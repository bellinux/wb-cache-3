40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{potential}} for disclosure recommendations given by authoritative supervisory bodies to reduce information asymmetry between the management and shareholders. Design/methodology/approach – There is only meagre existing evidence concerning firms' responses to disclosure recommendations. This paper uses descriptive statistics and OLS regression analysis to test if firms behave more similarly to voluntary or to mandatory disclosure when they follow the Committee of European Securities Regulators disclosure recommendation for International Financial Reporting Standards transition. Second, it analyses the determinants of and incentives for recommended transition disclosure. Findings – Recommended disclosure is documented to have more <b>mandatory</b> <b>characteristics</b> than purely voluntary disclosure. Moreover, the certain disclosure incentives for managers and corporate governance factors prove {{to have an impact}} on recommended disclosure. Firm size, growth prospects, and independent board members associate positively with recommended disclosure whereas there is a negative relationship between financial leverage and recommended disclosure. Research limitations/implications – The paper does not provide evidence on the cost differences between disclosure laws and authoritative disclosure recommendations. This could be examined by future research. Practical implications – Authoritative disclosure recommendations reduce information asymmetry. In some cases they may be a faster and more cost-efficient way to achieve disclosure enhancements than regulation. Originality/value – This paper is the first {{to explore the}} efficiency of authoritative disclosure recommendations in situations where urgent disclosure improvements are needed. The results have implications for regulatory bodies evaluating different strategies to reduce asymmetric information in these situations. Corporate governance, Disclosure, Regulation...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increase}} of heat flux densities generated by electronics, manufacturers are facing tremendous new challenges in which component heat flux might reach 100 W/cmÂ². This scenario is pushing the research efforts towards the development of alternative solutions, which {{will be able to}} ensure the needed cooling demands of high-integrated electronics. Furthermore, when considering the aeronautical applications, the reliability, compactness, and lightness of the cooling systems represent essential and <b>mandatory</b> <b>characteristics.</b> With the continuous miniaturization of the components, passive and active two-phase cooling devices can now be applied to electronics systems while maintaining the fundamental compactness and lightness of the whole system. This paper presents the experimental assessment of an electronic cooling prototype especially designed for helicopter avionics thermal management in the framework of 7 th FP EU project TOICA (Thermal Overall Integrated Conception of Aircraft, www. toica-fp 7. eu). The prototype consists of a set of compact Loop Heat Pipes (LHPs) especially designed for the hot spot treatment at blade level and an air cooled mini-Vapor Cycle System (mini-VCS), which is devoted to the overall heat rejection. One innovative concept of this system design lies {{in the presence of a}} thermal connector, named thermal plug, which acts as the evaporator of the mini-VCS, that cools down the LHP condenser. The experimental results are carried out at different hot spot heat loads, from 10 W to 50 W. The effect of different heat sink temperatures on the LHP thermal resistance is investigated. Furthermore, for a fixed evaporating temperature of the mini-VCS, the effects of vapor superheating at the outlet of the plug evaporator on the LHP thermal resistance is investigated. The proposed preliminary results allow to exploit the potentiality to use the proposed cooling technology in a typical airborne scenario...|$|E

40|$|High-quality {{narrative}} {{communication in}} corporate financial reports {{is important to}} make company reporting more useful to investors. However, standard-setters face a taxing challenge in deciding how these sections in corporate financial reports could be regulated most effectively. The objective of this dissertation is to examine risk and transition disclosures by Finnish listed firms in the IFRS era. It will address whether corporate risk and transition disclosures can be improved by releasing a detailed risk disclosure standard and authoritative disclosure recommendations. Also, the economic consequences of high-quality risk disclosures on stock markets will be examined. Finally, this research examines the non-regulatory determinants of risk and transition disclosures. This research uses positivist research methodology, which is the mainstream methodological avenue in financial accounting research. The main test methods are the standard mean test and the multivariate regression analysis. The sample firms in all essays consist of Finnish listed firms. The disclosure data were manually collected and coded. Data for the other variables were retrieved from the Thomson One Banker Financial, IBES, Worldscope and Datastream databases, or collected manually from the annual reports of the firms or from the register of Euroclear Finland Oy. This dissertation documents that a detailed national risk disclosure standard increases the quality of overall risk reviews in several dimensions. The results also demonstrate that risk disclosure quality associates negatively with information asymmetry. Additionally, {{it was found that}} the usefulness of risk disclosures to investors depends on firm riskiness, investor interest and market conditions. Regarding corporate transition disclosure, the results indicate that recommended disclosure has more <b>mandatory</b> <b>characteristics</b> than voluntary disclosure. Moreover, this dissertation documents several significant non-regulatory determinants of risk and transition disclosures such as firm size, profitability, financial leverage, growth prospects, listing on the NYSE, and board independence. The results benefit regulators, managers, investors, and analysts. This dissertation demonstrates for standard-setters such as the IASB, and the FASB, the SEC, and other national regulatory bodies that risk reporting under IFRS can be influenced through a detailed national disclosure standard. The findings suggest that a single legislative provision may not be effective enough to ensure transparent disclosure of abstract issues such as risks. Many managers may need detailed descriptions of the required disclosures with illustrative examples. We also demonstrate that managers react to the CESR (now ESMA) transition disclosure recommendation, which is actively promoted by the Finnish Financial Supervision Authority. Thus, in some cases (for example when urgent disclosure improvements are needed) authoritative disclosure recommendations may be a faster and more cost-efficient way to achieve disclosure improvements than laws or standard...|$|E
40|$|Library subject {{gateways}} (LSGs) are {{collections of}} databases {{and other information}} resources, arranged by subject, that have been assembled, reviewed and recommended by specialists, usually librarians. These library developed gateway collections support research and reference needs by identifying and pointing to recommended, academically-oriented web pages. Back at beginning of SGs libraries used to develop such tools by creating HTML coded web pages without using resource management software or any metadata description standards. These days, several open source software that support metadata description standards, data harvesting, web technology standards for SG creation and management have been developed providing the opportunity to every institution to create such a tool alone or in a cooperative with other institutions basis. On top of all such software does not demand any knowledge of HTML coding from the SG editors. THIRA was developed under PLOEGIS: from information to knowledge project (Operational Programme for Education and Initial Vocational Training ΙΙ - OPEIVT ΙΙ) After extensive bibliographic literature review on LSGs a list of <b>mandatory</b> <b>characteristics</b> was developed to define the core features of software the Library {{was looking for the}} creation and management of its SG. Based on the characteristics list the project team (both librarians and IT personnel) selected Scout Portal Toolkit because it was virtually turnkey, very inexpensive to maintain and operate, easy for non-technical staff to set up and populate with metadata, conformed to international standards for metadata, data harvesting and web technology. Scout PT comes with a Dublin Core Element Set and it took a few adjustments in order to support the metadata description of the resources held by the Library. Its Controlled Name Flag allows the usage of any thesaurus and its Classification Flag is open to any classification scheme. The project team selected the NDC’s bilingual List of Subject Headings for the subject description of the resources and the Australian Standard Classification of Education to create the Thematic Index. Regarding the technical aspect of the application, extensive additions to Scout’s source code were made {{in order to meet the}} requirements of the Library including changes to the database schema. The most fundamental issue was multi-language support (English and Greek) both in the application interface (menus, forms, etc) and in the bibliographical data (support for separate trees for each language). After adding multi-language capabilities to the application, the Library personnel proceeded to translating all forms, views and messages appearing in Scout in Greek. Furthermore, an alphabetic index of resources was added to the browsing options. Since this type of browsing was not provided in the original toolkit, the corresponding index was built from scratch. Finally, changes were also necessary in the metadata fields used in advanced search forms in order to provide the users with additional search options when looking for resources. The initial testing of the application included 311 databases held by the library at that moment. The conclusions drawn of this face highlighted some necessary improvements. These improvements mainly concerned the browsing capabilities offered to users which were initially limited to either resource type or resource thematic description, i. e it was not possible to view resources of a specific type (e. g. databases or electronic journals) for a given topic. In this direction, links were initially added to allow viewing only databases and more elaborate filtering capabilities were subsequently implemented...|$|E

Method development involved optimization of different RP columns, aqueous mobile phases, pH, phosphate concentration, and temperature. The optimum separation of these compounds was achieved using a Luna CN column (30 degrees C), 5 mmol L(- 1) sodium phosphate (pH 5. 0) as mobile phase, 1 mL min(- 1) flow-rate, UV absorbance-DAD detection at 220 nm, and resorcine as internal standard; this enabled separation of these compounds with baseline resolution (values in the 2. 1 - 10. 1 range) in about 8 min. Prior to HPLC, the developed sample preparation procedure consisted in a leaching process using the above mentioned mobile phase. Method validation {{was carried out in}} rice protein concentrates in accordance with the European Commission decision 2002 / 657 /EC criteria. For this purpose, eight <b>mandatory</b> performance <b>characteristics</b> for the conventional validation approach were determined: calibration graphs, extraction efficiencies, decision limits, detection capabilities, precision (repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility), accuracy, selectivity, and robustness. The extraction efficiencies for these compounds were in the range 99 - 100 % and the within-laboratory reproducibility at 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 detection capabilities concentration levels were smaller than 5, 4, and 3 %, respectively.

40|$|Peremptory {{rules in}} {{international}} business transactions The topic of this diploma thesis covers {{the issue of}} peremptory or rather overriding mandatory rules in international business transactions. Overriding mandatory rules are rules which shall apply despite the choice of law made by the parties of the contract. These rules, which are usually of a public nature, serve to implement some crucial public interests and may have important impacts on business relationships. The objective of this thesis is to, firstly, characterize overriding mandatory rules and secondly, to analyze the system of regulation of foreign trade with certain specific kinds of goods, where these rules are typically to be found. This thesis is divided into 12 chapters and also includes a general introduction and a final conclusion. The first chapters aim to provide a complex definition of overriding mandatory rules including one on what distinguishes these rules from public policy. The process of application of these rules based on their origin is examined in detail. The closest attention {{is given to the}} process of applying these rules when {{they are part of the}} law of a third country. The following chapters then focus on an area of law of which the use of overriding <b>mandatory</b> rules is <b>characteristic.,</b> i. e. the regulation of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Soluble glucose {{dehydrogenase}} is a homodimeric enzyme {{found in}} various bacteria such as Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, requiring Ca 2 + and pyrroloquinolinequinone (PQQ) cofactors for full enzymatic activity. sGDH catalyses the oxidation of glucose and other aldose sugars. The mechanistic details {{have yet to}} be disclosed. Towards that goal, a specific series of 3 isomeric analogs (2 - 4) of PQQ are being synthesized from methoxyaniline derivatives in the laboratory. The synthesis includes the reaction of a diazonium salt with ethyl- 2 -methyacetoacetate to yield the corresponding hydrazones of ethyl pyruvate. Each hydrazone underwent acid catalyzed Fischer indole synthesis followed by reduction of the nitro group using H 2 /Pd/C in to the corresponding aminoindole. Michael addition with dimethyl trans 2 -ketoglutaconate was performed to form the third pyridine ring, which was further oxidized into triesters. Hydrolysis of the oxidation product yields the 3 isomeric analogs of PQQ. These isomers differ in the positioning of the nitrogen atom on the ring system and will serve to define structural significance in terms of binding with a metal cation and reconstitution process with the apoprotein. Detailed analysis of the stability of each reconstituted enzyme as well as steady-state kinetics studies will shed light on the structural <b>characteristics</b> <b>mandatory</b> for enzymatic activity and active site characterization...|$|R

Having a high vapor pressure, this white crystalline solid of less toxicity in comparision to generally used boron precursors can easily be transferred into the gas phase by moderate heating. Together with argon as working gas the BH sub 3 NH sub 3 -vapor is led into a two-circuit plasma source utilizing the electron cyclotron wave resonance technique (ECWR) for ionization and dissoziation of the gas mixture by electron impact in the low pressure range (propor to 10 mbar).

By these investigations it was shown that stationary plasma conditions are established in a temperature range of 120 - 160 C. This behavior can be explained by a change in the chemical composition of the reactant during the evaporation process...|$|R

In order {{to simulate the}} internal structure correctly, {{the integration of the}} tunnel diode into the network simulation was <b>mandatory.</b> The tunnel-diode <b>characteristics</b> are modeled by LTSpice's arbitrary behavioral current sources. The integration of tunnel-diode characteristics into the network model was validated by comparison of simulated and experimental data. Lattice-matched triple-junction solar cells were examined under homogenous illumination between 1 and 1900 suns as well as under non-uniform digital irradiance. The verified model was then used to study the influence of lateral current spreading in layers surrounding the tunnel diodes. It is shown that a lateral current spreading from high to low illumination intensity regions cannot prevent the tunnel diode from switching to thermal diffusion under the used Gaussian illumination profile as it appears in concentrator photovoltaic applications. Furthermore, resistance regimes of the lateral conducting layers were identified, which would enable a current spreading that is high enough to transport all current exclusively by tunneling. It is shown that the presence of at least one additional layer above and one below the tunnel diode is mandatory. Finally, the necessary layer thicknesses using Alx- 1 GaxAs as lateral conducting layers are calculated for different doping concentrations and mole fraction...|$|R
40|$|To protect {{pipelines}} in Arctic regions {{they are}} often buried in trenches, effectively preventing damage by ice gouging. When trenching is performed in Arctic soil, subsea permafrost may be encountered at water depths up to 100 m, mainlywhile excavating clay soil. Frozen clay is an anisotropic inhomogeneous material with a tensile strength and behavior comparable to soft rock. Previous observations of cutting experiments on submerged frozen clay indicated that the dominant failure mechanism is tensile brittle. With an increasing thickness of the layer cut, the increase of cutting forces seems {{to be less than}} proportional. An explanation for this trend is the size effect, which describes the probabilistic weakening of the material when the thickness of the layer cut increases. An optimal thickness of the layer cut could result in lower specific energy consumption, however this may lead to higher cutting forces. In order to excel in the design and construction of efficient subsea excavation equipment (e. g. subsea trenchers) thorough knowledge of physical characteristics of permafrost is <b>mandatory.</b> These <b>characteristics</b> include the failure mechanisms, the required cutting forces and power consumption. Due to the brittle behavior of the frozen clay the use of a vibration-impact mechanism has been investigated. A literature reviewidentified that the knowledge on vibration-impact cutting in permafrost is very limited. Therefore Royal IHC and Delft University of Technology joined forces to fill this knowledge gap. The main goal of this research is to identify the governing parameters in (vibration-impact) cutting of frozen clay. Knowledge of the effect of vibration-impact cutting leads to the ability to calculate cutting forces in similar conditions and to determine the parameters required for designing effective subsea excavation equipment. In this study a prediction model of the vibration-impact cutting tool and soil is developed. A specialized large scale vibration-impact cutting setup was designed and constructed. The cutting experiments were performed on stiff clay having similar properties of the soils found in the Arctic. The results from the experiments were used to validate the prediction model. A relationship between drawbar force reduction, velocity ratio and force ratio has been found and is elaborated to design parameters.

First, with more data available for the post-adoption period, prior studies are extended by measuring if the mandatory adoption of IFRS in 2005 reduces the cost of equity. Second, using a comprehensive set of reporting incentives by both firm-specific core business factors (CBF) and internal corporate governance (ICG), and country-specific institutional environment factors (IEF), this study further investigates if both individual and interactive effects of reporting incentives in mandatory IFRS adoption are associated with cost of equity effects. Using a sample of 7, 294 firm-year observations in the EU between 2000 and 2009, the findings show that, on average, mandatory adopters have a significantly lower cost of equity of 1. 2 % (significant at the 1 % level using a two-tailed test). Also, the results provide evidence that mandatory IFRS adoption interacts with both firm-specific CBF and ICG and associates with significant differential effects {{in the cost of}} equity. In addition, when sampling firms are partitioned into different comprehensive legal, economic, social and cultural <b>characteristics,</b> <b>mandatory</b> adopting firms interact with CBF and/or ICG based on their particular IEF settings. Overall, these findings support the pro-incentive view that significant capital market benefits to shareholders cannot be derived by only adopting a single set of high quality accounting standards, unless firms have a high level of reporting incentives...|$|R

Having a high vapor pressure, this white crystalline solid of less toxicity in comparision to generally used boron precursors can easily be transferred into the gas phase by moderate heating. Together with argon as working gas the BH 3 NH 3 -vapor is led into a two-circuit plasma source utilizing the electron cyclotron wave resonance technique (ECWR) for ionization and dissoziation of the gas mixture by electron impact in the low pressure range (~ 10 microbar). For a precise adjustment of the energy of the ionic plasma species arriving at the growing film, an r. f. -diode circuit is superimposed to the discharge. Since for a controlled film deposition by PACVD a stationary plasma composition is <b>mandatory,</b> the evaporation <b>characteristics</b> of the reactant source was determined primarily. Therefore the evolution of the plasma and the vapor composition in dependence of evaporation time and temperature was investigated by optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and by mass spectrometric measurements respectively. By these investigations it was shown that stationary plasma conditions are established in a temperature range of 120 - 160 °C. This behavior can be explained by a change in the chemical composition of the reactant during the evaporation process. In the following thin boron nitride films were deposited onto Si(100) -substrates for fixed partial pressures of BH 3 NH 3 (2, 9 mbar) and argon (9, 3 microbar, FAr= 5 sccm). For all experiments the plasma power as well as the substrate temperature was kept at 200 W (B 0 = 34 G) and 380 °C, respectively. By a defined tuning of the r. f. -amplitude in the diode circuit it was demonstrated that the energy of the ionic species arriving at the growing film is an essential process parameter for c-BN growth. For these experiments c-BN growth took place in a small energy window with a width of about 25 eV. The maximum c-BN content was achieved at 107 eV. The fraction of h-BN and c-BN phases were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). At a film thickness of 61 nm the volume fraction of c-BN, derived from the IR-absorption peak areas of h-BN at 1385 cm - 1 and c-BN at 1081 cm - 1, already achieved 68 vol%. This is due to an early starting point of c-BN growth, which was confirmed by cross sectional high resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements (HRTEM). Furthermore these investigations confirmed the growth of a thin amorphous BN-layer followed by a (0002) -textured h-BN-film primarily to the c-BN-nucleation step as commonly observed in literature. After the c-BN-nucleation step has finished the growth of a nearly pure c-BN-phase is achieved. This was emphasized by auger electron spectroscopy. By means of secondary ion mass spectrometry in the MCs + -mode (MCs + -SIMS) it was shown that the c-BN-films contain a certain amount of hydrogen, which can be estimated to be around 10 - 15 at%. Since in FTIR no perceptible amount on B-H- or N-H-bindings in the c-BN- films could be detected, it must be concluded that the hydrogen is located as H 2 -molecules in the c-BN-network. Finally the elastic properties of a c-BN-film were estimated by calculations, based on Brillouin light scattering (BLS) results...|$|R
