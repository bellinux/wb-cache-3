An analysis of seismic records {{was the only way to}} determine reliable origin times. We were able to identify the two strongest explosions directly from the seismic records. Detailed time-frequency analy-sis enabled us to identify acoustic waves caused by the explosions. This led to the subsequent identification of two weaker explosions in seismic records and an indica-tion of two even weaker explosions that could not be identified in the records.

40|$|Natural {{hazards and}} {{disasters}} can cause major accidents in chemical facilities {{where they can}} lead to the release of hazardous materials which in turn may result in fires, explosions or toxic dispersions. An analysis of industrial accident databases showed that lightning strikes are the most frequent cause of major accidents triggered by natural events. As a starting point {{for the development of a}} quantitative approach to the problem, lightning-triggered accident case histories were retrieved from some of the <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>accident</b> databases to extract information on types of vulnerable equipment, failure dynamics and damage states, as well as on the final consequences of the event. The most vulnerable category of process equipment resulted by far storage tanks. Lightning damage is incurred by immediate ignition, electrical and electronic systems failure or structural damage with subsequent release. Oil, diesel and gasoline are the substances most frequently released during lightning-triggered Natech accidents. Toxic releases and tank fires are the most frequent final scenario associated to such events. JRC. G. 7 -Digital Citizen Securit...|$|E

30|$|In early 2013, however, a <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>accident</b> {{occurred}} in a coal mine in S Province, which led to forced suspension of production in all coal mines in S Province for 5  months. In addition, the S Provincial Government decided to accelerate the rectification of coal mines and released the “Emergency Circular of General Office of the S Provincial Government regarding the Acceleration of Rectification and Shutdown of Coal Mines.” 14 This statement required each county and municipality to select the major local party-state officials to form their own work teams to efficiently carry out the rectification. Before May 2013, the S Provincial Government had set the task of shutting down 120 coal mines in S Province, of which 16 coal mines were in Y Municipality and 4 coal mines in L County. However, the accident in May pushed this number up to 400 coal mines, 15 dramatically increasing the tasks of Y Municipality and L County. As a result, “management by objectives” (mubiao guanli zerenzhi) was adopted at the provincial, municipal, and county levels to rectify coal mines; in this process, the guiding principle shifted from market mechanism to state administration, and an economic task became a political task.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify high-risk groups for industrial accidents by setting up 2003 as the base year and conducting an in-depth analysis of the trends of <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>accident</b> indexes the index of industrial accident rate, the index of occupational injury rate, the index of occupational illness and disease rate per 10, 000 people, and the index of occupational injury fatality rate per 10, 000 people for the past 10 years. Methods: This study selected industrial accident victims, who died or received more than 4 days of medical care benefits, due to occupational accidents and diseases occurring at workplaces, subject to the Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act, as the study population. Results: According to the trends of four major indexes by workplace characteristics, the whole industry has shown a decreasing tendency in all four major indexes since the base year (2003); as of 2012, the index of industrial accident rate was 67, while the index of occupational injury fatality rate per 10, 000 people was 59. Conclusion: The manufacturing industry, age over 50 years and workplaces with more than 50 employees showed a high severity level of occupational accidents. Male workers showed a higher severity level of occupational accidents than female workers. The employment period of < 3 years and newly hired workers with a relatively shorter working period are likely to have more occupational accidents than others.

40|$|The {{so called}} {{cascading}} events, {{which lead to}} high-impact low-frequency scenarios are rising concern worldwide. A chain of events result in a <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>accident</b> with dreadful (and often unpredicted) consequences. Cascading events can {{be the result of}} the realization of an external threat, like a terrorist attack a natural disaster or of “domino effect”. During domino events the escalation of a primary accident is driven by the propagation of the primary event to nearby units, causing an overall increment of the accident severity and an increment of the risk associated to an industrial installation. Also natural disasters, like intense flooding, hurricanes, earthquake and lightning are found capable to enhance the risk of an industrial area, triggering loss of containment of hazardous materials and in major accidents. The scientific community usually refers to those accidents as “NaTechs”: natural events triggering industrial accidents. In this document, a state of the art of available approaches to the modelling, assessment, prevention and management of domino and NaTech events is described. On the other hand, the relevant work carried out during past studies still needs to be consolidated and completed, in order to be applicable in a real industrial framework. New methodologies, developed during my research activity, aimed at the quantitative assessment of domino and NaTech accidents are presented. The tools and methods provided within this very study had the aim to assist the progress toward a consolidated and universal methodology for the assessment and prevention of cascading events, contributing to enhance safety and sustainability of the chemical and process industry. ...|$|E

Besides the new concepts which {{lead us to}} question older concepts (risk, hazard and vulnerability), we propose to think about more practical aspects, for example the modelling of human behaviour and the confrontation in crisis situations. The link between concepts as: critical self-organization, emergence, bifurcation, and the methods in the Distributed Artificial Intelligence used to model them is however difficult. In this paper, we present ongoing analysis on the key concepts of risk science, such as the hazards and the catastrophes. We propose to enrich them with complex systems theories. First, we present methodological perspectives of the DAI, for example multi-agent systems, and compare them with other simulation methods used {{in the context of}} the risks. Secondly, we present the MOSAIIC model (Modelling and Simulation of Industrial Accidents by Individual-Based methods) which gives possibilities to simulate the behaviour of individuals during an industrial accident. The project and the MOSAIIC model aim to explore the effects of a <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>accident</b> on public health. For instance, the emission and the spread of a toxic gas in an urban environment may be a serious danger for the human health. Thus we propose to study the consequences of this type of event in order to reduce the vulnerability of the populations. In the model, we emphasize both on spatial and behavioral dimensions (ie. mobility and perception of risk) All these questions lead us to use different methodologies of analysis. For example, concerning mobility, the daily traffic can be simulated at a meso scale: a road axis for example. In that way, we aim to simulate the global dynamics of the network from the modelling of flows on arcs of the network (modulated according to the time of day and the day of week). Yet, we use classical models (for instance equilibrium models) because they give an ”average image” of the flows of vehicles on the arcs. Based on this first structural mobility, it is then possible to consider ”a change of level” regarding both the representation and the analysis: if a risk occurs or if a specific context disrupts the structure.

40|$|The {{welfare of}} society has {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} last few decades throughout the world due to advances in many sectors such as technology, health, communication, etc. But at the same time, this has also increased our dependency towards the correct functioning of these Critical Infrastructures (CIs). Therefore, a proper functioning and a high service reliability level of CIs are vital for the society’s welfare. In light of this situation, it is paramount to improve the resilience level of the CIs in order to prevent crises occurrence and absorb the impact when they occur. Resilience is defined as a capacity of a system to prevent a crisis occurrence, and in case it occurs, the capacity to absorb the magnitude of the impact and recover efficiently to the normal situation. Literature presents several definitions and perspectives regarding the resilience concept. However, it lacks to provide a detailed prescription about how crisis managers can improve their CI’s resilience level holistically. This research presents a framework that would help crisis managers to improve the resilience level of CIs. This framework provides a list of policies and sub-policies that crisis managers should implement in their CIs to enhance the resilience level. These policies have beendefined holistically taking into account internal and external stakeholders taking part in a <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>accident</b> as well as covering the four dimensions of resilience already defined in the literature. Furthermore, the influence of each resilience policy on the three resilience lifecycle stages has been determined. The main conclusion obtained from this analysis is that internal policies are the ones which most influence during the prevention stage whereas both internal and external policies assist on the absorption and recovery stages. An implementation methodology has also been defined in order to efficiently implement this framework in practice. It is difficult to implement all the policies at the same time. Furthermore, some policies require others prior implementation to achieve higher efficiency in their implementation. Therefore, this implementation methodology provides the temporal order in which the policies and sub-policies should be implemented in order to achieve a high resilience level. In order to carry out this research different kinds of research methods have been employed. Some methods aim to gather experts’ knowledge through workshops and questionnaires such as Group Model Building, Delphi, and Survey methods. Others, on the other hand, are based on analysis of past major industrial accidents or real cases such as case studies in CIs. From this variety of methods valuable and complementary information was gathered in order to develop and validate the resilience framework for CIs...|$|E
