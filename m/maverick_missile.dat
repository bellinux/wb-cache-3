25|$|The first AGM-65E laser <b>Maverick</b> <b>missile</b> {{was fired}} at Eglin AFB on 3 June 1980 from a Marine Corps Douglas A-4M Skyhawk. The missile was the laser-guided {{version of the}} USAF’s {{air-to-ground}} Maverick with a heavier warhead. It was being developed by Hughes Aircraft Company {{for use by the}} Marine Corps in close-air support of combat troops.|$|E
25|$|The TA-50 version mounts a three-barrel cannon {{version of}} the M61 Vulcan {{internally}} behind the cockpit, which fires linkless 20mm ammunition. Wingtip rails can accommodate the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, {{and a variety of}} additional weapons can be mounted to underwing hardpoints. Compatible air-to-surface weapons include the AGM-65 <b>Maverick</b> <b>missile,</b> Hydra 70 and LOGIR rocket launchers, CBU-58 and Mk-20 cluster bombs, and Mk-82, −83, and −84 general purpose bombs.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the Harrier GR7 {{played a}} {{prominent}} role during Operation Telic, the UK contribution to the U.S.-led Iraq War. When war broke out, Harriers flew reconnaissance and strike missions inside Southern Iraq, reportedly to destroy Scud missile launchers to prevent their use against neighbouring Kuwait. Prior to the war, the Harriers had been equipped with a new armament, the AGM-65 <b>Maverick</b> <b>missile,</b> which reportedly was a noticeable contribution to the Harrier's operations over Iraq; a total of 38 Mavericks were launched during the campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Brimstone has a Tandem Shaped Charge (TSC) warhead {{that employs}} a smaller initial charge, {{designed}} to initiate reactive armour, {{followed by a}} larger, more destructive charge, designed to penetrate and defeat the base armour. It {{has been estimated that}} Brimstone will be 3 times more effective than the AGM-65G <b>Maverick</b> <b>missile</b> against modern tanks, and 7 times more effective than the BL755 cluster bomb. In combat Brimstone has demonstrated accuracy and reliability [...] "both well above 90 percent" [...] according to the MoD; Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton has said that 98.3% to 98.7% of Brimstone fired in Libya [...] "did exactly what we expected".|$|E
2500|$|The {{test was}} {{conducted}} by the U.S. Air Force’s 46th Test Wing, 40th Flight Test Squadron at Eglin. The Sniper ATP was mounted on an A-10C Precision Engagement aircraft adjacent to the <b>Maverick</b> <b>missile</b> mounted on the LAU-88 missile rail. In this configuration, Sniper ATP is approximately [...] from the missile body. Test pilots from the 40th Test Squadron, and the 422nd Test Squadron at Nellis AFB, Nevada, {{reported that they were}} impressed with the ATP’s performance during the developmental and operational flight tests of the A-10C.
