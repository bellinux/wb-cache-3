5|$|The protagonist {{and player}} {{character}} of Shuffle! is Rin Tsuchimi, a normal seventeen-year-old second-year {{high school student}} and the male protagonist to the series. Since a young age, he has placed the well-being of others before his own and dislikes seeing people in sorrow. Since he lost his parents in his childhood, he has been living with Kaede Fuyou, a life envied by many of his classmates. One of the heroines of Shuffle!, Kaede believes it her duty {{in life is to}} take care of Rin, which she takes upon herself in order to atone for her treatment of him in the past and bears a one-sided love towards Rin. Kaede appears again as the heroine in Really? Really!, a sequel to Shuffle!, that continues from Kaede's ending in Shuffle!. In middle school, the two meet and later befriend Asa Shigure, another heroine of Shuffle! who is in her third-year of high school. While she has a weak constitution, she <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> it with her energetic tomboy personality and is an excellent cook. She has a habit of slapping Rin on his back.|$|E

25|$|IR earns about 70% of its {{revenues}} from freight traffic (₹686.2 billion from freight and ₹304.6 billion from passengers in 2011–12). Most of its profits come from transporting freight, and this <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> losses on passenger traffic. It deliberately keeps its passenger fares low and cross-subsidises the loss-making passenger traffic with the profit-making freight traffic.|$|E

He relates how Erik outwitted all foes with clever tricks {{and became the}} {{counselor}} of Fróði son of Fridleif, king of Denmark. Erik's expeditions on Fróði's behalf always went well because of Erik's cunning and way with words. Erik finally married Fróði's sister Gunvara and Erik's elder half-brother Rollerus (Roller) was made king of Norway.|$|E

25|$|The five-domed St. Mary's Ukrainian Catholic Church in Lourdes was {{designed}} by Myroslav Nimciv, while its Byzantine interior polychrome decorations were executed by artist Jerzy Nowosielski. The church is about a 10-minute walk from the basilica and the grotto, on a street named in honour of Ukraine, 8 Rue de l'Ukraine, situated on a narrow piece of property close to the railroad station. Visible from the basilica, {{the height of the}} building <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> its breadth.|$|E
25|$|In all the studied cases, carnivory allows {{plants to}} grow and {{reproduce}} using animals {{as a source of}} nitrogen, phosphorus and possibly potassium. However, there is a spectrum of dependency on animal prey. Pygmy sundews are unable to use nitrate from soil because they lack the necessary enzymes (nitrate reductase in particular). Common butterworts (Pinguicula vulgaris) can use inorganic sources of nitrogen better than organic sources, but a mixture of both is preferred. European bladderworts seem to use both sources equally well. Animal prey <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> differing deficiencies in soil nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Of {{particular}} {{significance is}} the plenary indulgence {{attached to the}} Apostolic Blessing that a priest is to impart when giving the sacraments to a person in danger of death, and which, if no priest is available, the Church grants to any rightly disposed Christian {{at the moment of}} death, on condition that that person was accustomed to say some prayers during life. In this case the Church itself <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the three conditions normally required for a plenary indulgence: sacramental confession, Eucharistic communion and prayer for the Pope's intentions.|$|E

25|$|Some {{textbooks}} mistakenly {{state that}} {{the speed of sound}} increases with increasing density. This is usually illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, which also have vastly different levels compressibilities which more than make up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is that sound travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. The reason is that the larger density of water, which works to slow sound in water relative to air, nearly <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the compressibility differences in the two media.|$|E
25|$|According to Jewish teachings, hell is {{not entirely}} physical; rather, it can be {{compared}} to a very intense feeling of shame. People are ashamed of their misdeeds and this constitutes suffering which <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the bad deeds. When one has so deviated from the will of God, one is said to be in Gehinnom. This is not meant to refer to some point in the future, but to the very present moment. The gates of teshuva (return) are said to be always open, and so one can align his will with that of God at any moment. Being out of alignment with God's will is itself a punishment according to the Torah.|$|E
25|$|The {{consuming}} east region, {{particularly the}} states in the northern part, heavily rely on stored gas to meet the peak demand during the cold winter months. Due to the prevailing cold winters, large population centers and developed infrastructure, {{it is not surprising that}} this region has the highest level of working gas storage capacity of the other regions and the largest number of storage sites, mainly in depleted reservoirs. In addition to underground storage, LNG is increasingly playing a crucial role in providing supplemental backup and/or peaking supply to LDCs on a short term basis. Although the total capacity for these LNG facilities does not match those of underground storage in scale, the short term high deliverability <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> that.|$|E

25|$|The {{region has}} a dense network of road and motorways, {{a system of}} {{maritime}} connections and an airport (Naples Airport), which connect it rapidly {{to the rest of}} the Country. Campania has a series of historical problems and internal contrasts, although they are improving. The regional capital, Naples, one of the most populated and interesting cities in Italy, rich in history and natural beauty, both artistic and archaeological, still represents the centre of regional life. The port connects the region with the whole Mediterranean basin, and brings tourists to the archaeological sites, the cities of art (Naples and Caserta), to the beautiful coastal areas and to the islands. The services sector <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> 78% of the region's gross domestic product.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} a game of Australian Football can vary from league to league, but is {{generally}} around 15 to 25 minutes per quarter. In the AFL, each quarter runs for 20 minutes plus time on – which <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> time occupied in stoppages, such as when the ball goes out of bounds, injuries, goals (or behinds) being kicked, or when the umpire is setting the angle of a free kick on goal. A typical AFL quarter might run from 27 to 33 minutes, but may be even longer if, for instance, injuries cause delays. AFL breaks after {{the first and third}} quarters are six minutes, with a 20-minute break at halftime. Thus, a match with quarters averaging 30 minutes would last {{about two and a half}} hours.|$|E
25|$|Zheng's game is characterised by consistency, intellect, quick {{reflexes}} {{and fighting}} spirit. She {{is not the}} strongest player, but <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> this with her careful thinking of where to place her shots and willingness to change game plans if a strategy is not working. Her shots are {{of a lot of}} pace and very well placed, making Zheng an excellent defensive counterpuncher. She has one of the best footwork and court coverage on the tour, which allows her to keep shots in play that would normally be winners; so few shots get by her that after the final match of 2005 Hobart International, the finalist Gisela Dulko described her game as 'The Great Wall of China' because 'she didn't miss one ball'. Also an accomplished doubles player, she is very comfortable when playing at the net. Zheng's best shot is her backhand. Zheng's main weakness is her serve; however she is sometimes able to neutralize her weak serve with her quickness or by serving to the body or to the opponent's weaker groundstroke.|$|E
