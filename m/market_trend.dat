The album was number 1 for six weeks in total; it remained in the top twenty until the start of July, before leaving the top-200 listings in mid December.|$|E

25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black <b>market</b> <b>trend</b> often referred to as transplant tourism. The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E

2500|$|Abdullah's {{expenditures}} {{were paid}} directly from Acre's treasury. In {{order to make}} up for declining revenues, Abdullah reversed the free <b>market</b> <b>trend</b> set under Sulayman Pasha by extending Acre's monopoly on Syria's cotton exports to imports coming into Acre as well. These policies resulted in Acre being bypassed by merchants and traders, with cotton from Nablus being shipped to Beirut instead. The French consul also relocated to Beirut, which was prospering at Acre's expense. In a report, the French consul wrote that Abdullah [...] "governs as if politics advised him to surround himself with ruins, to the point that all the country under his control presents a picture of isolation and poverty." [...] According to Philipp, [...] "only the instability of politics in Damascus ... and the preoccupation of the Ottomans with internal reforms and the Greek war disguised the weakness of Abdallah Pasha's regime".|$|E
2500|$|The Home Depot's lack {{of success}} in China has been {{attributed}} to the disconnect between The Home Depot's do-it-yourself ethos and Chinese culture. In 2012, the Home Depot conceded that it misread the country's appetite for do-it-yourself products. As a spokeswoman for the company {{said in an interview with}} the Wall Street Journal, [...] "The <b>market</b> <b>trend</b> says this is more of a do-it-for-me culture". Culturally, manual labor is seen as an activity for lower-class citizens, and some have speculated that The Home Depot could have capitalized on this by offering a do-it-for-me model to Chinese consumers. Chinese consumers prefer to see a finished product, such as a renovated room, rather than light bulbs and lumber. The same issue does not exist outside of China, especially in Canada, where Chinese Home Depot advertisements and store signage can be found in areas with large Chinese demographics.|$|E

2500|$|During a {{moose test}} (swerving {{to avoid an}} obstacle), which became famous in Germany as [...] "the elk test", the Swedish {{journalist}} Robert Collin of Teknikens Värld (World of Technology) in October 1997 rolled a Mercedes A-Class (without ESC) at 78km/h. Because Mercedes-Benz promotes a reputation for safety, they recalled and retrofitted 130,000 A-Class cars with ESC. This produced {{a significant reduction in}} crashes and the number of vehicles with ESC rose. Today, virtually all premium brands have made ESC standard on all vehicles, and the number of models with ESC continues to increase. The availability of ESC in small cars like the A-Class ignited a <b>market</b> <b>trend</b> thus ESC became available for all models at least as an option. Consequently, the European Union decided in 2009 to make ESC mandatory. [...] Since November 1, 2011, EU Type Approval is only granted to models equipped with ESC. By November 1, 2014, ESC is required on all newly registered cars in the EU.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{research}} in INIFAP (National Institute for Agricultural, Livestock and Forestry Research of Mexico) has been traditionally oriented to increase yields. Under this approach research objectives have been directed to obtain more kilograms of grains per hectare, more milk liters per cow, more meat per animal, etc. As {{national and international}} agricultural context has been changed, new approaches have been included and topics like environment and <b>market</b> <b>trends</b> are now incorporated to INIFAP's research activity. The market approach has been {{taken into account in}} an implicit way in some research projects of INIFAP. However, it is necessary {{to pay more attention to}} this topic because as it is known, consumers orient type and characteristics of goods to be produced. In this paper current situation and <b>market</b> <b>trends</b> of four important agricultural products in the Comarca Lagunera region are presented: cantaloupe, cotton, pecans and forages. In each case, after <b>market</b> <b>trends</b> and situation analysis, research approaches and topics are recommended to be followed by researchers of INIFAP Laguna. A common point in each case is that agricultural production should be profitable, increase farmer's income and standard of life, and at the same time be environmentally friendly.
