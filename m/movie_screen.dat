5|$|The serial expands on Austen's metaphorical use of landscapes, {{reinforcing}} {{beauty and}} authenticity. Elizabeth takes {{every opportunity to}} enjoy nature and to escape exposure to Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine. The most symbolic use of nature in the novel is Elizabeth and the Gardiners' visit to Pemberley in Derbyshire, where Elizabeth becomes conscious of her love for Darcy. The story makes nature integral {{in the form of}} Old England. Elizabeth's appreciation of the beauties of Derbyshire elevates Darcy in her and her relatives' opinion. Darcy's gaze through the window works as a <b>movie</b> <b>screen,</b> projecting Elizabeth's actions for him and the viewer. His participation in the English landscape is his redemption.|$|E

25|$|Videotape {{technology}} {{was still in}} its infancy when Australian television was launched in 1956 and video recorders did not become widely available to Australian TV stations until the 1960s. For the first few years, the only available method for capturing TV programs was the kinescope process, in which a fixed movie camera filmed broadcasts screened on a specially adjusted TV monitor. Similarly, the playback of pre-recorded programs to air was only possible at this stage through the telecine process, in which films or kinescoped TV recordings were played back on a <b>movie</b> <b>screen</b> which was monitored by a TV camera.|$|E

25|$|The Medical Detachment {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in operations known as Medical Civil Action Programs (MEDCAPS), conducted every day in provincial villages. By 1969, MEDCAPS were incorporated into Integrated Civil Action Programs (ICAPS), which were conducted by medical and other teams that would deploy overnight to a village and treat anyone who requested assistance. A <b>movie</b> <b>screen</b> would be erected nearby {{and those in the}} queue for treatment, and other villagers, would watch the films that were chosen to promote the South Vietnamese government {{at the expense of the}} Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces. Dental Civil Action Programs (DENTCAPS) were also carried out by 1 ATF units other than 1 ACAU. The 1 ACAU Medical Detachment co-ordinated all MEDCAPS and DENTCAPS conducted by 1 ATF units.

25|$|Disney and his {{remaining}} staff continued {{the production of}} the Mickey series, {{and he was able to}} eventually find a number of animators to replace Iwerks. As the Great Depression progressed and Felix the Cat faded from the <b>movie</b> <b>screen,</b> Mickey's popularity would rise, and by 1932 The Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members. At the 5th Academy Awards in 1932, Mickey received his first Academy Award nomination, received for Mickey's Orphans (1931). Walt Disney also received an honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse. Despite being eclipsed by the Silly Symphonies short the Three Little Pigs in 1933, Mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too, until 1935, when polls showed that Popeye was more popular than Mickey. By 1934, Mickey merchandise had earned $600,000.00 a year. In 1935, Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse Clubs, due to administration problems.|$|E

500|$|Approximately 75 ethnic, {{social, and}} {{religious}} Chicago organizations {{were asked to}} provide candidates whose faces would be photographed for integration into the fountain. The subjects were chosen from local schools, churches and community groups, and filming began in 2001 at the downtown campus of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). The SAIC students filmed their subjects with a $100,000 high-definition HDW-F900 video camera, the same model used in the production of the three Star Wars prequels. About 20 SAIC students took part in what became an informal master's course in public art for the project. Faculty from Columbia College Chicago was also involved in the production of the video. The high-definition equipment was used because of the scale of the project. [...] Because the image proportions were like a <b>movie</b> <b>screen</b> with a width far exceeding its height, the camera was turned on its side during filming.|$|E

However, twenty-four hours before impact, the flight team at JPL began privately expressing a high level of confidence that, barring any unforeseen technical glitches, the spacecraft would intercept Tempel 1. One senior personnel member stated [...] "All we can do now is sit back and wait. Everything we can technically do to ensure impact has been done."

After this brief demonstration, John and Sarah arrive and disrupt the proceedings. However, they are confronted by a T-1000 Terminator from the future (its appearance as the helicopter pilot), whom they engage with automatic-weapons. Kimberley Duncan is killed by the T-1000 while attempting to stop it. A second Terminator, portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, bursts through the <b>movie</b> <b>screen</b> through a [...] "time portal" [...] on his signature Harley-Davidson motorcycle – via actual actor/stunt double riding into auditorium – to rescue John. He takes John back through the portal and into the future war between humans and machines, with the T-1000 in pursuit. After defeating it, John and the Terminator make their way across the war ravaged landscape as they head towards Skynet. Along the way, they are chased by a Flying Hunter-Killer, four Mini-Hunters, and a Terminator endoskeleton.|$|E
