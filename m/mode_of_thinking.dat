5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E
25|$|If the {{challenge}} of contemporary equipment {{is to develop a}} <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> as ethical practice, it also involves the design or redesign of venues within which such formation is possible. Rabinow deals directly with the problem of venues in the work Synthetic Anthropos (with Gaymon Bennett) (2009). In that work Rabinow and Bennett argue that the question of where and how the composition of equipment takes place is itself a primary problem site.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{understanding}} {{is a term}} used commonly in education to define a <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> described as, ‘an essential tool for participating in democratic processes, at whatever level.’ It is a defensible position reached through the examination of ideas, issues or sources. It is achieved through reflecting upon, analysing and evaluating different ideas and positions, and is demonstrated through an ability to express informed responses and independent thought. Critical understanding develops through analytical and independent thought and is considered an increasingly important element of the education process as students progress to higher and further education. However {{it is not an}} easy concept to communicate for it is not a passive thing we do; it is about active engagement.|$|E

Using a framework <b>of</b> five <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> based on Jungian psychology, we {{answer this question}} by reviewing the classical writings of Sun Tzu and Clausewitz, and conclude that understanding of people and lateral thinking {{are the most important}} <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> associated with C 2. This leads to a number of suggestions for the design of C 2 Information Systems, particularly that they should provide increased emphasis on communications, group-working and brain-storming tools, and interoperability...|$|R

2500|$|In this period, Thomism had {{its chief}} center at Cologne, whence it {{influenced}} Kraków. [...] Cologne, formerly the home ground of Albertus Magnus, had preserved Albert's <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> [...] Thus the Cologne philosophers formed two wings, the Thomist and Albertist, and even Cologne's Thomists showed Neoplatonist traits characteristic of Albert, affirming emanation, {{a hierarchy of}} being, and a metaphysic of light.|$|E
2500|$|One <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> is {{that this}} {{tendency}} of acetylation {{to be associated with}} [...] "active" [...] transcription is biophysical in nature. Because it normally has a positively charged nitrogen at its end, lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the DNA backbone. The acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral amide linkage. This removes the positive charge, thus loosening the DNA from the histone. When this occurs, complexes like SWI/SNF and other transcriptional factors can bind to the DNA and allow transcription to occur. This is the [...] "cis" [...] model of epigenetic function. In other words, changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the DNA itself.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} sociological {{aspect of}} tradition {{is the one}} that relates to rationality. It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see theories of rationality), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by Raymond Boudon in his book Action. In this context tradition refers to the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and action justified as [...] "it has always been that way". This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the appeal to tradition (or argumentum ad antiquitatem), which takes the form [...] "this is right because we've always done it this way." [...] In most cases such an appeal can be refuted {{on the grounds that the}} [...] "tradition" [...] being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity.|$|E

2500|$|The action had {{achieved}} disappointingly little {{as far as}} the British were concerned. Fulton claimed that his machines had not been used properly, and began to refine them to make them easier to handle. Keith, who had been skeptical from the start, was sympathetic, considering that they had been unlucky and that another attempt might bring greater success. [...] Melville acknowledged this, but noted that the attack had had psychological implications, by spreading panic amongst the French. The French began to construct a series of booms and chains across the entrance to frustrate similar attacks in the future, which took time {{and put them in a}} defensive rather than offensive <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> By now the winter weather had arrived, and all thoughts of invasion had to be postponed until the spring 1805 at the earliest. The nature of the devices used in the attack provoked derision from much of the British public, who regarded it as an unfair and unsporting method of waging war. Fulton made another attempt to use his devices against the fleet at Boulogne on 19 September 1805, this time in company with Sir Sidney Smith, but again the attack did not produce any significant results.|$|E

60|$|Mr Godwin in {{the preface}} to his Enquirer, drops a few {{expressions}} which seem to hint at some change in his opinions since he wrote the Political Justice; and as this is a work now of some years standing, I should certainly think that I had been arguing against opinions which the author had himself seen reason to alter, but that in some of the essays of the Enquirer, Mr Godwin's peculiar <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> appears in as striking a light as ever.|$|E
60|$|The {{impression}} {{soon became}} very strong upon {{the mind of}} Lawrence {{that he would like}} to know what kind of man was this former lover. He had known Miss March about a year, and at the time of his first acquaintaince with her, she must have come very fresh from this engagement. To study the man to whom Roberta March had been willing to engage herself, was, to Lawrence's <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> if not a prerequisite procedure in his contemplated course of action, at least a very desirable one.|$|E

This thesis project delineates {{the way in which}} their novels, Silko???s Ceremony and Alexie???s Indian Killer, work with the non-Native reader. Ceremony works hard to change the reader???s <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> transparently educating readers in non-Westem <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> to produce a hybrid community of readers. Indian Killer, on the other hand, works against the non- Native reader in a reverse-colonization of a Western genre, fooling the reader into believing a social critique is a familiar mystery thriller. Though their methods differ, both texts take pains to educate non-Native readers and promote a positive cultural change...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the particular relevance of feminist critiques of epistemic authority in contexts of institutionalized violence. Reading feminist criticism of “experts” together with theorists of institutionalized violence, Stone-Mediatore argues that typical expert <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> are incapable <b>of</b> rigorous knowledge of institutionalized violence because such knowledge requires a distinctive kind of thinking-within-discomfort for which conventionally trained experts are ill-suited. The author demonstrates the limitations <b>of</b> “expert” <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> {{with reference to}} writings on the Iraq war by Michael Ignatieff and Fouad Ajami. Finally, the author turns to a newly active group of epistemic agents—anti-war relatives of soldiers [...] to examine the role that undervalued epistemic traits can play in knowledge of war {{and other forms of}} structural violence...|$|R
60|$|Upon this {{unpleasant}} occurrence Captain Brown absented {{himself from}} the inn {{in which he had}} resided under the name of Dawson, so that Colonel Mannering's attempts to discover and trace him were unavailing. He resolved, however, that no difficulties should prevent his continuing his enterprise while Julia left him a ray of hope. The interest he had secured in her bosom was such as she had been unable to conceal from him, and with all the courage of romantic gallantry he determined upon perseverance. But we believe the reader will be as well pleased to learn his <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and intention from his own communication to his special friend and confidant, Captain Delaserre, a Swiss gentleman who had a company in his regiment.|$|E
60|$|If {{there was}} {{something}} in Sir Halbert Glendinning's speech which flattered Roland's pride, there was also much that, according to his <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> was an alloy to the compliment. And yet his conscience instantly told him that he ought to accept, with grateful deference, the offer which was made him by the husband of his kind protectress; and his prudence, however slender, could not but admit he should enter the world under very different auspices as a retainer of Sir Halbert Glendinning, so famed for wisdom, courage, and influence, from those under which he might partake the wanderings, and become an agent in the visionary schemes, for such they appeared to him, of Magdalen, his relative. Still, a strong reluctance to re-enter a service from which he had been dismissed with contempt, almost counterbalanced these considerations.|$|E
60|$|M. Comte {{is equally}} {{free from the}} error of {{considering}} any practical rule or doctrine that can be laid down in politics as universal and absolute. All political truth he deems strictly relative, implying as its correlative a given state or situation of society. This conviction is now common to him with all thinkers who are on a level with the age, and comes so naturally to any intelligent reader of history, that the only wonder is how men {{could have been prevented}} from reaching it sooner. It marks one of the principal differences between the political philosophy of the present time and that of the past; but M. Comte adopted it when the opposite <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> was still general, and there are few thinkers to whom the principle owes more in the way of comment and illustration.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point {{the notion that}} human consciousness is evolving beyond the boundaries <b>of</b> formal, reductionist <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> The emergence <b>of</b> new <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and new knowledge patterns is discussed via discourses that identify postformal reasoning, integral thinking, and planetary consciousness. The chapter explores the theoretical relationships between several themes arising from the evolution of consciousness literature and a diversity of postformal educational approaches. Four core pedagogical values emerge from the intersection between these two clusters: love, life, wisdom, and voice. These core values are elucidated theoretically in relation to philosophies of education and practically through examples from the art of education. They are offered as pedagogical seeds for evolving consciousness through education in the 21 st century...|$|R

He writes with great force and vivacity; but the language, {{like everything else in}} his country, has undergone a revolution. The translator thought it best to be as literal as possible, conceiving such a translation would perhaps be the most fit to convey the author's peculiar <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> In this way the translator has no credit for style, but he makes it up in fidelity.
