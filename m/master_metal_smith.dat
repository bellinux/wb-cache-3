25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Mesoamerican <b>metal</b> <b>smiths</b> produced particular alloys with the chief aim of exploiting the alloys’ emergent color properties, particularly the vivid gold tones produced through infusion of tin, and the silver shades that develop at high arsenic concentrations. Notably, certain artifacts from West Mexico contain tin or arsenic at concentrations as high as 23 weight percent, while concentrations of alloying elements at roughly 2 to 5 weight percent are typically adequate for augmented strength and mechanical utility.|$|R
50|$|Mining in the Philippines began around 1000 BC. However, the {{discovery}} of a brass needle in Musang Cave, Cagayan pushed back the date to 2160 BC, the date the needle was made. <b>Metal</b> <b>smiths</b> from this era had already developed a crude version of modern metallurgical processes, notably the hardening of soft iron through carburization. However, unlike the typical pattern, there had been no shift to copper or bronze implements before iron implements, it had been from stone to iron.|$|R

40|$|Legendary <b>Metal</b> <b>Smiths</b> and Early English Literature' is a {{study of}} Christian {{religious}} influence on the portrayal of a powerful technology, metallurgy, in Old English verse. Starting from {{the controversy over the}} supernatural role of <b>metal</b> <b>smiths</b> in a metrical Anglo-Saxon charm, it proceeds to explore the impact of Christian thought on attitudes to the metal-worker in late antiquity and early medieval Europe. Significant and contentious characterizations of the smith in the Cain legend, the lives of the saints, and legends of Christ are discussed in turn. A chapter on heroic verse and another on wonder-working discuss, among other topics, the theory that Anglo-Saxon <b>metal</b> <b>smiths</b> were regarded with fear and superstition. The thesis put forth by the author {{in the course of this}} survey is that the critical approach which explains the concern of Anglo-Saxon literature with smithcraft as little more than an irrational primitivism finds little support in the religious writing of the period. What requires explanation is not the view that metallurgy was a matter of Christian concern, but the assumption that it was not. While this study is primarily concerned with mapping literary themes, it is not confined to the world of the imagination. Holding that themes, in order to be appreciated, must be perceived, where possible, in the light of the historical conditions in which they flourished, it devotes part of its space to a consideration of the latter. It examines the role of the monastic movement in disseminating an idealistic view of industry; describes the achievements of Anglo-Saxon metal-working; and attempts to appreciate some of the real hardships faced by workers in the Anglo-Saxon forge. The insights gained from this approach lead ultimately to a new reading of the metrical Anglo-Saxon charm with which the study began, a reading which, rather than peering backwards into the pagan past, looks forward to subsequent and more familiar examples of the forge in literature...|$|R
50|$|Madeline {{helped to}} found {{and lead the}} Deerfield Society of Arts and Crafts in 1901, which became an {{umbrella}} organization for the arts movement in the village.

She and Annie became very influential in developing arts and crafts in the community, with Madeline organizing tours of the village's craftwork and arranging speaking engagements. The two women were expert <b>metal</b> <b>smiths</b> in their own right.|$|R

The father finds out, becomes enraged, and has him killed, later serving his heart to Ghismunda in a goblet of her lover's making. Ghismunda is torn by grief, and she melts the heart and adds poison to it. Ghismunda drinks the poison and dies.|$|R
5000|$|The Mandinka society, states Arnold Hughes - a {{professor}} of West African Studies and African Politics, has been [...] "divided into three endogamous castes - the freeborn (foro), slaves (jongo), and artisans and praise singers (nyamolo). The freeborn castes are primarily farmers, while the slave strata included labor providers to the farmers, as well as leather workers, pottery makers, <b>metal</b> <b>smiths,</b> griots and others. The Mandinka Muslim clerics and scribes have traditionally been a separate endogamous occupational caste called Jakhanke, with their Islamic roots traceable to about the 13th-century.|$|R

50|$|For silicon, gauge {{factors can}} be two orders of {{magnitudes}} {{larger than those}} observed in most <b>metals</b> (<b>Smith</b> 1954). The resistance of n-conducting silicon mainly changes due to a shift of the three different conducting valley pairs. The shifting causes a redistribution of the carriers between valleys with different mobilities. This results in varying mobilities dependent on the direction of current flow. A minor effect {{is due to the}} effective mass change related to changing shapes of the valleys. In p-conducting silicon the phenomena are more complex and also result in mass changes and hole transfer.|$|R
5000|$|... “Empty Bowls” allows {{participating}} {{artists and}} groups {{to create and}} donate bowls, then serve a simple meal. In some communities, ceramic artists are joined by wood turners, glassblowers, fiber artists, <b>metal</b> <b>smiths,</b> painters, sculptors, and other artists and craftspeople. Guests choose a bowl to use that day and to keep {{as a reminder of}} all the empty bowls in the world. In exchange for the meal, and the bowl, guests contribute a suggested minimum donation. One hundred percent of each meal's proceeds are devoted to local hunger-fighting organizations, such as food banks or soup kitchens, or to national or international charitable groups.|$|R

His work, along with that of his business partner enamel artist Elfi Müller, was the subject of an American newsreel item in the 1950s.|$|R
