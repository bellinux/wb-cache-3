50|$|In {{low level}} {{modulation}} a small audio stage {{is used to}} modulate a low power stage. The output of this stage is then amplified using a linear RF amplifier. The great disadvantage of this system is that the amplifier chain is less efficient, because {{it has to be}} linear to preserve the modulation. Hence high efficiency class C amplifiers cannot be employed, unless a Doherty amplifier, EER (Envelope Elimination and Restoration) or other methods of predistortion or negative feedback are used. High level modulation uses class C amplifiers in a broadcast AM transmitter and only the final stage or final two stages are modulated, and all the earlier stages can be driven at a constant level. When modulation is applied to the plate of the final tube, a large audio amplifier is needed for the <b>modulation</b> <b>stage,</b> equal to 1/2 of the DC input power of the modulated stage. Traditionally the modulation is applied using a large audio transformer. However many different circuits have been used for high level AM modulation. See Amplitude Modulation.|$|E

In the general case of noisy quantum channels the signal squeezing can be optimized to provide best performance of the protocol in the presence of side-channel leakage prior to modulation. Our results demonstrate that leakage from the trusted source in continuous-variable quantum key distribution should not be underestimated and squeezing optimization is needed to overcome coherent state protocols.

Methods and Results: Myocardial length crystals were used to simultaneously assess regional left ventricular (LV) function, and high- fidelity pressure and conductance catheters were used to assess global LV contractility by pressure-volume relations in nine open-chest dogs. Mid-LV M- mode and two-dimensional color TDI images were recorded during control and inotropic <b>modulation</b> <b>stages</b> with dobutamine and esmolol.

Opposing significant decreases occurred with esmolol: peak systolic velocity of 4. 46 ± 0. 94 to 2. 31 ± 0. 81 cm/s*, systolic TVI of 0. 47 ± 0. 12 to 0. 19 ± 0. 11 cm*, and diastolic TVI of 0. 55 ± 0. 11 to 0. 33 ± 0. 11 cm* (*all P <. 001 versus control).

40|$|In {{the late}} seventies and early eighties a {{technique}} known as Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) was developed for providing spectrally efficient error correction coding. Instead of adding redundant information {{in the form of}} parity bits, redundancy is added at the <b>modulation</b> <b>stage</b> thereby increasing bandwidth efficiency. A digital communications system can be designed to use bandwidth-efficient multilevel/phase modulation such as Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), Phase Shift Keying (PSK), Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) or Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). Performance gain can be achieved by increasing the number of signals over the corresponding uncoded system to compensate for the redundancy introduced by the code. A considerable amount of research and development has been devoted toward developing good TCM codes for severely bandlimited applications. More recently, the use of TCM for satellite and deep space communications applications has received increased attention. This report describes the general approach of using a concatenated coding scheme that features TCM and RS coding. Results have indicated that substantial (6 - 10 dB) performance gains can be achieved with this approach with comparatively little bandwidth expansion. Since all of the bandwidth expansion is due to the RS code we see that TCM based concatenated coding results in roughly 10 - 50 % bandwidth expansion compared to 70 - 150 % expansion for similar concatenated scheme which use convolution code.

40|$|Currently, the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) {{standards}} body {{is working}} actively to specify Voice services over Adaptive Multi-user channels on One Slot (VAMOS), an enhanced transmission scheme {{to double the}} voice service capacity in existing Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) system. Capacity increase is achieved by multiplexing two users in the same timeslot within the same radio frequency channel. With this new transmission scheme, several characteristics of VAMOS downlink signals can {{be taken into account}} in mobile station equalizer design. Firstly, the base station maps a pair of bits from the two VAMOS users to a quaternary symbol whose I/Q amplitude ratio may vary burst by burst. When the ratio is not unity, the VAMOS downlink signal is improper because its pseudo-covariance does not vanish. Secondly, in the baseband <b>modulation</b> <b>stage,</b> the symbol sequence is processed by π/ 2 progressive symbol rotation and linearized Gaussian minimum shift keying (LGMSK) pulse shaping. Hence, intersymbol interference (ISI) is introduced. Lastly, due to tight frequency reuse in most GSM networks today, mobile stations also experience co-channel interference (CCI) from other base stations transmitting various types of signals such as GMSK, 8 phase shift keying (8 PSK), or VAMOS. In order to achieve network capacity increase, advanced equalizers in mobile stations are required to offer superior bit error rate (BER) performance in this challenging mobile radio system. Unlike uplink transmission where a base station is typically equipped with an antenna array to enhance the desired signal and suppress CCI, equalizer design in downlink direction is more challenging because most mobile stations have one antenna only. In the past decade, various single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) solutions have been developed to mitigate the CCI effect. While these solutions can be straightforwardly reused to obtain acceptable performance in VAMOS, in this work a novel equalizer is proposed to achieve better BER performance by addressing the forementioned characteristics of VAMOS downlink signals. This equalizer consists of a widely linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) minimum mean square error (MMSE) filter and a joint maximum likelihood sequence estimator (JMLSE). In the first stage, since the transmitted signal and the received signal may not be jointly proper, a widely linear filter is more effective in suppressing interference from other base stations plus background noise while preserving the two paired VAMOS users’ signal energy. In the next stage, further interference cancellation is achieved by jointly detecting the two users’ symbol sequences using JMLSE. Optimality of the proposed equalizer is justified by theoretical proof and simulation in this work. 1 yea...|$|E

40|$|Fixed-rate and rateless channel code constructions are {{designed}} for satisfying conflicting design tradeoffs, leading to codes that benefit from practical implementations, whilst offering a good bit error ratio (BER) and block error ratio (BLER) performance. More explicitly, two novel low-density parity-check code (LDPC) constructions are proposed; the first construction constitutes a family of quasi-cyclic protograph LDPC codes, which has a Vandermonde-like parity-check matrix (PCM). The second construction constitutes a specific class of protograph LDPC codes, which are termed as multilevel structured (MLS) LDPC codes. These codes possess a PCM construction that allows the coexistence of both pseudo-randomness {{as well as a}} structure requiring a reduced memory. More importantly, it is also demonstrated that these benefits accrue without any compromise in the attainable BER/BLER performance. We also present the novel concept of separating multiple users by means of user-specific channel codes, which is referred to as channel code division multiple access (CCDMA), and provide an example based on MLS LDPC codes. In particular, we circumvent the difficulty of having potentially high memory requirements, while ensuring that each user’s bits in the CCDMA system are equally protected. With regards to rateless channel coding, we propose a novel family of codes, which we refer to as reconfigurable rateless codes, that are capable of not only varying their code-rate but also to adaptively modify their encoding/decoding strategy according to the near-instantaneous channel conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed reconfigurable rateless codes are capable of shaping their own degree distribution according to the nearinstantaneous requirements imposed by the channel, but without any explicit channel knowledge at the transmitter. Additionally, a generalised transmit preprocessing aided closed-loop downlink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is presented, in which both the channel coding components as well as the linear transmit precoder exploit the knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). More explicitly, we embed a rateless code in a MIMO transmit preprocessing scheme, in order to attain near-capacity performance across a wide range of channel signal-to-ratios (SNRs), rather than only at a specific SNR. The performance of our scheme is further enhanced {{with the aid of a}} technique, referred to as pilot symbol assisted rateless (PSAR) coding, whereby a predetermined fraction of pilot bits is appropriately interspersed with the original information bits at the channel coding stage, instead of multiplexing pilots at the <b>modulation</b> <b>stage,</b> as in classic pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM).
