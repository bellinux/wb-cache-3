40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} Large White turkeys to determine the feasibility of using fertilizer phosphates {{as a source of}} supplemental phosphorus for starting, growing and finishing turkeys in practical, corn-soybean meal diets. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine and compare the relative biological value of two fertilizer phosphates, concentrated triple superphosphate (CSP), and diammonium phosphate (DAP), and phosphated egg shell with a reference standard which was <b>mono-sodium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> NaH 2 PO 4 *H 2 O (A. R. or technical grade), (2) to determine the possible fluorine toxicity of CSP and DAP in diets for starting and growing-finishing turkeys, (3) to determine the effect of higher levels of dietary phosphorus on body weight gain, bone breaking strength, percent bone ash and survival, (4) to determine the toxicity of calcium fluorphosphate from CSP and DAP as compared to sodium fluoride, (5) to determine the response of turkeys fed CSP, DAP and partially defluorinated phosphate from day-old to 20 weeks of age, and (6) to determine the response of turkeys to “minimal” and “optimal” levels of “available” phosphorus from day-old to 20 weeks of age.

40|$|Phytase {{has been}} shown to {{consistently}} improve the bioavailability of phytate phosphorus for pigs. However, only about 60 to 70 % of the phytate P in a corn-soy diet is made available when supplemented with an optimal phytase dose. The use of high available P (HAP) should provide an additional strategy for improving the bioavailability of phytate P in pigs. In experiments 1 and 2, growth performance and utilization of P were compared in pigs fed high available P or normal corn with or without phytase. Weight gain and feed efficiency were expectedly depressed in the diet containing normal corn without phytase; supplementation with phytase improved these performance criteria. The addition of phytase to HAP corn diets produced a numerical improvement in weight gain. Supplementing the normal corn diet with phytase improved P digestibility and retention. Adding phytase to HAP corn gave a numerical increase in phosphorus digestibility and retention. Phosphorus digestibility and retention in HAP corn were increased 28 % and 34 %, respectively. The bioavailability of P in HAP and normal corn relative to <b>mono-sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> was assessed in experiment 3. Estimates of P bioavailability from HAP and normal corn when plasma P was regressed on supplemental P intake was 46 and 33 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} of 28 days duration {{were conducted}} to evaluate phosphated egg shell and fertilizer phosphates as supplemental phosphorus sources. Large White, female poults of the Nicholas strain were used in all studies. The birds were fed a corn-soybean meal basal diet containing 28 percent protein. Phosphorus sources and calcium carbonate were added to furnish the desired levels of Ca and P. Dietary treatments and tap water were given ad libitum and birds were raised in battery brooders with raised wire floors. Bioavailability of phosphorus from two fertilizer phosphates, concentrated super phosphate (CSP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP), was high. Relative biological values for CSP and DAP were 95 and 96 percent, respectively, as compared to 100 percent for <b>mono-sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (NaH 2 P 04 -H 20), the reference standard. The relative biological value of phosphated egg shell was 99. 5 and 100. 1 percent in two separate experiments. CSP and DAP contained 2. 35 to 2. 48 percent of fluorine and were somewhat toxic, depressing body weight gain and feed efficiency when fed to supply recommended or higher than recommended levels of supplemental phosphorus. Depressions in body weight gain and feed efficiency were observed in two experiments. High fluorine levels from CSP and DAP apparently did not affect tibia breaking strength and percent tibia ash in these short term experiments. Fluorine content of tibia ash was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased with CSP and DAP treatments...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has focused on the development of novel substrate mimics as potential DXR inhibitors of 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), an essential enzyme in the mevalonate-independent pathway for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in Plasmodium falciparum. DXR mediates the isomerisation and reduction of 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate (DOXP) into 2 C-methyl-D-erithrytol 4 -phosphate (MEP) and has been validated as an attractive target for the development of novel anti-malarial chemotherapeutic agents. Reaction of various amines with specially prepared 4 -phosphonated crotonic acid {{in the presence of the}} peptide coupling reagent, 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), has afforded a series of amido-phosphonate esters in moderate to good yields (48 % - 73 %) which, using a RuCl₃/CeCl₃/NaIO₄ catalyst system, have been dihydroxylated to furnish the dihydroxy-amido phosphonate ester pro-drugs; subsequent hydrolysis under microwave irradiation has afforded the corresponding phosphonic acids. A second series of potential inhibitors viz., 3 -substituted aniline-derived phosphonate esters, their corresponding phosphonic acids and mono-sodium salts, have also been successfully synthesised. In these compounds, the essential functional groups are separated by one, two, three or four methylene groups, Deprotonation of the 3 -substituted aniline substrates, followed by reaction with the appropriate ω-chloroalkanoyl chloride produced the ω-chloroamide intermediates, which were subjected to the Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction to afford the diethyl phosphonate esters in moderate to good yields (48 % - 74 %). Microwave-assisted TMSBrmediated cleavage of the phosphonate esters furnished the phosphonic acids, neutralisation of which afforded the <b>mono-sodium</b> salts. Furan-derived <b>phosphate</b> esters and phosphonic acids have been prepared as conformationally-restricted DOXP analogues. Functionalization at C- 5 of the trityl-protected furan was achieved using the Vilsmeier-Haack formylation and Friedel-Crafts acylation reactions and, following de-tritylation, phosphorylation and oximation, using hydroxylamine hydrochloride, the novel oxime derivatives have been isolated as a third series of potential DXR inhibitors in very good yields (87 % - 96 %). Finally, in order to exploit an additional binding pocket in the PƒDXR active site, a series of N-benzylated phosphoramidic derivatives were obtained in seven steps from the starting material, diethyl phosphoramidate. The known inhibitors, fosmidomycin and its acetyl derivative FR 900098, were also successfully synthesised as standards for STD-NMR binding and inhibition assays. In all, over 200 compounds (136 novel) have been prepared and appropriately characterised using 1 -and 2 -D NMR and IR spectroscopic analysis and, where necessary, HRMS or combustion analysis. Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) protein-NMR experiments, undertaken using selected compounds, have revealed binding of most of the ligands examined to EcDXR. Computersimulated docking studies have also been used to explore the preferred ligand-binding conformations and interactions between the ligands and essential DXR active-site residues, while DXR-enzyme inhibition assays of selected synthesised ligands have revealed certain patterns of inhibitory activity. ...|$|R
