5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Ashton-under-Lyne's growth made it {{necessary}} {{to find a new}} water supply. Before the introduction of piped water the town's inhabitants drew water from wells and the nearby River Tame. Industrial processes had polluted the river however, and the wells could not sustain a rapidly expanding population. From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping water from reservoirs, but there were still <b>many</b> <b>homes</b> without proper drainage or water supply. Today, waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as <b>many</b> <b>homes</b> once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E

Although the Christmas tree had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in <b>many</b> <b>homes</b> across the country. In the early 19th century {{there had been a}} revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert's 1823 work Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England and William Sandys's 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern led to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Andrew was a Category 5 Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that struck}} the Bahamas and Florida in mid-August 1992, the most destructive hurricane to ever hit the state. It {{was the strongest}} in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the United States until it was surpassed by Katrina in 2005. Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was felt in South Florida, with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 km/h). Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), it stripped <b>many</b> <b>homes</b> of all but their concrete foundations. In total, it destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $26.5 billion in damage, and left 65 people dead.|$|E

5|$|In La Paz, a {{town that}} at that time had a {{population}} of approximately85,000, 20,000were left homeless (nearly {{one third of the}} towns population), and an additional 4,000were injured. It is estimated that one out of five homes were destroyed in the city. Widespread flooding was reported throughout the city with mud filling up the first floor of many houses. This flash flooding led to <b>many</b> <b>homes</b> and automobiles being destroyed. Several roofs fell off of homes and landed deep in the mud. Many roads were blocked due to fallen trees while numerous homes were pushed off their foundation; some cars were also abandoned when Hurricane Liza struck. Some cars were reportedly piled against damaged building and debris. Nine people died when a car was swept away in the floodwaters.|$|E

The storm surge destroyed 48homes on Long Island, while the winds damaged the roofs of many more. Widespread crop damage occurred, amounting to about $20million (1985USD). Overall damage in the United States was estimated at $900million, which was less than expected. In neighboring Canada, the remnants of Gloria caused minor power outages in New Brunswick, although confusion related to the storm's arrival {{led to the creation}} of the Canadian Hurricane Centre.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to flood damage, hurricane-force winds downed trees and power lines over large areas and <b>many</b> <b>homes</b> were damaged to varying degrees. An estimated 50,000residences were left without {{electricity in the}} region.

Along the East Coast hiking trail, an estimated 5,000 trees were downed. In all, losses from the hurricane were placed at $200million, ranking it as the costliest cyclone in Newfoundland history. In terms of its overall impact, Igor was regarded as the worst storm of tropical origin to hit Newfoundland since 1935.|$|E

These channels, which mainly broadcast locally relevant news, are produced by regional media houses and news networks, and are broadcast through the local cable network, which is now slowly becoming defunct due to the Indian government's ruling on mandatory digitization of TV channels.|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{derived from}} John also {{produced}} rainfall across southern New Mexico, peaking at 5.25inches (133mm) at Ruidoso. The rainfall overflowed rivers, forcing people to evacuate along the Rio Ruidoso. The rainfall also caused isolated road flooding. Rainfall in New Mexico canceled an annual wine festival in Las Cruces and caused muddy {{conditions at the}} All American Futurity at the Ruidoso Downs, the biggest day of horse racing in New Mexico.
