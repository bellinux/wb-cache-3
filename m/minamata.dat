5|$|A serious {{industrial}} disaster was {{the dumping}} of mercury compounds into <b>Minamata</b> Bay, Japan. It {{is estimated that}} over 3,000 people suffered various deformities, severe mercury poisoning symptoms or death from {{what became known as}} <b>Minamata</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|Toxic effects include {{damage to}} the brain, kidneys and lungs. Mercury {{poisoning}} can result in several diseases, including acrodynia (pink disease), Hunter-Russell syndrome, and <b>Minamata</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in <b>Minamata,</b> Japan, now called <b>Minamata</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|Balaji Sadasivan {{was born}} on 11 July 1955 in Singapore, the son of Indian immigrants. A student at Raffles Institution, Siglap Secondary School (1969–1971) and National Junior College (1972–1973), he {{subsequently}} studied medicine at the University of Singapore. In his second year, he won an essay competition organised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and received the opportunity to attend a healthcare workshop in <b>Minamata,</b> Japan, where he learned about the devastating effects of <b>Minamata</b> disease, a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. This led him to specialise in neurosurgery later on, which was not a popular discipline at the time. In 1979, Sadasivan graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.), {{and two years later}} embarked on further studies at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (F.R.C.S.) in 1984. He trained at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between 1985 and 1990, obtaining a diploma from the American Board of Neurology Surgery and becoming a fellow at Harvard University in 1990. He also worked at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard, and at the Children's Hospital Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1997, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B. (Hons.)) from the University of London.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals can degrade air, water, {{and soil}} quality, and {{subsequently}} cause health issues in plants, animals, and people, {{when they become}} concentrated {{as a result of}} industrial activities. Common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. Recent examples of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of <b>Minamata</b> disease, in Japan (1932–1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil, and high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the founder Tokuma Shoten, {{encouraged}} Miyazaki {{to work on a}} film adaptation. Miyazaki initially refused, but agreed on the condition that he could direct. Miyazaki's imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of <b>Minamata</b> Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the film's polluted world. Miyazaki and Takahata chose the minor studio Topcraft to animate the film, as they believed its artistic talent could transpose the sophisticated atmosphere of the manga to the film. Pre-production began on May 31, 1983; Miyazaki encountered difficulties in creating the screenplay, with only sixteen chapters of the manga to work with. Takahata enlisted experimental and minimalist musician Joe Hisaishi to compose the film's score. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was released on March 11, 1984. It grossed ¥1.48 billion at the box office, and made an additional ¥742 million in distribution income. It is often seen as Miyazaki's pivotal work, cementing his reputation as an animator. It was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly that of main character Nausicaä. Several critics have labeled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind as possessing anti-war and feminist themes; Miyazaki argues otherwise, stating that he only wishes to entertain. The successful cooperation on the creation of the manga and the film laid the foundation for other collaborative projects. In April 1984, Miyazaki opened his own office in Suginami Ward, naming it Nibariki.|$|E
25|$|A second {{outbreak}} of <b>Minamata</b> disease occurred in Niigata Prefecture in 1965. The original <b>Minamata</b> disease and Niigata <b>Minamata</b> disease are considered {{two of the}} four big pollution diseases of Japan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minamata</b> {{is known}} due to <b>Minamata</b> disease, a {{neurological}} disorder caused by mercury poisoning. The disease {{was discovered in}} 1956. A local chemical plant was blamed for causing the disease by emitting untreated wastewater to the <b>Minamata</b> Bay.|$|E
25|$|Lately, <b>Minamata</b> {{has focused}} on {{becoming}} a model environmental city. In 1999, the city obtained the ISO 14001 certification for Environmental Management. In 2001, <b>Minamata</b> became an official Japanese Eco-town. In 2004 and 2005, <b>Minamata</b> won the Japanese Top Eco-City contest.|$|E
25|$|Photographic {{documentation}} of <b>Minamata</b> {{started in the}} early 1960s. One photographer who arrived in 1960 was Shisei Kuwabara, straight from university and photo school, who had his photographs published in Weekly Asahi as early as May 1960. The first exhibition of his photographs of <b>Minamata</b> {{was held in the}} Fuji Photo Salon in Tokyo in 1962, and the first of his book-length anthologies, <b>Minamata</b> Disease, was published in Japan in 1965. He has returned to <b>Minamata</b> many times since.|$|E
25|$|Hair {{samples were}} taken from the victims of the disease and also from the <b>Minamata</b> {{population}} in general. In patients, the maximum mercury level recorded was 705parts per million (ppm), indicating very heavy exposure and in nonsymptomatic <b>Minamata</b> residents, the level was 191ppm. This compared to an average level of 4ppm for people living outside the <b>Minamata</b> area.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minamata</b> disease {{broke out}} again in 1965, this time {{along the banks}} of the Agano River in Niigata Prefecture. The polluting factory (owned by Showa Denko) {{employed}} a chemical process using a mercury catalyst very similar to that used by Chisso in <b>Minamata.</b> As in <b>Minamata,</b> from the autumn of 1964 to the spring of 1965, cats living {{along the banks of}} the Agano River had been seen to go mad and die. Before long, patients appeared with identical symptoms to patients living on the Shiranui Sea, and the outbreak was made public on 12 June 1965. Researchers from the Kumamoto University Research Group and Hajime Hosokawa (who had retired from Chisso in 1962) used their experience from <b>Minamata</b> and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. In September 1966, a report was issued proving Showa Denko's pollution to be the cause of this second <b>Minamata</b> disease.|$|E

25|$|Ontario <b>Minamata</b> {{disease is}} a {{neurological}} syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. It occurred in the Canadian province of Ontario, in 1970, and severely affected two First Nation communities in Northwestern Ontario following consumption of local fish contaminated with mercury, and one First Nation in Southern Ontario due to illegal disposal of industrial chemical waste. The disease was named after the infamous case of severe mercury poisoning in the fishing community of <b>Minamata,</b> Japan, which became known as <b>Minamata</b> disease because it devastated only {{the residents of the}} community.|$|E
25|$|Outbreaks of {{methylmercury}} poisoning occurred {{in several places}} in Japan during the 1950s due to industrial discharges of mercury into rivers and coastal waters. The best-known instances were in <b>Minamata</b> and Niigata. In <b>Minamata</b> alone, more than 600 people died due to {{what became known as}} <b>Minamata</b> disease. More than 21,000 people filed claims with the Japanese government, of which almost 3000 became certified as having the disease. In 22 documented cases, pregnant women who consumed contaminated fish showed mild or no symptoms but gave birth to infants with severe developmental disabilities.|$|E

25|$|On 1 July, the {{minesweeper}} got underway for Sasebo {{where she}} remained until 18 July, when she departed for <b>Minamata,</b> Japan. Woodpecker spent four days at <b>Minamata</b> and five days at Yokosuka {{before returning to}} Sasebo on 1 August. She remained at her home port until 9 September, when she began a two-day round-trip voyage to Pohang, Korea.|$|E
25|$|The first {{patient with}} {{previously}} unseen neurological symptoms {{was reported in}} <b>Minamata</b> in 1956. In 1959, a researcher from Kumamoto University suspected that an organomercury compound could be the cause. However, paths of transformation of inorganic to organic mercury were unknown or uncertain {{at that time and}} so the effluent from Chisso was not identified as the sought source. It took 9 more years until the government officially acknowledged mercury-containing effluent from local acetaldehyde chemical plants to be the cause of <b>Minamata</b> disease. Since then, victims of the <b>Minamata</b> disease have been compensated by Chisso and both local and national governments thanks to won lawsuits and official relief programmes.|$|E
25|$|The Chisso Corporation {{first opened}} a {{chemical}} factory in <b>Minamata</b> in 1908. Initially producing fertilisers, the factory followed the nationwide expansion of Japan's chemical industry, branching out into production of acetylene, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, vinyl chloride, and octanol, among others. The <b>Minamata</b> factory {{became the most}} advanced in all of Japan, {{both before and after}} World War II. The waste products resulting from the manufacture of these chemicals were released into <b>Minamata</b> Bay through the factory wastewater. These pollutants had an environmental impact. Fisheries were damaged in terms of reduced catches, and in response, Chisso reached two separate compensation agreements with the fishery cooperative in 1926 and 1943.|$|E
25|$|The people {{directly}} {{impacted by}} the pollution of <b>Minamata</b> Bay were not originally allowed to participate in actions that would affect their future. Disease victims, fishing families, and company employees {{were excluded from the}} debate. Progress occurred when <b>Minamata</b> victims were finally allowed to come to a meeting to discuss the issue. As a result, postwar Japan took a small step toward democracy.|$|E
25|$|The {{deception}} {{was successful}} {{and almost all}} parties involved in <b>Minamata</b> disease were duped into believing that the factory's wastewater had been made safe from December 1959 onward. This widespread assumption meant that doctors were not expecting new patients to appear, resulting in numerous problems {{in the years to}} follow, as the pollution continued. In most people's minds, the issue of <b>Minamata</b> disease had been resolved.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} step for <b>Minamata</b> City {{to be recognized}} by everybody as an international environmental model city.|$|E

25|$|Throughout 1965 and 1966, {{researchers}} from the Kumamoto University Research Group (that {{had been set up}} to investigate the original outbreak) and Dr. Hajime Hosokawa (the former Chisso hospital director) brought their significant experience from <b>Minamata</b> and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. Many lessons were learned from <b>Minamata</b> and the investigation into the cause of the outbreak proceeded much more smoothly than it had in <b>Minamata.</b> The prefectural government, Niigata University, citizen's organisations, and local people all worked together to uncover the cause. In March 1966, factory plant wastewater was reported to be suspected as the source of pollution, and in September, the Ministry of Health and Welfare announced it had discovered methylmercury in moss at the outlet of the Showa Denko factory in Kanose village.|$|E

25|$|Unlike their {{counterparts}} in <b>Minamata,</b> the victims of Showa Denko's pollution lived a considerable distance from the factory and had no particular link to the company. As a result, the local community was much more supportive of patients' groups and a lawsuit was filed against the company in March 1968. The Niigata lawsuit was filed only {{three years after the}} outbreak had been made public in 1965. In contrast, the first lawsuit filed in <b>Minamata</b> happened in 1969, 13 years after the original outbreak was discovered.|$|E
25|$|During the {{investigation}} {{by researchers at}} Kumamoto University, the causal substance had {{been identified as a}} heavy metal and it was widely presumed that the Chisso plant was the source of the contamination. Chisso was coming under closer scrutiny and to deflect criticism, the wastewater output route was changed. Chisso knew of the environmental damage caused by its wastewater and was well aware that it was the prime suspect in the <b>Minamata</b> disease investigation. Despite this, from September 1958, instead of discharging its waste into Hyakken Harbour (the focus of investigation and source of original contamination), it discharged wastewater directly into <b>Minamata</b> River. The immediate effect was the death of fish {{at the mouth of the}} river, and from that point on, new <b>Minamata</b> disease victims began to appear in other fishing villages up and down the coast of the Shiranui Sea, as the pollution spread over an even greater area.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minamata</b> disease {{attracted}} global {{attention in}} 1972 during the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm. The official report {{presented to the}} Conference by the Japanese government {{did not mention the}} disease at all; this lack of honesty resulted in a second report being put together by Japanese citizens. <b>Minamata</b> disease patients were sent to Stockholm to hand in the citizens' report. Evidence of the misery caused by heavy environmental pollution revealed the downside of Japan's post-war rapid economic development to global public.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{environmental}} protests did result in Japan becoming more democratized, {{it did not}} completely rid Japan {{of the system that}} first suppressed the fishermen and victims of <b>Minamata</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|Researchers from Kumamoto University {{also began}} to focus on the cause of the strange disease. They found that the victims, often members of the same family, were {{clustered}} in fishing hamlets along the shore of <b>Minamata</b> Bay. The staple food of victims was invariably fish and shellfish from <b>Minamata</b> Bay. The cats in the local area, which tended to eat scraps from the family table, had died with symptoms similar to those now discovered in humans. This led the researchers to believe that the outbreak was caused by some kind of food poisoning, with contaminated fish and shellfish being the prime suspects.|$|E
