500|$|The Super Furry Animals had {{originally}} intended to issue the song [...] "Wherever I Lay <b>My</b> <b>Phone</b> (That's My Home)" [...] as the third single from Guerrilla but, on returning from an American tour in 1999, found that their record company, Creation, had not done any work regarding the release. Returning from a tour of Europe later the same year the band discovered that both their record label and record plugging company had folded and that Creation made the decision, first to release [...] "Night Vision" [...] instead of [...] "Wherever I Lay <b>My</b> <b>Phone</b> (That's My Home)", and then to replace [...] "Night Vision" [...] with [...] "Do or Die" [...] as the last single from Guerrilla. Singer Gruff Rhys has expressed dissatisfaction with this choice, claiming {{that he is not}} sure how the decision was made and that he wanted [...] "Wherever I Lay <b>My</b> <b>Phone</b> (That's My Home)" [...] to be released as he [...] "quite fancied the idea of a novelty hit". However, the group ultimately felt [...] "Wherever I Lay <b>My</b> <b>Phone</b> (That's My Home)" [...] could not be issued in any case following the December 1999 release of [...] "I Wanna 1-2-1 With You" [...] by Jimmy Cauty's Solid Gold Chartbusters, which was [...] "based on the same Nokia ringtone".|$|E
500|$|... "Do or Die" [...] is the {{eleventh}} single by Super Furry Animals. It {{was the last}} single to be taken from the Guerrilla album and was the band's last release for Creation Records. The track reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart after its release on 17 January 2000. The group had originally wanted to release [...] "Wherever I Lay <b>My</b> <b>Phone</b> (That's My Home)" [...] as the final single from Guerilla but Creation instead chose [...] "Do or Die", a decision which the band claimed not to understand.|$|E

This version was designed mainly for easier finger usage.

When asked, Dawson said [...] "They came at 6.30 a.m. Ten officers. They searched our house {{from top to bottom}} and seized some of our belongings - <b>my</b> mobile <b>phones,</b> <b>my</b> laptop, <b>my</b> girlfriend’s <b>phone,</b> documents. Then they said I had {{to go down to the}} station. We didn't know what was going on." [...] "It nearly broke me."

500|$|In 1995, Led Zeppelin were {{inducted}} into the United States Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith. Jason and Zoë Bonham also attended, representing their late father. At the induction ceremony, the band's inner rift became apparent when Jones joked upon accepting his award, [...] "Thank you, my friends, for finally remembering <b>my</b> <b>phone</b> number", causing consternation and awkward looks from Page and Plant. Afterwards, they played one brief set with Tyler and Perry, with Jason Bonham on drums, and then a second with Neil Young, this time with Michael Lee playing the drums.|$|E
500|$|The Blue Jays drafted Loup in {{the ninth}} round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Loup had shown a strong {{performance}} when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted. Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me before I even heard anything and then <b>my</b> <b>phone</b> rang and I got the call. It's exciting. They told me they would call {{me as soon as}} the draft was over and we would discuss details, so hopefully everything will shake out." ...|$|E
500|$|Contrary to speculation, Henderson's {{refusal to}} officially retire {{had not been}} delaying his {{eligibility}} for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period {{has been based on}} major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, [...] "I believe today, and people say I’m crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them... they can always ring <b>my</b> <b>phone</b> and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game." ...|$|E

It takes advantage of the [...] "Smart Bluetooth" [...] Apple implemented in iOS 7. A review in TheNextWeb said it was [...] "money well spent" [...] and worked [...] "exactly as described", but that the beeping of the device could be louder and users will still need to supplement it with the Find <b>my</b> <b>Phone</b> app. A review in Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
500|$|Clark's {{loyalty to}} the Democratic Party was {{questioned}} by some {{as soon as he}} entered the race. Senator Joe Lieberman called Clark's party choice a matter of [...] "political convenience, not conviction." [...] Republican Governor Bill Owens of Colorado and University of Denver president Marc Holtzman have claimed Clark once said [...] "I would have been a Republican if Karl Rove had returned <b>my</b> <b>phone</b> calls." [...] Clark later claimed he was simply joking, but both Owens and Holtzman said the remark was delivered [...] "very directly" [...] and [...] "wasn't a joke." [...] Katharine Q. Seelye wrote that many believed Clark had chosen to be a Democrat in 2004 only because it was [...] "the only party that did not have a nominee." [...] On May 11, 2001, Clark also delivered a speech to the Pulaski County Republican Party in Arkansas saying he was [...] "very glad we've got the great team in office, men like Colin Powell, Don Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Paul O'Neill—people I know very well—our president George W. Bush." [...] U.S. News & World Report ran a story two weeks later claiming Clark had considered a political run as a Republican.|$|E
500|$|Since 2016, Chabon {{has been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} Donald Trump, both during his {{campaign}} for the presidency (signing a petition with over 400 other writers against his presidency in May 2016), and during his administration. During an interview with The Guardian before Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Chabon remarked of the incoming president, [...] "I really have no idea what to expect. He’s so unpredictable. He’s so mercurial. You know, I would be no more surprised if he stood up there and declared amnesty for all illegal immigrants to the United States than if {{he said he was going}} to take them all out to be shot. He’s like a random impulse generator." [...] In a 2017 radio interview, Chabon spoke of President Trump and said: “Every morning I wake up and in the seconds before I turn <b>my</b> <b>phone</b> on to see what the latest news is, I have this boundless sense of optimism and hope that this is the day that he’s going to have a massive stroke, and, you know, be carted out of the White House on a gurney." ...|$|E

5000|$|On January 21 and 22, 2009, Tice {{appeared}} on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann {{and stated that}} while {{he worked in the}} NSA, his role was to follow the communications of specific individuals in a program separate from the one that had been previously disclosed. Tice also stated that programs were given dual military and intelligence status so that both types of congressional oversight could be simultaneously denied. Tice said he initially understood that he was to identify the communication methods of journalists (and entire news organizations) so that they could avoid collection. He said it was difficult for him to communicate securely after he became a whistleblower since [...] "I knew all my communications were tapped, <b>my</b> <b>phones,</b> <b>my</b> computer, and I've had the FBI on me like flies".|$|R

500|$|Musically, [...] "Superstar" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop song, that {{features}} influences of electronic and pop music. The track was mixed by Demacio 'Demo' Castellon for The Demolition Crew, and recorded by Angie Teo. Editing for the track {{was completed by}} Stephen 'The Koz' Kozmeniuk for The Demolition Crew. The song makes references to historical figures including Marlon Brando, James Dean, Al Capone, Bruce Lee, Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln and John Travolta. Billboards Keith Caulfied noted dubstep influences during the bridge, and like other songs on MDNA, [...] "Superstar" [...] takes time to change the composition into a fast-paced track. According to Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph, the composition features a [...] "shimmering ambiance built up from a ringing guitar loop and echoing tom-tom pattern {{that might have been}} constructed from Beatles' drum fills." [...] Along with the looping music, the lyrics are simple and obtuse in nature, which McCormick believed was done deliberately like [...] "You can have the password to <b>my</b> <b>phone</b> / I'll give you a massage when you get home". There are also references to her older songs like [...] "Into the Groove" [...] (1985) with the line, [...] "You're Travolta getting into your groove".|$|E

The band had also planned on releasing [...] "Wherever I Lay <b>My</b> <b>Phone</b> (That's My Home)" [...] as a single, but this was ultimately dropped when Jimmy Cauty, formerly of The KLF, and Guy Pratt released the mobile telephone-themed novelty-pop record [...] "I Wanna 1-2-1 With You" [...] under the name Solid Gold Chartbusters which heavily samples the Nokia theme.|$|E
2500|$|The Melody Maker has {{described}} opening track [...] "Check It Out" [...] as a [...] "jazz funk" [...] song which turns into dub after its first minute. The magazine {{went on to}} state that the song sums up the album due to its [...] "defacement of symmetry" [...] and disorder, which is also evident on [...] "Do or Die", [...] "The Turning Tide" [...] and [...] "The Teacher", all of which start as pop before ending up [...] "skew-whiff under a wealth of hooligan noise". [...] "The Turning Tide" [...] features a string arrangement by High Llamas frontman Sean O'Hagan. According to Rhys the band were happy with O'Hagan's [...] "interesting" [...] arrangement—the track is more serious {{than many of the}} other songs on the album and the group found writing a string part for it themselves problematic. [...] "Do or Die" [...] {{has been described as a}} [...] "dumb pop song" [...] by Rhys and called [...] "surf pop" [...] by the Melody Maker. Rhys has called [...] "Wherever I Lay <b>My</b> <b>Phone</b> (That's My Home)" [...] "metronomical", and stated that it was inspired by mobile phone ringtones.

5000|$|On July 29, Brady {{released}} a statement on his Facebook page criticizing Goodell's decision to uphold the suspension, stating in part (emphasis in the original): I am very disappointed by the NFL’s decision to uphold the 4 game suspension against me. I did nothing wrong, {{and no one in}} the Patriots organization did either. Despite submitting to hours of testimony over the past 6 months, it is disappointing that the Commissioner upheld my suspension based upon a standard that it was [...] "probable" [...] that I was [...] "generally aware" [...] of misconduct. The fact is that neither I, nor any equipment person, did anything of which we have been accused. I also disagree with yesterdays narrative surrounding my cellphone. I replaced <b>my</b> broken Samsung <b>phone</b> with a new iPhone 6 AFTER my attorneys made it clear to the NFL that <b>my</b> actual <b>phone</b> device would not be subjected to investigation under ANY circumstances. As a member of a union, I was under no obligation to set a new precedent going forward, nor was I made aware at any time during Mr. Wells investigation, that failing to subject <b>my</b> cell <b>phone</b> to investigation would result in ANY discipline.Most importantly, I have never written, texted, emailed to anybody at anytime, anything related to football air pressure before this issue was raised at the AFC Championship game in January. To suggest that I destroyed a phone to avoid giving the NFL information it requested is completely wrong.To try and reconcile the record and fully cooperate with the investigation after I was disciplined in May, we turned over detailed pages of cell phone records and all of the emails that Mr. Wells requested. We even contacted the phone company {{to see if there was}} any possible way we could retrieve any/all of the actual text messages from <b>my</b> old <b>phone.</b> In short, we exhausted every possibility to give the NFL everything we could and offered to go thru the identity for every text and phone call during the relevant time.He dismissed my hours of testimony and it is disappointing that he found it unreliable...I will not allow my unfair discipline to become a precedent for other NFL players without a fight.|$|R
