40|$|Thesis (Msc Food Sc (Food Science)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{physical}} and mental development of underprivileged children, living in developing countries, is detrimentally affected by the exposure to poverty, malnutrition and poor health. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the possible risk of nutritional deficiencies of children (aged 5 – 6 years) in a low socio-economic community in the Grabouw area of the Western Cape, South Africa. The nutritional status of the children was evaluated by using anthropometric measurements (weight and height). Furthermore, the dietary intake provided by the meals offered at the schools they attended (Agapé 1 and Agapé 2), was assessed using the school menus. The latter were analysed using the FoodFinder 3 ® computer programme (Medical Research Council of SA, Tygerberg, South Africa). Three supplementary food products (biscuit, health bar and soy <b>milk-based</b> <b>drink)</b> were subsequently developed to address possible nutritional deficiencies. The microbial stability of the products was determined, after which sensory acceptability of all three products was determined using a consumer panel consisting of children (n = 51; M:F = 27 : 24; 5 – 6 years) from the mentioned schools within the low socio-economic community. Anthropometric results were in agreement with those found by the National Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) (1999) and the South African Vitamin A Consultative Group (SAVACG) (1995), with stunting found to be most prevalent (16 %). Only 5 % of the children were found to be underweight and none were found to be wasted. The developed biscuit and health bar was found to be microbiologically safe when stored for at least 30 d at 25 ° and 35 °C respectively, and the soy <b>milk-based</b> <b>drink</b> for 7 d if stored at refrigeration temperatures (5 °C). Concerning the sensory preference, no significant difference was found between the preference for any of the developed products by the males and the females. For the specific products the preference for the biscuit did not differ significantly from the health bar, nor did the health bar differ significantly from the soy <b>milk-based</b> <b>drink,</b> but the biscuit did differ significantly (p = 0. 006) from the soy <b>milk-based</b> <b>drink</b> for preference. The biscuit was found to be the most preferred of the three products and the soy <b>milk-based</b> <b>drink</b> the least. The majority of the juvenile consumer panel (95 %) found all three developed food products acceptable and could, therefore, be considered possible supplementary foods in a school nutrition programme. The aim of nutritional supplementation is to supplement the existing diet and in doing so ensuring a more ideal nutrient intake closer to what is recommended by the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). It is proposed that nutritional deficiencies should, however, not only be addressed by means of nutritional supplementation, but should also be assisted by the nutrition education of the parent/guardian so as help them to make informed nutritional choices and in doing so providing their children with the nutrients necessary for optimal mental and physical development...|$|E
40|$|Induction of mild {{states of}} hyperketonemia may improve {{physical}} and cognitive performance. In this study, we determined the kinetic parameters, safety and tolerability of (R) - 3 -hydroxybutyl (R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate, a ketone monoester administered {{in the form}} of a meal replacement drink to healthy human volunteers. Plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were elevated following administration of a single dose of the ketone monoester, whether at 140, 357, or 714 mg/kg body weight, while the intact ester was not detected. Maximum plasma levels of ketones were attained within 1 - 2 h, reaching 3. 30 mM and 1. 19 mM for β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, respectively, at the highest dose tested. The elimination half-life ranged from 0. 8 - 3. 1 h for β-hydroxybutyrate and 8 - 14 h for acetoacetate. The ketone monoester was also administered at 140, 357, and 714 mg/kg body weight, three times daily, over 5 days (equivalent to 0. 42, 1. 07, and 2. 14 g/kg/d). The ketone ester was generally well-tolerated, although some gastrointestinal effects were reported, when large volumes of <b>milk-based</b> <b>drink</b> were consumed, at the highest ketone monoester dose. Together, these results suggest ingestion of (R) - 3 -hydroxybutyl (R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate is a safe and simple method to elevate blood ketone levels, compared with the inconvenience of preparing and consuming a ketogenic diet...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} three potentially anti-inflammatory probiotic bacteria from three different genera on immune variables in healthy adults in a clinical setting based on previous in vitro characterization of cytokine responses. METHODS: A total of 62 volunteers participated in this randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group intervention study. The volunteers were randomized to receive a <b>milk-based</b> <b>drink</b> containing either Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb 12 (Bb 12), or Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS (PJS) or a placebo drink for 3 wk. Venous blood and saliva samples were taken at baseline and on d 1, 7 and 21. Fecal samples were collected at baseline {{and at the end}} of intervention. RESULTS: The serum hsCRP expressed as the median AUC 0 - 21 (minus baseline) was 0. 018 mg/L in the placebo group, - 0. 240 mg/L in the LGG group, 0. 090 mg/L in the Bb 12 group and - 0. 085 mg/L in the PJS group (P = 0. 014). In vitro production of TNF-α from in vitro cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was significantly lower in subjects receiving LGG vs placebo. IL- 2 production from PBMC in the Bb 12 group was significantly lower compared with the other groups. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, probiotic bacteria have strain-specific anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults...|$|E

The association therapy was initiated in 24 patients (15 males, 9 females, age range 38 - 64 years) with an average cardiovascular risk at 10 years of 13. 6 and with moderate hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol > 239 mg/dL) in spite of treatment with Pro-Activ (13 patients) and Colestat (11 patients) used in monotherapy for 8 weeks. Compared to monotherapy, TC and LDL-C levels were significantly reduced with the combination therapy to reach the TC and LDL-C goals in the majority of these patients (< 240 and < 160 mg/dL, respectively, reached in 21 / 24 patients). Moreover, the cardiovascular risk also has been reduced to reach the level of 10. 7 (- 21. 3 % versus monotherapy). No undesired effects were recorded.

40|$|Intensive strength-training (ST) {{can result}} in {{exercise}} induced muscle damage (EIMD), which commonly leads to reductions in acute muscle function. Post-exercise ingestion of carbohydrate and protein mixtures attempt to attenuate the effects of EIMD. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of whey-protein-hydrolysate and milk-based formulated drinks on recovery of muscle function following ST. Thirty resistance-trained males (age: 25. 2 ± 5. 5 years, mass: 79. 4 ± 8. 4 kg, stature: 1. 77 ± 0. 45 m) provided written informed consent to participate. The study {{was approved by the}} local ethics committee inline with Helsinki Declarations. Participants were randomly equally assigned to either; whey-hydrolysate and dextrose drink (WH), <b>milk-based</b> <b>drink</b> (MB), flavoured dextrose (PLACEBO) and performed baseline assessments of perceived muscle-soreness (SORENESS), static-squat jump (SSJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), seated medicine-ball throw (MBT) and isokinetic assessments of the knee-extensors and flexors. Subsequently, participants performed a ST session consisting of various multi-joint barbell exercises. Participants then consumed either WH, MB or PLACEBO 10 min following ST, subsequently repeating all assessments 24 h and 48 h post-ST. In relation to within-group changes, all groups experienced substantial increases in SORENESS at 24 h and 48 h (P < 0. 001). However, for dynamic power measures (SSJ, CMJ and MBT), PLACEBO experienced a decrease for only CMJ at 48 h (− 1. 8 cm), whereas WH and MB experienced significant decreases across SSJ (WH; − 3 cm at 24 h, MB; − 2. 6 cm at 24 h, − 2. 0 cm at 48 h), CMJ (WH; − 2. 4 cm at 24 h, MB; − 3. 7 cm at 24 h, − 3. 3 cm at 48 h) and MBT (WH; − 0. 25 m at 48 h, MB; − 0. 33 cm at 24 h, − 0. 38 m at 48 h) (P < 0. 05). All groups experienced significant decreases in isokinetic-extension torque at both 24 h and 48 h; however, flexion torque was decreased for PLACEBO only at these time points (24 h: − 10 N · m, 48 h: − 13 N · m) (P < 0. 05). Isokinetic-extension power and work were significantly decreased at 24 h and 48 h for both WH [Power (24 h: − 18 W, 48 h: − 13 W) Work (24 h: − 30 J, 48 h: − 22 J) ] and PLACEBO [Power (24 h: − 15 W, 48 h: − 14 W) Work (24 h: − 25 J, 48 h: − 28 J) ] (P < 0. 05); however, no decreases occurred for MB. Flexion power was significantly decreased for only PLACEBO at 24 h and 48 h (24 h: − 7 W, 48 h: − 6 W) (P < 0. 05). Decreases in flexion work occurred across all conditions at 48 h, but only for PLACEBO at 24 h (WH, 48 h: − 6 J) (MB, 48 h: − 15 J) (PLACEBO, 24 h: − 11 J, 48 h: 13 J) (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Thesis (Msc Food Sc (Food Science)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Carob (Ceratonia silliqua) is an evergreen, drought {{resistant}} tree of Mediterranean origin. Popularly {{known as}} St John’s bread, the carob pod {{has a long}} history of use in food (over 4 000 years). Carob has a good nutritional value, a long shelf-life (2 - 3 years) and it is relatively cheap. Due to its high sugar content, carob is naturally sweet. It also has a nutty chocolate-like flavour, but unlike chocolate or cocoa, carob does not contain any caffeine, thiobromine or oxalic acid. In addition, carob is normally regarded as a healthy food because of its low fat content (0. 2 – 2. 3 %). Carob trees are also found in South Africa, especially in the Western Cape Province. Locally, carob trees have been used mainly ornamentally or as a source of animal fodder, with minimal use of the pods as a nutritious food source. Knowledge of the nutritional composition and the overall nutritional potential of locally (South African) grown carob cultivars is also limited. Carob could potentially be used as an alternative food source in South Africa as currently, most of this nutritious product goes to waste each year. In this study, the feasibility of using carob pods as an alternative source of food in South Africa was investigated. This was done by firstly, analysing the cultivars for proximate composition (moisture, carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fibre, protein, polyphenols, fat and ash) as well as for amino acids, fatty acids and minerals, in order to determine and compare their nutritional contents. Five cultivars (Tylliria, SFax, Aaronsohn, Santa Fe and an “Unknown” cultivar) were examined. The average proximate composition of raw carob pods was 8. 17 – 9. 56 % moisture, 89. 57 – 91. 12 % carbohydrates, 40. 69 – 54. 74 % total sugars (33. 70 – 45. 09 % sucrose, 1. 79 – 4. 95 % glucose and 1. 80 – 5. 19 % fructose), 29. 88 – 36. 07 % dietary fibre, 3. 07 – 4. 42 % protein, 2. 58 – 3. 08 % polyphenols, 0. 45 – 0. 86 % fat and 2. 13 – 2. 69 % ash. Seven essential amino acids were present in all the cultivars, except for methionine which was not detected in the Single unknown cultivar. This study has shown that all the cultivars had good long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) proportions in terms of the saturated to polyunsaturated fatty acid (SFA: PUFA) and n- 6 to n- 3 ratios. The short-chain fatty acid content of the cultivars was low. All nine minerals (calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, sodium, manganese, iron, copper and zinc) analysed for in this study were detected in all five carob cultivars and all cultivars were very low in sodium. The impact of various roasting times (45, 60 and 75 min) at 150 ºC, on the temperature sensitive components such as sugars, protein and fat, was also examined. Roasting had no significant (P> 0. 05) effect on the fat content. Although roasting significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced the sugar and protein content from 54. 74 to 32. 53 % and 3. 59 to 3. 18 %, respectively, levels in both raw and roasted carob still represented a potentially nutritious food source and alternative to cocoa. A variety of food products targeted at the various food market sectors were developed with carob as an ingredient. The formulations for five new food products (bread, porridge, breakfast cereal, mousse and <b>milk-based</b> <b>drink)</b> were developed where carob had successfully been incorporated as an ingredient. Microbiological and consumer sensory analyses carried out showed that all products developed were safe and acceptable. The findings of this study provide useful scientific evidence towards the fact that carob could potentially be used as an alternative food source in South Africa...|$|E

40|$|Aim:  To {{describe}} {{trends in}} purchasing patterns of non-alcoholic, water-based beverages (WBBs) in Australia, 1997 – 2006. Methods:  Trends in volume sales of WBBs were determined from data {{supplied by the}} Australian beverage industry, not including fruit juice or <b>milk-based</b> <b>drinks.</b> Change was calculated as per cent difference between 1997 and 2006, volume share by proportion of total sales in the category and per capita consumption by dividing total volume sales by population estimate for that year. Sugar supply from WBBs was calculated by multiplying sales by sugar content. Demographic trends from AC Nielsen surveys were shown as per cent households purchasing beverages and as volume share by age and sex. Results:  Total volume sales of WBBs increased by 13 % from 1997 to 2006, largely accounted for by increases in sales of plain still water and non-sugar carbonated soft drink (CSD). Sales in the CSD category saw a shift away from sugar-sweetened to non-sugar. There was a concomitant increase in sales of sugar-sweetened sports and energy drinks, and iced tea. Younger people and high-income households were the major purchasers of CSDs, and for sports and energy drinks, it was young males. Conclusion:  The increased sales of beverages by 2006 appear to reflect a greater trend towards purchasing fluids, particularly increases in bottled water and non-sugar CSDs. Sugar supply from beverages has declined, mostly because of decreasing sales of sugar-sweetened CSDs since 2002. Industry-generated data proved useful in forming a picture of apparent non-alcoholic, WBB consumption patterns in Australia...|$|R

The additional energy, protein, and sodium in a milk-based liquid meal supplement facilitate superior fluid recovery following exercise. Griffith Health, School of Public HealthFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|Oligosaccharides are new {{functional}} food ingredients whose production and use are increasing rapidly. Many of them possess beneficial effects for consumer health {{because they are}} noncario genic, low in calories, and bifidogenic, that is, they promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the colon. Major uses of oligosaccharides are in <b>drinks,</b> <b>milk-based</b> infant formulas, confectionery and bakery products, yogurts and dairy desserts. The types of bifidogenic oligosaccharides currently commercialized as food ingredients, {{as well as their}} obtention, properties, applications and future trends in the manufacture of new products are described in this article.

40|$|Benzodiazepines (BDZs) {{are widely}} used as tranquilizers and antidepressive drugs in common {{clinical}} practice. However, their ready availability and their synergistic effects with alcohol make them attractive for criminal intentions. To prove criminal action for legal reasons, it is often necessary to analyze beverage residues from a crime scene. <b>Milk-based</b> alcoholic <b>drinks</b> (whiskey creams) are gaining popularity due to their lower alcohol content pleasant taste. However, the complexity of this sample, containing proteins and fatty acids, can mask the presence of drugs or other substances in standard analysis methods. These characteristics make whiskey creams highly suitable for illicit purposes. In this study, eight BDZs, including diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, flurazepam, nitrazepam and clonazepam, were extracted from whiskey cream using the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) method and analyzed using GC–MS. The QuEChERS protocol can efficiently separate most of the matrix from the target compounds while maintaining acceptable recoveries. The presented method is simple and rapid and has been validated in terms of precision, accuracy and recoveries. Limits of detection and limits of quantitationwere {{in the range of}} 0. 02 – 0. 1 and 0. 1 – 0. 5 mg/mL, respectively. Whiskey cream beverages, fortified with commercial drugs at 20 mg/mL, were extracted and analyzed demonstrating the applicability of the method in forensic analysis...|$|R
40|$|In North-East Italy (the Veneto region) several {{public school}} {{nutrition}} {{policies have been}} developed to reduce the consumption of high caloric snacks and beverages. However, little is known about whether the policies actually influence students’ dietary behaviours. In order to address this point, a multi-centre cross-sectional survey of 691 Italian students was conducted. Students completed the Beverage and Snack Questionnaire (BSQ), which assesses the consumption of beverages and snacks at school and out-of-school. Three levels Poisson Models with random intercept with students (level 1 units) nested into classroom (level 2 units), and nested into schools (level 3 units), were used to examine the influence of the school setting versus the out-of-school environment (independent variable) on students’ consumption of sweet beverages, snacks, milk based beverages, low carbohydrate drinks, fruit and vegetables (dependent variable) (p≤ 0. 05). The results showed a significantly higher consumption of sweet beverages, snacks, <b>milk-based</b> beverages, low-carbohydrate <b>drinks,</b> fruit and vegetables out-of-the school, suggesting a school-protective association Thus, the policies aimed to limit or deny access to unhealthy foods in the school environment may {{play an important role in}} promoting more healthful dietary patterns for school children. Additional studies should be conducted to compare students’ dietary behaviours between schools with nutrition policies to those without nutrition policies...|$|R
40|$|Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) {{leads to}} the {{degradation}} of protein structures within the muscle. This may subsequently lead to decrements in muscle performance and increases in intramuscular enzymes and delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Milk, which provides protein and carbohydrate (CHO), {{may lead to the}} attenuation of protein degradation and (or) an increase in protein synthesis that would limit the consequential effects of EIMD. This study examined the effects of acute milk and milk-based protein–CHO (CHO-P) supplementation on attenuating EIMD. Four independent groups of 6 healthy males consumed water (CON), CHO sports <b>drink,</b> <b>milk-based</b> CHO-P or milk (M), post EIMD. DOMS, isokinetic muscle performance, creatine kinase (CK), and myoglobin (Mb) were assessed immediately before and 24 and 48 h after EIMD. DOMS was not significantly different (p > 0. 05) between groups at any time point. Peak torque (dominant) was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) 48 h after CHO-P compared with CHO and CON, and M compared with CHO. Total work of the set (dominant) was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) 48 h after CHO-P and M compared with CHO and CON. CK was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) 48 h after CHO-P and M compared with CHO. Mb was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) 48 h after CHO-P compared with CHO. At 48 h post-EIMD, milk and milk-based protein–CHO supplementation resulted in the attenuation of decreases in isokinetic muscle performance and increases in CK and Mb...|$|R
