25|$|A {{common goal}} among {{experienced}} web developers {{is to develop}} and deploy applications that are flexible and easily <b>maintainable.</b> An important consideration in reaching this goal is the separation of business logic from presentation logic.

25|$|Reasons for why {{maintainability}} is low can {{be classified}} as reckless vs. prudent and deliberate vs. inadvertent, and often {{have their origin in}} developers' inability, lack of time and goals, their carelessness and discrepancies in the creation cost of and benefits from documentation and, in particular, <b>maintainable</b> source code.|$|E
25|$|The 567D's {{turbocharger}} {{is perhaps}} the least <b>maintainable</b> part of such an engine, and the 567D turbo has many more maintenance issues than 645E and later turbos. A common choice is conversion of a 567D turbo engine to Roots-blown, thereby abandoning the turbo and its many issues. Installation of 645 power assemblies will still allow Roots-converted 4-axle locomotives (GP20s) to produce , as does a Roots-blown 16-645E, thereby becoming the functional equivalent of a GP38, although with older electrical equipment and controls, and, of course, the older carbody.|$|E
500|$|For many years, Nelson's {{image was}} marked by his red hair, often divided into two long braids {{partially}} concealed under a bandanna. In the April 2007 issue of Stuff Magazine Nelson was interviewed about his long locks. [...] "I started braiding my hair when it started getting too long, and that was, I don't know, probably in the 70's." [...] On May 26, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair, and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published {{a photograph of the}} pigtail-free Nelson on his website. Nelson wanted a more <b>maintainable</b> hairstyle, as well helping him stay cool more easily at his Maui home. In October 2014, the braids of Nelson were sold for [...] at an auction of the Waylon Jennings estate. In 1983, Nelson cut his braids and gave them to Jennings as a gift during a party celebrating Jennings' sobriety.|$|E
500|$|In spring 1916, a German officer by {{the name}} of Captain Roemer was searching for an {{appropriate}} piece of cemetery land south-east of Mons. During this search he approached renowned biologist and local landowner Jean Houzeau de Lehaie, who offered some former quarry land on his family estate lands between the districts of St. Symphorien and Spienne, possibly to ensure that land associated with Neolithic flint mines of Spiennes was not employed instead. Roemer initially proposed that the land be requisitioned, with compensation being provided by the local authorities. Houzeau de Lehaie refused to accept payment for the land and agreed to part with it only under the condition that it be donated instead of requisitioned, and that in the cemetery the dead of both sides be treated with equal respect. During 1916 and 1917 Landsturm Infantry Battalions exhumed burials from isolated and less <b>maintainable</b> sites and re-interred them in the new cemetery. Most of the bodies that were exhumed were from the north and north east of the Mons battlefield especially near Nimy and Obourg where the British stopped Imperial German units from crossing the Mons-Conde canal. The German and British dead were reburied in graves with markers containing the message Enemies in Life but United in Death (...) , a common German practice during the First World War. The cemetery was inaugurated on 6 September 1917 with a ceremony attended by prominent German figures, including Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, [...] Albrecht, Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, and Frederick Francis IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.|$|E
500|$|When {{examining}} {{ancient and}} medieval naval operations, {{it is necessary}} to first understand the technological limitations of galley fleets. Galleys did not handle well in rough waters and could be swamped by waves, which would be catastrophic in the open sea; history is replete with instances where galley fleets were sunk by bad weather (e.g. the Roman losses during the First Punic War). The sailing season was therefore usually restricted from mid-spring to September. The <b>maintainable</b> cruising speed of a galley, even when using sails, was limited, as were the amount of supplies it could carry. Water in particular, being essentially a galley's [...] "fuel" [...] supply, was of critical importance. With consumption levels estimated at 8 litres a day for every oarsman, its availability was a decisive operational factor in the often water-scarce and sun-baked coasts of the Eastern Mediterranean. Smaller dromons are estimated {{to have been able to}} carry about 4 days' worth of water. Effectively, this meant that fleets composed of galleys were confined to coastal routes, and had to make frequent landfall to replenish their supplies and rest their crews. This is well attested in Byzantine overseas endeavours, from Belisarius' campaign against the Vandals to the Cretan expeditions of the 9th and 10th centuries. It is for these reasons that Nikephoros Ouranos emphasizes the need to have available [...] "men with accurate knowledge and experience of the sea , which winds cause it to swell and which blow from the land. They should know both the hidden rocks in the sea, and the places which have no depth, and the land along which one sails and the islands adjacent to it, the harbours and the distance such harbours are the one from the other. They should know both the countries and the water supplies." ...|$|E
500|$|A Royal Stag ad in 2011 {{featuring}} Harbhajan Singh, {{showed him}} opting to {{not work in}} his father's ball bearing factory and focus on cricket instead. The commercial ends with him asking the viewer, if with his achievements, [...] "Have I made it large?" [...] Royal Stag's rival, United Spirits Ltd's McDowell's No. 1 Platinum whisky mocked the ad in its commercial featuring Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The ad showed Harbhajan look-alike making ball bearings the size of gym balls at his father's factory, asking if he had [...] "made it large", only to get slapped by his father for being incompetent. Dhoni then tells the viewer, [...] "Zindagi main kuch karna hai to large chodo, kuch alag karo yaar" [...] (If {{you want to do}} something in life, then forget large, do something different [...] ). The ad is considered to be a rare example of a spoof in surrogate advertising. The Economic Times quoted an industry official as saying, [...] "It is in bad taste, this type of advertising has never been used in the Indian liquor industry." [...] Harbhajan served a legal notice to United Spirits Ltd on 18 July 2011 claiming that the commercial mocked him, his family and the Sikh community. The notice was sent to Vijay Mallya, UB Executive vice-chairman SR Gupte, President & CFO Ravi Nedungadi, Deputy President Harish Bhat and Executive VP (Corporate Affairs) Nandini Verma. It was sent by Avtar Kaur, Harbhajan's mother, through his lawyers, Dewani Advocates & Consultants. Kaur stated these kinds of advertisements brought [...] "disunity and friction" [...] in the Indian cricket team and could be termed [...] "anti-national". The notice also demanded that the company publicly apologise to the family [...] "through widely-read newspapers as well as television channels prominently", remove the advertisement within three days of receiving the notice and compensation of [...] The United Breweries Group withdrew the ad on 22 July 2011 stating that had done so [...] "in the interest of the game of cricket" [...] and fearing that the commercial could be [...] "misused by vested interests to further their own agenda".

60|$|When, therefore, {{we argue}} {{from a number}} of known cases to another case {{supposed}} to be analogous, it is always possible, and generally advantageous, to divert our argument into the circuitous channel of an induction from those known cases to a general proposition, and a subsequent application of that general proposition to the unknown case. This second part of the operation, which, as before observed, is essentially a process of interpretation, will be resolvable into a syllogism or a series of syllogisms, the majors of which will be general propositions embracing whole classes of cases; every one of which propositions must be true in all its extent, if the argument is <b>maintainable.</b> If, therefore, any fact fairly coming within the range of one of these general propositions, and consequently asserted by it, is known or suspected to be other than the proposition asserts it to be, this mode of stating the argument causes us to know or to suspect that the original observations, which are the real grounds of our conclusion, are not sufficient to support it. And in proportion to the greater chance of our detecting the inconclusiveness of our evidence, will be the increased reliance we are entitled to place in it if no such evidence of defect shall appear.|$|E
60|$|I {{have known}} books written on Tolerance, the proper title {{of which would}} be--intolerant or {{intolerable}} books on tolerance. Should not a man who writes a book expressly to inculcate tolerance learn to treat with respect, or at least with indulgence, articles of faith which tens of thousands ten times told of his fellow-subjects or his fellow-creatures believe with all their souls, and upon the truth of which they rest their tranquillity in this world, and their hopes of salvation in the next,--those articles being at least <b>maintainable</b> against his arguments, and most certainly innocent in themselves?--Is it fitting to run Jesus Christ in a silly parallel with Socrates--the Being whom thousand millions of intellectual creatures, of whom I am a humble unit, take to be their Redeemer, with an Athenian philosopher, of whom we should know nothing except through his glorification in Plato and Xenophon?--And then to hitch Latimer and Servetus together! To be sure there was a stake and a fire in each case, but where {{the rest of the}} resemblance is I cannot see. What ground is there for throwing the odium of Servetus's death upon Calvin alone?--Why, the mild Melancthon wrote to Calvin[1], expressly to testify his concurrence in the act, and no doubt he spoke the sense of the German reformers; the Swiss churches advised the punishment in formal letters, and I rather think there are letters from the English divines, approving Calvin's conduct!-- Before a man deals out the slang of the day about the great leaders of the Reformation, he should learn to throw himself back to the age of the Reformation, when the two great parties in the church were eagerly on the watch to fasten a charge of heresy on the other. Besides, if ever a poor fanatic thrust, himself into the fire, it was Michael Servetus. He was a rabid enthusiast, and did every thing he could in the way of insult and ribaldry to provoke the feeling of the Christian church.
