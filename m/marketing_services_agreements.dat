5000|$|Some {{broadcasting}} {{companies have}} used loopholes to establish duopolies in smaller markets {{by way of}} a local <b>marketing</b> <b>agreement,</b> shared <b>services</b> <b>agreement</b> or joint sales agreement; where a station effectively brokers its entire airtime to the owner of another station in the market, which becomes responsible for handling its programming and advertising sales - and in effect, operations. These are termed as [...] "virtual duopolies" [...] as the station's license is held by one company, while its operations are handled by another. Through a 2014 FCC ruling, joint sales agreements in which the senior partner sells a minimum of 15% of the advertising time for its junior partner are counted toward ownership caps.|$|R
5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny {{regarding the use of}} such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales agreements count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local <b>marketing</b> and shared <b>services</b> <b>agreements</b> in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing agreements to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in the market, and then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Media Ventures Management (then {{owner of}} WTXL) entered into an {{operational}} outsourcing agreement with rival NBC affiliate WTWC-TV (owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group) {{which resulted in}} that station controlling WTXL and [...] "WBXT". On March 17, 2002, this outlet merged all of its operations into WTWC's studios (on Deerlake South in unincorporated Leon County, Florida northwest of Bradfordville). The agreement between WTXL and WTWC {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States and was something similar to arrangements known today as local <b>marketing</b> and shared <b>service</b> <b>agreements.</b> The Southern Broadcast Corporation (now Calkins Media) acquired WTXL's license on November 30, 2005 but allowed the outsourcing agreement to continue. On February 20, 2006, the partnership between the two stations was dissolved when the Southern Broadcast Corporation gave notice to terminate the agreement with Sinclair. As a result, WTXL moved out of the WTWC building.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{adaptive}} efficient job scheduling service model on Grids using multi agent systems and a <b>market</b> like <b>Service</b> level <b>Agreement</b> (SLA) negotiation protocol based on the Contract Net model. This job scheduling service model involves four types of agents: service user agents, service provider agents, local scheduler agents and inter-grid agents. Service provider agents provide services to service user agents by allocating resources using local scheduler agents. Service provider agents provide services to service user agents by allocating resources using local scheduler agents. The service provider agents may contact the inter-grid agents if enough resources are not available in their own grid. Inter-grid agents provide resources from the neighboring grid. The service provider agent may adapt the dedicated service according to its interactions with service user agent. The SLA negotiation protocol is a hierarchical bidding mechanism involving negotiations between the four agents. In this protocol, the agents exchange SLA announcements, SLA-bid, and SLA-awards to negotiate the schedule of jobs on Grid Compute resources. To deal {{with the presence of}} uncertainties, renegotiation is used to allow the agents to re-negotiate the SLA in failur...|$|R
