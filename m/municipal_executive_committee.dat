However, Tjvuholmen is a popular recreational areas and a process to regulate the area as such had just been completed.

40|$|Abstract: Municipal {{oversight}} {{committees are}} trajectories for effective {{performance of the}} contemporary municipalities. This research evaluates structural measures and competencies critical for effective performance of the municipal oversight committees. A conceptual analysis as a qualitative research technique was used to critically analyse theories on the predictors for effective performance of the municipal oversight committees. Theoretical findings were triangulated {{with the findings of}} the studies conducted on the effectiveness of the municipal oversight committees in South Africa. Findings indicated the effectiveness of municipal oversight committees is determined by {{the extent to which the}} existing relevant legislations and policies create structures and working relationships that permit greater level of accountability, participation and transparency. However, practices in most of the municipalities signify effective accountability, participation and transparency are undermined by the exclusionary interpretation of section 20 (3) of the Municipal Systems Act by the <b>municipal</b> <b>executive</b> mayoral <b>committees.</b> Such exclusionary interpretations cause the exclusion of the municipal councils and Section 79 committees from certain meetings and information. Since councilors are directly elected from the larger society irrespective of the level of education and expertise, the other challenges were also found to be latent in the skills and competencies of councilors to effectively accomplish technically complex activities of the municipal oversight committees. The study concludes with the postulation of a grid of critical structural measures and competencies that can be suggested for improving the performance of councilors and municipal oversight committees...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} management {{system has been}} introduced in the South African public service with the intensions of monitoring, reviewing, assessing performance, developing underperformers and recognising and rewarding good performance. This study was undertaken {{as an attempt to}} assess whether the Lukhanji municipality {{performance management}} systems contribute to the improvement of service delivery and employee productivity. The literature review undertaken in this study, shows that there is a general poor understanding of performance management systems in Lukhanji municipality. The literature review further establishes that there are several challenges that hinder the effective implementation of a performance management system in the municipality. Other findings of the study include that there is a challenge in setting the unrealistic performance targets which are unrealisable by employees. These are the reasons why productivity levels are not always realised and targets not achieved by Lukhanji municipality. The main findings of the study are that, although performance management systems {{play a significant role in}} the improvement of service delivery, it has not contributed in the improvement of employee productivity of the Lukhanji municipality. The main recommendation on the basis of this finding is that there should be thorough and regular training of officials within the Lukhanji Municipality about the performance management system and how it influences productivity and service delivery. In conclusion, the <b>Municipal</b> <b>Executive</b> Mayoral <b>Committee</b> should demand verifiable evidence to justify a higher rating during quarterly assessments, and that punitive disciplinary measures be taken against those who do not comply with the provision of the performance management system framework, particularly failure to submit performance instruments...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this essay was to study whether niche parties that were {{represented}} in municipal councils in Sweden during the 2007 - 2010 term of office were politically relevant. Furthermore, factors that might facilitate political relevance for niche parties were studied. Political relevance was studied using two theoretical perspectives. The objective model of political relevance presents four categories of relevance based on the relations between political parties in a political assembly; governing parties, coalition parties, blackmail parties and isolated parties. The subjective model of political relevance relies on the party representatives’ own judgments of the relevance of their parties. To study objective and subjective political relevance, party representatives were interviewed. The results showed that seven out of eight niche parties were politically relevant according to the objective model, and six out of eight niche parties were relevant according to the subjective model. For the study of possible facilitating factors, a comparative table was formed using statistics and official data. Percentage of seats and type of majority coalition seemed to affect the possibilities for niche parties to become governing parties. A large percentage of seats and being represented on the <b>municipal</b> <b>executive</b> board and <b>committees</b> seemed to facilitate subjective political relevance. ...|$|R
