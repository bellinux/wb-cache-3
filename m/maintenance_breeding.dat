40|$|Annually, several tons of {{residues}} {{that are}} rich in phenolic compounds are produced during the processing of acerola (Malpighia emarginata DC.) juice. Adding value to these residues is of great interest, since {{they can be a}} viable solution in the search for natural substances with insecticidal action and low impact on the environment and humans. Taking into account the economic losses from the attacks by the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in different crops, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the extract of acerola bagasse flour (ABF) against this insect and determine the phenolic compounds in this extract. Bagasse of acerola (BRS 238 or Frutacor clon) generated after juice production, was frozen and lyophilized. To obtain the extract, 6 g ABF was mixed with 60 mL acetone:water solution (7 : 3 v/v), and the extract was lyophilized. Spodoptera frugiperda caterpillars, 48 h-old, obtained by the <b>maintenance</b> <b>breeding,</b> were transferred to glass tubes supplied with an artificial diet containing the ABF extract at 0, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg L- 1 diet. The following variables were evaluated: duration and survival of larval and pupal stages, pupal weight, sex ratio, adult longevity, oviposition period, number of egg masses, and total number of eggs. The ABF extract contained several phenolic compounds including gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, catechin, p-coumaric acid, salicylic acid, and quercetin. The extract was toxic to S. frugiperda, prolonging the pre-pupal stage and increasing the mortality of caterpillars...|$|E

The strains of mice used were C 57 BL/ 6 N, DBA/ 2 N, CBA, C 3 H/HeN, and BALB/cAnN. All mice were evaluated for susceptibility to Cryptosporidium parvum after intragastric inoculation with 10 (6) oocysts per mouse. The DBA/ 2 N, CBA, C 3 H/HeN, and BALB/cAnN mice given 0. 25 micrograms of DEX per g per day orally (the dose and route previously used to infect rats with C. parvum) failed to develop chronic infections. However, the C 57 BL/ 6 N mice sustained light infections {{during the entire}} 28 -day experiment. The five strains of mice were also administered DEX intraperitoneally at concentrations ranging from 62. 5 to 500 micrograms/day. Only the C 57 BL/ 6 N mice given DEX at 125 micrograms/day developed chronic infections which persisted over 10 weeks, suggesting that the genetic background of the mouse {{plays a role in}} determining susceptibility to cryptosporidosis following immunosuppression with DEX. We believe that the C 57 BL/ 6 N mouse model will prove to be superior to other animal models for evaluating potential anticryptosporidial agents, as well as for elucidating the immunological defects that allow C. parvum to establish chronic infections, because of cost effectiveness and ease in <b>maintenance,</b> <b>breeding,</b> and handling. We also evaluated the C 3 H/HeJ/beige mouse (lacks natural killer cell activity) and the C 57 BL/ 6 N mouse maintained on a low-protein diet to induce immunosuppression.

The author has studied {{the relation between the}} success ratio and the vegetation in the home range for 25 years to make clear the reasons why its ratio have dropped recently. Firstly the author has confirmed that the ratio has kept near 100 % in 1980 s, and its level have fallen about 50 % in 1990 s and many kumataka couldn’t breed in 2000 s. Secondly the author has confirmed the home range of three site of the kumataka. The area of site A is 635 hectares, site B is 839 hectares and site C is 1, 108 hectares. Thirdly vegetation within the range divided 10 categories and data would be related to the success ratio have been collected. The author has analyzed these data and divided the usable vegetation (forest) and un-usable one. The former categories consisted mainly under 10 years artificial forest, broad leaf forest, harvested area and so on, the latter categories contained mainly over 10 years artificial forest and forest without care. Forest cares, such as thinning, pruning and tending are very important roles to keep their success ratio. Finally the author made clearly conclusion as follow. (1) Wide area of the under 10 year artificial forests and broad-leaved forests were existed in 1980 s. (2) Un-usable forest area for the kumataka have increased and exceeded usable forest area. (3) Un-usable area of site A has counted less than 400 hectares since 1990 s. (4) Usable area should be kept over 400 hectares for <b>maintenance</b> <b>breeding</b> success ratio. (5) Usable area needs over a half of the home range. (6) If forestry activities, such as harvesting, thinning, pruning and so on, shall be carried out the level of 1980 s, its ratio shall go up to higher level like the 1990 s.

40|$|Hybrid {{varieties}} of crops {{usually have a}} short but spectacular life. When they succumb to disease, replacing them requires a lengthy breeding, process. But plant-breeders at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), in India, have developed a strategy that will keep pearl millet hybrids going indefinitely, even when they become susceptible to disease. Normally hybrids are developed by crossing two uniform inbred parents. The new strategy replaces one of the parents with an open pollinated variety. This new cross produces what are called 'Top-cross' hybrids and they are now being tested by the All-India Coordinated Pearl Millet Improvement Project. So far they have yielded {{as well as the}} best uniform hybrid, and yet they have a greater resistance to disease because, within the cross, there is a better spread of genetic material. If, however, the 'Top-cross' hybrid does succumb to disease it is very much easier to get resistance back into it through the open pollinated parent. This can be done in one or two generations. It is possible, therefore, to keep a hybrid going indefinitely by performing <b>maintenance</b> <b>breeding</b> on the open-pollinated parent. The ICRISAT plant breeders are taking the strategy a stage further. They are replacing the uniform inbred parent with a hybrid by crossing the hybrid with an open-pollinated variety. This means that the resulting hybrid has even more genetic variability within it. This method helps, too, in reducing the cost of seed production. ICRISAT is also changing another aspect of its pearl millet breeding programme. Instead of developing varieties that can be grown in all locations and situations, they are now breeding varieties to suit very specific areas. For instance, to breed varieties specially for the deserts of Rajasthan in India the plant breeders have taken local {{varieties of}} pearl millet and improved them so that they mature in a shorter time. In this way they can escape the onset of droughts that usually begin {{at the end of the}} growing season.

40|$|The Red Queen {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} antagonistic coevolution between parasites and their hosts {{is responsible for}} the evolutionary maintenance of sexual reproduction. It suggests that frequency-dependent selection by parasites against common host genotypes prevents asexual clones capitalising on their two-fold reproductive advantage and out-competing their sexual counterparts. However, in order for the Red Queen to be effective parasites must be highly virulent and display genotype-specific infection patterns, and both of these requirements are known to be affected by environmental conditions.

This {{species has}} been {{classified}} as vulnerable; therefore, <b>maintenance</b> and <b>breeding</b> of dholes in captivity is important. Successful husbandry protocols involve {{a minimum of}} stress for captive animals. Levels of glucocorticoid hormones, such as corticosterone, {{have been widely used}} as an index of physiological stress. Situations such as novelty, extreme temperatures, and pain activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which ultimately causes the release of glucocorticoids into the bloodstream. Glucocorticoids can be detected in feces, and fecal collection is non-invasive. The goals of this thesis are: 1) to provide a mean and range of glucocorticoid values for dholes, 2) to determine if a correlation exists between certain husbandry events and fecal glucocorticoids, and 3) to determine if a correlation exists between behaviors that are presumed to be stress-related and fecal glucocorticoids. Subjects were 5 dholes housed at the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species of the San Diego Wild Animal Park in Escondido, CA. Fecal corticosterone was successfully extracted and assayed from dhole feces for the first time. Results revealed complex individual differences in the relationship between husbandry and corticosterone and between behavior and corticosterone. Of 8 behaviors noted, only vertical tail was consistently positively correlated with corticosterone levels. Results of this study are pertinent to dhole husbandry, in that 1) no behavior {{with the possible exception of}} vertical tail will reliably indicate hormonal stress, and 2) day to day variability in corticosterone levels makes it difficult to use this hormone as an index of stress in dholes.

40|$|Prior {{research}} has shown that estrous female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatto) maintain spatial proximity preferentially to lower-ranking males. In this paper, 657 h of focal individual follows of 48 free-ranging estrous female rhesus macaques of two social groups during two mating seasons are used to evaluate the hypothesis that this phenomenon is attributable to female mate choice for novel males. This hypothesis is plausible because of the positive correlation between dominance rank and the length of time since a male immigrated into a group or matured in his natal group (i. e., his breeding tenure). However, partial correlation analysis showed that after removing the effect of dominance rank, there was no significant tendency for estrous females to maintain proximity preferentially to males of shorter breeding tenure. In contrast, removing the effect of breeding tenure did not eliminate the result that estrous females maintained proximity preferentially to lower ranking males. Novel (i. e., extra-group, new immigrant, and newly matured natal) males did not consistently experience more estrous female proximity maintenance than non-novel males, although sample sizes are too small to conclusively falsify this hypothesis. Within male-estrous female dyads, responsibility for proximity maintenance did not tend to shift from the female to the male between consecutive mating seasons. Male breeding tenure was not significantly correlated with year-to-year change in responsibility for proximity <b>maintenance.</b> Male <b>breeding</b> tenure was not consistently correlated with female sexual refusal. In one of two social groups, in one of two mating seasons, females appeared to choose novel males.

The present study was conducted to identify causes for the variable twinning response in cattle to low dosages of gonadotropin therapy, to assess fertility in cattle that ovulate multiple oocytes (eggs), and to assess the relationship between number of fetuses and development of the fetus...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{suggested}} management techniques directed at reducing blackbird breeding populations fail {{to incorporate the}} underlying mechanisms regulating populations. Theoretically, removal of individuals from the breeding population should lower the breeding densities and presumably reduce recruitment. However, compensatory responses might occur with decreased breeding densities, but no empirical data are available to test this hypothesis. Much of the underlying compensatory theory is based on differential allocation of resources to reproduction vs. self <b>maintenance</b> at different <b>breeding</b> densities, mainly {{in the form of}} depensatory effects of resource limitation on growth and survival. However, as the breeding density in an area changes, social interactions among individuals also change (Whittingham and Schwabl 2002; Pilz and Smith 2004). Recent research has shown maternally derived steroid hormones present in eggs offer a potential compensatory mechanism by which adult social interactions affect offspring growth and survival (Schwabl 1996 a; Schwabl 1996 b). Gaining insight into the underlying mechanisms regulating red-winged blackbird populations will allow for more effective and efficient management techniques. This study focuses on the effects of density and social interactions on nesting female red-winged blackbirds and the effects of maternally derived yolk steroids on offspring survival...|$|R
40|$|Crossbreeding {{of goats}} in {{traditional}} subsistence flocks had been promoted in selected villages of eastern Ethiopian highlands {{as a means}} to quick genetic progress based on the thesis that crossbreeding can increase the net contribution of goats. Observations on flock dynamics patterns of smallholder flocks with crossbred goats showed that the desirable attributes of crossbreeding had not been maintained after the promotion phase because: 1) the pool of crossbred goats was too small to maintain 50 % exotic blood level in the crossbreeds; 2) shortages of crossbred breeding males also led to gradual back crossing of the does, resulting in an increasingly mosaic mix of crossbreeds; 3) the small size of flocks as well as their rapid turnover limited the scope for any selective <b>breeding</b> and the <b>maintenance</b> of superior <b>breeding</b> animals; and 4) losses control on the breeding of various classes of crosses with indigenous goats posed undesirable dissemination of introduced genes into the indigenous genetic pool. Therefore it was concluded that crossbreeding of indigenous goats with exotic breeds, as a technology for genetic improvement of smallholder goat flocks of Ethiopian highlands, is not sustainable under, subsistence mode of production...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief that}} kin selection {{is necessary for}} the evolution of cooperative breeding in vertebrates has recently been questioned. These doubts have primarily arisen because of the paucity of unequivocal evidence for kin preferences in cooperative behaviour. Using the cooperative breeding system of long-tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus) in which kin and non-kin breed within each social unit and helpers are failed breeders, we investigated whether helpers preferentially direct their care towards kin following breeding failure. First, using observational data, we show that not all failed breeders actually become helpers, but that those that do help usually do so at the nest of a close relative. Second, we confirm the importance of kinship for helping in this species by conducting a choice experiment. We show that potential helpers do not become helpers in the absence of close kin and, when given a choice between helping equidistant broods belonging to kin and non-kin within the same social unit, virtually all helped at the nest of kin. This study provides strong evidence that kinship plays an essential role in the <b>maintenance</b> of cooperative <b>breeding</b> in this species...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} the behaviour and reproduction of any exotic species of mammal {{plays an important role}} in the successful <b>maintenance</b> and <b>breeding</b> of that species in captivity. Data from the field are particularly important in evaluating results in captivity. Where complete field data are not available, problems arising in captivity can only be assessed by taking successfully breeding individuals as the norm and using them as a guideline when studying reproductive problems. This study has been designed to establish the reproductive parameters of the lesser mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus, using data from the field and successfully breeding individuals to this end. Aberrations arising in captivity were examined and an attempt was made to identify their causes. During the course of this study data have been collected on the annual variations of behavioural and physiological parameters. Information on male and female reproductive physiology has been collected and hormone assays have been conducted on urine samples from oestrous, pregnant and non-pregnant females. Data on infant birth-weight and development have also been recorded. Special attention has been paid to reproductive behaviour, particularly birth and maternal care. In addition, a study has been made of social behaviour and communication. The relationship between social behaviour, status and reproductive success has been examined. Having established the "normal" condition it was possible to examine deviations from this norm. Under certain circumstances environmental stimulation was observed to either stimulate or suppress reproduction. Suppression of reproduction is discussed in the light of physical and social environmental influences. Data on pathology have also been collected and adrenal weight and histology recorded. An attempt has been made to integrate post-mortem findings with observations on reproduction and behaviour. The normative data collected in this study are discussed in terms of their adaptive significance and the deviations from the normal condition are viewed in terms of stress. An attempt is then made to indicate the positive influence which this and similar studies could have on captive animal management...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGynodioecy is the {{co-occurrence of}} females and hermaphrodites in populations. It is usually {{due to the}} {{combined}} action of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) genes and nuclear genes that restore male fertility. According to previous theoretical studies, {{it is very difficult}} to explain the maintenance of gynodioecy with CMS and male-fertile cytotypes, although it has been observed in some species. However, only very specific situations have been investigated so far. We present a model to investigate the conditions that promote the <b>maintenance</b> of this <b>breeding</b> system in the case of an outcrossed species when CMS and male-fertile (non-CMS) cytotypes are present in an infinite panmictic population. We show that the type of cost of restoration strongly affects the conditions for stable maintenance of gynodioecy. Stable nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy requires a female advantage, which is a classical condition for gynodioecy, but also a cost of CMS for female fitness, which had been rarely investigated. A cost of restoration is also needed, which could affect either pollen or seeds. Finally, we found that gynodioecy was attainable for a large set of parameter values, including low differences in fitness among genotypes and phenotypes. Our theoretical predictions are compared with previous theoretical work and with results of empirical studies on various gynodioecious species...|$|R
