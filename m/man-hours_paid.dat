50|$|Political {{campaigns are}} {{relatively}} short, {{and there are}} restrictions {{on the use of}} billboards. For all of their activities, campaigns included, political parties have to rely on government subsidies and dues paid by their members. An 'electoral expenditure' law restricts expenditure of political parties during an electoral campaign. Because of the huge public bureaucracy, the high politicisation of nominations, and the widely accepted practice that political nominees spend many <b>man-hours</b> <b>paid</b> for by all tax-payers for partisan electioneering, this arrangement favours the ruling political parties. Since no single party holds an absolute majority, the strongest party or party family will usually create a coalition with other parties to form the government.|$|E

At this point many <b>man-hours</b> of <b>paid</b> production work and considerable amounts of money for location fees and/or permits have been invested in the chosen location. A change of creative concept at this stage or glitch of any kind (such as property owner cancellation) is potentially costly, and legal action is a possible consequence. Also, if production misrepresents itself regarding its activities, intended use of the location, damages the property or negligently causes other problems for the property owner, the property owner may seek remedy in any of many forms available, including legal action.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{economic efficiency}} {{of work in}} the horticultural production in the selected farms which carry out the integrated production. At the average, one <b>man-hour</b> was <b>paid</b> 0. 09 PLNkÂ·man-hour- 1. Taking into consideration the use structure in the investigated objects, the intensity of production organization was determined. The production was varied (it was within the intensity range of 213 - 393 points) and the differences resulted directly from the participation of the grain cultivation area and currant plantation in particular farms. A field work mechanization degree is, inter alia, a factor that influences the labour inputs level. Thus, an annual use of farm tractors was also determined. It was 400 hours. The paper covers farms associated in the formalized producer's group...|$|R
