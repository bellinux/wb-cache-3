2500|$|Two {{other major}} {{sporting}} events {{that followed the}} Super Bowl that year also were forced {{to clean up their}} respective halftime shows following the incident. The Pro Bowl, which would be played on February 8 at Aloha Stadium in Hawaii, originally was to feature singer JC Chasez, {{who was a member of}} boy band 'N Sync as was Timberlake, sing the National Anthem before the game and perform his hit song [...] "Blowin' <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> (<b>with</b> Her Love)" [...] at halftime. However, the NFL did not allow Chasez to perform during halftime due to the sexually suggestive content of his chosen song (even though the game was carried by ESPN, which is not under the content purview of the FCC as it is a cable network, and therefore only self-regulates content as an advertiser-supported service), replacing it with traditional Hawaiian dancers. The 2004 NBA All-Star Game also cleaned up its act, despite being broadcast on TNT (which in reiteration, is not bound by FCC content regulations as a cable network), having halftime performer Beyoncé Knowles perform [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] rather than [...] "Naughty Girl", which they feared would incite controversy given its sexual content. Jackson was in attendance at the game, and dressed conservatively. The networks that were to broadcast the 46th Grammy Awards (CBS) and the 76th Academy Awards (ABC), live events scheduled for February 8 and February 29 respectively, enhanced their broadcast delays to accommodate editing of inappropriate video in addition to audio.|$|E
