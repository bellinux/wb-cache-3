The importance men placed on muscle and weight may be traced back to the release of G.I. Joe. The “bulked-up action heroes, along with the brawny characters in many video games, present an anatomically impossible ideal for boys, much as Barbie promotes proportions that are physically impossible for girls”. Males are thus exposed to extensive imaging of men with bulging muscles, who often act as warriors or fighters, solving problems with their fists. By watching their heroes fight and punch, boys learn that aggression is essential {{and that they should}} strive to have huge muscles too. If these role models were smiling, less hyper-masculinized, or less aggressive, boys would not learn from such a young age that hyper-masculinity is the only successful way to be a ‘man’.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the most}} universally {{accepted}} cynological classification (FCI Spitz and Primitive Types Group), the breed belongs to the Primitive Group of dogs. The Alopekis has erect ears, a wedge-shaped head, normal (scissors) bite and dentition and a <b>mesomorphic,</b> normal-symmetrical structure, body type & morphology. Typical specimens do not display elements of dwarfism. Their bodies are strong and their legs are neither bowed nor notably or disproportionately shortened. Acquired leg deformities are also undesirable characteristics. The breed's proportions suggest a gradual reduction in size over time (genetic sweep) due to evolution, selection and local adaptation http://www.sciencemag.org/content/316/5821/112.abstract. It {{is also possible that}} the breed shares some ancestry, together with the Cretan Hound, from the smaller and more slender Ethiopian Wolf (Canis Simensis) and perhaps even the Southern sub-species Canis Simensis Citernii, rather than the larger and heavier Grey wolf (Canis Lupus) ancestral species. Alopekis morphology suggests a natural - archaic dog type, ancestral / archetypical to the subsequent central European small Spitz/ Nordic and Terrier breeds. The Pomeranian dog, said to be a descendant of ancient Dalmatian / Illyrian dogs and especially those from the island of Melite / Melita (Mljet) in the Adriatic Sea http://www.pomeranianproject.com/earlyspitz.html, which used to be a Greek territory until the 12th century, is probably a descendant of the Alopekis & the Meliteo Kynidio / Small Greek Domestic Dog. Additionally, the hunting ability of the Alopekis, is a further indication that suggests a relation to other breeds of this group V of the F.C.I. Classification http://fci.be/nomenclature.aspx?lang=en that were developed in other Mediterranean regions after the Greek colonization in Southern Italy, Sicily, Malta, Cyrene, Corsica, Southern France, the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic islands, probably with the influence of larger hounds such as the Cretan Hound https://web.archive.org/web/20131203011725/http://www.koe.gr/ellinikesfiles_krlagonikos.htm, as suggested by the existence in Crete of a small type similar to the Alopekis, in morphology and use, as a hunting and utility dog, which in modern times is called Venetaki from the Latin venaticus; in ancient times this dog was possibly identical to the type called Κυναμολγός (Gr. Kynamolgos, cynomolgus = milking dog).|$|E

They spend their lives training as warriors and assassins, with little time for leisure activities. They have unknown patrons that provide training and support - probably in exchange for their services. The Kizanti favor aggressive or provocative clothing that is designed to attract attention. They are adept at many types of weapons, but prefer using ritual high-quality bladed weapons that are covered in richly inlaid engravings (especially when killing Phentari). Warriors wear their hair in a short, stiff mohawk to indicate their status. Kizanti assassins have prosthetic earlobes, implanted contact lenses, and wear their hair long so they can pass for Human. Although the Kizanti have no unified racial language (speaking one of many regional languages with local dialects instead) and have no indigenous written language, they speak and read a form of Eridani as a common tongue (taught to them by their hidden patrons, no doubt).|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} {{polymorphic}} transitions occurring during the stretching of samples of syndiotactic polypropylene (s-PP) in the trans-planar <b>mesomorphic</b> form is presented. Samples in the pure transplanar <b>mesomorphic</b> form or in mixture with crystals of the helical form I have been stretched {{at room temperature}} and at 4 °C. Both the stretching temperature and the crystalline modification of the starting material strongly influence the polymorphism of oriented s-PP fibers. Stretching procedures at room temperature induce the crystallization of the trans-planar form III, regardless of the crystalline modification of the starting unoriented sample. Both the trans-planar <b>mesomorphic</b> form and the helical form I transform at high deformation into the crystalline trans-planar form III. When the stretching is instead performed at 4 °C the structural transitions occurring upon stretching depend on the crystalline modification of the starting unoriented material. Indeed, if s-PP samples in the pure trans-planar <b>mesomorphic</b> form are stretched at 4 °C, only an orientation of the <b>mesomorphic</b> crystals occurs, and the transition into the crystalline form III is never observed, also for high deformation. When the s-PP samples are, instead, in mixtures of crystals of the <b>mesomorphic</b> and helical forms, stretching at 4 °C induces the transition of the helical form into the trans-planar form III at low deformations. At high deformations the <b>mesomorphic</b> form also transforms into the crystalline form III. In all the experiments, {{the removal of the}} tension in fibers stretched at room temperature and at 4 °C produces structural changes, which depend on the crystalline form of the starting unoriented samples and on the crystalline modifications formed during the stretching. The trans-planar form III transforms, indeed, into the crystalline forms present in the unoriented samples or formed during the stretching (helical form and/or <b>mesomorphic</b> form).

40|$|A {{parallel}} {{analysis of}} the polymorphic behavior and mechanical properties of syndiotactic polypropylene samples with different stereoregularity and crystallized in the helical form and in the trans-planar <b>mesomorphic</b> form, stretched at room temperature and at 4 °C, is reported. Oriented fibers show good elastic properties at room temperature, regardless of the crystalline form present in the original fiber. The elastic behavior is associated with reversible polymorphic transitions occurring in the crystalline regions during the stretching and relaxation of fibers. The helical form or trans-planar <b>mesomorphic</b> form present in the fibers transform by stretching into the form III, which transforms back into the helical or trans-planar <b>mesomorphic</b> forms by removing the tension. At 4 °C fibers in trans-planar <b>mesomorphic</b> form do not transform into the form III by stretching, and no phase transition is observed upon releasing the tension. Correspondingly, the elastic recovery at 4 °C of <b>mesomorphic</b> fibers is significantly reduced {{in a very small}} deformation range. These results indicate that both the enthalpic effect, due to the polymorphic transition occurring in the crystals, and the entropic effect, due to the conformational transitions of the amorphous tie chains, contribute simultaneously to the elastic recovery of syndiotactic polypropylene fibers...|$|E
