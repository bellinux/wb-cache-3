40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} variability of HfOx-based resistive {{random access memory}} (RRAM) are investigated for manufacturing and product designs. Manufacturing variability is characterized at different levels including lots, wafers, and chips. Bit-error-rate (BER) is proposed as a holistic parameter for the write cycle resistance statistics. Using the electrical in-line-test cycle data, a method is developed to derive BERs as functions of the design margin, to provide guidance for technology evaluation and product design. The proposed BER calculation can also be used in the off-line bench test and build-in-self-test (BIST) for adaptive error correction and for the other types of random access memories.

As with the preceding workshops in the NVMW series, {{the primary objective}} was to encour-age {{the development of a}} “vertical ” vision for research on the role of NVM technologies in an ever-increasing number of application scenarios, ranging from data-intensive com-puting systems to super high-resolution video games. As the capabilities of NVM-based stor-age rapidly evolve, it is more critical than ever that researchers at each level of the system “stack ” be aware of the needs, challenges, and opportunities associated with the other lev-els. The workshop provides researchers and practitioners the opportunity to gain a broader understanding of what is needed to accelerate the development and adoption of NVM-based storage technologies, and to establish rela-tionships that will provide the basis for further advances.

40|$|In June 2007, I had the {{privilege}} of attending a Healing of <b>Memories</b> <b>workshop</b> lead by Father Michael Lapsley, one of the founder members of the Institute for Healing of Memories. The purpose of the workshop was to help the predominantly white members of a middle class Dutch Reformed congregation in the Northern Suburbs of Cape Town and the predominantly coloured members of a congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Elsies River on the Cape Flats, to share their stories of the past with regard to apartheid with each other. Apart from the stories that were told and the sharing of experiences about the apartheid history that took place, I was struck by the way in which Father Lapsley conducted the workshop. There was a deep compassion for all the participants as was embodied through the way in which he treated each of us with respect. But apart from his cordiality in leading the workshop, one could sense a deeper source of compassion, a source revealing a compassionate understanding of God�s presence amidst the violence and turmoil in our broken world. The aim {{of this article is to}} reflect on whether one could speak of something like �compassionate leadership�, and to take a closer look at the relationship between compassion and God images in the life and work of Michael Lapsley. Special attention will be given to the way in which he exercises leadership through his many involvements related to his own personal story of trauma. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This article presents literary research on the notion of compassionate leadership as a specific kind of leadership. The results indicate that the leadership of Father Michael Lapsley does indeed portray features of this kind of leadership. The research can become the source for finding new strategies for religious leadership. </p...|$|R
40|$|This article explores {{strategies}} for engaging geographically fragmented urban communities as {{active participants in}} conceptually re-mapping their former localities. It looks in detail at the ongoing Retracing Salford project in Salford, UK, which employs the use of everyday objects and oral histories to engage and enable former residents to reconnect with their recently demolished neighbourhoods and each other. The project also seeks to document an urban working class history largely overlooked by the large-scale institutions. &# 13; &# 13; The project {{is based on a}} PhD study undertaken by the author at The District Six Museum in Cape Town, South Africa, which examined the use of material artefacts in exhibitions and <b>memory</b> <b>workshops</b> at that museum (Cassidy 2009). Like District Six, Salford has undergone wide-scale demolition and population dispersal over the past 40 years. &# 13; &# 13; What began as relatively simple installations in museums, libraries and the like, has now grown to include digitised versions of the family snaps, street signs and oral histories, as a developing online Streets Museum archive (www. streetsmuseum. co. uk). This article reflects on how the methodology employed in the Retracing Salford project has helped rejuvenate and reconnect these dispersed communities. The article argues that the approach used is succeeding in widening the circle of participation and debate in relation to heritage issues, in particular the absence of commemoration of working-class community culture in the city. It has also increased awareness of urban land clearance issues. Its continued success depends on numerous factors, such as developing new strategies of engagement with the community, regularly gaining publicity and organising new exhibitions and workshops. &# 13; &# 13; Keywords: Material culture, community participation, urban working class histor...|$|R

40|$|Background. There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} on the efficacy and social utility of cognitive training. To address this, we have designed a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of <b>memory</b> training <b>workshops</b> for healthy older people {{in terms of their}} short- and long-term impact on cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and functionality. /nMethods/design. A randomized controlled trial will be performed in health care centers in Barcelona (Spain) through comparison of a group of individuals participating in <b>memory</b> training <b>workshops</b> (experimental group) with another group with similar characteristics not participating in the workshops (control group). The intervention will consist of twelve 90 -minute group sessions imparted once a week by a psychologist specialized in memory training. The groups will each comprise approximately 15 people, for a total number of 230 patients involved in the study. Each session has its own objectives, materials and activities. The content of the intervention is based on memory training from different perspectives, including cognitive and emotional aspects and social and individual skills. Data will be collected at baseline, at 3 – 4 months and at 6 months. To assess the efficacy of the intervention on cognitive function, health-related quality of life and functionality, a statistical analysis will be performed by fitting a repeated-measures mixed effects model for each main outcome: Self-perceived memory, measured by a Subjective Self-reported Memory Score (from 0 to 10) and by the Memory Failures in Everyday life questionnaire (MFE); Everyday memory, measured using the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test- 3 (RBMT- 3) and Executive control abilities, measured in terms of visual-perceptual ability, working memory and task-switching ability with the Trail Making Test (TMT) and with the digit span scale of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS III). /nDiscussion. The results of this study will be highly useful for social and public health policies related to older people. Given the continuous increase in the prevalence of older people, a large number of interventions targeting memory loss are funded by public resources. To ensure transparency and effective prioritization, research such as the present study is needed to provide evidence of the effectiveness and usefulness of these interventions. This protocol was designed with financial assistance from the Ministry of Health of Spain, provided by the Carlos III Health Institute (PI 11 / 02060). We would like to express our gratitude to Manel Nebot, who was the principal investigator of the protocol and who died during its development. Without his courage, experience and motivation, the project would have not been possible...|$|R
40|$|The central goal of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{underlying}} theories and concepts that help to explain the step-by-step processes and form the foundations of reconciliation-based programmes in Cape Town, South Africa. In theory, civil society organisations (CSOs) have logical rationales of how their project designs lead {{to some form of}} reconciliation, but in practice, the links between project activities and project goals are very ambiguous and are seldom articulated in detail. Through empirical research, this thesis provides the explanation and articulation needed to link the goals and outcomes by applying strategies used in "theory of change" (TOC) discourse to two community reconciliation projects in Cape Town: the Community Healing Project housed under the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation, and the Healing of <b>Memory</b> <b>workshops</b> housed under the Institute for Healing of Memories. A TOC framework was first applied to community projects in the 1990 s in the United States. The framework was designed to help explain the underlying theories that linked the activities to outcomes of community programmes that were established to tackle social issues on the community level. Seen as a success in explaining these projects, a TOC framework has been applied to several other community organisations, but has not been fully explored outside the Western context. The main {{goal of this}} research, then, is to apply a TOC framework to the two case studies and ascertain if it is a helpful tool in explaining community reconciliation interventions. The rationale for this research stems from the superficial engagement of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in South African communities, which resulted in a lack of healing and reconciliation at the community level. After the completion of the TRC, CSOs filled this gap in reconciliation by designing programmes to facilitate healing and reconciliation within communities. Years into the construction of such reconciliation projects, more information is needed about how the CSOs explain their programmes. The methodology for this research first involves an inductive approach that allows for observations about the activities and intended outcomes that make up the two case studies, then applies a TOC framework that allows for the explanation of the concepts that link the activities and outcomes. The research concludes that the application of a TOC framework to community reconciliation projects is not only a useful tool in helping to explain how the projects operate, but should be a necessary practice in explaining community reconciliation interventions because of its ability to describe the complicated phenomenon of reconciliation and avoid superficial explanations. By applying a TOC framework, the concepts and theories that lie behind the intervention strategies help to articulate why change happens the way it does...|$|R

40|$|Changing {{routines}} and creating new routinization processes are difficult tasks involving both cognitive and political mechanisms. In this paper we use Defial- a French meet proessing firm- {{in order to}} illustrate {{some of the problems}} involved in creating a new procedural <b>memory</b> in a <b>workshop</b> and in applying the concept of 'routine'. We discuss some methodological implications resulting from our various observations and the choice we made. In our case study, the complexity arose partly from the many different factors that affect the production process, such as stress and the overload syndrome. We show that time and hierachical pressure cannot alone ensure the success of memorization of a task. The routinization process is only truly sucessful when a new state of condidence towards management has been established, a confidence that helps overcome the socio-emotional issues arising from the changes that are taking place and that paves the way for the acceptance of change in both declarative and procedural memory. ...|$|R
40|$|Memory {{institutions}} face increasing {{volumes of}} electronic documents {{and other media}} content for long term preservation. Data are normally stored in specific formats for documents, images, sound, video, etc., produced by software from different vendors. This software is controlled neither by the institution producing the files, nor by the institution that archives it. This obligates memory institutions to carry out conformance tests before accepting transfers of electronic collections, but again these are {{beyond the control of}} the institution and can be unreliable. This poses problems for long-term preservation. Digital content, meant for preservation, passing through an uncontrolled generative process can jeopardise the preservation process. The objective of PREFORMA (PREservation FORMAts for culture information/e-archives) – a Pre Commercial Procurement project co-funded by the European Commission under its FP 7 -ICT Programme – is to give memory institutions full control of the conformance testing of files created, migrated and ingested into archives. This is achieved through the development of open source tools which enable this process within an iteration that is under the full control of memory institutions. The project aims to establish a sustainable ecosystem involving interested stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds, including researchers, developers and <b>memory</b> institutions. The <b>workshop</b> will present the results of the project, including demonstration of the conformance checkers developed during the prototyping phase. This will inform a discussion with the digital preservation community – open source community, developers, standardization bodies and memory institutions – about the opportunities offered by PREFORMA and the challenges that are still to be addressed...|$|R
40|$|It is {{my great}} {{pleasure}} to serve as guest editor for this special issue of TCCA Newsletter, which is hosting eight papers from the MEDEA (<b>MEmory</b> DEcoupled Architectures) <b>Workshop,</b> jointly held with PACT- 2000 conference. The rationale behind this workshop was to revive the original idea of Memory Access Decoupling, presented in the famous paper of Jim Smith, Decoupled Access/Execute Architectures. In that paper a novel architecture was proposed, as emerging among high performance architectures appearing in the industrial scenario (CDC Cyber 180 / 990, CSPI array processor) and the academy (Illinois SMA). At that time, Jim Smith {{came back to the}} University of Wisconsin to fuel his ideas. The main concept in Memory Access Decoupling was to use two instruction streams and queues to separate memory accesses and pure computations. After about 20 years the scenario of high performance microprocessors is quite changed. Superscalar and VLIW architectures are the dominant paradigms, and a variety of tricks are used to enhance the performance or reduce the consumption. Instruction Level Parallelism, Out-of-Order Execution, Speculative Loads, Branch Prediction, Multithreading, Chip Multiprocessors, Dynamic Compilation, {{are just some of the}} keywords entered in our common vocabulary. In this new scenario we asked for contributions that could show how memory decoupling could be applied to achieve design goals, and possibly to explore new sources of parallelism. As observed by Roth, Zilles, and Sohi, in this issue first paper, today's processors can tolerate latencies of about 10 cycles, but we are approaching the case where the processor-memory gap is going to exceed 100 cycles. So, at this time...|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's {{thesis is}} about the usage of {{activation}} activities. Its main goal is to map activation activities offered in the Home for the Elderly "Máj" and how popular they are. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts - theoretical and empirical. The theoretical part is further divided into four sections. The first one describes changes connected to getting old. Second section characterizes different kinds of activation activities. Third one describes how to correctly communicate with the elderly; {{it is important to know}} how to communicate with the elderly whose hearing or sight are impaired, or with those who suffer from dementia. The last section describes basic types of motivation that affects activity of the elderly. I have chosen qualitative strategy of the research. The research was in-field. Methods used for getting data were extrospective observation and half-structured dialog, method for processing the data was qualitative content analysis. The researched group of people were nine elderly women and three workers from the home for the elderly in the regional town. The research showed that the facility offers wide range of activation activities that may be performed each day - canistherapy, reminiscence, art therapy, psychotherapy, music therapy, ergotherapy - <b>workshops,</b> <b>memory</b> training,, various cultural events, group games, reading and church services. The elderly are content with the available free time activities. It turns out that all of the approached elderly take part in at least one activity per week. One of the most visited and popular activities is ergotherapy - workshops, where larger groups of the elderly meet regularly. The interest in other activation activities is tied to the interests the elderly had before moving into the home for the elderly. Thanks to these activation activities they do not feel alone, they can meet with others and fulfill their needs. The results of this work can be used as feedback and information for specialists who create activation program in home for the elderly...|$|R
40|$|The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (SATRC) was {{operatively}} {{established in}} 1996 and operated in public {{for about two}} and a half years. Its aim was to disclose the truth about the past, reconcile the people and prevent the Apartheid past from happening again. When the Commission handed in the preliminary Final Report in October 1999, it had not accomplished the tasks set forth. Still, thousands of South Africans have not been given the support they were promised upon referred to the Commission. This thesis focuses mainly on two cases extracted from the public hearings run by the Amnesty Committee of the SATRC in Cape Town 1997, and on one case from a workshop which I took part in early 1998, in Stellenbosch outside Cape Town. Thematically I have centred on two topics: memory and narratives. In extending this thematic field I further focus on the concepts of truth, intersubjectivity, conflict and transformation. By revealing the material from the hearings and the workshop I make explicit that the non-arbitrary narratives voiced in these intersubjective arenas aid the negotiation and recreation of memories and challenge the recorded (hi) story of South Africa. The latter necessitates a re-writing of the Master narrative of the country, and the former involves the individual subject to connect to the present and reclaim the narrative voice. Due to the segregating former regime and its constitutional rules of excluding and violating conduct, the people of the country re-experiences the traumatic past as it is compellingly opened on the stage of the SATRC. Hence, traumatic memories saturate the communicative fields and pain returns to the victimized individual. This is more than the Commission can practically manage and it is visible that reconciliation, or forgiveness even, are acts it cannot facilitate. There are moments of truth and reconciliation within the Commissioned sphere, but judged by its goals the SATRC cannot be said to have been successful. The individual has to turn to other forums in order to heal traumatic <b>memories,</b> and the <b>workshop</b> case exemplifies a socially intimate "healing of memories" project. In this context the Self is acknowledged and the internal "thou" may surface in a secure intersubjective field. The contrast to the public SATRC with all its recording equipment and staged performances is striking. As the Commission cannot enter the private sphere of the workshop, the individual cannot experience her/his uniqueness during the broadcasted public hearing, except very infrequent, I argue. However, the Commission has instigated a commemorative project of paramount importance and for which it will be remembered...|$|R
