40|$|Even {{though there}} exists a vast ritual {{literature}} of Kerala, topics related to theology and to the function of ‘initiation’ were taken up for discussion only in the early ritual <b>manuals</b> <b>of</b> Kerala, such as the Śaivāgamanibandhana, Prayogamañjarī, Ĭśānagurudevapaddhati etc. The later ritual manuals, such as the Kriyādīpikā, Tantrasamuccaya etc. did not deal with ‘initiation’ and instead prescribed a mantropadeśa in which the teacher (ācārya) teaches the mūla-mantra to the student. This paper will discuss in detail how the early ritual <b>manuals</b> <b>of</b> Kerala dealt with the subject of ‘initiation’ and will show how the importance of ‘initiation’ declined gradually and was forgotten by the later authors <b>of</b> the ritual <b>manuals</b> <b>of</b> Kerala...|$|R
