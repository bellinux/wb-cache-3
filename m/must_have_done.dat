25|$|Seldom has {{a captain}} regretted his {{decision}} {{as much as}} Ben Hutton of Middlesex Crusaders <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> when he chose to field on a flat Lord's against Hampshire Hawks. Before the match, Middlesex were top of the table, Hampshire rock bottom. It didn't show. Kevin Pietersen played a typical knock, scoring 80 off 50 balls with six sixes, while Dimitri Mascarenhas got himself a 26-ball fifty as Hampshire amassed 353 for 8 off 45 overs – a run rate of 7.84. Despite Owais Shah's 89, Middlesex were never in it, and crumbled to 248 all out in just 39 overs – Pietersen bowling the last over, conceding a single off the first ball before bowling four dot balls to Paul Hutchison and having him caught by captain Shane Warne on the last ball – meaning that Pietersen now had figures of 1–0–1–1 in one-day cricket. It {{turned out to be}} his only List A over all season.|$|E

500|$|Gernsback's new magazine, Amazing Stories, was successful, but Gernsback {{lost control}} of the {{publisher}} when it went bankrupt in February 1929. By April he had formed a new company, Gernsback Publications Incorporated, and created two subsidiaries: Techni-Craft Publishing Corporation and Stellar Publishing Corporation. Gernsback sent out letters advertising his plans for new magazines; the mailing lists he used almost certainly were compiled from the subscription lists of Amazing Stories. This would have been illegal, as the lists were owned by Irving Trust, the receiver of the bankruptcy. Gernsback denied using the lists under oath, but historians have generally agreed that he <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so. The letters also asked potential subscribers to decide the name of the new magazine; they voted for [...] "Science Wonder Stories", which became the name of one of Gernsback's new magazines.|$|E
500|$|As a youth, Lincoln {{disliked the}} hard labor {{associated}} with frontier life.

His stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy [...] "physical labor", but loved to read. Lincoln was largely self-educated. His formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent, the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning. Family, neighbors, and schoolmates of Lincoln's youth recalled that he read and reread the King James Bible, Aesop's Fables, Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Weems's The Life of Washington, and Franklin's Autobiography, among others.|$|E

500|$|In July 2014, audio leaked of Spears {{singing the}} song without pitch correction. James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph noted that Spears struggles to project {{her voice and}} reach the song's high notes. Critics {{described}} Spears' vocal performance in the leaked track as [...] "flat at best and, at worst, like a strangled cat", [...] "noticeably off-key", [...] "unpolished [...] unflattering", [...] "diabolical", [...] "a style that might kindly be described as tentative", and [...] "toxic to the ears". CNN defended the track, saying that its quality is irrelevant as Spears is not known for her vocal ability. Orbit claimed that the audio was a vocal warm up, {{not expected to be}} a take, and not intended to be heard by the public, adding, [...] "Whomever put this on the internet <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so in a spirit of unkindness, but it can in no way detract from the fact that Britney is and always will be beyond stellar!

[...] Adelson said two other instances which similarly have dominated the Digg main page in the past were the Virginia Tech Massacre in the aftermath of the incident and the [...] "7/7" [...] London bombings in 2005. Adelson commented on the popularity of Scientology theme within the Digg community: [...] "In the history of Digg, there's no question that the topic of Scientology has been of great interest to the community ... I can't explain why." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{the idea}} for the film came while at the Marina Beach, the opening {{sequence}} song [...] "Enna Parvai" [...] picturised on Muthuraman and Kanchana was filmed on the beach promenade with the University of Madras and Presidency College in the background. In the first scene of the film, Sridhar attempted to depict Chennai as a [...] "progressive place: where couples sang duets on the Marina". Most of the film was shot in Ooty. Filming also took place on location at the Aaliyar Guest House, a bungalow near Aaliyar Dam, Coimbatore. During filming, Gopu gave Ravichandran the lyrics of the song [...] "Naalaam Naalaam", which were written like tongue-twisters in chaste Tamil. He claimed they were his own lines and asked him to memorise them. When the director called for the shots, Ravichandran asked for more time because he found it difficult to remember the dialogue. The puzzled director then said, [...] "This isn’t the dialogue. Who gave it to you? This is a social film, a comedy. Gopu <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it.

500|$|Nesbitt {{had been}} {{approached}} at a British Academy Television Awards ceremony by director Paul Greengrass, who {{wanted him to}} star in a television drama he was making about the 1972 [...] "Bloody Sunday" [...] shootings in Derry. Nesbitt was only seven years old when the shootings happened and was ignorant of its cause; he believed that there was [...] "no smoke without fire" [...] and that the Catholic marchers <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> something to provoke the British Army. He was filming Cold Feet in Manchester when he received the script. He read it and found that had [...] "an extraordinary effect" [...] on him. Nesbitt played Ivan Cooper in Bloody Sunday, the man who pressed for the march to go ahead. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Cooper and spent many hours talking to him about his motives on that day. He met with relatives of the victims and watched the televised Bloody Sunday Inquiry with them, and also read Don Mullan's Eyewitness Bloody Sunday and Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson's Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?. Greengrass compared Nesbitt's preparation to an athlete preparing for a race, and told The Observer, [...] "For an Irish actor, doing the Troubles is like doing Lear." [...] Nesbitt had questioned whether {{he was a good}} enough actor to effectively portray Cooper and was worried what Derry Catholics would think of a Protestant playing the lead, although Ivan Cooper himself is a Protestant.|$|E
500|$|A proclamation: In {{the markets}} {{of the city}} the profits from {{commerce}} are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages {{are not allowed to}} sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this [...] "the boxing of the community family." [...] They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two {{at the end of the}} year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E
