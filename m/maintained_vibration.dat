40|$|Male crickets produce stridulatory songs using engaged tegmina (forewings) : a {{plectrum}} on {{the left}} sweeps along a tooth row on the right. During stridulation, the plectrum moves across the teeth and vibrations are amplified by the surrounding cells and veins, resonating at the frequency of tooth impacts. The advance of the plectrum on the file is controlled by an escapement mechanism so that passing each single tooth generates one wave of a highly tonal signal. Both tegmina must oscillate in phase to avoid destructive interference. But as each plectrum-tooth contact begins, {{the right and left}} tegmina react in opposite oscillatory directions. A mechanical phase shifter is part of the left tegmen and compensates to achieve wing oscillation synchrony. We use a new technique to simulate plectrum-on-file interactions: in combination with laser vibrometry, this technique assessed plectrum mechanics in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. Using an excised teneral file, shaped like a partial gear and moved by a motor, and a microscan Doppler laser vibrometer, plectrum and left-tegmen mechanics were explored. The results show that plectrum and harp oscillate with a phase difference of ca. 156 deg., a shift rather than a complete phase inversion (180 deg.). This phase shift occurs at the site of a large wing vein (possibly A 3). Plectrum and harp vibrate with similar fundamental frequency, therefore, plectrum torsion resonant frequency is important for <b>maintaining</b> <b>vibration</b> coherence. The mechanical aspects involved in this partial phase inversion are discussed with respect to the escapement mechanism.

40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in efficiency, current methodologies for space structure control design still engage significant human resources for engineering development and routine maintenance. The adaptive neural control (ANC) program {{is part of an}} effort to develop neural network based controllers capable of self-optimization, on-line adaptation and autonomous fault detection and control recovery. This development in addition supports the long-term space exploration objectives for which autonomous spacecraft involving self-reliant control systems are a necessity. The ANC program comprises two phases. The first, basic phase focused on the development of efficient and completely autonomous neural network feedforward control for the case of broadband disturbances. Algorithms were developed that work with no prior modeling information about the system to be controlled and adapt to changing conditions, while minimizing or eliminating the introduction of extraneous training signals. The algorithms were demonstrated experimentally on an optical structure testbed at Harris. The second phase of the program demonstrated a more complex neural controller on the advanced space structures technology research experiments (ASTREX) test facility at the Air Force Research Laboratory capable of the fault-tolerant adaptive control of multiple sensors and actuators. This system used six actuation channels of the existing ACESA struts on the ASTREX structure to simultaneously cancel three independent tonal disturbances in the 10 - 15 Hz band, measured at non-collocated sensors on the secondary tower of the structure. The system demonstrated impressive fault-recovery performance, maintaining good cancellation performance with successive actuators disabled. Cancellation of individual tones was between 25 and 55 dB, with over 27 dB attenuation realized root mean square. The algorithm required very low computational throughput, operating at a sample rate of 1 / 20 Hz. The results of the ANC program show that adaptive cancellation systems can reduce vibrations in precision structures without prior modeling information and can adapt successfully to certain failures in actuators or sensors, optimally reconfiguring themselves without human intervention. These capabilities should significantly reduce the expense of designing and <b>maintaining</b> <b>vibration</b> control systems for spacecraft...|$|R

This is done by designing the mass distribution such that the total center of mass of the mechanism is stationary for all motions. However, when the payload changes, for example during pick-and-place action, the dynamic balance cannot be <b>maintained,</b> and <b>vibrations</b> will appear, reducing the accuracy.

Three of these strategies rely on reconfiguration of the mechanism; by changing position the counter weights (I), by changing the joint locations (II) or by altering the amount of counter weight (III). The last two strategies use active control of additional linkages to steer the mechanism in over a reactionless trajectory. These additional linkages can be placed at the base as a reaction mechanism (IV), or within the kinematic chain with redundant joints (V). The implications and differences of these strategies are shown by applying them to a 3 degree of freedom (DOF) planar mechanism.

40|$|Footfalls {{can produce}} {{vibrations}} that are irritating to occupants, or disruptive to vibration-sensitive spaces {{in hospitals and}} research laboratories. This paper describes, using case studies, techniques {{that can be used}} to predict vibrations, and mitigation strategies to control them. Firstly, pedestrian loading on footbridges is described. Stochastic simulations are conducted in which a number of pedestrians with random weights, walking speeds, and walking paths cross a bridge with random spacing. The resulting vibration response of the bridge is determined to estimate the peak acceleration of the bridge. For the case considered, tuned mass dampers (TMDs) were subsequently installed on the bridge to increase the effective damping of two modes. Next, crowd loading on stadia and ballroom structures is considered. For these structures, the crowd-structure interaction must be considered since the mass of the crowd is a significant fraction of the mass of the structure, which alters the dynamic response of the system. In the case presented, TMDs are considered to reduce the vibrations associated with crowd excitation. Lastly, the vibrations associated with a pedestrian walking in a corridor adjacent to a vibration-sensitive room in a hospital or research facility are described. <b>Maintaining</b> low <b>vibrations</b> in these hospitals and laboratories is critical as the operation of equipment may be adversely affected by vibrations that are well below the threshold of human perception.

Such a sensor faces two primary challenges: a method to provide power for the sensor, and a method to detect corrosion. This project has two goals: to build a model of the TAPS as a test bed for a piezoelectric micro power generator (PMPG), and to use the model to explore corrosion detection methods (perhaps by analyzing changes in the vibration spectrum), for use in the sensor array. To miniaturize the TAPS while <b>maintaining</b> its <b>vibration</b> spectrum, we will specify the dimensions of the model to have the same natural frequency, turbulent flow, and vortex induced vibrations as the actual pipeline. The model will serve as a test bed for various PMPG designs, and also serve as a starting point for exploring methods to detect corrosion in pipes. The primary vibration mode was found to be due to the natural frequency of the pipe, which was 20. 2 Hz for the TAPS. Experimentally, we found the frequency to be in a range from 12 - 19 Hz.

Wind forces can cause tall buildings to undergo significant vibrations that are a potential source of clean and renewable energy for buildings and the power grid. Tall buildings have utilized dampers as a means of mitigating these wind induced vibrations, however, this research proposes the use of dampers as, not only vibration mitigation devices for extreme loading (e. g. strong winds and earthquakes), but also as energy harvesters which convert this vibrational energy into electricity. Designing a building for both energy harvesting (EH) under service conditions (e. g. low or moderate wind loads) and vibration mitigation (VM) under extreme loads is a challenging undertaking due to the conflicting requirements in structural damping for EH and VM. Large damping is required for VM, whereas small or moderate damping is required for EH to ensure that the structure <b>maintains</b> low-amplitude <b>vibrations</b> for as long as possible.

Force disturbance rejection and position alignment {{are two major}} functional requirements of vibration isolation systems. With conventional passive isolation systems, a tradeoff exists between improving force disturbance rejection <b>maintaining</b> ground <b>vibration</b> isolation. Commercial active isolators address such a tradeoff {{through the use of}} inertial sensors, but the AC-coupled nature of the sensors leads to an inconvenient low frequency response. By referencing a payload stiffly to a softly suspended proof mass, both of the aforementioned functional requirements can be resolved while maintaining ground disturbance isolation performance. Philips Applied Technologies originally developed the concept, named Advanced Isolation ModuleS (AIMS). The AIMS system uses a relative displacement measurement between a payload which is to be isolated from vibrations and a proof mass as feedback. The displacement sensor allows the inertial measurement to be DC-coupled. The objective of this research is to find a relatively low-cost approach for the AIMS concept. A 1 -DOF active vibration isolation system based on closed loop control utilizing the DC-coupled inertial measurement as feedback was retrofitted onto an optical table. The coil of a commercial geophone was used as the proof mass, as the geophone provides a relatively inexpensive, low frequency suspension.

Five volunteers performed four isometric contractions of 50 s at 80 % MVC with no vibration (control) and with superimposed vibration at 20, 30, and 40 Hz. Fatigue was estimated from the decay of force, EMG mean frequency, and EMG conduction velocity. 30 -Hz vibrations represented the most fatiguing stimulus. Our preliminary results also show a better correlation between force and conduction velocity decay than between force and mean frequency decay, indicating the former as a better EMG indicator of fatigue. The proposed methods provide important advancements for the analysis of vibration exercise and guidance towards the definition of optimal training protocols...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{drilling}} of deep holes {{remains an}} unsatisfactory machining operation due its limited productivity. This manufacturing process requires the chips {{to be evacuated}} {{through the use of}} retreat cycles and high-pressure lubrication, which is problematic both for productivity and the respect of the environment. An alternative response to the chip evacuation problem is the use of a vibratory drilling head which enables the chip to be split thanks to the drill's axial vibration. The high-speed drilling operation requires specific cutting conditions to be determined in order to <b>maintain</b> self-excited axial <b>vibration</b> throughout the drilling process. The prediction of adequate cutting conditions is determined {{on the basis of the}} frequency characteristics of the spindle/self-vibratory drilling head and the dynamics of the cutting process. It can be expressed in terms of a specific stability diagram indicating the zone of stable self-excited axial vibration. The aim of this study is to develop a high-speed spindle/drilling head/tool system finite element model to evaluate the system's dynamic characteristics and the adequate cutting conditions allowing stable self-excited axial vibration. The model is elaborated on the basis of rotor dynamics prediction, and takes into account the interfaces between system components, using the receptance coupling method. Using the model, adequate cutting conditions are determined by integrating the model-based tool tip transfer function into the chatter vibration stability approach proposed by Budak and Altintas. The simulated results are validated by performing vibration and drilling tests. The proposed model can be used to accurately evaluate the dynamic performance of the spindle/self-vibratory drilling head and can also be used to design an optimised spindle/drilling head for a given drilling process...|$|R
40|$|Although {{individual}} mobility {{represents a}} general desire of todays society, {{the role of}} passenger cars within actual traffic systems is discussed more and more controversially. One main reason is the carbon dioxide content of the exhaust gas emissions which is considered to contribute to global warming. This situation led to {{a renewed interest in}} hybrid vehicles which combine at least two types of propulsion systems. Generally an Electrical Motor (EM) is integrated between Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and Gear Box (GB). The resulting Hybrid Electric Drive Train (HEDT) differs from the original one with respect to mass distribution, inertia moments and cg position, for example, thus requiring an adaptation of the mounting system in order to <b>maintain</b> a low <b>vibration</b> and noise level inside the passenger cabin. A powertrain mounting system has a significant effect in the noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) as well as ride and handling characteristics of a vehicle. Lighter vehicles and increasing customer demands for a vehicle refinement and dynamics are placing a greater emphasis on the optimization of the position, stiffness and damping characteristics of the mounts. A modeling approach is described, using the multibody dynamic simulation package ADAMS/ Engine, which allows the compromises between conflicting design requirements to be assessed rapidly and an optimum specification reached. The use of time domain non-linear approach allows the motion of the powertrain and mounts deflection to be assessed under normal and extreme driving conditions. Model of the major engine components allow the forced response of the powertrain, to low frequency engine excitation, to be predicted in order that idle shake and, via the use of transfer functions, interior vibration may be assessed. In addition the rigid body modes of the powertrain can be predicted and separated from known vehicle and powertrain forcing frequencies for good vehicle dynamics and NVH. Finally, Active Vibration Compensation methods are investigated and a piezo active controller is designed and tested in laboratory. This thesis deals with the development of a controller that receives inputs from a sensor and accordingly generates a response which in turn is fed to the piezo actuators. Since the road conditions vary continuously, it is necessary for the controller to generate a very quick response. Besides reduction in the weight and volume, this "Active Method" offers a high reduction in vibrations in the low frequency range...|$|R
