40|$|We {{investigate}} formation {{processes and}} physical properties of globular cluster systems (GCSs) in galaxies based on high-resolution cosmological simulations with globular clusters. We focus on metal-poor clusters (MPCs) and correlations with their host galaxies by assuming that MPC formation is truncated {{at a high}} redshift (z_trun > 6). We find that the correlation between mean metallicities (Z_gc) of MPCs and their host galaxy luminosities (L) flattens from z=z_trun to z= 0. We also find that the observed relation (Z_gc ~ L^ 0. 15) in MPCs can be reproduced well in the models with Z_gc ~ L^ 0. 5 at z=z_trun when z_trun ~ 10, if <b>mass-to-light-ratios</b> {{are assumed to be}} constant at z=z_trun. However, better agreement with the observed relation is found for models with different <b>mass-to-light-ratios</b> between z=z_trun and z= 0. It is also found that the observed color-magnitude relation of luminous MPCs (i. e., ``blue tilts'') may only have a small contribution from the stripped stellar nuclei of dwarf galaxies, which have nuclei masses that correlate with their total mass at z=z_trun. The simulated blue tilts are found to be seen more clearly in more massive galaxies, which reflects the fact that more massive galaxies at z= 0 are formed from a larger number of dwarfs with stellar nuclei formed at z>z_trun. The half-number radii (R_e) of GCSs, velocity dispersions of GCSs (sigma), and their host galaxy masses (M_h) are found to be correlated with one another such that R_e ~ M_h^{ 0. 57 } and sigma ~ M_h^{ 0. 32 }.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} analysis of the properties of a large sample of dynamically hot old stellar systems, from globular clusters to giant ellipticals, which was performed in order to investigate the origin of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies. The data were mostly drawn from Forbes et al. (2008). We recalculated some of the effective radii, computed mean surface brightnesses and <b>mass-to-light-ratios,</b> estimated ages and metallicities. We completed the sample with globular clusters of M 31. We used a multivariate statistical technique (K-Means clustering), together with a new algorithm (Gap Statistics) for finding the optimum number of homogeneous sub-groups in the sample, using {{a total of six}} parameters (absolute magnitude, effective radius, virial mass-to-light ratio, stellar mass-to-light ratio and metallicity). We found six groups. FK 1 and FK 5 are composed of high- and low-mass elliptical galaxies respectively. FK 3 and FK 6 are composed of high-metallicity and low-metallicity objects, respectively, and both include globular clusters and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies. Two very small groups, FK 2 and FK 4, are composed of Local Group dwarf spheroidals. Our groups differ in their mean masses and virial mass-to-light ratios. The relations between these two parameters are also different for the various groups. The probability density distributions of metallicity for the four groups of galaxies {{is similar to that of}} the globular clusters and UCDs. The brightest low-metallicity globular clusters and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies tend to follow the mass-metallicity relation like elliptical galaxies.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{it has become}} clear that {{interaction}} induced formation of compact young star clusters is a ubiquitous pheonomenon, and the understanding of this process is thought to also shed light on galaxy evolution in general, because these young clusters are widely believed to be the progenitors of a part of the globular cluster systems seen in local elliptical galaxies. We have observed the prototypical merger NGC 4038 / 4039 using near-infrared broad- and narrow band imaging, integral field spectroscopy and medium and high resolution spectroscopy. We find that all of the bright star clusters are young (< 20 Myrs), but the "overlap region" hosts the youngest clusters (similar to 5 Myrs), while the nuclear starbursts started similar to 100 Myrs ago. Photometric and dynamical masses range from 10 (5) to a few x 10 (6) M(circle dot). However, mass-to-light ratios vary from cluster to cluster and suggest differences in the contribution of low-mass stars.

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} the Integrated Galaxy-wide stellar Initial Mass Function (IGIMF) approach in the framework of the semi-analytic model GAEA (GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly), which features a detailed treatment of chemical enrichment and stellar feedback. The IGIMF provides an analytic description of the dependence of the stellar IMF shape on the rate of star formation in galaxies. We find that our model with a universal IMF predicts a rather flat [α/Fe]-stellar mass relation. The model assuming the IGIMF, instead, is able to reproduce the observed increase of α-enhancement with stellar mass, in agreement with previous studies. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} massive galaxies are characterized by larger star formation rates at high-redshift, leading to stronger α-enhancement with respect to low-mass galaxies. At the same time, the IGIMF hypothesis does not affect significantly the trend for shorter star formation timescales for more massive galaxies. We argue that in the IGIMF scenario the [α/Fe] ratios are good tracers of the highest star formation events. The final stellar masses and <b>mass-to-light-ratio</b> of our model massive galaxies are larger than those estimated from the synthetic photometry assuming a universal IMF, providing a self-consistent interpretation of similar recent results, based on dynamical analysis of local early type galaxies.

40|$|Using {{high-resolution}} numerical simulations, {{we investigate}} mass- and luminosity-normalized specific frequencies (T_N and S_N, respectively) of globular cluster systems (GCSs) {{in order to}} understand the origin of the observed U-shaped relation between S_N and V-band magnitude (M_V) of their host galaxies. We adopt a biased GC formation scenario in which GC formation is truncated in galaxy halos that are virialized at a later redshift, z_trun. T_N is derived for galaxies with GCs today and converted into S_N for reasonable galaxy mass-to-light-ratios (M/L). We find that T_N depends on halo mass (M_h) in the sense that T_N can be larger in more massive halos with M_h > 10 ^ 9 M_sun, if z_trun is as high as 15. We however find that the dependence is too weak to explain the observed S_N-M_V relation and the wide range of S_N in low-mass early-type galaxies with - 20. 5 < M_V < - 16. 0 mag for a reasonable constant M/L. The M_V-dependence of S_N for the low-mass galaxies can be well reproduced, if the <b>mass-to-light-ratio</b> M_h/L_V ∝ M_h^α, where α is as steep as - 1. Based on these results, we propose that the origin of the observed U-shaped S_N-M_V relation of GCSs can be understood in terms of the bimodality in the dependence of M_h/L_V on M_h of their host galaxies. We also suggest that the observed large dispersionin S_N in low-mass galaxies is due partly to the large dispersion in T_N. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures (two color), accepted by ApJ...|$|E
40|$|Massive galaxies at high-z have smaller {{effective}} radii {{than those}} today, but similar central densities. Their size growth therefore relates {{primarily to the}} evolving abundance of low-density material. Various models have been proposed to explain this evolution, which have different implications for galaxy, star, and BH formation. We compile observations of spheroid properties {{as a function of}} redshift and use them to test proposed models. Evolution in progenitor gas-richness with redshift gives rise to initial formation of smaller spheroids at high-z. These systems can then evolve in apparent or physical size via several channels: (1) equal-density 'dry' mergers, (2) later major or minor 'dry' mergers with less-dense galaxies, (3) adiabatic expansion, (4) evolution in stellar populations & <b>mass-to-light-ratio</b> gradients, (5) age-dependent bias in stellar mass estimators, (6) observational fitting/selection effects. If any one of these is tuned to explain observed size evolution, they make distinct predictions for evolution in other galaxy properties. Only model (2) is consistent with observations as a dominant effect. It is the only model which allows for an increase in M_BH/M_bulge with redshift. Still, the amount of merging needed is larger than that observed or predicted. We therefore compare cosmologically motivated simulations, in which all these effects occur, & show they are consistent with all the observational constraints. Effect (2), which builds up an extended low-density envelope, does dominate the evolution, but effects 1, 3, 4, & 6 each contribute ~ 20 % to the size evolution (a net factor ~ 2). This naturally also predicts evolution in M_BH-sigma similar to that observed. Comment: 19 pages, 7 figures. accepted to MNRAS (matches accepted version...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Clusters {{of galaxies}} allow a direct {{estimate}} of the metallicity and metal production yield on the largest scale so far. The ratio of the total iron mass in the ICM to the total optical luminosity of the cluster (the iron <b>mass-to-light-ratio)</b> {{is the same for}} all clusters which ICM is hotter than ∼ 2 keV, and the elemental proportions (i. e. the [α/Fe] ratio) appear to be solar. From these evidences it is argued that both the IMF as well the relative contributions of SN types are likely to be universal. Constraints on the past SN activity in galaxy clusters are then derived, and support is given to the notion that the average SNIa rate was much higher in the past, i. e. at least 10 times more than currently observed in local elliptical-s. It is also argued that cluster metallicity (∼ 1 / 3 solar) should be taken as representative of the low-z universe as a whole. There is now compelling evidence that the bulk of stars in cluster as well as in field ellipticals and bulges formed at high redshifts (z> ∼ 3). Since such stars account for at least ∼ 30 % of the baryons now locked into stars, it is argued that at least 30 % of stars and metals formed before z ≃ 3. As a consequence, the metallicity of the universe at z = 3 is predicted to be ∼ 1 / 10 solar. This requires the cosmic star formation rate to run at least flat from z ∼ 1 to ∼ 5, which appears to agree with the most recent direct determinations of the star formation rate in Lyman-break galaxies. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the stellar populations in a sample of 7000 galaxies from the 6 dF Galaxy Survey (6 dFGS). We derive ages and metallicities using stellar population models. We also derive dynamical masses and dynamical mass-to-light ratios by combining central velocity dispersions with global photometry in B, R and K bands. Together, these data allow to reduce the degeneracies between age, metallicity and star formation burst-strength that have limited previous studies. We find old galaxies exhibit a mass-metallicity relation with slope d[Fe/H]/dlogM = 0. 25, while young galaxies show slopes consistent with zero. When we account for the effects of the mass-metallicity relation, we obtain a single, consistent relation between mass-to-light ratio and mass for old galaxies in all passbands. As we have accounted for stellar population effects, this relation must have a dynamical origin. However, we demonstrate that any simple trend between <b>mass-to-light-ratio</b> and mass or luminosity is inconsistent with the observations, and that a more complex relationship must exist. We find the central regions of galaxies often exhibit young stellar populations. However {{it is only in the}} lowest-mass galaxies (10 ^ 10 M_) that these populations are evident in the global photometry. In higher-mass galaxies, young central populations have decreasing influence on the global photometry, with there being no discernible impact in galaxies more massive than 2 x 10 ^ 11 M_. We conclude that the young stellar populations detected in spectroscopic studies are generally centrally concentrated, and that there is an upper limit on the mass of star-forming events in massive galaxies. These results have ramifications for mass-to-light ratios estimated from photometric observations. Comment: 18 pages, Accepted form publication in MNRAS. Replaced after proofing modification...|$|E
40|$|By {{exploiting}} the database of early-type galaxies (ETGs) {{members of the}} WINGS survey of nearby clusters, we address here the long debated question of the origin {{and shape of the}} Fundamental Plane (FP). Our data suggest that different physical mechanisms concur in shaping and tilting the FP with respect to the virial plane (VP) expectation. In particular, an hybrid solution in which the structure of galaxies and their stellar population are the main contributors to the FP tilt seems to be favoured. We find that the bulk of the tilt should be attributed to structural non-homology, while stellar population effects play an important but less crucial role. Our data indicate that the differential FP tilt between the V and K-band is due to a sort of entanglement between structural and stellar population effects, for which the inward steepening of color profiles (V-K) tends to increase at increasing the stellar mass of ETGs. The same analysis applied to the ATLAS 3 D and SDSS data in common with WINGS (WSDSS throughout the paper) confirms our results, the only remarkable difference being the less important role of the stellar <b>mass-to-light-ratio</b> in determining the FP tilt. The ATLAS 3 D data also suggest that the tilt depends as well on the dark matter (DM) fraction and on the rotational contribution to the kinetic energy (Vrot/sigma). We show that the global properties of the FP can be understood in terms of the underlying correlation among mass, structure and stellar population of ETGs, for which, at increasing the stellar mass, ETGs become (on average) older and more centrally concentrated. Finally, we show that a Malmquist-like selection effect may mimic a differential evolution of the mass-to-light ratio for galaxies of different masses. This should be taken into account in the studies investigating the amount of the so called downsizing phenomenon. Comment: 22 pages, 17 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{positron}} annihilation gamma-ray signal in the Milky Way (MW) shows a puzzling morphology: a {{very bright}} bulge and a very low surface-brightness disk. A coherent explanation of the positron origin, propagation through the Galaxy and subsequent annihilation in the interstellar medium {{has not yet been}} found. Tentative explanations involve positrons from radioactivity, X-ray binaries, and dark matter (DM). Dwarf satellite galaxies (DSGs) are believed to be DM-dominated and hence promising candidates in the search for 511 keV emission as a result of DM annihilation into electron-positron pairs. The goal {{of this study is to}} constrain possible 511 keV gamma-ray signals from 39 DSGs of the MW and to test the annihilating DM scenario. We use the spectrometer SPI on INTEGRAL to extract individual spectra for the studied objects. As the diffuse galactic emission dominates the signal, the large scale morphology of the MW has been modelled accordingly and was included in a maximum likelihood analysis. Alternatively, a distance-weighted stacked spectrum has been determined. Only Reticulum II (Ret II) shows a 3. 1 sigma signal. Five other sources show tentative 2 sigma signals. The mass-to- 511 -keV-luminosity-ratio shows a marginal trend towards higher values for intrinsically brighter objects, opposite to the V band <b>mass-to-light-ratio,</b> which is generally used to uncover DM in DSGs. All derived flux values are above the level implied by a DM interpretation of the MW bulge signal. The signal from Ret II is unlikely to be related to a DM origin alone, otherwise, the MW bulge would be about 100 times brighter than what is seen. Ret II is exceptional considering the DSG sample, and rather points to enhanced recent star formation activity, if its origins are similar to processes in the MW. Understanding this emission may provide further clues regarding the origin of the annihilation emission in the MW. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, accepted by A&...|$|E
