In executing its mission as {{the architect of the}} future Army, the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) has used a heuristic capital allocation algorithm to recommend which candidate Army modernization actions to fund {{in the development of the}} Long Range Army <b>Materiel</b> Requirements <b>Plan</b> (LRAMRP). The goal of this thesis is to develop a flexible, responsive, multi-objective, optimization model to replace the existing heuristic capital allocation algorithm. This model maximizes potential warfighting benefits derived from competing Army candidate modernization actions subject to multiple national and Department of the Army goals and constraints. Additionally, this study demonstrates the fast prototyping capability of a weighted, goal programming approach to a multiple objective capital budgeting problem formulated with the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The model will be implemented by the Army's TRADOC Analysis Command (TRAC) Operations Analysis Center (OAC) as a tool in designing overall optimal Army investment strategies [...] Long Range Army <b>Materiel</b> Requirements <b>Plan</b> (LRAMRP), Multi-objective capital budgeting, Weighted linear goal programming, General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) Captain, United States Arm...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) is a tactical communications system which provides mobile field radio, telephone, and record traffic for the U. S. Army at corps and division levels. This system went from contract award to materiel fielding {{in a period}} of less than {{two and a half years}} through the utilization of nondevelopmental item (NDI) acquisition. The accelerated acquisition cycle presented many challenges to the successful deployment of this tactical communications system. This thesis examines the nontraditional methods of materiel fielding which were employed to address the challenges posed by the NDI acquisition of MSE. These nontraditional methods include contractor total package fielding, contractor developed and implemented training, and contractor logistic support. This thesis identifies the implications of these methods as a source of information for those elements of the acquisition community involved in <b>materiel</b> fielding <b>planning.</b> A significant lesson learned is that contractor total package fielding, training, and logistic support are viable alternatives for accomplishing materiel fielding for NDI systems[URL]...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Defense (DOD) positions equipment and supplies at strategic locations {{around the world to}} enable it to field combat-ready forces in days rather than the weeks it would take if equipment had to be moved from the United States to the location of a military conflict. However, sustained operations have taken a toll on the condition and readiness of military equipment. Over the last few years, we have identified a number of ongoing and long-term challenges regarding DOD's prepositioned stocks. The services have estimated the cost and time frame to replenish their stocks in DOD's annual report to Congress, and they review their prepositioning programs to address new requirements to meet future needs. DOD has reported to Congress that the services are committed to reconstituting prepositioned materiel but must balance these efforts with the department's other priorities, such as restructuring capabilities within its prepositioned stocks and changes in its overseas military presence. In 2011, we reported that DOD has limited departmentwide guidance that would help ensure that its prepositioning programs accurately reflect national military objectives and recommended that DOD develop overarching guidance related to prepositioned stocks. 2 DOD currently is developing a plan examining its prepositioning programs called the Comprehensive <b>Materiel</b> Response <b>Plan.</b> This effort is examining how to effectively and efficiently preposition stocks to enhance preparedness for a range of activities [...] such as major combat operations, security assistance, and humanitarian relief. DOD officials expect this review to be completed in the fall of 2011 and to provide additional guidance on its prepositioning programs. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 amended Title 10 of the United States Code to require DOD to submit annual reports to the congressional defense committees on the status of prepositioned materiel and equipment {{at the end of each}} fiscal year. DOD's reports are required to address the following six elements: 1. the level of fill for major end items 4 of equipment and spare parts in each prepositioned set at the end of the fiscal year covered by the report; 2. the material condition of equipment in the prepositioned stocks at the end of such fiscal year, grouped by category or major end item; 3. a list of major end items of equipment drawn from prepositioned stocks that fiscal year and a description of how the equipment was used and whether it was returned to the stocks after its use; 4. a time line for completely reconstituting any shortfall in the prepositioned stocks; 5. an estimate of the funding required to completely reconstitute any shortfall in the prepositioned stocks and a description of the Secretary's plan for carrying out the reconstitution; and 6. a list of any operation plans affected by a shortfall in the prepositioned stocks and a description of the action taken to mitigate any risk created by that shortfall. In March 2011, DOD issued its fiscal year 2010 report on the status of its prepositioned materiel and equipment from October 2009 to September 2010. 5 DOD's report includes an unclassified section to address reporting elements one through five and a classified annex to address reporting element six. The law also includes a reporting requirement that directs us to review the DOD report and submit to the congressional defense committees any additional information that will further inform the committees on the status of the materiel in prepositioned stocks. For this report, our objectives were to assess the extent to which DOD has (1) addressed the six reporting requirements in the fiscal year 2010 report to Congress on its prepositioned stocks, and whether additional information would be useful; and (2) implemented recommendations that we have made since 2005 regarding prepositioning efforts. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article {{examines}} cultural dynamics in the Neolithic of temperate Europe through {{a study of}} bone, antler and tooth artefacts from settlements and burials dating from Linear Pottery through to Michelsberg and Chasséen (VIth to IVth millennia BC). The artefacts, which include previously unpublished material, are examined together with evidence for animal breeding and hunting, {{with a view to}} considering the whole range of resources provided by animals, be they real or symbolic. As a result of this analysis, it is suggested here that while domestication {{is an integral part of}} society, hunting is transferred from the material to the ideological sphere. Use of resources from domestic animals becomes so important in economic terms that its impact can be seen in settlement architecture. At the same time, hunting becomes a socially valued and emblematic factor which eventually influences and transforms burial practices and probably also the underlying social structure. This phenomenum occurs over a wide area of western and central Europe and is undoubtedly an important factor in the development of the Neolithic. A fresh insight into the neolithisation process is thus offered, integrating different and previously unexploited data. The transfer of hunting from the real to the symbolic sphere is interpreted as resulting from the interaction of two entirely different cultural entities. To put it simply, one is a hunting culture with Mesolithic origins and the other an animal husbandry culture belonging to Neolithic settlers. Yet the situation is far more complex because Mesolithic people could have herded and Neolithic people actually did hunt. The interpretation proposed here is based to a large extent on evidence for changes in hunting practices, involving «‑specialized‑» hunting of red deer, an animal which was accorded a special status. It is suggested, as a working hypothesis, that the two cultural entities could have lived side by side with little métissage in Linear Pottery villages throughout the duration of this culture. They would have lived in houses of different sizes and each would have had specific meat diets. In fact the slight differences that are not easily detectable in the archaeological record reflect profound differences in food customs and way of life, which maintained a strong and long-lasting separation between these two contrasting entities. This cohabitation with almost no intermixing was replaced by a first episode of fusion towards the end of the Linear Pottery which reduced the vivacity of the Mesolithic component, while at the same time contributing to the downfall of the Linear Pottery Culture. True cultural or even «‑ethnic‑» métissage occurred and this altered Neolithic social and economic organization through the appropriation of certain hunter-gatherer values. From then on there followed cyclic episodes of fusion between the two kinds of culture, linked to the spatial expansion of the Neolithic, right up to its final stages. The origins of the «‑chalcolithisation‑» process may lie in one of the last, or perhaps the very last of these episodes. Mots-clés.

Cette étude est placée dans la perspective de la dynamique évolutive et culturelle générale du Néolithique du VI e au IV e millénaire avant J. -C. en Europe tempérée. L'examen de mobiliers osseux inédits, provenant d'habitats et de sépultures, combiné aux données de l'élevage et de la chasse, tente de cerner l'ensemble des ressources, matérielles comme idéelles, que l'exploitation animale fournit entre le Rubané, le Michelsberg et le Chasséen. Une fois structuré, cet ensemble de données conduit à observer un transfert de la sphère matérielle à l'idéel concernant la chasse, et ce à mesure que la société s'enracine dans la domestication. Autrement dit, l'économie se renforce dans l'exploitation des ressources animales domestiques de manière assez forte pour influencer l'architecture de l'habitat-; c'est du moins l'idée que défend cet article. En parallèle, la chasse devient un facteur emblématique et socialement valorisant qui, à son tour, influence les pratiques funéraires et, vraisemblablement aussi, ébranle les fondements de la structure sociale qui avait cours jusqu'alors. Ce transfert, qui se produit sur un vaste territoire, de l'ouest européen jusqu'aux confins de l'Europe centrale, possède indéniablement une certaine prégnance dans l'évolution du Néolithique de cette aire. Son origine sociologique paraît s'imposer, offrant matière à réviser le processus de la néolithisation grâce à des arguments tout à fait différents de ceux qui sont habituellement considérés pour ce sujet. Le recyclage de la pratique concrète de la chasse vers l'idéel est interprété comme le résultat de l'interaction de deux entités culturelles bien dissociées. En schématisant, l'une, ayant la culture de la chasse, serait d'origine mésolithique-; l'autre, ayant la culture des animaux domestiques, serait originaire des colons néolithiques. La situation est en fait bien plus compliquée car les «-Mésolithiques-» pratiqueraient l'élevage tandis que les «-Néolithiques-» chassent. L'interprétation proposée est fondée sur l'évolution de la pratique cynégétique et une certaine «-spécialisation-» de celle-ci sur une espèce donnée, le cerf, auquel est conféré un statut très particulier. Considérant ce nouvel argument, on aboutit à penser qu'une période de cohabitation sans mélange (ou très peu) entre les deux entités sociales serait possible tout au long du Rubané et au sein des villages de cette culture. Les deux entités en présence se manifesteraient en habitant des maisons de tailles différentes et en mangeant des viandes spécifiques. Ces différences, très subtiles sur le <b>plan</b> <b>matériel</b> et difficiles à détecter, masquent en fait des pratiques alimentaires et des habitus profondément différents, qui maintiennent une distinction sociale forte entre elles. La cohabitation presque sans mélange de ces deux entités sociales au cours du Rubané pourrait laisser la place à un premier épisode de fusion à la fin de cette culture-; cette hypothèse explicite la fin du Rubané qui est en même temps la fin de la vivacité de la composante mésolithique déjà intégrée dans les villages de cette culture. Un vrai mélange culturel sinon «-ethnique-» pourrait se produire ensuite au sein d'une organisation et d'une structure économique dans la logique du Néolithique tandis qu'il s'approprie certaines des valeurs sociales des chasseurs-cueilleurs. À partir de là, des épisodes de fusion cycliques entre ces deux cultures se succéderaient, liés à l'expansion territoriale du Néolithique. Ce phénomène possède encore vraisemblablement une suite jusque dans les dernières étapes du Néolithique. Le dernier de ces épisodes, ou parmi les derniers, pourrait être une des origines du processus de «-chalcolithisation-». Abstract.
