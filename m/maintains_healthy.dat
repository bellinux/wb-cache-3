50|$|No-dig methods allow {{nature to}} carry out {{cultivation}} operations. Organic matter such as well rotted manure, compost, leaf mold, spent mushroom compost, old straw, etc., is added directly to the soil surface as a mulch at least 5-15 centimeters (2-6 in) deep, which is then incorporated {{by the actions of}} worms, insects and microbes. Worms and other soil life also assist in building up the soil's structure, their tunnels providing aeration and drainage, and their excretions bind together soil crumbs. This natural biosphere <b>maintains</b> <b>healthy</b> conditions in the upper soil horizons where annual plant roots thrive. No-dig systems are said to be freer of pests and disease, possibly due to a more balanced soil population being allowed to build up in this undisturbed environment, and by encouraging the buildup of beneficial rather than harmful soil fungi. Moisture is also retained more efficiently under mulch than on the surface of bare earth, allowing slower percolation and less leaching of nutrients.|$|E

40|$|As {{it moves}} towards the new millennium, the Irish economy is {{impressive}} {{not only because}} of the extent/speed of the transformation and of its growth performance but also due to the fascinating effectiveness in implementing the Structural Funds programmes. In this respect, the article explores the role of the Structural Funds in Ireland within three separate themes: institutional and organisational aspects of EU funds; procedures and instruments associated with EU funds; interrelations of monitoring, evaluation and management of EU funds. Even though, not all aspects of the Irish experience are likely to be equally relevant to Central and Eastern European policy makers and analysts, it is important to learn the essentials of the Irish case. Presumably one of the most important lessons, considering the new challenges of the Central and Eastern European Countries, is that the active structural policy pursued was decisively coupled with sound macroeconomic policies. Thus, Ireland demonstrates today what can be achieved if Structural Funds assistance is integrated into a coherent domestic policy which, in particular, <b>maintains</b> <b>healthy</b> macroeconomic conditions and which is supported by social consensus...|$|E

40|$|Adipose tissue (AT) {{expansion}} and remodeling that <b>maintains</b> <b>healthy</b> function relies on stromal preadipocytes capable of differentiating into new adipocytes (adipogenesis). During chronic positive energy balance, a relative deficit in adipogenesis, from either {{a decrease in}} preadipocyte number or their capacity to differentiate, leads to excessive adipocyte hypertrophy and AT dysfunction. AT contains macrophages whose number and activation state is dynamically regulated with changes in AT mass. This study aims to investigate the effect of macrophage-secreted factors on preadipocyte survival. To assess the effect of macrophage-secreted factors on preadipocytes, murine 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes or human primary preadipocytes were incubated with macrophage-conditioned medium (MacCM), prepared from either murine (J 774 A. 1, RAW 264. 7, bone marrow-derived) or human (THP- 1, monocyte-derived) macrophage models, respectively. MacCM inhibited preadipocyte apoptosis and activated pro-survival signaling in both preadipocyte models. Inhibition of PDGFR, Akt, or ERK 1 / 2 reduced the pro-survival effect of MacCM in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes. Inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, or enhancement of ROS clearance, reduced MacCM-dependent 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocyte survival. Whereas anti-inflammatory activated macrophages retained the ability to prevent preadipocyte apoptosis, pro-inflammatory activated macrophages did not. TNF-α immunoneutralization restored the survival activity of pro-inflammatory MacCM on 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes. These studies reveal a novel pro-survival effect of MacCM on preadipocytes, and identify signaling molecules (PDGF, Akt, ERK 1 / 2, and ROS) that underlie this action. Macrophage activation was found to regulate the pro-survival activity of MacCM. These in vitro cell culture studies are consistent with a model in which the extent of preadipocyte apoptosis in vivo may determine preadipocyte number {{and the ability of}} AT to expand while maintaining healthy function during chronic positive energy balance...|$|E

Its main themes include: maintaining ecological integrity, matching ecological and governance boundaries, and recognizing humans as a part of the ecosystem. Using ecosystem approaches to management offers several benefits to fisheries managers, including: a tool to address non-fishing related causes for declining fisheries, such as the dams in the Pacific Northwest that have endangered most salmon runs; an opportunity to re-furbish an aging management system; and a method for setting management and conservation priorities. Some of these benefits are not applicable to pelagic fisheries. However a large number of issues currently facing the yellowfin and bigeye fisheries can be addressed with EBM. These include: the overfishing of stocks, the definition of stock boundaries, the unintentional capture of non-target species, the contamination of tuna with mercury, and the flexibility of fishermen in response to regulation. Because of these benefits, and in light of the fact that fisheries managers are clearly moving toward using EBM (Kalo et al. 2002, EPAP 1998, POC 2003, USCOP 2004, WPRFMC 2005), I found that EBM is worth pursuing in pelagic fisheries in the future, despite the challenges mangers will face when implementing it...|$|E

Nektonic utilization of the upper Houston Ship Channel (HSC) was assessed through characterization of species composition, abundance and community structure of finfish and macroinvertebrate populations. Impact of basic water quality trends on utilization was evaluated. seine, gillnet and revolving screen collections from two deep-water and six shoreline sampling stations in upper HSC stream segments 1006 (downstream) and 1007 (upstream) during May 1988 through July 1989 yielded 33, 042 nektonic organisms comprising 84 taxa. Spatial and temporal trends in catch statistics, species diversity, and hydrological variables were assessed for each sampling gear type. Seasonal composition by dominant taxa was determined and effect of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen on catch statistics examined. Mean surface (shoreline) water temperature and dissolved oxygen levels were similar between segments and followed expected seasonal trends. Mean bottom dissolved oxygen levels in segment 1007 during May through September were consistently 1 to 1. 5 mg/l lower than segment 1006 and exhibited hypoxic conditions. Significantly greater catch and biomass were observed in segment 1007 as compared to those of segment 1006. Species diversity and number of taxa were comparable between segments. Distinct reductions in catch, number of taxa and species diversity characterized winter seine collections in segment 1006. Surface water temperatures appeared to exert the greatest hydrological influence on shoreline catch statistics. Revolving screen catches were greatest in Segment 1007 during November through March when bottom dissolved oxygen levels peaked and water temperatures ebbed. Significantly reduced catches in segment 1007 during May through October coincided with highest water temperatures and near-anoxic dissolved oxygen levels. By contrast, catch statistics from segment 1006 were highest during summer and early fall when mean bottom temperature and dissolved oxygen levels were highest and lowest, respectively. Cumulative number of taxa was highest in both segments during winter. HSC segment 1006 <b>maintains</b> <b>healthy</b> shoreline and bottom nekton communities year-round. Low dissolved oxygen in bottom waters restrict nekton utilization of segment 1007 during summer. Richness and abundance in segment 1007 during winter equaled or exceeded that of segment 1006...|$|E

40|$|The {{long term}} goal of my thesis {{research}} is to understand how tissue-specific phosphorylations on the small mitochondrial protein, cytochrome c (Cytc), regulate its functions, under both physiologically healthy and stressed conditions, and to identify the cell signaling pathways targeting Cytc. Cytc is a functionally diverse protein that carries electrons in the electron transport chain and plays {{a critical role in}} cellular apoptosis, two diverse pathways that maintain cellular health that are active under diverse conditions. Since Cytc plays a pivotal role in both these highly divergent pathways, regulation of the protein is very important—phosphorylation of the protein under physiological conditions hence implies a regulation by cell signaling pathways that have yet to be identified and studied. Previous work by our lab suggests the importance of reversible phosphorylation of Cytc in regulating its functions 1 - 4. We hypothesize that under healthy conditions, phosphorylated Cytc partially inhibits mitochondrial respiration and <b>maintains</b> <b>healthy</b> mitochondrial membrane potential, preventing ROS generation, while cellular stress- mediated dephosphorylation leads to increased respiration and ROS generation, initiating apoptosis. To further test this hypothesis and to extend our understanding of Cytc phosphorylation on its functions, I conducted two studies. In the first study, I investigated the physiological phosphorylation status of Cytc in mammalian kidney tissues. To begin with, I purified bovine kidney Cytc in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, identified threonine phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis, and determined threonine 28 1 phosphorylation by immobilized metal affinity chromatography/nano-liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Nano/LC/ESI/MS/MS). To characterize the effect of Thr 28 phosphorylation on Cytc functions, I mutated Thr 28 to glutamate, a phosphomimetic mutation, and alanine, a nonphosphorylatable control. I went on to express and purify wild-type, the phosphomimetic mutant and the non- phosphorylatable mutant Cytc in bacterial cells. I also expressed and analyzed wild-type, the phosphomimetic mutant and the nonphosphorylatable mutant Cytc in mammalian cells {{to determine the effects of}} the Cytc mutations on the functions of the protein in vitro and on overall cellular metabolism and physiology, under healthy and stressed conditions. I also found that Thr 28 phosphorylation is AMP kinase-mediated, and AMP kinase colocalizes with Cytc to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Our data suggest that Thr 28, conserved in mammalian Cytc, is an important regulatory site that leads to regulation of ETC flux via ‘controlled respiration,’ preventing  m hyperpolarization, a known cause of ROS and trigger of apoptosis (discussed in Chapter 2, manuscript under preparation). In the second study, the phosphorylation status of Cytc in ischemic brain was investigated to determine if insulin-induced neuroprotection and inhibition of Cytc release in ischemic brain was associated with Cytc phosphorylation. We used an animal model of global brain ischemia, and found a 50 % decreased death rate of CA 1 hippocampal neurons after neuroprotective post-ischemic insulin administration as compared to untreated controls. The increased survival of CA 1 neurons was correlated to inhibition of Cytc release from mitochondria into cytosol 24 hours post reperfusion, which in turn was mediated by Cytc phosphorylation on Tyr 97. We thus propose that Cytc is phosphorylated by an insulin-dependent signaling pathway, and this may impede with 2 its release from mitochondria and its ability to induce apoptosis (discussed in Chapter 3, manuscript published in PLoS One, 2013 8 (11) :e 78627) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{process of}} {{initiating}} and <b>maintaining</b> <b>healthy</b> lifestyle behaviours is complex, includes {{a number of}} distinct phases and is not static. Theoretical models of behaviour change consider psychological constructs such as intention and self efficacy but do not clearly consider the role of stress or psychological distress. General practice based interventions addressing lifestyle behaviours have been demonstrated to be feasible and effective however {{it is not clear}} whether general practitioners (GPs) take psychological health into consideration when discussing lifestyle behaviours. This qualitative study explores GPs' and patients' perspectives about the relationship between external stressors, psychological distress and <b>maintaining</b> <b>healthy</b> lifestyle behaviours. Methods. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 16 patients and 5 GPs. Transcripts from the interviews were thematically analysed and a conceptual model developed to explain the relationship between external stressors, psychological distress and healthly lifestyle behaviours. Results: Participants were motivated to <b>maintain</b> a <b>healthy</b> lifestyle however they described a range of external factors that impacted on behaviour in both positive and negative ways, either directly or via their impact on psychological distress. The impact of external factors was moderated by coping strategies, beliefs, habits and social support. In some cases the process of changing or <b>maintaining</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviour also caused distress. The concept of a threshold level of distress was evident in the data with patients and GPs describing a certain level of distress required before it negatively influenced behaviour. Conclusion: <b>Maintaining</b> <b>healthy</b> lifestyle behaviours is complex and constantly under challenge from external stressors. Practitioners can assist patients with <b>maintaining</b> <b>healthy</b> behaviour by providing targeted support to moderate the impact of external stressors. © 2013 McKenzie and Harris; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
