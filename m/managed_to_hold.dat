The garrison at Dyrrhachium <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out all summer, despite Robert's catapults, ballistae and siege tower. The garrison made continuous sallies from the city; on one occasion, Palaiologos fought {{all day with}} an arrowhead in his skull. Another sally succeeded in destroying Robert's siege tower.|$|E

Although initially some progress was made, the Germans <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> Orsonga throughout December amidst intense hand-to-hand fighting. Finally, the Māoris were {{withdrawn from the}} line {{on the night of}} 15/16 January 1944 when they were relieved by an Indian unit.

It was a successful day for the division; it had captured the most ground of all the divisions of XV Corps involved in the battle. It had also reached all four of its objectives although it ended the day in possession of three plus Flers itself, which was actually in 41st Division's sector.|$|E

Ibrahim sent 1,500 men to attempt a landing near Areopolis and go north to threaten the Maniot rear. This force was initially successful; however they were repelled with heavy losses.

5|$|The {{industrial}} coal city of Lens, France {{had fallen}} under German control in October 1914 during the Race to the Sea. Consequently, the Germans also controlled the heights at Hill 70 {{to the north}} of the city and Sallaumines Hill to the southeast, both of which had commanding views over the surrounding area as well as the city itself. Hill 70 was a treeless expanse at the end of one of the many spurs.

The successful assault forced Charlie Company to retreat into Yudam-ni which left Fox Company trapped in Toktong Pass, a vital pass that controlled the road. On 29 November, several efforts by the 7th Marines failed to rescue Fox Company despite inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. Aided by artillery from Hagaru-ri and Marine Corsair fighters, Fox Company <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out for five days while enduring constant attacks by the PVA 59th Division.|$|E
5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was {{narrowed to}} a {{distance}} of several hundred yards, attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> off counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket.|$|E

In the morning of 25 July, further casualties were sustained by German artillery. German infantry then launched a counterattack on the battalion's right, but the Australians <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their ground. They remained in the line throughout the day, before the 19th Battalion arrived {{as part of the}} 5th Brigade's relief of the 3rd Brigade. Having lost 19 officers and 512 other ranks killed, wounded or missing, the battalion had suffered the most of all the 3rd Brigade's battalions and was moved back to Berteaucourt to be rebuilt.|$|E

The ensuing Battle of Hill Eerie was {{one of a series of}} larger attacks by Chinese and North Korean forces which produced heavier fighting than the previous year had seen. These offensives were conducted largely in order to secure a better position during the ongoing truce negotiations. Chinese forces continued to mount concentrated attacks on the lines of the UN forces, including the 45th Infantry Division, but the division <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> most of its ground, remaining stationary until the end of the war in the summer of 1953.|$|E
5|$|The {{additional}} artillery units {{immediately went}} to work hampering German consolidation, by shelling their front and support lines and seeking out hostile batteries. The Germans sprung a surprise on the Canadians by exploding four large mines under trenches of the 2nd Canadian Division covering the spur at the eastern outskirts of the ruins of Hooge and a company of the Canadian 28th (North West) Battalion was wiped out in the explosions. The Canadians <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their position and prevent the Germans from reaching their support line but Byng ultimately {{decided to leave the}} Hooge trenches in German hands and to concentrate on regaining Mount Sorrel and Tor Top. To dissuade the Germans from more attacks on the left flank of the Canadian Corps, the dismounted British 2nd Cavalry Brigade came on loan to the Canadian Corps as a counter-attack force.|$|E
