25|$|In 1976 the Luxury and Regency {{editions of}} the {{full-size}} 98s were offered, in 2-door coupes or 4-door hardtops. 4-doors had an extra window (like an opera window) in the C-pillar. A landau roof option for the coupe gave it a huge-looking opera window. Like the Custom Cruiser, 98s had a dual section eggcrate-design grille, with new front end panel, front bumper, and wraparound horizontal parking lamps. Amber marker lenses aligned with the headlamps wrapped around the fender sides. Separate clear cornering lamps had horizontal ribs. Vertical tailamps were decorated with a small emblem in each lens. Tiny back-up lamps stood alongside the license plate, on a panel that also contained small red lenses next to the tailamps. Standard 98 equipment included a 455 CID Rocket V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, Turbo-Hydramatic, vari-ratio power steering, power brakes, power driver's seat, driver's door armrest control console, electronic <b>message</b> <b>center,</b> electric clock, fold-down center armrests, front ashtray, and JR78 x 15 blackwall steel-belted radials. Rear fender skirts and bumper impact strips were also standard. A new 2.41:1 axle ratio became standard to improve fuel economy.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 January, the Japanese-held Clark Field was {{attacked}} by the squadron. After being captured in 1942, Clark Field became the main Japanese air base in the Philippines. [...] That day, four Air Commando P-51D Mustangs caught a group of enemy aircraft on the parking ramp, with their propellers turning over slowly. Four Nakajima Ki-44s were struck by a 500-pound bomb and were destroyed. Five more enemy fighters were destroyed in strafing runs, and no squadron aircraft were damaged. The same day on Negros Island, other 3d Fighter Squadron Mustangs discovered some camouflaged enemy aircraft on a landing strip. [...] They were also obliterated by strafing fire, but one Mustang was hit by 20-mm antiaircraft fire {{and was forced to}} bail out over the sea. [...] The pilot, Capt. Charles B. Adams, was picked up safely by a Consolidated PBY Catalina the next day and he was returned to the squadron. Shortly afterwards, the squadron moved up from Leyte to Lingayen Airfield on Luzon. The squadron's last mission from Tanaunan hit Baguio, the prewar summer capital of the Philippine Government. [...] It had become the Japanese Commander in the Philippines, General Yamashita's headquarters. Sixteen Mustangs, along with Consolidated B-24 Liberators from the 22d Bombardment Group attacked the Headquarters. [...] The target was obliterated with direct hits on administration buildings, the <b>message</b> <b>center,</b> warehouses, barracks and officer's quarters.|$|E
2500|$|A graphic {{account of}} some of the vicissitudes of the Argosy Lemal and its mixed crew came from S/Sgt. Arthur B. Dunning, Headquarters Company, 60th Signal Battalion. He and six other enlisted men of that unit were ordered aboard her on 9 September 1943, at Oro Bay, New Guinea, to handle Army radio traffic. The {{commander}} of the ship reported to naval authorities, not to General Akin. After six months' service along the New Guinea coast, the skipper was removed for incompetence. His replacement was no better. Among other things, he obeyed to the letter Navy's order forbidding the use of unshielded radio receivers at sea. Since the Signal Corps receivers aboard the ship were unshielded and thus liable to radiate sufficiently to alert nearby enemy listeners, the men were forbidden to switch them on in order to hear orders from Army headquarters ashore. As a consequence, during a trip in the spring of 1944 from Milne Bay to Cairns, Australia (on naval orders), the crew failed to hear frantic Signal Corps radio messages to the Argosy Lemal ordering her to return at once to Milne Bay to make ready for a forthcoming Army operation. On the way to Australia the skipper, after a series of mishaps attributable to bad navigation, grounded the Argosy hard on a reef. Most of the crew already desperately ill of tropical diseases, now had additional worries. The radio antennas were swept away along with the ship's rigging, and help could not be requested until the Signal Corps men strung up a makeshift antenna. Weak with fevers and in a ship on the verge of foundering, they pumped away at the water rising in the hold and wondered why rescue was delayed till they learned that the position of the ship that the skipper had given them to broadcast was ninety miles off their true position. As they threw excess cargo overboard, [...] "some of the guys," [...] recorded Dunning, [...] "were all for jettisoning our skipper for getting us into all of this mess." [...] Much later, too late for the need the Signal Corps had for the ship, the Argosy Lemal was rescued and towed to Port Moresby for repairs to the vessel and medical attention to the crew, many of whom were by then, according to Dunning, [...] "psycho-neurotic." [...] Besides Dunning, a radio operator, there were T/4 Jack Stanton, also a radio operator; T/Sgt. Harold Wooten, the senior non-commissioned officer; T/4 Finch and T/5 Burtness, maintenance men; and T/5 Ingram and Pfc. Devlin, code and <b>message</b> <b>center</b> clerks. Dunning described the Argosy as a 3-mast sailing vessel with a 110-horsepower auxiliary diesel engine. [...] "She was the sixth vessel," [...] he wrote, [...] "to be taken over by the Small Ships Section of the U.S. Army, her primary purpose was handling [...] traffic between forward areas and the main USASOS headquarters." ...|$|E
