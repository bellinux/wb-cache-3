5|$|A Project Leader {{is elected}} once per {{year by the}} developers. The leader has special powers, {{but they are not}} absolute, and {{appoints}} delegates to perform specialized tasks. Delegates make decisions as they think is best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> the leader, reverse a decision made by the leader or a delegate, amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions. The voting method is based on the Schulze method (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).|$|E
5|$|The Government is {{responsible}} to the Croatian Parliament; the parliament <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> the Government as a whole or {{any member of the}} Government in particular by an absolute majority vote (majority of all MPs) following a request for a confidence vote by one fifth of the parliament members or by the prime minister. The prime minister {{and other members of the}} Government are jointly responsible for decisions passed by the Government and individually responsible for their respective portfolios (areas of responsibility). The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister, who must then secure a vote of confidence from the Croatian Parliament (majority of all MPs); the appointment is therefore counter-signed by the speaker of the parliament to signify this. Appointments of members of the Government are done by the prime minister with the approval of the Croatian Parliament (again signified via a counter-signature by the speaker of the parliament). The rules of procedure and regulations enacted by the Government must be published in Narodne Novine—the official gazette of Croatia—to be binding.|$|E

500|$|Neuromancer {{was written}} on a [...] "clockwork typewriter," [...] the very one you <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates {{from somewhere in the}} 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs {{slightly}} less than the Macintosh SE/30 I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black [...] "crackle" [...] paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 {{was one of the best}} portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.|$|E

It's not premeditated and it certainly can't be condoned." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{different}} schemes for reissuing license plates, {{a process known}} as [...] "replating". In some jurisdictions, plates are issued on a permanent basis and are not replaced unless the owner requests a new plate or a remake of the current plate. Other jurisdictions re-plate on a rolling basis, replacing a particular motorist's plate when it reaches a certain age. Still other jurisdictions <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> a particular series of plates for reissuance at regular or irregular intervals. This is particularly common in jurisdictions in which only one license plate series or design is valid at any given time. Optional-issue plates may or may not follow the same rules for replacement as standard-issue plates, depending on the jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|Michigan is, by tradition, {{known as}} [...] "The Wolverine State," [...] and the University of Michigan takes the {{wolverine}} as its mascot.

2500|$|Ashley Montagu claimed [...] "the {{skeleton}} {{of the classic}} Mongoloid type is very delicately made, even down {{to the character of}} the sutures of the skull which, like those of the infant skull, are relatively smooth and untortuous. In fact the Mongoloid presents so many physical traits which are associated with the late fetus or young infant that he has been called a fetalized, infantilized or pedomorphic type. Those who have carefully observed young babies <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> that the root of the nose is frequently flat or low as in Mongoloids, and that an internal epicanthic fold in such instances is usually present. The smaller number of individual head hairs and the marked hairlessness of the remainder of the body are infantile traits, as are likewise the small mastoid processes, the shallow fossa into which the jawbone fits (the mandibular fossa), the rather stocky build, the large brain-pan and brain, lack of brow ridges, and quite a number of other characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams's work is {{identified}} with the noir fiction subgenre of [...] "hardboiled" [...] crime writing. His 1953 novel Hell Hath No Fury—- published by the defining pulp crime fiction company, Gold Medal Books—- was the first paperback original to merit a review from renowned critic Anthony Boucher of The New York Times. Boucher relates Williams {{to two of the}} most famous noir fiction writers: [...] "The striking suspense technique...may remind you of [...] Woolrich; the basic story, with its bitter blend of sex and criminality, <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> James M. Cain. But Mr. Williams is individually himself in his sharp but unmannered prose style and in his refusal to indulge in sentimental compromises." [...] Ed Gorman's description of a characteristic Williams novel, Man on the Run (1958), outlines the essential elements that associate it with the noir fiction category: [...] "a) a falsely accused man trying to elude police, b) a lonely woman as desperate in her way as the man on the run, c) enough atmospherics (night, rain, fog) to enshroud a hundred films noir." [...] Cultural critic Geoffrey O'Brien further details Williams's [...] "chief characteristics": ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{interesting}} perspective {{can be seen}} on one of {{the most}} dramatic days in the history of network radio. [...] On the morning/afternoon of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, while the first attack wave was over Oahu, NBC Blue was broadcasting The Inspector General, as part of its Great Plays program, while NBC Red was broadcasting a program with popular bandleader Sammy Kaye. [...] At 4 p.m., ET, the Blue's broadcasts of the National Vespers was interrupted by various news reports. [...] Later on in the evening, at 6:30p.m. and 6:45p.m., Drew Pearson's and Eleanor Roosevelt's regular broadcasts are heard, followed at 7 p.m. by a news roundup show that competed with Jack Benny, and later on Bible Week opposite the Chase and Sanborn Hour with Edgar Bergen. [...] (The Blue did have the popular Inner Sanctum mystery anthology series later that night at 8:30, followed in turn by its number one show with Walter Winchell.) [...] Lastly, of interest to those who <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> the satiric references in Warner Bros. cartoons of the era, at 10 p.m., the Blue carried The Goodwill Hour with John J. Anthony, dispensing advice to those who sought it, and who presumably were not tuned into Phil Spitalny's orchestra on the Red network.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Reynolds {{played for}} Stanford's {{freshman}} football team. The team included Reynolds, Bobby Grayson, Monk Moscrip and Bones Hamilton, {{and came to}} be known as the [...] "Vow Boys." [...] The 1932 Stanford varsity team was soundly defeated by the USC Trojans. After watching the defeat, the freshmen players got together and vowed that they would never lose to the Trojans. [...] The Stanford team proceeded to beat USC three straight years from 1933–1935 — making good on the vow. Stanford was the dominant team on the Pacific Coast, appearing in the New Year's Day Rose Bowl game in each of those three years. Reynolds established a record that has never been matched by playing in every minute of three consecutive Rose Bowl games. In each of those games, Reynold played all 60 minutes on offense and defense without substitution. [...] Two years after Reynolds completed the feat, Los Angeles Times sports columnist Braven Dyer wrote:"A young man arrived in town yesterday enjoying perhaps the most unique distinction in the history of the Tournament of Roses football. He is the only athlete who ever played through three consecutive Rose Bowl games without substitution. His name is Bob Reynolds. You <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> him as 'Horse' Reynolds. … Reynolds left the field that afternoon with no fanfare or trumpets but on January 1, 1936, he set a record which may never be equalled in this annual classic. He was never removed for a substitute durying any of the three games." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Golden Bough, J.G. Frazer {{interpreted}} {{an incident}} from the Acts of Saint Dasius, an early martyrological text, as indicative of human sacrifice {{in connection with}} the Saturnalia. Dasius was a Christian soldier who refused to play the part of the King of the Saturnalia when it was allotted to him, and for his refusal was killed. From this anecdote, Frazer surmises that the King of the Saturnalia was originally a scapegoat victim who was killed as a human sacrifice to Saturn {{at the end of his}} festival. Since the role of the [...] "king" [...] is not attested before the Imperial period, this interpretation is not generally accepted by modern specialists of Roman religion. The martyrdom of Dasius took place at Durostorum in the province of Moesia Inferior on 20 November 303 AD, the anniversary of Diocletian's accession as emperor (dies imperii) and nearly a month before the date of the communal sacrifice for the Saturnalia (December 17). The execution occurred more broadly in the context of general harassment of Christians in the Roman military during the Diocletianic Persecution, the edict for which had been issued in February of that year, and only after Dasius refused to venerate Imperial icons. K.M. Coleman regards the martyrdom of Dasius as an enactment of scapegoat ritual, but likens it to the ritualized executions that took place as mythological scenarios in the arena, with the costuming and role of the Christian meant to enhance the purposes of retributive justice and the restoration of the pax deorum. As an element of martyr narrative, the torture of the mock [...] "king" [...] <b>may</b> <b>recall</b> the mocking of Jesus of Nazareth by Roman soldiers in the Gospels of Mark and Matthew.|$|E
