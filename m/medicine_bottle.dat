5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E
5|$|Mark's ex-girlfriend, Lana Turnboldt, has {{a picnic}} with her fiancé at the secluded {{place in the}} mountains, where they {{discover}} Mr. Griffin's <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle.</b> The police investigate, and find Mr. Griffin's body buried nearby. However, police do not find the ring Mr. Griffin was wearing when he died as David had taken it. Irma Ruggles, David's paternal grandmother who lives with him, discovers the ring and refuses {{to give it back}} to him, believing the ring to be that of David's father who had left him. David tells Susan he took the ring and his grandmother found it, but they are unsuccessful at retrieving it from her, so Susan tells Mark about the situation because she feels he would know what to do. Irma Ruggles is later murdered, and a neighbor refers to the suspect as a boy in a brown sweater. Susan makes the connection, knowing that Mark has a brown sweater he wears all the time, and that Mark would stop at nothing to get what he needed – in this case, the ring.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into a <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall {{to the bottom of the}} playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E
50|$|Liquid <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> are {{not quite}} as distinctive, but feature a spill proof cap coupled with a dosing syringe that is claimed to be more {{accurate}} than spoon dispensing. The liquid <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> also feature the color-coded ring around the neck.|$|R

25|$|Patients {{with early}} Parkinson's disease suffer {{a large enough}} amount of {{prospective}} memory impairment to be affected in everyday life. These patients show impairment {{in the use of}} internal attentional strategies which are required for intention retrieval. Parkinson's disease leads to poorer performance on time-based but not event-based prospective memory tasks. For example, patients may forget to take medication at certain times of the day, but forgetting is less likely if they see the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle.</b>|$|E
25|$|Medication Event Monitoring Systems, in {{the form}} of smart <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> tops, smart {{pharmacy}} vials (or smart blister packages are frequently used in clinical trials and other applications where exact compliance data are required. Such systems usually work without any patient input, and record the time and date the bottle or vial was accessed, or the medication removed from a blister package. The data can be read via proprietary readers, or NFC enabled devices, such as smartphones or tablets. There is evidence that the use of such devices can help improve adherence.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Hardy, {{whistling}} softly, {{rose and}} walked round the room, uncorking <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> and sniffing at their contents. A smile of unaffected pleasure lit up his features as {{he removed the}} stopper from one particularly pungent mixture.|$|R
2500|$|Improvised slides are common, {{including}} pipes, rings, spoons, {{and even}} stones. Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett {{was fond of}} using a Zippo lighter as a slide, but this was largely for special effects. [...] Glass bottles, such as beer bottles, are common, and Duane Allman (Derek and the Dominos, Allman Brothers Band) used a glass Coricidin <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle.</b> Blues guitarist CeDell Davis used a butterknife.|$|E

50|$|Less common colours include jade, amber (from <b>bottles</b> for whiskey, <b>medicine,</b> spirits, {{and early}} bleach bottles), golden amber or amberina (mostly used for spirit bottles), lime green (from soda bottles during the 1960s), forest green, and ice- or soft blue (from soda <b>bottles,</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles,</b> ink bottles, and fruit jars {{from the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, windows, and windshields). These colors are found about once for every 25 to 100 pieces of sea glass found.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} concisely. He {{nodded to the}} {{paragraphs}} of my narrative {{and at the end}} he poured something from a <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> into a sticky little wineglass and drank it. I became aware of the presence of drugs, of three or four small bottles before him among his disorder of papers, of a faint elusively familiar odour in the room.|$|E

60|$|Bailey thought {{swiftly and}} {{clutched}} a <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> in either hand. One he flung, and it smashed against the acacia. Silently and deliberately, and keeping his bright {{eyes fixed on}} Bailey, the Malay clambered into the balcony. Bailey, still clutching his second bottle, but with a sickening, sinking feeling about his heart, watched first one leg come over the railing and then the other.|$|E
60|$|Again we {{proceeded}} {{to a third}} mortuary, if it may so be called, and here Maqueda pointed out the skeleton of a man, in front of which stood a tray piled up with what evidently had been the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> of the period and among them a number of rude surgical instruments.|$|R

60|$|He looked curiously {{round the}} room. It {{was not a}} bad bedroom, light and warm. There were many <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> {{aggregated}} {{in a corner of}} the washstand--and a bottle of Three Star brandy, half full. And there were also photographs of strange people on the chest of drawers. It was not a bad room.|$|R
6000|$|... "My brain's not {{so clear}} {{as it used}} to be. No use hiding things. Why," [...] began Savine, and Geoffrey, who surmised that he had not seen his daughter, knocked over a <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> with his elbow and spent some time noisily groping under the table for it. The action might have deceived one of his own sex, but Helen, who {{wondered}} what his motive was, grew piqued as well as curious.|$|E
60|$|They are {{practically}} unanimous in their account of Plattner's proceedings. He poured {{a little of}} the green powder into a test-tube, and tried the substance with water, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and sulphuric acid in succession. Getting no result, he emptied out a little heap--nearly half the bottleful, in fact--upon a slate and tried a match. He held the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> in his left hand. The stuff began to smoke and melt, and then exploded with deafening violence and a blinding flash.|$|E
6000|$|He {{thought her}} an unpleasant, morbid girl, but [...] "that is no affair of mine," [...] he said shrugging his shoulders, {{and he gave}} her the bottle to deliver. Before taking it to Ballingall's, however, she {{committed}} a little crime. She bought an empty bottle at the 'Sosh, and poured into it some of the contents of the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle,</b> which she then filled up with water. She dared try no other way now of getting medicine for her mother, and was too ignorant to know that there are different drugs for different ailments.|$|E
5000|$|The great {{majority}} of the company's production was in the form of glass bottles, many of which were beer bottles, milk bottles, and a large number of glass <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> in a variety of standard sizes.

60|$|Gerald nodded silently. They {{passed along}} the corridor. The {{door of the}} room which Mr. Dunster had {{occupied}} was ajar. As though by common consent, they both stopped and looked in. The windows were all wide open, the bed freshly made. The nurse was busy collecting some <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> and fragments of lint. She looked at them in surprise.|$|R
60|$|And {{seeing him}} {{so anxious to}} begin she made no further objection, contenting herself with giving him a draught from his <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle.</b> She had already told him Fan's story, and he had heard it with some interest. He congratulated the girl on having found a brother in his old school-fellow, Arthur Eden, and took some merit to himself for having brought them together. But he {{did not make the}} remark that truth was {{stranger}} than fiction. It was evident that he was impatient to get to other more important matters.|$|E
60|$|Yes, you {{are lucky}} to have a bag that holds you comfortably. Mine is a strange contrivance; I don't die, damme, and I can't get along on both feet to save my soul; I am a chronic sickist; and my work cripples along between bed and the parlour, between the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle</b> and the cupping glass. Well, I like my life all the same; and should like it none the worse if I could have another talk with you, though even my talks now are {{measured}} out to me by the minute hand like poisons in a minim glass.|$|E
60|$|A polychromatic rug {{like some}} brilliant-flowered rectangular, {{tropical}} islet lay {{surrounded by a}} billowy sea of soiled matting. Upon the gay-papered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from house to house--The Huguenot Lovers, The First Quarrel, The Wedding Breakfast, Psyche at the Fountain. The mantel's chastely severe outline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew like the sashes of the Amazonian ballet. Upon it was some desolate flotsam cast aside by the room's marooned when a lucky sail had borne them to a fresh port--a trifling vase or two, pictures of actresses, a <b>medicine</b> <b>bottle,</b> some stray cards out of a deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three weeks ago!" [...] He looked wonderingly around--at {{the little}} table at his side, where a huge bowl of sweet-scented roses was {{surrounded}} by a little army of empty <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles,</b> at Margharita's pale, wan face, and at a couch drawn up to the bedside. [...] "And you have been nursing me all the time?" [...] he whispered.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after it}} was created 'parachlorometaxylenol' was then called 'PCMX', but this {{was thought to be}} a horrible name and it was renamed 'Dettol' Then in 1930s it was marketed in England, and then in 1932 in India.

6000|$|Mrs Wickam, as {{a serious}} character, {{expressed}} her approval with a groan; and having made some cold dabs {{at the bottom of}} the bedclothes, as feeling for the patient's feet and expecting to find them stony; went clinking among the <b>medicine</b> <b>bottles</b> on the table, as who should say, 'while we are here, let us repeat the mixture as before.' ...|$|R
