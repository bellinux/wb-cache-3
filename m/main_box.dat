2500|$|The Board {{eventually}} {{decided that}} the post of [...] "Director" [...] (instituted in 1992 in lieu of [...] "Fringe Administrator") would be abolished and replaced by a Chief Executive, to reinforce the Fringe head's basic administrative function. A report into the failure was commissioned from accountancy firm Scott-Moncrieff. Several venues now use their own ticketing systems; this {{is partly due to}} issues of commissions and how ticket revenue is distributed, but was reinforced by this 2008 failure of the <b>main</b> <b>box</b> office.|$|E
2500|$|The Veltro was a wooden, {{shoulder}} wing cantilever monoplane, with a [...] span wing which was straight tapered in plan {{and had an}} aspect ratio of 18:1. [...] Its wing was constructed around a <b>main</b> <b>box</b> spar and a lighter auxiliary spar and was made in three pieces, with a central panel [...] long. [...] The wing was skinned with [...] thick plywood, apart from the tight radius leading edge which was made of carefully shaped balsa wood glued to a forward false spar. The trailing edges carried fabric covered slotted ailerons outboard and ply covered slotted flaps which at low deflection angles acted as camber changing, lift increasing devices {{to increase the speed}} range and at higher angles (>60°) acted as airbrakes. [...] The wing tips were fitted with tip bodies [...] long and [...] in diameter.|$|E

5000|$|The dynamic strip {{normally}} {{shows the}} next down that will occur, such as [...] "3rd Down". It changes to show down and distance {{and the play}} clock, and turns yellow if a flag is thrown. When a score occurs, the dynamic strip disappears and the <b>main</b> <b>box</b> changes to show the logo of the team scoring, along {{with the type of}} score ("TOUCHDOWN", [...] "FIELD GOAL", [...] "SAFETY"). For a penalty, the <b>main</b> <b>box</b> shows the logo of the offending team, while the dynamic strip turns yellow and displays the type of penalty. When a timeout is called, the dynamic strip turns to the color of the team taking the timeout and displays [...] "Timeout", while the <b>main</b> <b>box</b> displays the team's logo over a neutral gray background. After a few seconds, the <b>main</b> <b>box</b> returns to the scores and a small gray box with the team logo appears next to the team logo in the dynamic strip.|$|E

5000|$|The Venus 2000 {{consists}} of a <b>main</b> <b>box</b> linked to a cylindrical [...] "receiver" [...] that fits over the penis by a connecting hose.

The final adjustment possible is an internal adjustment {{that can be used to}} change the amplitude of the pumping motion, but this is not available in operation, as adjusting it requires the <b>main</b> <b>box</b> of the machine to be dismantled and reassembled.|$|E

50|$|In 2017, to {{accommodate}} the Chargers use of the stadium, upgrades were made at cost to the Chargers including bleachers in the second deck {{on the east side}} of the stadium being replaced by tip-up seats and moved to the berm on the north side, adding 1,000 seats. A new section of upper-level bleachers, which seat 330, were erected in the southeast corner of the stadium. Also the luxury suites were renovated with new seats, furniture, community tables, and engineered hardwood floors and the press box underwent an upgrade with A third row added to the <b>main</b> <b>box,</b> boosting capacity from about 35 to 53. Floors were constructed on the roof of the luxury suites so an auxiliary press box could be built on both sides of the <b>main</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E

50|$|Since {{its initial}} release in 2004, A Call to Arms has gone though several {{significant}} changes, {{with the release}} of supporting material and supplements. Initially the <b>main</b> <b>boxed</b> set contained the basic rules set and fleet lists for the Earth Alliance, Minbari, Centauri, Narn, Interstellar Alliance, Shadows, Vorlons, Raiders and League of Non-Aligned Worlds, as well as cardboard counters {{that could be used in}} place of miniatures to represent the ships. Some of these lists were extremely limited in options but most ships from the show were represented, including the iconic White Star but not the Babylon 5 space station.|$|R

The failed original MEB was returned to Earth and offered an opportunity to study some electronic parts which had spent 50 months in the natural radiation environment of a low Earth orbit (LEO) spacecraft. Spare parts were annealed at ambient temperatures on the ground. Dose rate effects between the flight and laboratory environments were compared...|$|R
50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>boxed</b> set has {{a series}} of {{scenarios}} that can be played individually, but together outline the play of the entire General War. As well, it also allows for free campaigns outside of the canonical Star Fleet Universe timeline to be played, with canonical orders of battle {{for each of the}} stellar empires. The expansions typically have a number of scenarios, which may be a focused treatment of a particular part of the General War, or an alternate way the war could have begun. There are also a limited number of scenarios that show other conflicts in the region, such as the Four Powers War.|$|R
50|$|The MARES motor {{may need}} up to 8 kW to {{accelerate}} {{but only for}} some tens of milliseconds. To minimize peak external power usage, MARES employs a battery, housed in the <b>main</b> <b>box,</b> which distributes these short power spikes over longer time periods. Using the battery as a buffer, MARES will consume an average of 150-200 W during a typical experimental session.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} video {{circuits}} of the era, {{it does not}} offer dynamic RAM refresh capabilities. Thus the VIC-20 employed the more expensive static RAM chips; but with the low RAM capacity of that machine, just 5 KB in the <b>main</b> <b>box,</b> that didn't matter too much. Memory expansions for the VIC-20 either used SRAM as well or implemented their own refresh circuit.|$|E
5000|$|For the 2014 season, Fox's MLB {{coverage}} debuted a new graphics package {{first seen}} on its NASCAR broadcasts that year. Notably, the score box {{was moved to}} the bottom-left corner of the screen. The box places the team abbreviations and scores on the left side over the team's background color. On the top of the right side is the inning (which is the only component in yellow text) and the base graphic; the lower right contains the count and outs (represented by two dots). Above the <b>main</b> <b>box</b> is a new [...] "dynamic" [...] strip, which by default shows the last name of the current pitcher along with the number of pitches he has thrown. However, this strip can be expanded and change color to display team-specific information, such as on-deck hitters and pitchers warming up in the bullpen. In June 2015, this was also expanded to include a white area featuring the last name of the current batter and their performance throughout the game (or their average for their first time at-bat). When a home run is hit, the <b>main</b> <b>box</b> turns to the team's color and displays the text [...] "Home Run", while the dynamic strip grows and displays the name of the team over the team's logo. Other times (usually on FSN), the dynamic strip displays the name of the player who hit that home run and the <b>main</b> <b>box</b> displays the type of home run and how many home runs that player has hit during the season. The graphics package itself is similar to the previous design, though these graphics are more {{in the shape of a}} square, with a typeface that is less athletic in style than the previous Fox graphic packages. Starting with the 2016 season, the score box {{was moved to the}} bottom right.|$|E
