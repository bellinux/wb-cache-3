5000|$|Pre-calculated {{crown molding}} tables or {{software}} {{can be used}} to facilitate the determination of the correct angles. Given the spring angle and the wall angle, the formulas used to calculate the <b>miter</b> <b>angle</b> and the bevel angle are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Fitting {{crown molding}} {{requires}} a cut at the correct combination of <b>miter</b> <b>angle</b> and bevel angle. The calculation of these angles {{is affected by}} two variables: (1) the spring angle (or crown angle, typically sold in 45 degree and 38 degree formats), and (2) the wall angle.|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} low-cost, three-axis, computer numerically controlled (CNC) router was completed {{with the goal of}} bringing the advantages of numerically controlled machine tools to the woodshop. To reduce cost, a novel single rail design was employed. The number of custom parts was kept to a minimum and, where necessary, every effort was made to minimize manufacturing cost. The novel features of the design include vacuum clamping, the ability to cut joinery at <b>miter</b> <b>angles</b> from 0 * to 90 *, and force controlled cutting. Many of the components are used quite aggressively (particularly with regard to stiffness), but the accuracy goal of ± 0. 005 " in X and Y and + 0. 010 " in Z was met. by Alexander D. Sprunt.

50|$|In {{addition}} to design skills, segmented turning demands precision woodworking skills {{as well as}} turning skills. Design and construction of a bowl blank—the wood piece mounted on the lathe for turning a vessel—requires <b>angled</b> <b>miter</b> joints cut to tolerances of {{as little as a}} tenth of one degree or better.|$|R
5000|$|Whistlestop was {{designed}} by Cris Bruch and completed in 2009. It {{is located at the}} intersection of Southwest 5th Avenue and Southwest Morrison Street in the Portland Transit Mall. The stainless steel sculpture depicts pipe organ components, specifically a windchest and three [...] "fanciful" [...] pipes. It measures 127 in x 72 in x 37 in and weighs 1,200 pounds. According to Bruch, it is intended to [...] "evoke sound and provide a quiet moment in an urban streetscape, and the softly reflective surface picks up changes in light and color." [...] One contributor to Blog Down to Washington, a website curated by the University of Washington Alumni Association, described the sculpture as [...] "curved and fluted pipes rising from a low box, also <b>mitered</b> and <b>angled</b> to appear sharp and otherworldly".|$|R
50|$|For a cornice molding two running {{rules are}} usual, {{one on the}} wall, {{the other on the}} ceiling, upon which the mold is worked to and from by one workman, while another man roughly lays on the plaster to the shape of the molding. The <b>miters</b> at the <b>angles</b> are {{finished}} off with joint rules made of sheet steel of various lengths, three or four inches (102 mm) wide, and about one-eighth inch thick, with one end cut to an angle of about 30°. In some cases the steel plate is let into a stock or handle of hardwood.|$|R
50|$|The Rockwell Tools brand {{features}} {{power tools}} (both corded and cordless) and hand tools. Some of these tools include drills, VersaCut circular saws, power planers, <b>miter</b> saws, G-Force <b>angle</b> grinders, sanders, and bench grinders. Many {{of the products}} offered by Rockwell Tools come with free batteries for life. Rockwell Tools also {{offers a variety of}} specialty tools including the Sonicrafter, an oscillating multi-tool that is used for remodeling and general home improvement. The Jawhorse is a clamping device that is similar in style to a bench vise, but offers hands-free operation. Rockwell also offers the ShopSeries, which is a line of tools aimed at budget-conscious DIYers.|$|R
