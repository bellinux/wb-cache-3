5|$|The {{carotenoids}} are pigmented molecules found {{naturally in}} plants, and {{some types of}} fungi, including S.scutellata. A 1965 study reported the carotenoid composition of this fungus, found to contain {{a high proportion of}} <b>monocyclic</b> carotenes—carotenes with only one cyclohexene ring, such as beta-carotene. Also present were minor amounts of xanthophyll, a molecule structurally related to the carotenes.|$|E
5|$|The phallotoxins {{consist of}} at least seven compounds, {{all of which have}} seven similar peptide rings. Phalloidin was {{isolated}} in 1937 by Feodor Lynen, Heinrich Wieland's student and son-in-law, and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich. Though phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells, they have since been found to add little to the death cap's toxicity, as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, phalloidin is also found in the edible (and sought-after) Blusher (Amanita rubescens). Another group of minor active peptides are the virotoxins, which consist of six similar <b>monocyclic</b> heptapeptides. Like the phallotoxins, they do not induce any acute toxicity after ingestion in humans.|$|E

25|$|Aromatic amines are {{chemicals}} that are produced when {{products such as}} dyes, polyurethane products, and certain pesticides are made. They are also found in cigarette smoke, fuel exhaust, and in over cooked, burned meat. The three types of aromatic amines <b>monocyclic,</b> polycyclic, and heterocyclic have all been found in recent studies of breast health. <b>Monocyclic</b> amines {{have been found to}} cause mammary cancer in rats. Studies have shown that women who eat higher amounts of overcooked meat, meaning more exposure to heterocyclic amines, have also been diagnosed with more post-menopausal breast cancer. Heterocyclic amines also have the ability to copy estrogen and in laboratory studies have been found to encourage the growth of cancerous tumors on human tissue.|$|E
25|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons are molecules containing {{two or more}} simple aromatic rings fused together by sharing two neighboring carbon atoms (see also simple aromatic rings). Examples are naphthalene, anthracene, and phenanthrene. In fused aromatics, not all carbon–carbon bonds are necessarily equivalent, as the electrons are not delocalized over the entire molecule. The aromaticity of these molecules can be explained using their orbital picture. Like benzene and other <b>monocyclic</b> aromatic molecules, polycyclics have a cyclic conjugated pi system with p-orbital overlap {{above and below the}} plane of the ring.|$|E

2500|$|Planar <b>monocyclic</b> {{molecules}} containing 4n π-electrons are called antiaromatic and are, in general, unstable. [...] Molecules {{that could be}} antiaromatic will tend to change from this electronic or conformation, thereby becoming non-aromatic. [...] For example, cyclooctatetraene (COT) distorts out of planarity, breaking π overlap between adjacent double bonds. Recent studies have determined that cyclobutadiene adopts an asymmetric, rectangular configuration in which single and double bonds indeed alternate, with no resonance; the single bonds are markedly longer than the double bonds, reducing unfavorable p-orbital overlap. This reduction of symmetry lifts the degeneracy of the two formerly non-bonding molecular orbitals, which by Hund's rule forces the two unpaired electrons into a new, weakly bonding orbital (and also creates a weakly antibonding orbital). Hence, cyclobutadiene is non-aromatic; the strain of the asymmetric configuration outweighs the anti-aromatic destabilization that would afflict the symmetric, square configuration.|$|E
50|$|Simple {{aromatic}} rings can be heterocyclic if {{they contain}} non-carbon ring atoms, for example, oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. They can be <b>monocyclic</b> as in benzene, bicyclic as in naphthalene, or polycyclic as in anthracene. Simple <b>monocyclic</b> aromatic rings are usually five-membered rings like pyrrole or six-membered rings like pyridine.
