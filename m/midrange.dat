5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two <b>midrange</b> drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and <b>midrange</b> are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the <b>midrange</b> is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and <b>midrange,</b> and 3kHz between the tweeter and <b>midrange.</b> The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|The NS-10 {{does not}} have a {{perfectly}} flat frequency response. The sound of the NS-10 is slightly heavy in the <b>midrange,</b> and like other sealed-box speakers of similar size its bass extension is limited. It has a +5dB boost in the <b>midrange</b> at around 2kHz, and the bottom end starts rolling off at 200Hz. The <b>midrange</b> response is so open that it exposes the frequencies that are the most problematic and worst-sounding to the human ear.|$|E
5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its <b>midrange</b> performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} 2-way design {{consisted of}} two 150-4C bass drivers with 4-inch coils, and two H5038P-100 elliptical horns. The 5038s are essentially <b>midrange</b> drivers that start rolling off at 15kHz. In 1960, after feedback from foreign distributors, the Paragon {{was made into a}} 3-way loudspeaker by adding two 075 ring radiators (tweeters) mounted {{in the back of the}} cabinet and aimed at the central 'sweet spot'. Bass–mid crossover was at 500Hz and mid–treble frequencies crossed over at 7kHz.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the speaker}} uses bought-in drivers, {{they have been}} rebuilt using {{stronger}} materials. Drivers' metal baskets are treated to reduce the effects of vibration, and the enclosure designed and constructed to control energy. The drive units (T27, B110 and B139) were sourced from KEF in kit form, and two KEFKIT3 kits were judiciously used for each cabinet. However, Linn found the T27 tweeter too fragile {{and replaced it with}} the more robust and better-sounding D2008 from Scan-Speak after a very short run; the Scan-Speak tweeter was later changed to a Linn D20-LP-1, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark. The <b>midrange</b> KEF B110, known for its use in the LS3/5A BBC monitor, is a 100mm-diameter unit to which Linn applied a layer of doping. The woofer is a KEF B139.|$|E

The iPhone 5 supports 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, but not iOS 11 which was released on September 19, 2017. The iPhone 5 is the second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS after the iPhone 4S.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the <b>midrange</b> because of standing waves generated.|$|E
5|$|Paul prefers {{playing in}} the half court versus playing up-tempo. He creates scoring {{opportunities}} by constantly changing speeds; upon beating his defender one-on-one or shedding him in the pick-and-roll, he will often slow down and box him out, denying him from regaining front side position and forcing the defense to help at all times. His ability to penetrate deep into the paint leads to easy shots for his teammates, and in 2013 he was second {{in the league in}} assisted three pointers. As a playmaker, he is noted for his consistently high assist-to-turnover ratio, averaging just 2.4 turnovers per game over his career. A deft <b>midrange</b> shooter, he is especially proficient from the right elbow, leading the league in shooting percentage from that area in 2015. On defense, he aggravates opponents with active hands and high effort, and has been ranked {{as one of the best}} perimeter defenders in the NBA.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year with the Lakers under new coach Joe Mullaney, Chamberlain seriously injured his knee. He was injured in the ninth game of the schedule, {{suffering}} a total rupture of the patellar tendon {{at the base of}} his right kneecap, and missed the next several months before appearing in the final three games of the 82-game regular season. Owing to a great start, he managed to average 27.3 points, 18.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. Again, the Lakers charged through the playoffs, and in the 1970 NBA Finals, the Lakers were pitted against the New York Knicks, loaded with future Hall-of-Famers Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. Cherry observed that Reed, a prolific <b>midrange</b> shooter, was a bad matchup for Chamberlain: having lost lateral quickness due to his injury, the Lakers center was often too slow to block Reed's preferred high post jump shots. In Game 1, New York masterminded a 124–112 win in which Reed scored 37 points. In Game 2, Chamberlain scored 19 points, grabbed 24 rebounds, and blocked Reed's shot in the final seconds, leading the Lakers to a 105–103 win. Game 3 saw Jerry West famously hit a 60-foot shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 102; however, the Knicks took the game 111–108. In Game 4, Chamberlain scored 18 points and grabbed 25 rebounds and helped tie the series at 2. In Game 5, with the Knicks trailing by double digits, Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed to be done for the series. By conventional wisdom, Chamberlain now should have dominated against little-used Knicks backup centers Nate Bowman and Bill Hosket or forwards Bradley and DeBusschere, who gave up more than half a foot against the Lakers center. Instead, the Lakers gave away their 13-point halftime lead and succumbed to the aggressive Knicks defense: L.A. committed 19 second half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half. The Lakers lost 107–100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. In Game 6, Chamberlain scored 45 points, grabbed 27 rebounds and almost single-handedly equalized the series in a 135–113 Lakers win, and with Reed out, the Knicks seemed doomed prior to Game 7 in New York.|$|E

50|$|The <b>midranges</b> of the Corsican {{mountains}} {{seem to be}} preferred {{because of}} their constant humidity and moderate temperatures. Constant water in the creeks {{coming down from the}} summits supports good development of the larvae over the hot summer.

5000|$|Cone tweeters have a {{narrower}} dispersion characteristic {{that is the}} same as a cone woofer's. Many designers therefore believed this made them a good match to cone <b>midranges</b> and woofers, allowing for superb stereo imaging. However, the [...] "sweet spot" [...] created by the narrow dispersion of cone tweeters is small. Speakers with cone tweeters offered the best stereo imaging when positioned in the room's corners, a common practice in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s.|$|R
25|$|West in 1930 {{and later}} P. G. A. H. Voigt (1940) {{showed that the}} early Wente-style {{condenser}} microphones contributed to a 4 to 6dB <b>midrange</b> brilliance or pre-emphasis in the recording chain. This meant that the electrical recording characteristics of Western Electric licensees such as Columbia Records and Victor Talking Machine Company in the 1925 era had a higher amplitude in the <b>midrange</b> region. Brilliance such as this compensated for dullness in many early magnetic pickups having drooping <b>midrange</b> and treble response. As a result, this practice was the empirical beginning of using pre-emphasis above 1,000Hz in 78rpm and rpm records.|$|E

5000|$|Also called F0, {{resonance}} frequency measured in hertz (Hz). The frequency {{at which the}} combination of the energy stored in the moving mass and suspension compliance is maximum, and results in maximum cone velocity. A more compliant suspension or a larger moving mass will cause a lower {{resonance frequency}}, and vice versa. Usually it is less efficient to produce output at frequencies below Fs, and input signals significantly below Fs can cause large excursions, mechanically endangering the driver. Woofers typically have an Fs in the range of 13-60 Hz. <b>Midranges</b> usually have an Fs in the range of 60-500 Hz and tweeters between 500 Hz and 4 kHz. A typical factory tolerance for Fs spec is ±15%.|$|R

50|$|Loudspeakers {{are often}} built into horn-shaped {{enclosures}} or use horns.

An audio driver (e.g., a speaker cone or dome) is mounted at the small, inner end. Horn loudspeakers are very efficient, but have a sharp cutoff frequency, depending on their size, with little sound output below. Bass sounds are usually produced by conventional speaker cones, since a (straight or folded) horn sufficient to reproduce 20 Hz {{would have to be}} about 12 ft.

40|$|The {{presence}} of missing rainfall data is inevitable due to error of recording, meteorological extremes and malfunction of instruments. Consequently, a competent imputation algorithm for missing data treatment algorithm {{is very much}} needed. There are several such efficient algorithms which have been introduced in earlier studies.

Therefore, this study is intended to introduce several single imputation algorithms for missing data treatment, which believed to be more competent in treating missing daily rainfall data without the need {{to depend on the}} information of adjoining rainfall stations. The proposed algorithms use descriptive measures of the data, including arithmetric means, geometric means, harmonic means, medians and <b>midranges.</b> These algorithms are tested on hourly rainfall data records from six selected rainfall stations located in the Kuantan River Basin.

40|$|Rating Scales for Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{prepared}} {{a critique of}} the Hoehn and Yahr scale (HY). Strengths of the HY scale include its wide utilization and acceptance. Progressively higher stages correlate with neuroimaging studies of dopami-nergic loss, and high correlations exist between the HY scale and some standardized scales of motor impairment, disability, and quality of life. Weaknesses include the scale’s mixing of impairment and disability and its non-linearity. Because the HY scale is weighted heavily toward postural instability as the primary index of disease severity, it does not capture com-pletely impairments or disability from other motor features of PD and gives no information on nonmotor problems. Direct clinimetric testing of the HY scale has been very limited, but the scale fulfills at least some criteria for reliability and validity, especially for the <b>midranges</b> of the scale (Stages 2 – 4). Al-though a “modified HY scale ” that includes 0. 5 increments has been adopted widely, no clinimetric data are available on this adaptation. The Task Force recommends that: (1) the HY scale be used in its original form for demographic presen-tation of patient groups; (2) when the HY scale is used for group description, medians and ranges should be reported and analysis of changes should use nonparametric methods; (3) in research settings, the HY scale is useful primarily for defining inclusion/exclusion criteria; (4) to retain simplicity, clinicians should “rate what you see ” and therefore incor-porate comorbidities when assigning a HY stage; and (5) because of the wide usage of the modified HY scale with 0. 5 increments, this adaptation warrants clinimetric testing.

40|$|We analyze scale-dependent {{statistics}} of correlated random hydrogeological variables and their extremes using neutron porosity data from six deep boreholes, in three diverse depositional environments, as example. We show that key {{statistics of}} porosity increments behave and scale in manners {{typical of many}} earth and environmental (as well as other) variables. These scaling behaviors include a tendency of increments to have symmetric, non-Gaussian frequency distributions characterized by heavy tails that decay with separation distance or lag; power-law scaling of sample structure functions (statistical moments of absolute increments) in <b>midranges</b> of lags; linear relationships between log structure functions of successive orders at all lags, known as extended self-similarity or ESS; and nonlinear scaling of structure function power-law exponents with function order, a phenomenon commonly attributed in the literature to multifractals. Elsewhere we proposed, explored and demonstrated a new method of geostatistical inference that captures all of these phenomena within a unified theoretical framework. The framework views data as samples from random fields constituting scale mixtures of truncated (monofractal) fractional Brownian motion (tfBm) or fractional Gaussian noise (tfGn). Important questions not addressed in previous studies concern the distribution and statistical scaling of extreme incremental values. Of special interest in hydrology (and many other areas) are statistics of absolute increments exceeding given thresholds, known as peaks over threshold or POTs. In this paper we explore the statistical scaling of data and, for the first time, corresponding POTs associated with samples from scale mixtures of tfBm or tfGn. We demonstrate that porosity data we analyze possess properties of such samples and thus follow the theory we proposed. The porosity data are of additional value in revealing a remarkable cross-over from one scaling regime to another at certain lags. The phenomena we uncover are of key importance {{for the analysis of}} fluid flow and solute as well as particulate transport in complex hydrogeologic environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{automotive}} industry currently faces many challenges pertaining to strict emissions and fuel consumption constraints for a sustainable society. These regulations have motivated {{the investigation of}} low temperature combustion modes such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) as a potential solution to meet these demands. HCCI combustion is characterized by high efficiency and low engine-out emissions. However, this advanced combustion mode is limited in the speed-load operating space due to high pressure rise rates for increased loads. Often higher loads are run at later combustion phasings to reduce pressure rise rates, however high cyclic variability (CV) {{can also be a}} limiting factor for late combustion phasings. This work presents advancements in the understanding of high variability dynamics in recompression HCCI as well as methods for control of CV and load transitions which typically encounter regions of high variability. Standard in-cylinder pressure based analysis methods are extended for use on high variability data. This includes a method of determining the trapped residual mass in real time. Determination of the residual mass is critical in recompression HCCI because of the combustion's sensitivity to the thermal energy contained within the residual charge. Trapping too much or little residuals can lead to ringing or misfires and CV, respectively. Various levels of CV are studied using large experimental data sets to ensure statistical relevance. The cycle resolved analysis of this data has allowed {{for the development of a}} predictive model of the variability associated with lean late phasing combustion. This model is used to develop control which can suppress cyclic variability at steady state. Knowledge about steady state control of CV and its oscillatory dynamics is further applied to the development of an adaptive controller. The adaptive controller uses a parameter estimation scheme in the feedforward component of a baseline <b>midranging</b> structure. The adaptive feedforward component enables the ability to correct for modeling errors and reduces parameterization effort. Experimental results demonstrate that the control is effective at navigating through large load transients while avoiding excess amounts of variability. Additionally, the actuators spend more time in a region of high authority when compared to non-adaptive control...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on a unified self-consistent scaling framework which is consistent with key behavior exhibited by many spatially/temporally varying earth, environmental and other variables. This behavior includes tendency of increments to have symmetric, non-Gaussian frequency distributions characterized by heavy tails that often decay with lag; power-law scaling of sample structure functions (statistical moments of absolute increments) in <b>midranges</b> of lags, with breakdown in power-law scaling at small and/or large lags; linear relationships between log structure functions of successive orders at all lags, also known as extended self-similarity; and nonlinear scaling of structure function power-law exponents with function order. The major question we attempt to answer is: given data measured on a given support scale at various points throughout a 1 D/ 2 D/ 3 D sampling domain, which appear to be statistically distributed and to scale {{in a manner consistent with}} that scaling framework, what can be said about the spatial statistics and scaling of its extreme values, on arbitrary separation or domain scales? To do so, we limit our investigation in 1 D domain for simplicity and generate synthetic signals as samples from 1 D sub-Gaussian random fields subordinated to truncated monofractal fractional Brownian motion (tfBm) or truncated fractional Gaussian noise (tfGn). Such sub-Gaussian fields are scale mixtures of stationary Gaussian fields with random variances that we model as being log-normal or Lévy α/ 2 -stable. This novel interpretation of the data allows us to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of all parameters characterizing the underlying truncated sub-Gaussian fields. Based on synthetic data, we find these samples conform to the aforementioned scaling framework and confirm the effectiveness of generation schemes. We numerically investigate the manner in which variables, which scale according to the above scaling framework, behave at the tails of their distributions. Ours is the first study to explore the statistical scaling of extreme values, specifically peaks over thresholds or POTs, associated with such families of sub-Gaussian fields. Before closing this work, we apply and verify our analysis by investigating the scaling of statistics characterizing vertical increments in neutron porosity data, and POTs in absolute increments, from six deep boreholes in three different depositional environments...|$|R
