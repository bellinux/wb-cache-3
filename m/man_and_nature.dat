5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>nature,</b> and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write poetry is reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for a brighter, more joyous life.|$|E

25|$|Adherence {{to strict}} {{dichotomy}} between <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women: Some eco-feminist critiques {{are that the}} dichotomy between women <b>and</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>nature</b> <b>and</b> culture creates a dualism that is too stringent and focused in the difference of women <b>and</b> <b>men.</b> That eco-feminism too strongly correlates the social status of women with the social status of nature, rather than the non-essentialist view that women along with nature both have masculine and feminine qualities, and that just like feminine qualities have often been seen as less worthy, nature is also seen as having lesser value than culture, or the qualities involved in these concepts.|$|R
5000|$|Currently, the Hungarian {{ethnology}} of religion, {{primarily the}} academic circle of Miháli Hoppál, {{has an important}} role in international shamanic studies.

25|$|Fallingwater {{stands as}} one of Wright's {{greatest}} masterpieces both for its dynamism and for its integration with its striking natural surroundings. Fallingwater {{has been described as}} an architectural tour de force of Wright's organic philosophy. Wright's passion for Japanese architecture was strongly reflected in the design of Fallingwater, particularly in the importance of interpenetrating exterior and interior spaces and the strong emphasis placed on harmony between <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>nature.</b> Contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando has said of the house,I think Wright learned {{the most important aspect of}} architecture, the treatment of space, from Japanese architecture. When I visited Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, I found that same sensibility of space. But there was the additional sounds of nature that appealed to me.|$|E
25|$|Hindu texts {{accept a}} polytheistic framework, {{but this is}} {{generally}} conceptualized as the divine essence or luminosity that gives vitality and animation to the inanimate natural substances. There is a divine in everything, human beings, animals, trees and rivers. It is observable in offerings to rivers, trees, tools of one's work, animals and birds, rising sun, friends and guests, teachers and parents. It is the divine in these that makes each sacred and worthy of reverence. This seeing divinity in everything, state Buttimer and Wallin, makes the Vedic foundations of Hinduism quite distinct from Animism. The animistic premise sees multiplicity, power differences and competition between man and man, man and animal, as well as <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>nature.</b> The Vedic view does not see this competition, rather sees a unifying divinity that connects everyone and everything.|$|E

A volume titled The Open Boat and Other Tales of Adventure was published in the United States in 1898; an edition entitled The Open Boat and Other Stories was published simultaneously in England. Praised for its innovation by contemporary critics, the story is considered an exemplary work of literary Naturalism, and is one of the most frequently discussed works in Crane's canon. It is notable for its use of imagery, irony, symbolism, and the exploration of such themes as survival, solidarity, and the conflict between <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>nature.</b> H. G.

500|$|Spinoza, {{with his}} determinism, {{believes}} that <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>nature</b> must be unified under a consistent set of laws; God and nature are one, {{and there is}} no free will. Contrary to most philosophers of his time and in accordance with most of those of the present, Spinoza rejects the dualistic assumption that mind, intentionality, ethics, and freedom are to be treated as things separate from the natural world of physical objects and events. His goal is to provide a unified explanation of all these things within a naturalistic framework, and his notion of conatus is central to this project. For example, an action is [...] "free", for Spinoza, only if it arises from the essence and conatus of an entity. There can be no absolute, unconditioned freedom of the will, since all events in the natural world, including human actions and choices, are determined in accord with the natural laws of the universe, which are inescapable. However, an action can still be free {{in the sense that it}} is not constrained or otherwise subject to external forces.|$|E

40|$|The {{reason for}} the {{failures}} of our environmental policies are not only in our “anthropocentric” views and over confidence in modem technology, but also in our negligence towards the humans’ role in nature. To alter environmental policy, we do not, however, need to coincide with ideas such as deep ecology or “biocentrism”,which diminishes the human role in the environment. The author recommends learning from the relationships between <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>nature</b> in traditional communities, which humans are {{important part of the}} natural environment itself. 人間の存亡は自然環境に左右されてきたことは言うまでもないが、自然環境自体が、古来人間活動の影響を受けてきたことも厳然たる事実である。端的に言えば、人間活動の伸張は自然の後退及び人間社会への馴化をもたらしたといえる。それでは、人間社会が発達（develop）すれば自然環境は悪化し、滅びに向かうのであろうか。しかし、最近は経済成長だけではない、オルターナティブな持続可能なdevelopmentの概念も登場している。これは、人間の発達を科学することを標榜する組織のなかで、環境法を研究する筆者としては、避けては通れない課題であり、本稿では、人間と自然との関係を、環境政策、環境法研究の視点から検討する...|$|R

500|$|Within {{the many}} poems that explore this idea—among them Keats's and the works by his contemporaries—Keats begins by {{questioning}} suffering, breaks {{it down to}} its most basic elements of cause and effect, and draws conclusions about the world. His own process is filled with doubt, but his poems end with a hopeful message that the narrator (himself) is finally free of desires for Love, Ambition, and Poesy. The hope contained within [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] is found within the vision he expresses in the last stanza: [...] "I yet have visions for the night/And for the day faint visions there is store." [...] Consequently, in her analysis of The Odes of John Keats, Helen Vendler suggests that [...] "Ode on Indolence" [...] is a seminal poem constructed with themes and images that appeared more influential in his other, sometimes later, poems. The ode is an early and entirely original work that establishes the basis of Keats's notion of soul making, a method by which the individual builds his or her soul through a form of education consisting of suffering and personal experience. This is a fundamental preoccupation of the Romantics, who believed the way to reconcile <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>nature</b> was through this soul development, education—the combination of experience and contemplation—and that only this process, not the rationality of the previous century, would bring about true Enlightenment.|$|E
