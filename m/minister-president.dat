5|$|After World War II, Ohmsen {{initially}} {{worked as}} a government employee of the Schleswig-Holstein agricultural ministry. He ran for public office as a candidate of the Schleswig-Holstein-Block in the 1954 Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein election. During an election speech, he disparaged the <b>Minister-President</b> of Schleswig-Holstein Friedrich-Wilhelm Lübke. Ohmsen was immediately dismissed without notice from his position in the agricultural ministry for insulting the <b>Minister-President.</b> He rejoined the military service of the Bundeswehr on 16 March 1956 as a Kapitänleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) of the Bundesmarine (German Federal Navy). He was promoted to Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) on 15 November 1957 and Fregattenkapitän (Frigate Captain) on 13 August 1965 and retired on 30 September 1967.|$|E

5|$|After a brief postponement, an {{announcement}} was made on 1 February 1942, detailing how the cabinet had elected Quisling to the post of <b>Minister-President</b> of the national government. The appointment {{was accompanied by a}} banquet, rallying and other celebrations by the Nasjonal Samling members. In his first speech, Quisling committed the government to closer ties with Germany. The only change to the Constitution was the reinstatement of the ban on Jewish entry into Norway, which had been abolished in 1851.|$|E
5|$|After the {{previous}} German Grand Prix (at the Nürburgring) in July 2009, {{the future of}} the race was in doubt after the government of Baden-Württemberg and the town of Hockenheim withdrew their funding for the event. Planned discussions between the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone and the <b>Minister-President</b> of Baden-Württemberg Günther Oettinger to renegotiate the expenses for hosting the event had ended after Ecclestone made controversial comments regarding Adolf Hitler, and the organisers of the Nürburgring circuit announced that they would not hold the race in 2010 because of a commitment to hold the event the following year. An agreement was reached in September which would see the event run until 2018 with both circuit's management and Formula One Management agreeing to cover any losses incurred.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cessation}} of hostilities, Cooper served as a legal advisor for the 300,000 displaced persons in his unit's occupation zone seeking repatriation after being brought to Germany as slaves by the Nazis. Under {{the terms of the}} agreement reached at the Yalta Conference, all displaced Russian nationals were to be returned to the Soviet Union, but Soviet negotiators decided that the agreement did not apply to non-Russian spouses and children of the nationals. Cooper brought this to the attention of General Patton, who rescinded the repatriation order in the Third Army's occupation zone. Cooper received a citation from the Third Army's military government section for his action. Cooper also oversaw the reorganization of the 239 courts in the German state of Bavaria in an attempt to replace all the Nazi officials, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Among the judges installed by Cooper were Wilhelm Hoegner, future <b>Minister-President</b> of Bavaria, and Ludwig Erhard, the future Chancellor of Germany.|$|E

5|$|King Frederick William IV {{suffered}} a stroke in 1857 and could no longer rule. This led to his brother William becoming Prince Regent of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1858. Meanwhile, Helmuth von Moltke had become chief of the Prussian General Staff in 1857, and Albrecht von Roon would become Prussian Minister of War in 1859. This shuffling of authority within the Prussian military establishment would have important consequences. Von Roon and William (who took an active interest in military structures) began reorganizing the Prussian army, while Moltke redesigned the strategic defense of Prussia by streamlining operational command. Prussian army reforms (especially {{how to pay for}} them) caused a constitutional crisis beginning in 1860 because both parliament and William—via his minister of war—wanted control over the military budget. William, crowned King Wilhelm I in 1861, appointed Otto von Bismarck to the position of <b>Minister-President</b> of Prussia in 1862. Bismarck resolved the crisis in favor of the war minister.|$|E

25|$|The Brussels-Capital Region {{is governed}} by a {{parliament}} of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking, parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a <b>minister-president,</b> four ministers and three state secretaries. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking {{secretary of state and}} two French-speaking secretaries of state. The <b>minister-president</b> does not count against the language quota, but in practice every <b>minister-president</b> has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact ordinances (French: ordonnances, Dutch: ordonnanties), which have equal status as a national legislative act.|$|E
25|$|After the CSU {{lost more}} than 17% of the votes in the Bavarian state {{elections}} of 2008, incumbent <b>Minister-President</b> Günther Beckstein and Chairman of the CSU, Erwin Huber, announced their resignations. Horst Seehofer was quickly proposed as their successor. At a party convention on October 25 he was affirmed as the new Chairman of the CSU, and on October 27 he was elected <b>Minister-President</b> by the Landtag with votes from the Free Democratic Party, forming the first coalition government in Bavaria since 1962.|$|E

30|$|Disputes {{about who}} was at fault started before the conference had even ended. The West German media put the blame {{squarely}} on the East German <b>Minister-Presidents</b> and the SED. According to the Hamburg-based news magazine Der Spiegel, which cited {{a press conference in}} East Berlin as its source, the SED <b>Minister-Presidents</b> had arrived with a draft of the ‘rejection communiqué’ already in their pockets. 8 The weekly broadsheet Die Zeit wrote that the <b>Minister-Presidents</b> had appeared as ‘a collective unit’ that ‘embraced the remote-controlled agenda advocated at the Moscow conference by the Soviet Union, and in Germany by the SED.’ 9 The state-controlled press in the Soviet-occupied zone put a rather different spin on things. Grotewohl had given the official line in a radio broadcast: he blamed the ‘failure’ on the West. 10 The editor-in-chief of Neues Deutschland, Lex Ende, penned an editorial in which he criticised the SPD <b>Minister-Presidents</b> who, he wrote, had experienced ‘enlightenment by the holy spirit of Dr Schumacher’ in Munich. 11 The hope that an East-West summit might bridge the chasm between the Allies had not come true. Instead of finding a fresh political perspective for Germany, the Munich conference now stood as a stark symbol of the country’s division.|$|R
