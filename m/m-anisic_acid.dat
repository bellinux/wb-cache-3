40|$|We {{determined}} {{the effect of}} 3 -methoxybenzamide (3 -MB), a competitive inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (E. C. 2. 4. 2. 30), on intrachromosomal homologous recombination in mouse Ltk- cells. We used a cell line that contained in its genome two defective Herpes thymidine kinase (tk) genes as closely linked direct repeats. Intrachromosomal homologous recombination events were monitored by selecting for tk-positive segregants that arose during propagation of the cells and recombination rates were determined by fluctuation analysis. We found that growth of cells in the continuous presence of 2 mM 3 -MB increased intrachromosomal recombination between 3 and 4 -fold. Growth of cells {{in the presence of}} 2 mM <b>m-anisic</b> <b>acid,</b> a non-inhibitory analog of 3 -MB, had no effect on intrachromosomal recombination rates. Additionally, we found that 3 -MB increased both gene conversions and crossovers to similar extents, adding to the evidence that these two types of intrachromosomal rearrangements share a common pathway. These findings contrast with our previous studies [Waldman, B. C. and Waldman, A. S. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res., 18, 5981 - 5988] in which we determined that 3 -MB inhibits illegitimate recombination and has no effect on extrachromosomal homologous recombination in mouse Ltk- cells. An hypothesis is offered that explains the influence of 3 -MB on different recombination pathways in mammalian cells in terms of the role that poly(ADP-ribosylation) plays in DNA break-repair...|$|E
40|$|Vanillic acid (4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzoic acid) {{supported}} the anaerobic (nitrate respiration) {{but not the}} aerobic growth of Pseudomonas sp. strain PN- 1. Cells grown anaerobically on vanillate oxidized vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, and protocatechuic acid (3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid) with O 2 or nitrate. Veratric acid (3, 4 -dimethoxybenzoic acid) but not isovanillic acid (3 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxybenzoic acid) induced cells for the oxic and anoxic utilization of vanillate, and protocatechuate was detected as an intermediate of vanillate breakdown under either condition. Aerobic catabolism of protocatechuate proceeded via 4, 5 -meta cleavage, whereas anaerobically it was probably dehydroxylated to benzoic acid. Formaldehyde {{was identified as a}} product of aerobic demethylation, indicating a monooxygenase mechanism, but was not detected during anaerobic demethylation. The aerobic and anaerobic systems had similar but not identical substrate specificities. Both utilized <b>m-anisic</b> <b>acid</b> (3 -methoxybenzoic acid) and veratrate but not o- or p-anisate and isovanillate. Syringic acid (4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethoxybenzoic acid), 3 -O-methylgallic acid (3 -methoxy- 4, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid), and 3, 5 -dimethoxybenzoic acid were attacked under either condition, and formaldehyde was liberated from these substrates in the presence of O 2. The anaerobic demethylating system but not the aerobic enzyme was also active upon guaiacol (2 -methoxyphenol), ferulic acid (3 -[4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl]- 2 -propenoic acid), 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxycinnamic acid (3 -[3, 4, 5 -trimethoxyphenyl]- 2 -propenoic acid), and 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxybenzoic acid. The broad specificity of the anaerobic demethylation system suggests that it probably is significant in the degradation of lignoaromatic molecules in anaerobic environments...|$|E
40|$|A DC(B) A {{approach}} to synthesize the potent anticancer drug Daunomycinone and analogs was investigated. ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 5 -methoxynaphthol and 86 were {{chosen as the}} CD and A-ring^synthons. Except thallic nitrate oxidation, all attempts gave low^yields of Juglone. 1, 4 -naphthoquinonmonoxime failed to form an^isoxazole. The challenge was to introduce a ketomethyl side chain^and a cis- 1, 3 glycol to 115. The reduction of trimethoxybenzoic acid^to 86 was improved. The side chain was introduced by adding Li- 119 ^on 108 a. Moving to a nonpolar solvent reduced 1, 4 -polarization of (beta) -ketoenolether, a vinylogus ester, and produced more positive charge on cyclic ketone than free ester in 108. The ratio of desired 121 over useless 122 was thus improved from 4. 5 : 1 to 9 : 1. Chromatography of the mixture was simplified. One attempt to introduce a one-carbon unit to 123, did not succeed. Epoxidation of 94, {{with the hope of}} reducing the (alpha) -ketoepoxide to 115 did not succeed. 121 was reduced to 131 with 9 -BBN. Hydroxylamine was found very effective in work-up. Various A-ring synthons, 94, 131, and 111 failed to introduce the 9 -OH group through a (gamma) -lactone under exhaustive variations. Evidence for 121 was observed but attempts to convert it to 115 led only to 121. The 1, 3 -dithiane in 121 and 131 were exchanged with 1, 2 -dioxolane protecting group. A new reaction of conjugate reduction of (beta) -ketoenolethers into (beta) -alkoxyketones in presence of an ester group was developed. Bulky esters of 108 were used to control stereoselectivity. Birch reduction of <b>m-anisic</b> <b>acid</b> was improved to give 85 % yield of the enone acid 111. Use of larger R(, 1) in 112 and non-polar solvent, produced a stereoselective 1, 2 -addition of 119. The major product was the allylic alcohol 193, which was cis to the ester and formed a (gamma) -lactone. A new method for converting an allylic alcohol into cis- 1, 3 -glycol was developed. This could of adapted for other cis relations and is of large synthetic value. The 5 -methoxynaphthol ester of 111 was prepared to undergo a regiospecific photo-Fries rearrangement to produce daunomycinone and analogs. ...|$|E
40|$|Four thermotolerant {{actinomycetes}} from soil, {{identified as}} Streptomyces albulus 321, Streptomyces sioyaensis P 5, Streptomyces viridosporus T 7 A, and Streptomyces sp. V 7, were grown at 45 Â°C in media containing either benzoic acid or hydroxyl- and methoxyl-substituted benzoic acids {{as the principal}} carbon sources. Benzoic acid was converted to catechol; p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, and veratric acids were converted to protocatechuic acid; and m-hydroxybenzoic acid was converted to gentisic acid. Catechol, protocatechuic acid, and gentisic acid were cleaved by catechol 1, 2 -dioxygenase, protocatechuate 3, 4 -dioxygenase, and gentisate 1, 2 -dioxygenase, respectively. Dioxygenases appeared only in induced cultures. m-Hydroxybenzoic, <b>m-anisic,</b> and p-anisic <b>acids</b> were gratuitous inducers of dioxygenases in some strains. One strain converted vanillic acid to guaiacol...|$|R
