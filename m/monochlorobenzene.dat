40|$|International audienceChlorobutyl {{coatings}} are industrially applied on metallic {{inner walls}} of HCl storage tanks, {{in order to}} protect steel against corrosion. Rubber coating constitutes an efficient barrier against HCl penetration up to metallic surface; yet, traces of <b>monochlorobenzene</b> (MCB) into HCl solutions can locally damage the coating and induce both acid infiltration and rapid corrosion of steel under the coating. Acoustic emission (AE) technique, due to its non-intrusive feature and its sensitivity, is a potential technique for the detection of polymer coating damage as well as metallic corrosion under the coating. In that context, this technique was coupled and compared to electrochemical measurements at least for metal damage evaluation. AE signals produced by corrosion of bare metal in HCl solution were first characterized, and then AE and electrochemical results obtained during metal and/or coating damage were compared, in the case of physical or chemical deteriorations of the coating, in an HCl solution containing traces of <b>monochlorobenzene.</b> In case of physical coating damaging, AE and polarisation resistance measurements are in good correlation as soon as metallic corrosion starts.

40|$|The {{application}} {{range of the}} on-line solid-phase extraction-gas chromatographic (SPE-GC) analysis of aqueous samples has been extended to volatile analytes. In the new set-up, after conventional aqueous-sample loading and drying of the SPE cartridge with nitrogen gas, 30 - 50 μl of an organic solvent, the so-called presolvent, such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate are introduced into the retention gap prior to the actual desorption {{to ensure that a}} solvent film is already present in the retention gap when the introduction of the analyte-containing desorption solvent starts. This procedure allows the recovery of analytes as volatile as <b>monochlorobenzene</b> and xylene. Aspects such as the type of retaining precolumn, and the type and amount of presolvent have been studied systematically to explain the performance of the novel set-up. Actually, when using 50 μl of presolvent, the use of a retaining precolumn did not have any significant influence on the recovery of the volatile analytes. The modified SPE-GC procedure was tested by analysing 10 ml of fiver Rhine water spiked at the 0. 5 μg/l level with about 80 microcontaminants covering a wide range of volatility. The test compounds included chlorobenzenes, substituted and nonsubstituted aromatic compounds, anilines and phenolic compounds and organonitrogen and organophosphorus pesticides. The system performance in terms of recovery (typically 70 - 115 % at the 0. 5 μg/l level) and repeatability (R. S. D. values typically 1 - 9 %; n= 7) was satisfactory, even for <b>monochlorobenzene,</b> the most volatile analyte of the test mixture.

30|$|The {{pressure}} drop encountered in {{heavy crude oil}} transportation via pipelines is more acute when {{it is to be}} transported over a long distances; therefore drag reduction by incorporating an additive becomes an option. The transportation of crude oil via pipelines is mostly in the turbulent flow regime. Additionally, high frictional loss as a result of high viscosity causes much of the energy applied to transport the crude oil to be wasted. High drag in turbulent flow is caused by radial transport of flow momentum by fluid eddies. Polymer drag reduction was discovered decades ago by Toms (1948), who observed about 30 - 40  % drag reduction upon the addition of polymer (methyl methacrylate) to turbulent <b>monochlorobenzene</b> flowing via pipeline. In this respect, drag-reducing additives help to reduce friction near the pipeline walls and within the turbulent fluid core of moving fluid. Therefore, for energy conservation and high efficiency of bitumen and heavy crude oil transfer, drag reduction is vital.|$|E

The use of different growth support materials, namely limestone, sand, ceramic and PVC pall-rings, was investigated. Limestone led to clogging of the reactor due to the accumulation of surface precipitates, but PVC pall-rings allowed for a uniform biofilm growth. The biotrickling filter presented maximum removal efficiency (RE, 95 %) under OL regimes of 10 g m- 3 -reactor h- 1.

In the study area, the historical contamination by chlorobenzenes was well known and remediation actions were implemented. Nevertheless, in recent time, groundwater increasing concentrations of MCB were observed. In this industrial site there are different plants that were active in the past too and for this reason is not easy to distinguish between old and new contaminant contribution.

The ground samples were characterized and analyzed by X-ray fluorescence, gas chromatography (GC), X-ray diffraction and ion chromatography. The intermediate products, such as pentachlorobenzene, tetrachlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene isomers, dichlorobenzene and <b>monochlorobenzene</b> were detected by GC. Then the main dechlorination path way for HCB was proposed. With a series of verification experiments, the final degradation products of HCB were amorphous carbon and inorganic chlorine.

However, most studies to date have only addressed mixed cultures and there is limited information regarding single strain stability. Here we have investigated the microbial community dynamics in two bioreactors, each inoculated with a pure bacterial strain capable of degrading a recalcitrant substrate, namely Xanthobacter aut.

The bioreactor fed with DCE was functionally stable and the percentage of GJ 10 cells in the community remained high (around 95 % of total cells) throughout, even after introduction of foreign microorganisms. The bioreactor fed with MCB was also functionally stable, but in contrast to the DCE bioreactor, probing results revealed the disappearance of strain JS 150 from the bioreactor within a week.

The best analytical conditions were obtained using PDMS/DVB/CAR fibre using headspace extraction (HS-SPME) at 50 degreesC for 20 min without stirring. The linear range for each compound by HS-SPME with GC/FID was defined. The detection limits for these compounds obtained with PDMS/DVB/CAR fibre and GC/FID were: benzene (15 ng L- 1), toluene (160 ng L- 1), <b>monochlorobenzene</b> (54 ng L- 1), ethylbenzene (32 ng L- 1), m-xylene (56 ng L- 1), p-xylene (69 ng L- 1), styrene (35 ng L- 1), o-xylene (42 ng L- 1), m-dichlorobenzene (180 ng L- 1), p-dichlorobenzene (230 ng L- 1), o-dichlorobenzene (250 ng L- 1) and trichlorobenzene (260 ng L- 1). This headspace SPME-GC-FID method was compared with a previously validated method of analysis using closed-loop-stripping analysis (CLSA).

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a simple, rapid and efficient method for the extraction and preconcentration of different classes of pesticides in mineral water samples by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. To optimize the DLLME conditions for the different classes of pesticides and access the effect of variables on the extraction, a central composite design (CCD) with a five-level fractional factorial design was used for the construction of a second order response surface model (RSM). The limits of quantification were between 0. 005 and 0. 5 &# 956;g L- 1. Correlation coefficients (r) were higher than 0. 999. Recoveries ranged from 102 to 120 %, with relative standard deviations between 1 and 10 %. Low matrix effect for all compounds was observed.

40|$|Aerobic {{conditions}} {{proved to}} be best for the microbiol conversion of alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) in a soil slurry. The dry soil contained 400 mg of alpha-HCH per kg. This xenobiotic compound was mineralized within about 18 days at an initial rate of 23 mg/kg of soil per day by the mixed native microbial population of the soil. The only intermediate that was detected during breakdown was pentachlorocyclohexene, which was detected at very small concentrations. Alpha-HCH was also bioconverted under methanogenic conditions. However, a rather long acclimation period (about 30 days) was necessary before degradation started, {{at a rate of}} 13 mg/kg of soil per day. Mass balance calculations showed that about 85 % of the initial alpha-HCH that was present was converted to <b>monochlorobenzene,</b> 3, 5 -dichlorophenol, and a trichlorophenol isomer, possibly 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol. Under both denitrifying and sulfate-reducing conditions, no significant bioconversion of alpha-HCH was observed. The beta isomer of HCH was recalcitrant at all of the four redox conditions studied. We propose that the specific spatial chloride arrangement of the beta isomer is responsible for its stability. The results reported here with complex soil slurry systems showed that alpha-HCH is, in contrast to the existing data in the literature, best degraded biologically in the presence of oxygen...|$|E

The shape of the EA spectra of C 153 in benzene, 1, 4 -dioxane, or <b>monochlorobenzene</b> remarkably depends on the angle between the polarization direction of the absorption light and the applied electric field, whereas the EA spectra of C 153 doped in PMMA show only the Stark shift and the field-induced change in spectral shape is negligible. These results demonstrate that C 153 is reoriented by application of electric fields in solution, but the molecules are immobilized in a PMMA film. Based on the EA spectra, electric dipole moments both in the ground state and in the excited state have been evaluated for C 153 in different solvents. In the EA spectra of pyrene, only the Stark shift is observed both in solution and in PMMA, indicating that the field-induced molecular reorientation does not occur both in solution and in PMMA.

40|$|From {{contaminated}} industrial sludge, two stable multistrain microbial enrichments (consortia) {{that were}} capable of rapidly utilizing chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, respectively, were obtained. These consortia were characterized as to their species composition, tolerance range, and activity maxima {{in order to establish}} and maintain the required operational parameters during their use in biofilters for the removal of chlorobenzene contaminants from air. The consortia were immobilized on a porous perlite support packed into filter columns. Metered airstreams containing the contaminant vapors were partially humidified and passed through these columns. The vapor concentrations prior to and after biofiltration were measured by gas chromatography. Liquid was circulated concurrently with the air, and the device was operated in the trickling air biofilter mode. The experimental arrangement allowed the independent variation of liquid flow, airflow, and solvent vapor concentrations. Bench-scale trickling air biofilters removed <b>monochlorobenzene,</b> o-dichlorobenzene, and their mixtures at rates of up to 300 g of solvent vapor h(- 1) m(- 3) filter volume. High liquid recirculation rates and automated pH control were critical for stable filtration performance. When the accumulating NaCl was periodically diluted, the trickling air biofilters continued to remove chlorobenzenes for several months with no loss of activity. The demonstrated high performance and stability of the described trickling air biofilters favor their use in industrial-scale air pollution control...|$|E
40|$|Lindane (¿-HCH) is a {{pesticide}} {{that has}} mainly {{been used in}} agriculture. Lindane and the other HCH isomers are highly chlorinated hydrocarbons. The presence {{of a large number}} of electron withdrawing chlorine groups makes some of the HCH isomers rather recalcitrant in oxic environments. Especially ß-HCH is poorly degraded by aerobic bacteria. The chlorine groups make HCH isomers more accessible for an initial reductive attack, a common mechanism in anoxic environments. Among the HCH isomers, ¿-HCH is degraded most easily while ß-HCH is most persistent. Little is known about the diversity of the microorganisms involved in anaerobic HCH degradation. Thus far, species within the genera Clostridium and Bacillus, two Desulfovibrio species, and one species each of Desulfococcus, Desulfobacter, Citrobacter and Dehalobacter have been found to metabolize lindane and other HCH isomers. Benzene and <b>monochlorobenzene</b> are the end products of anaerobic degradation, while in some studies pentachlorocyclohexane, tetrachlorocyclohexene, chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols have been detected as intermediates. Enzymes and coding genes involved in the reductive dechlorination of HCH isomers are largely unknown. Recently, a metagenomic analysis has indicated the presence of numerous putative reductive dehalogenase genes in the genome of ß-HCH degrading Dehalobacter sp. High-throughput omics techniques can help to explore the key players and enzymes involved in the reductive dehalogenation of lindane and other HCH isomers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the concepts behind and the software architecture of a simulation/optimization-based information and {{decision support system}} {{for the management of}} hazardous substances and their environment-technology interactions. This interactive system is implemented on a microcomputer workstation and combines data base management, system simulation and optimization, interactive data analysis and elements of decision technology with a symbolic display-oriented user interface. Important features of the interface are the use of several parallel or alternative styles of interaction and display, including color graphics and natural language. By combining quantitative methods with qualitative descriptions, and giving the user direct and interactive control over the system’s functions, human knowledge is integrated with formal approaches into a man-machine system through an intelligent and easily accessible user interface. Within this framework, component subsystems for the multi-criteria assessment of chemical technologies at the industry {{as well as at the}} plant and process level are discussed in more detail. At the plant level, a prototype application for the production of <b>monochlorobenzene</b> and chlorophenols is described. These examples of production processes in the chemical industry are connected with many highly toxic compounds including 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2, 3, 7, 8 TCDD). These processes serve as an example for the application of the decision support system for technology evaluation and assessment...|$|E
