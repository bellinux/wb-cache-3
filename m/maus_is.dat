25|$|Holden {{was born}} in Pasadena, California in 1958. He {{is the son of}} Joseph T. Holden, PhD, a biochemist, Emeritus Senior Scientist, and Director Emeritus of the Beckman Research Institute at the City of Hope National Medical Center. His mother, Nancy Holden, {{attended}} the original Little Red School House in New York City, and later earned an MS. A career educator, she founded a program for special needs children in Los Angeles and has been active as board member and president of various Jewish genealogy societies. Holden attended The Chandler School and was one of only four students to graduate from its short-lived high school. During that time he played on the same football team as Drew Pinsky (also known as “Dr. Drew”). Holden's wife, Takako, and his children, Maya and Alex, play prominent roles in the concluding chapter of Peripatetic Postcards. Mr. Big <b>Maus</b> <b>is</b> dedicated to Maya and Alex, as well as Holden's father.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 Holden {{published}} a novel, Mr. Big Maus, a caper centering on contemporary corporate culture run amok and one iconoclast's mission to rebalance an unjust world. Mr. Big <b>Maus</b> <b>is</b> {{a blend of}} late-modern, contemporary, and post-modern sensibilities, with a plot that is linear and integrated, which eschews mysticism, and provides action that is sudden, direct and rational. This is countered by a narrative that is ironic, characters who are self-reflexive yet irrational, and spiced with the nuance of metafiction. Its protagonist is flawed, disempowered, contending with alienation, and questing to discover identity. The plot presents universal themes {{within the context of}} everyday life and features evolution in its character’s lives. It offers the audience a moral resolution. Substantively, the book spotlights history and memory, celebrates intellect and speech, and is optimistic and ultimately uplifting. Among its key themes is discourse about: time, consciousness and human practices. This is seen, above all, through the constant presence, use, and dependence on technology (i.e. the emerging present and looming future), in contrast to the protagonist's constant nostalgia for a reliance on products of cinema, music, television and literature (i.e. the recent and distant past). A second theme is the changing America landscape—reflected in its ubiquitous immigrants—as well as the clash of generational and institutional values. A final theme, built from strands of the previous two, is the ways that innovation, invention, commercialization and business influence and are influenced by the poles of technological determinism and independent creative expression.|$|E
500|$|Early {{instalments}} of Maus {{that appeared}} in Raw inspired the young Chris Ware to [...] "try to do comics that had a 'serious' tone to them".

500|$|The German word <b>Maus</b> <b>is</b> cognate to the English word [...] "mouse", {{and also}} {{reminiscent}} of the German verb mauscheln, which means [...] "to speak like a Jew" [...] and refers to the way Jews from Eastern Europe spoke German—a word not etymologically related to Maus, but distantly to Moses.|$|E
500|$|<b>Maus</b> <b>is</b> {{a graphic}} novel by American {{cartoonist}} Art Spiegelman, serialized from 1980 to 1991. [...] It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father {{about his experiences}} as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. [...] The work employs postmodern techniques and represents Jews as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs. [...] Critics have classified Maus as memoir, biography, history, fiction, autobiography, or a mix of genres. [...] In 1992 it became the first graphic novel to win a Pulitzer Prize.|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman blurs {{the line}} between the frame and the world, such as when neurotically trying to deal with what <b>Maus</b> <b>is</b> {{becoming}} for him, he says to his wife, [...] "In real life you'd never have let me talk this long without interrupting." [...] When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse. [...] Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father's tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which [...] "helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities".|$|E

500|$|Spiegelman {{rendered}} the original three-page [...] "Maus" [...] and [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] in highly detailed, expressive styles. [...] Spiegelman planned to draw Maus {{in such a}} manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. [...] Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies. [...] Spiegelman {{wanted to get away}} from the rendering of the characters in the original [...] "Maus", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, [...] "tells you how to feel, tells you how to think". [...] He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments. [...] He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions. [...] The contrast between the artwork in [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] and Maus drives home the effectiveness of the simpler artwork—"Prisoner" [...] is alienating, while <b>Maus</b> <b>is</b> more inviting, encouraging deeper contemplation and understanding.|$|E
500|$|A cottage {{industry}} of academic research {{has built up}} around Maus, and schools have frequently used it as course material {{in a range of}} fields: history, dysfunctional family psychology, language arts, and social studies. [...] The volume of academic work published on Maus far surpasses that of any other work of comics. [...] One of the earliest such works was Joshua Brown's 1988 [...] "Of Mice and Memory" [...] from the Oral History Review, which deals with the problems Spiegelman faced in presenting his father's story. [...] Marianne Hirsch wrote an influential essay on post-memory called [...] "Family Pictures: Maus, Mourning, and Post-Memory", later expanded into a book called Family Frames: Photography, Narrative, and Postmemory. [...] Academics far outside the field of comics such as Dominick LaCapra, Linda Hutcheon, and Terrence Des Pres took part in the discourse. [...] Few approached Maus who were familiar with comics, largely {{because of the lack of}} an academic comics tradition—Maus tended to be approached as Holocaust history or from a film or literary perspective. [...] In 2003, Deborah Geis edited a collection of essays on Maus called Considering Maus: Approaches to Art Spiegelman's [...] "Survivor's Tale" [...] of the Holocaust. [...] <b>Maus</b> <b>is</b> considered an important work of Holocaust literature, and studies of it have made significant contributions to Holocaust studies.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{he rejects}} the label, <b>Maus</b> <b>is</b> {{recognized}} as a progenitor of the hypnagogic pop scene, a genre noted for its reliance on memory and nostalgia. His compositions tend to employ the use of particular modal scales previously associated with Renaissance and Medieval music, which he believes is often mistaken {{as an attempt to}} evoke the 1980s. He explains that [...] "I'm not trying to evoke that time, I just hear that sound and it seems to suit this time right now. ... People associate the kind of harmonies that associate from the modes with the 80s sound, and for me it's not about the 80s, it's about what I think the kind of harmony is that arises from these modes - what I'm interested in." [...] He adds: [...] "For whatever reason, the pioneers of electronic music that came out of Sheffield and Manchester in the 1980s became interested in these ecclesiastical modes that, historically, were associated with the divine. ... The palette was there in the 80s so why was it set aside and forgotten? That thread can be taken up again." [...] He goes on to opine that synthesizers and waveforms offer more [...] "color and possibility" [...] than the guitar, which he feels is an [...] "exhausted" [...] instrument.|$|E
