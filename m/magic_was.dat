Conversely, Chaos <b>magic</b> <b>was</b> to have consisted of harmful elemental attacks, detrimental status afflictions, and invisibility spells.|$|E
5|$|Alchemical <b>magic</b> <b>was</b> used {{to create}} or alter potions to achieve more {{powerful}} effects, repair or enchant items, identify unknown items or creatures, and combine different Order or Chaos spells to create spells with multiple elements (such as earth and fire spells creating a molten metal spell). Alchemical magic could also imbue a target with elemental attributes; for example, a warrior imbued with the Water element would deal extra cold-type damage but receive additional heat-type damage.|$|E

Others argue that <b>magic</b> <b>was</b> {{an important element of}} both Golden Age and Silver Age characters.

Science was a common explanation for the origin of heroes in the Silver Age.|$|E

The game received awards and nominations from several gaming publications, including the CESA Game Awards' Outstanding Performance Award. Versions were released for mobile phones and the Xbox Live Arcade in 2006 and 2008, respectively. A sequel, Meteos: Disney <b>Magic,</b> <b>was</b> released for the Nintendo DS in 2007.|$|E
5|$|While {{the game}} was simply called Magic through most of playtesting, when the game had to be officially named a lawyer {{informed}} them that the name <b>Magic</b> <b>was</b> too generic to be trademarked. Mana Clash was instead chosen to be the name used in the first solicitation of the game, however, everybody involved with the game continued to {{refer to it as}} Magic. After further consultation with the lawyer, it was decided to rename the game Magic: The Gathering, thus enabling the name to be trademarked.|$|E

5|$|For late Medieval Scotland {{there is}} {{evidence}} of occasional prosecutions of individuals for causing harm through witchcraft. High-profile political cases included the action against John Stewart, Earl of Mar for allegedly using sorcery against his brother King James III in 1479. Evidence of these political cases indicates that they were becoming rarer {{in the first half of}} the sixteenth century however. Popular belief in <b>magic</b> <b>was</b> widespread in the Middle Ages, but theologians had been generally sceptical, and lawyers only interested in prosecuting cases in which harm from <b>magic</b> <b>was</b> evident. From the late sixteenth century attitudes began to change, and witches were seen as deriving powers from the Devil, with the result that witchcraft was seen as a form of heresy. These ideas were widely accepted by both Catholics and Protestants in the sixteenth century. In the aftermath of the initial Reformation settlement of 1560, Parliament passed the Witchcraft Act 1563, one of a series of laws underpinning Biblical laws and similar to that passed in England a year earlier, which made the practice of witchcraft itself, and consulting with witches, capital crimes. The first witch-hunt under the act was in the east of the country in 1568–69 in Angus and the Mearns, where there were unsuccessful attempts to introduce elements of the diabolic pact and the hunt collapsed.|$|E

5|$|Sir Terence David John Pratchett, OBE (28 April 1948 – 12 March 2015), {{better known}} as Terry Pratchett, was an English author of fantasy novels, {{especially}} comical works. He {{is best known for}} his Discworld series of 41 novels. Pratchett's first novel, The Carpet People, was published in 1971. The first Discworld novel, The Colour of <b>Magic,</b> <b>was</b> published in 1983, after which he wrote two books a year on average. His 2011 Discworld novel Snuff was at the time of its release the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000copies in the first three days. His final Discworld novel, The Shepherd's Crown, was published in August 2015, five months after his death.|$|E

5|$|The first Discworld novel, The Colour of <b>Magic,</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in hardback by Colin Smythe Ltd in 1983. The paperback edition {{was published by}} Corgi, an imprint of Transworld, in 1985. Pratchett's popularity increased when the BBC's Woman's Hour broadcast The Colour of Magic as a serial in six parts, and later Equal Rites. Subsequently, the hardback rights were taken by the publishing house Victor Gollancz Ltd, which remained Pratchett's publisher until 1997, Colin Smythe having become Pratchett's agent. Pratchett was the first fantasy author published by Gollancz.|$|E
5|$|The game {{used the}} Infinity Engine, a game engine {{initially}} developed by BioWare for Baldur's Gate. However, Planescape: Torment was being developed using the Infinity Engine before Baldur's Gate had been released, leaving the engine's acceptance {{in the market}} still unknown. Black Isle made modifications to the engine to suit the game. For example, playable characters were able to run, and both the character sprites and backgrounds were larger and more detailed. The greater size and detail was achieved by bringing the perspective closer to the ground. <b>Magic</b> <b>was</b> also {{an important part of}} the game's design, and a team of four designers worked solely on the visuals and mechanics of spells.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{considered}} for development by WayForward Technologies {{as far back}} as 1997. An archived version of the company's official website showcases a very different approach to the game, which was at the time considered for development on PC or PlayStation, in full 3D with traditionally animated characters moving before a 3D background. Shantae was presented as a troubled genie born without magic powers, who had to save the world from the Jins, powerful beings once sealed who escaped {{at the beginning of the}} game and planned to drain all magic from the world. Back then, her <b>magic</b> <b>was</b> capable, as envisioned by Erin Bozon, the original creator of the character, to summon animals, but transformation was already planned as Shantae could turn into a harpy. Her dances could also launch attacks and she had different outfits with different characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Childrens <b>magic</b> <b>is</b> a {{specialized}} aspect of parlor <b>magic</b> and <b>is</b> meant to entertain children.

60|$|Secondly, <b>Magic</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} three sorts, viz., divine, natural, and diabolical. And natural <b>magic</b> <b>is</b> again {{subdivided}} into two kinds, simple and compound; and natural compound <b>magic</b> <b>is</b> again likewise divided into two kinds, viz., natural-divine magic, and natural-diabolical magic. Now, to give the reader a clear and a distinct notion of each several species of magic here mentioned, I set down the following definitions: Divine <b>magic</b> <b>is</b> a celestial science, in which all operations that are wonderfully brought about, are performed by the Spirit of God. Natural <b>magic</b> <b>is</b> a science {{in which all the}} mysterious acts that are wrought, are compassed by natural spirits. But as this natural <b>magic</b> may <b>be</b> exercised about things either in a manner indifferent in themselves, or mere morally good, and then it is mere natural magic; or else about things theologically good, and transcendently bad; and then it is not merely and natural magic, but mixed and compound. If natural <b>magic</b> <b>be</b> exercised about the most holy operations, it is then mixed with the divine, and may then be called, not improperly, natural-divine magic. But if natural magic troubles itself about compassing the wickedest practices, then is it promiscuous with the demoniacal, and may not improperly <b>be</b> called natural-diabolical <b>magic.</b>|$|R

5|$|Adventures of Mana is {{a remake}} of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, {{which was the first}} entry in the Mana series. It is the second remake of Final Fantasy Adventure, the first being the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana, which had removed the {{connections}} to the Final Fantasy series in favor of being more connected {{to the rest of the}} Mana series. According to Adventures of Manas producer, Masaru Oyamada, the development team focused on not upsetting what had made the original game good, while adding things that had not been possible to do in the original version due to hardware limitations; they also aimed to make the game more comfortable and intuitive to play: for instance, switching armor and weapons and using items and <b>magic</b> <b>was</b> made easier, and shortcut commands were added. The game borrows some elements from the original Game Boy version, and some from Sword of Mana. For example, the first remake introduced the ability to play as the heroine, but Adventures of Mana, like the original, only has a male playable character; conversely Adventures of Manas battle system, user interface and sword attack are based on Sword of Manas rather than the original's. Kenji Ito, the composer for Final Fantasy Adventure, returned to create updated and more dramatic rearrangements for the remake.|$|E
5|$|Despite Autumn Games' {{support and}} desire to expand Skullgirls, their {{continued}} litigation prevented the publisher from providing any financial backing. Attempting {{to pick up where}} they left off, Lab Zero Games decided to ask its fanbase for help once more, following the success of the EVO 2013 charity drive. On February 25, 2013, Lab Zero Games set up an Indiegogo page for Skullgirls, in an effort to raise $150,000 {{for the development of the}} game's first DLC character, Squigly. Contributors received various rewards, including desktop wallpapers, a digital copy of the official soundtrack, Steam keys for the PC release, Steam keys for Half-Minute Hero, and the chance to add a background character to the game, among others. The campaign reached its initial goal in less than 24 hours, while the stretch goal of a second DLC character, Big Band, secured funding in just over 2 weeks. A third DLC character, determined by fan vote, was funded during the final two days, along with a playable robotic version of Ms. Fortune named Robo-Fortune. An additional stretch goal that would provide a free license for the game's engine, Z-Engine, to the developers of Them's Fightin' Herds (at the time called Fighting is <b>Magic)</b> <b>was</b> also funded. With minutes left before the end of the drive, the last stretch goal was met, securing funding for another fan-selected DLC character. The Indiegogo campaign raised nearly $830,000 of its original $150,000 goal. Several alternate character and announcer voice packs were also funded. All downloadable characters and voice packs were free to download on all platforms within the first three months of their release.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2005, the mobile-game {{publisher}} Gameloft {{announced that}} they would bring Meteos and Q Entertainment's other puzzle game, Lumines, to cell phones. The game was released on March 30, 2006, as Meteos Astro Blocks. In 2006, Buena Vista Games announced they would publish four Q Entertainment games, including the then-unannounced Meteos: Disney Magic for the Nintendo DS. A sequel to Meteos, Meteos: Disney Magic, developed by Platinum Egg and Aspect Co., follows Meteos basic concept {{with a number of}} changes—most notably, replacing the game's alien species with Disney characters. The Nintendo DS was held sideways, creating a taller playing field on the touchscreen. Disney characters Mickey Mouse, Jack Sparrow, and Winnie the Pooh are featured in the game, whose plot involves restoring order in the storybook vault after its contents are mysteriously rearranged. A significant change in gameplay was the ability to drag tiles left and right; in Meteos, tiles could only be moved up and down. Meteos: Disney <b>Magic</b> <b>was</b> released in North America on February 22, 2007, and in Europe on June 1. It had a cooler reception than its predecessor, with a score of 74 out of 100 from Metacritic. Phil Theobald, who also reviewed the first Meteos, while enjoying Disney Magic, thought that the lowered difficulty made it less fun.|$|E
