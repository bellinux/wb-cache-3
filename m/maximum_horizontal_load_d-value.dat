In this study, two types of cyclic loading tests were adopted: 1) of increased amplitude at every new cycle, 2) of constant amplitude. Results obtained from this experiment are as follows: 1) under cyclic loading with increased amplitude, two types of local buckling: elephant foot bulge mode and diamond shaped mode, are generated near the base depending upon the radius-thickness ratio; 2) the effects of radius-thickness ratio and compressive axial <b>load</b> on the <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> are small; and 3) the <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> may not be affected by the loading types...|$|R
40|$|Simplified {{method of}} {{analysis}} for the structural response of a regular multi-story frame to combined constant vertical and monotonically increasing <b>horizontal</b> <b>loads</b> have been investigated. Complete elasto-plastic analysis of the frame is carried out by separating the frame {{into a number of}} subframes and performing piecewise elastic analysis on each subframe making use of the load increment technique. For a subframe considered, rotation angles at joints in the same floor are assumed to be identical, and this makes the formulation of the governing equation simple, which is derived from the slope-deflection equations in view of the equilibrium conditions. Two possible avenues of approach to solve the joint rotations from the governing equation {{at all levels of the}} frame are presented. The validity of the Merchant-Rankine formula has been verified from the results obtained in the parametric study, and the use of it to determine the <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> is illustrated.

40|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> impact <b>load</b> {{experienced}} by the aircraft landing gear wheel during landing is an important parameter in landing gear safety design and performance analysis. Using a non-contact photoelectric testing method, this paper experimentally obtained the dynamic data of the instantaneous rotational speed for an aircraft wheel when it contacts the platform. Moreover, the kinetic relationship between the transient rotational speed of the aircraft wheel and the force of horizontal impact was established. According to the change data measured from the transient rotational speed of the aircraft wheel, the <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> impact <b>load</b> at the instant of aircraft contact with the platform was calculated.

The horizontal forces were altemately applied on the second and top floors of the frame. The ultimate strength and the inelastic horizontal load-displacement curve of the frame were calculated and the experimental results were compared with them. The experimental observations and the discussions are summarized as follows: 1) When the relative horizontal displacement reached h/ 100 (h=story height) in the first story, the <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> was observed. And a window pane was broken in the first story. 2) The concrete block wall, which tends to be neglected in the structural calculation, affects the strength and crack pattｅrns of the column with it. 3) The horizontal ultimate strength of a frame with weak-columns and strong-beams can be estimated by summing up the smaller of the values for either bending or shearing ultimate loads carrying capacity of a column. 4) The calculated inelastic curve based on Sugano 2 ̆ 7 s method fairly well agrees with the envelope of the horizontal load-displacement curves obtained from the tests. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the methodology {{to perform a}} conceptual structural design of the landing gears and the dynamic landing loads for the Unmanned Space re-entry Vehicle USV 3, currently under development at CIRA. The landing gear preliminary design is usually carried-out by responding to requirements of maximum overall dimensions, maximum weight and maximum attainable load factor. The oleo-pneumatic mechanism is conceived {{with the aim of}} maximizing the oleo-pneumatic efficiency, since it is critically depending on the maximum vertical load factor and on the strut length, whereas the structure is generally sized by combining the design vertical loads with the <b>maximum</b> expected <b>horizontal</b> <b>loads.</b> The <b>horizontal</b> drag component simulating the force required to accelerate the tires and wheels up to the landing speed (spin-up) and the forward acting <b>horizontal</b> <b>load</b> resulting from rapid reduction of the spin-up drag loads (spring-back) must be evaluated. The dynamic model of the landing gear system, fully nonlinear and taking into account the structural flexibility has been conceived. In particular, the dynamic model is made of subsystems based on statistical evaluations and/or semi-empirical equations; these subsystems should be easy manageable, making the whole system simple to analyze for different values of the project parameters. The model is used for material selection and preliminary sizing of components through dynamic analyses. At the same time, <b>maximum</b> expected <b>horizontal</b> <b>loads</b> are evaluated in an iterative manner, the entire process leads to the conceptual design of the landing gear. A method to carry-out the dynamic landing simulations by integration of the vehicle equations with those of each undercarriage (pseudo-elastic, fully nonlinear dynamic equations) has been defined and applied to the USV 3 vehicle. The coupling between the vehicle and the landing gears has been performed by using a kinematic approach, i. e. the aircraft is considered rigid. The developed methodology is entirely encoded in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, and linked to excel sheets for the input and output data management. Dynamic landing simulations on two and three points have been performed for evaluating the maximum responses of spin-up and spring back loads in a rational manner. A sensitivity analysis involving landing horizontal and vertical speed, and tire inflation pressure completes the whole work. A comparison of resulting <b>horizontal</b> <b>loads</b> with those obtained by using the Appendix C and D of STANAG 4671 (USAR) shows the convenience to use the rational approach presented herein. In fact the attained lower structural loads may lead to potential weight and cost reduction from the earliest phases of design...|$|R
40|$|Investigating the {{response}} of skirted foundations to uniaxial vertical, <b>horizontal</b> and moment <b>loading</b> as well as under the combinations of these loads is key feature in their designing procedure. Naturally the offshore loads take place under undrained conditions and the short term response of a foundation in undrained soil is most critical. Therefore investigating the foundation response in undrained condition is conservative. In this paper, a series of three-dimensional finite element analyses are performed to investigate {{the response}} of skirted foundations in undrained uniform soil under uniaxial vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>loads.</b> Uniaxial ultimate vertical and <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> bearing capacities are presented for different embedment ratios “ 0 ≤ L/D ≤ 1 ”, where L is the embedment length and D is the caisson diameter. The <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> capacity corresponds to purely horizontal translation where the rotation degree of freedom is constrained.

The approximately east–west <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> stress orientation is consistent {{over much of the}} basin, except in the Patchawarra Trough where <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> stress rotates to a northwest–southeast orientation.

The stress field in the Cooper Basin appears to mark the apex of a major horseshoe-shaped rotation in <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> stress direction across central eastern Australia. Finite element modelling of the in situ stress field of the Indo–Australian Plate (IAP) using a range of plate-scale tectonic forces is able to match the regional <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> stress orientation over most of Australia reasonably well, including the mean east–west <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> stress orientation in the Cooper Basin. However, plate boundary–scale modelling does not adequately match the horseshoe-shaped stress rotation across central eastern Australia. The average east–west <b>maximum</b> <b>horizontal</b> stress orientation in the Cooper Basin indicates that stresses from tensional forces acting along the Tonga–Kermadec subduction zone are not transmitted into the interior of the Australian plate. The majority of the tensional forces associated with the Tonga–Kermadec subduction zone are most likely accommodated along the numerous spreading centres within the Lau–Havre backarc basin. A number of more localized stress anomalies have also been identified. These cannot be explained by plate-scale tectonic forces and are possibly a result of geological structure and/or density contrasts locally perturbing the stress field. Scott D. Reynolds, Scott D.

Column foot transfer seismic energy all from the bottom of structure to upper structure.

If the external force is larger than the friction force at column foot, slip will appear to the column foot. Column will rotate under the effect of <b>horizontal</b> <b>load,</b> which is named as “column rocking with slip”. At this working state, the shear force at column foot is equal to the friction force according to the horizontal force equilibrium equation. And, the load transferred from the bottom of column foot to upper structure is same with friction force, which plays an obvious seismic isolation effects. After seismic load, column may be in a new state with irreclaimable slip, which is named as “full compression with slip”. During column rocking, if the restoring moment is less than the external moment, column will overturn, which is named as “column overturning”.

Eventually, the vertical stress was again slowly increased to the designed value (27  MPa) to finish the 3 D stress loading.
