5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the <b>mortgage</b> <b>market</b> and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

40|$|Financialization can be {{characterized}} as capital switching from the primary, secondary or tertiary circuit to the quaternary circuit of capital. Housing is a central aspect of financialization. The financialization of <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets</b> demands that not just homes but also homeowners become viewed as financially exploitable. It is exemplified by the securitization of mortgage loans, but also by the use of credit scoring and risk-based pricing. In the past century, <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets</b> were transformed from being a ‘facilitating market’ for homeowners in need of credit to one increasingly facilitating global investment. Since <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets</b> are both local consumer markets and global investment markets, the dynamics of financialization and globalization directly relate homeowners to global investors thereby increasing the volatility in <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets,</b> as the current crisis shows all too well...|$|R

To date, quantitative analysis on the depth of <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets</b> across a broad set of countries has been very limited.

The present paper might be accepted as the updated and enriched version of existing research for the European region in terms of the coverage of countries, historical data and the empirical analyses.

One of the most notable results of this study is that, statistical significance of explanatory variables in modeling the depth of the <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets</b> depends heavily on both the variables, countries (regions) included in the models and the regression methodology used. Hence, we argue that strong conclusions based on such analyses should be avoided and the findings of previous research on the variations of the depth of <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets</b> should be carefully evaluated...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{technique}} {{to assess the impact}} of changes in <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets</b> on households, exploiting an implication of the permanent income hypothesis: The higher a household's expected future income, the higher its desired consumption, ceteris paribus. With perfect credit markets, desired consumption matches actual consumption and current spending forecasts future income. Because credit market imperfections mute this effect, the extent to which house spending predicts future income measures the "imperfectness" of <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets.</b> Using micro-data, we find that since the early 1980 s, <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets</b> have become less imperfect in this sense, and securitization has played an important role.

25|$|The Great Depression wrought {{havoc on}} the U.S. housing market. By 1933, an {{estimated}} 20 to 25% of the nation's outstanding mortgage debt was in default. Fannie Mae was established in 1938 by amendments to the National Housing Act as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Originally chartered as the National Mortgage Association of Washington, the organization's explicit purpose was to provide local banks with federal money to finance home mortgages {{in an attempt to}} raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing. Fannie Mae created a liquid secondary <b>mortgage</b> <b>market</b> and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more housing loans, primarily by buying Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgages. For the first thirty years following its inception, Fannie Mae held a monopoly over the secondary <b>mortgage</b> <b>market.</b> Other considerations may have motivated the New Deal focus on the housing market: {{about a third of the}} nation's unemployed were in the building trade, and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build.|$|E

25|$|To {{facilitate}} the securitization of non-mortgage assets, businesses substituted private credit enhancements. First, they over-collateralised pools of assets; shortly thereafter, they improved third-party and structural enhancements. In 1985, securitization techniques {{that had been}} developed in the <b>mortgage</b> <b>market</b> were applied {{for the first time}} to a class of non-mortgage assets — automobile loans. A pool of assets second only to mortgages in volume, auto loans were a good match for structured finance; their maturities, considerably shorter than those of mortgages, made the timing of cash flows more predictable, and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence.|$|E
25|$|Originally, Fannie had an 'explicit guarantee' {{from the}} {{government}}; {{if it got}} in trouble, the government promised to bail it out. This changed in 1968. Ginnie Mae was split off from Fannie. Ginnie retained the explicit guarantee. Fannie, however, became a private corporation, chartered by Congress and with a direct line of credit to the US Treasury. It was its nature as a Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) that provided the 'implied guarantee' for their borrowing. The charter also limited their business activity to the <b>mortgage</b> <b>market.</b> In this regard, although they were a private company, they could not operate like a regular private company.|$|E
25|$|The first {{significant}} bank credit card sale came to market in 1986 {{with a private}} placement of $50 million of outstanding bank card loans.

After the success of this initial transaction, investors grew to accept credit card receivables as collateral, and banks developed structures to normalize the cash flows.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how {{financial}} institutions function in an imperfectly competitive market, {{one that is}} repeatedly shocked by financial innovations and governmental interventions and is always in disequilibrium. It does not consider whether or not financial institutions caused the collapse of real estate markets, but instead offers reasons why major lenders moved in the <b>mortgage</b> <b>markets</b> as they did. The paper is concerned primarily with real estate lending and financial institutions in the 1980 s. However, a long history preceded the recent real estate collapse and, as in a Greek tragedy, the hubris of the principals probably made the collapse inevitable.

25|$|Associated Press {{reported}} that {{in response to the}} costs that the legislation places on banks, some banks have ended the practice of giving their customers free checking. Small banks have been forced to end some businesses such as mortgages and car loans in response to the new regulations. The size of regulatory compliance teams has grown. The Heritage Foundation, calling attention to the new ability of borrowers to sue lenders for misjudging their ability to repay a loan, predicted that smaller lenders would be forced to exit the <b>mortgage</b> <b>market</b> due to increased risk. One study has shown that smaller banks have been hurt by the regulations of the Dodd–Frank Act. Community banks' share of the US banking assets and lending market fell from over 40% in 1994 to around 20% today, although this is a misleading at best but highly likely inaccurate number considering the Dodd-Frank was implemented 16 years later than 1994.
