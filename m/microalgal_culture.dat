The method {{was based on a}} specific program called AlgaSim coupled with the adding-doubling method: at the individual cell scale, AlgaSim simulates the spectral properties of one model, three-layer spherical algal cell from its size and chemical composition. As a second step, the adding-doubling method makes it possible to retrieve the total transmittance of the algal medium from the optical properties of the individual algal cells. The method was tested by comparing the simulated total transmittance spectra for dense marine microalgal cultures of Isochrysis galbana (small flagellates) and Phaeodactylum tricornutum (diatoms) to spectra measured using an experimental spectrophotometric setup. Our study revealed that the total transmittance spectra simulated for the quasi-spherical cells of Isochrysis galbana were in good agreement with the measured spectra over the whole spectral range. For Phaeodactylum tricornutum, large differences between simulated and measured spectra were observed over the blue part of the transmittance spectra, probably due to non-spherical shape of the algal cells. Prediction of the algal cell density, mean size and pigment composition from the total transmittance spectra measured on algal samples was also investigated using the reversal of the method. Mean cell size was successfully predicted for both species. The cell density was also successfully predicted for spherical Isochrysis galbana, with a relative error below 7 %, but not for elongated Phaeodactylum tricornutum with a relative error up to 26 %. The pigments total quantity and composition, the carotenoids:chlorophyll ratio in particular, were also successfully predicted for Isochrysis galbana with a relative error below 8 %. However, the pigment predictions and measurements for Phaeodactylum tricornutum showed large discrepancies, with a relative error up to 88 %.

We studied flocculation induced by high pH to concentrate <b>microalgal</b> <b>cultures,</b> both for a freshwater green algae (Chlorella vulgaris) and a marine diatom model species (Phaeodactylum tricornutum).

Up to 88 % reduction was obtained by dosing 40 g L− 1 after 24 h of contact time. Then, culturing tests were performed on a microalgal inoculum including mainly Chlorella spp. and Scenedesmus spp. under controlled temperature and light conditions during 6 – 14 weeks. Raw, stripped, and stripped and adsorbed digestate samples were tested. The biomass production rate increased from 27 ± 13 mg TSS L− 1 d− 1 on raw digestate, to 82 ± 18 mg TSS L− 1 d− 1 by using stripped digestate, and to 220 ± 78 mg TSS L− 1 d− 1 by using the stripped and adsorbed digestate. Moreover, nitrification was constantly suppressed when using the stripped and adsorbed digestate, while relevant nitrite built-up was observed when using raw and stripped digestate. These results suggest that microalgae are able to grow on the raw digestate, provided that long hydraulic retention times are applied. A much faster growth (up to 10 times) can be obtained by pretreating the liquid {{fraction of}} digestate by stripping and adsorption, which may be an effective means of improving the areal productivity of <b>microalgal</b> <b>culturing</b> on digestates...|$|R
40|$|A perfusion-cell {{bleeding}} culture {{strategy was}} developed for enhancing the productivity of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) by the diatom Nitzschia laevis. As the strategy combined the concepts of continuous culture and perfusion culture, it allowed continuously and simultaneously harvesting the algal cells and removing inhibitory compounds during the cultivation. Compared with a single operation of continuous culture, the perfusion-cell bleeding culture greatly enhanced the steady-state biomass concentration, biomass productivity, EPA yield, EPA productivity and glucose utilization efficiency. The perfusion-cell bleeding culture also allowed higher biomass productivity and EPA productivity than the single perfusion culture did. At a bleeding rate of 0. 67 day- 1 and a perfusion rate of 0. 6 day- 1, the EPA productivity achieved 175 mg 1 - 1 day- 1, which is the highest ever reported in <b>microalgal</b> <b>cultures.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the biochemical suitability of Australian native microalgal species Scenedesmus sp., Nannochloropsis sp., Dunaliella sp., and a chlorophytic polyculture as nutritional supplements for human health. The four <b>microalgal</b> <b>cultures</b> were harvested during exponential growth, lyophilized, and analysed for proximate composition (moisture, ash, lipid, carbohydrates, and protein), pigments, and amino acid and fatty acid profiles. The resulting nutritional value, based on biochemical composition, was compared to commercial Spirulina and Chlorella products. The Australian native microalgae exhibited similar, and in several cases superior, organic nutritional properties relative to the assessed commercial products, with biochemical profiles rich in high-quality protein, nutritious polyunsaturated fats (such as α-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid), and antioxidant pigments. These findings indicate that the microalgae assessed have great potential as multi-nutrient human health supplements...|$|R
