5|$|As {{with almost}} all sexually {{transmitted}} infections, women are <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to acquiring genital HSV-2 than men. On an annual basis, {{without the use}} of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk of HSV-2 from infected male to female is about 8–11%.|$|E
5|$|Glass fibers {{are useful}} thermal {{insulators}} {{because of their}} high ratio of surface area to weight. However, the increased surface area makes them much <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to chemical attack.

5|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} announced {{findings that}} sublethal exposure to imidacloprid rendered honey bees significantly <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to infection by the fungus Nosema, thereby suggesting a potential link to CCD, given that Nosema is increasingly considered {{to contribute to}} CCD.|$|E
40|$|Phototherapy {{is largely}} {{used in the}} {{management}} of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, but its safety is very far from being proved. The Authors studied the effectiveness of daylight in low-birth-weight newborns. The results obtained show that the reduction of bilirubin induced by phototherapy is related with gestational age and intra-uterine growth. The very low-birth-weight infants, at higher risk of kernicterus, as they are more responsives to phototherapy, as well they are, probably, <b>more</b> <b>susceptibles</b> to side-effects. The Authors think that phototherapy should be planned on the basis of such observations...|$|R
40|$|Available {{resources}} to tackle an epidemic infection are usually limited, while {{time and effort}} required to control it are increasing functions of the starting time of the containment effort. The problem of scheduling limited available resources, when there are several areas where the population is infected, is considered. A deterministic model, appropriate for large populations, where random interactions can be averaged out, {{is used for the}} epidemic’s rate of spread. The problem is tackled using the concept of deteriorating jobs, i. e. the model represents increasing loss rate as <b>more</b> <b>susceptibles</b> become infected, and increasing time and effort needed for the epidemic’s containment...|$|R
40|$|In November 2002, the Netherlands {{adopted a}} {{vaccination}} program targeted at behavioural risk groups. Between January 2003 and December 2007, 1386 patients acutely infected with HBV were reported. Reported cases declined from 326 in 2003 to 220 in 2007. Sexual intercourse {{was the most}} frequently reported mode of transmission (65 %), especially among men having sex with men. Genotypes A and D remained predominant. In total, 40, 600 participants were fully vaccinated, the overall compliance was 62 %, and the estimated overall program coverage was 12 % of the at-risk population. With <b>more</b> effort, <b>more</b> <b>susceptibles</b> may be reached, but the program will {{not be sufficient to}} substantially reduce HBV in the Netherlands. Therefore, universal vaccination should be considered. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} factors make people <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to TB infections. The most {{important}} risk factor globally is HIV; 13% of all people with TB are infected by the virus. This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of HIV are high. Of people without HIV who are infected with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those coinfected with HIV develop the active disease.|$|E
5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular {{menstruation}} {{that lasts}} {{for a few}} days (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience Menorrhagia are <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to iron deficiency than the average person. An enzyme called plasmin inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid.|$|E
50|$|Risk {{factors for}} HN include poorly {{controlled}} moderate to high blood pressure, older age, other kidney disorders. and Afro-Caribbean background - unclear {{whether this is}} due to them being <b>more</b> genetically <b>susceptible</b> to kidney damage by hypertension or whether it is because of poor management of high blood pressure amongst them.|$|R
30|$|The affect heuristic: Explains how {{the current}} affective state may {{influence}} human judgements. For example, when {{in a positive}} mood, one may be <b>more</b> easily <b>susceptible</b> to deception and manipulation because of a tendency to making hasty and possibly incorrect judgements, whereas one may be less inclined to do so when in a negative mood.|$|R

5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not only that Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to physical injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{two studies}} were {{published}} showing that neonicotinoids affect bee long-term and short-term memory, suggesting {{a cause of}} action resulting in failure {{to return to the}} hive. In another study done in 2013, scientists reported that experiments suggested that exposure to the neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin and imidicloprid results in increased levels of a particular protein in bees that inhibits a key molecule involved in the immune response, making the insects <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to attack by harmful viruses.|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the susceptibility of 312 extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates {{with that of}} 1, 216 ESBL nonproducers. Of ESBL producers, 25 % were susceptible to gentamicin, 30 % to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 41 % to ciprofloxacin, and 60 % to piperacillin-tazobactam. ESBL nonproducers were <b>more</b> often <b>susceptible</b> to these agents. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae represent {{a major source of}} resistance to various antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|Using {{decision}} analysis we evaluated {{the benefits and}} risks of continued primary reliance on oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) compared to use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). We followed a hypothetical cohort of 3. 5 million children from birth to age 30 assuming 95 per cent coverage with 98 per cent effective vaccine. Primary reliance on IPV would result in more cases of paralytic poliomyelitis as well as <b>more</b> <b>susceptibles</b> remaining in the population than would be expected with continuing OPV use (74. 1 vs 10. 0 cases and 5. 9 per cent vs 1. 1 per cent susceptibles, respectively). However, with OPV use, most cases of paralysis seen {{would be associated with}} the vaccine. Our analysis supports a continuation of current US policy placing primary reliance on OPV but the conclusion is heavily dependent on assumptions of risk of exposure to wild virus in the United States. Major declines in risk of exposure to wild virus could alter the balance significantly...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative uropathogens isolated from pregnant women. Methods: We performed a snapshot cohort study of women receiving {{care in the}} University of Florida prenatal clinics during March 2000. Subjects with asymptomatic bacteriuria or cystitis were identified and the antimicrobial susceptibility of each pathogen was recorded. Data were analyzed using chi-square, Fisher’s exact test and ninety-five percent confidence intervals, as appropriate. Results: Ninety-five positive cultures were identified. Isolates were <b>more</b> often <b>susceptible</b> to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (87 %) and nitrofurantoin (89 %) than to ampicillin (72 %) (p < 0. 03). Escherichia coli accounted for 71 (75 %) cases and was <b>more</b> often <b>susceptible</b> to nitrofurantoin (100 %) than to TMP-SMX (87 %) (p < 0. 01). Proteus isolates were all susceptible to TMP-SMX and resistant to nitrofurantoin (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Both TMP-SMX and nitrofurantoin are superior to ampicillin for empiric treatment of lower urinary tract infection in pregnant women. Nitrofurantoin is superior to TMP-SMX for treatment of infections caused by E. coli. For suspected or confirmed cases caused by Proteus organisms, TMP-SMX is the preferred agent...|$|R
5|$|Most {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in red blood cell count (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and shortness of breath. A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1940s, {{wildfires}} {{burned through}} the Little Applegate River watershed frequently. The United States Forest Service began fire suppression {{efforts in the}} 1920s, and a smokejumper station was built about 20 years later. Species that depend on fire to reproduce—such as ponderosa pine—declined in population, while Douglas-fir and white fir spread. Buckbrush and manzanita, normally chaparral plants, encroached on the oak savanna regions. The vegetation in the watershed continues to grow denser, making it <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to insect infestations and disease.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} are <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> than aluminium {{to external}} corrosion, particularly in seawater, {{and may be}} galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It {{is not difficult to}} monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E
5|$|There {{are areas}} which people {{believe to be}} {{protected}} from tornadoes, whether by being in a city, near a major river, hill, or mountain, or even protected by supernatural forces. Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, affect valleys, and have damaged several city centers.

5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E

40|$|For serum-resistant {{clinical}} isolates of Escherichia coli {{were grown}} {{in the presence of}} various subinhibitory concentrations of mecillinam or pivmecillinam and then exposed to the bactericidal action of human serum. All strains became <b>more</b> serum <b>susceptible</b> as a result of pregrowth in medium containing mecillinam, but the concentration of antibiotic needed to produce the effect varied according to the strain being used.

5|$|Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were {{becoming}} inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to disease.

Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks {{did not have the}} delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.|$|E
5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become <b>more</b> <b>susceptible</b> to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by {{changes at the}} gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B.
