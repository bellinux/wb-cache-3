500|$|After the game, Gary Anderson was {{described}} as [...] "inconsolable." [...] Although the Vikings still led by seven points at the time, his missed kick had a demoralizing effect on the team. ESPN contributor Ben Goessling noted [...] "how swiftly it pulled the bottom {{out from under a}} team that had an air of inevitability about it to that point." [...] Writing for the website Sporting News, Jeff Diamond, the Vikings' general manager in 1998, observed that, [...] "Our team played the rest of the game as if it was in shock that our automatic kicker had missed at the most critical time." [...] Randle concurred, describing his reaction to the kick as, [...] "I was standing there like someone just punched me in <b>my</b> <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry {{became known}} as one of the best punt {{blockers}} in the game while playing for Washington & Jefferson. Years later, he cited a blocked punt in 1916 as his greatest thrill as a player. Taking the ball off the punter's toe and running it back 40 yards for a touchdown, Henry recalled: [...] "The ball plopped right against <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> never bounced as I threw my arms around it." ...|$|E

During this time, Cao Pi personally visited him, held his hand and sobbed with grief. Xiahou Shang died shortly after. Cao Pi honoured him with the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Dao" [...] (悼侯) and wrote an official eulogy for him: [...] "(Xiahou) Shang had been a close companion to me since my childhood. He was loyal, sincere and faithful. Although we did not have the same parents, we were as close as brothers. He was like <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> heart, and like claws and teeth to me. He was intelligent, perceptive and exceptionally brilliant. It is a pity that his life ended so early. Alas, such is life! I hereby grant him the posthumous appointment of Senior General Who Attacks the South and award him the seal of the Marquis of Changling." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{purchaser}} {{took me to}} his {{apartments and}} commenced operations immediately. Having cut off my ears, however, he discovered signs of animation.

5000|$|Many {{authors have}} noted the highly toxic nature of barbel roe when eaten by humans, {{including}} Dame Juliana Berners and Charles David Badham. Badham relates the experience of Italian physician Antonio Gazius, who, he says, [...] "took two boluses, and thus describes his sensations: 'At first I felt no inconvenience, but some hours having elapsed, I began to be disagreeably affected, <b>and</b> as <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> swelled, <b>and</b> could not be brought down again by anise or carminatives, I was soon {{in a state of}} great depression and distress.' His countenance was pallid, like a man in a swoon, deadly coldness ensued, violent cholera and vomiting came after until the roe was passed, and then he became all right." ...|$|R

60|$|Bear with {{me while}} I explain {{the way of}} my {{reasoning}} and of my innocence.

Unfortunately for <b>my</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> mucous membranes, Nelson had a strange quirk of nature that made him find happiness in treating me to beer. I had no moral disinclination for beer, and just because I didn't like the taste of it and the weight of it was no reason I should forgo the honour of his company. It was his whim to drink beer, and to have me drink beer with him. Very well, I would put up with the passing discomfort.|$|E
