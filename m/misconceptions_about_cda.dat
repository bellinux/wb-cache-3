40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> dementia and its associated factors in Hong Kong. To address the relationship between misconceptions and tendency to seek treatment or information. Design: Survey type quantitative study. Subjects: 1002 Hong Kong people (433 males and 569 females). Main outcome measures: Perceived prevalence of dementia, <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> dementia, treatment seeking tendency, and interest in dementia related information. Results: High level of <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> dement ia was observed. In general, male gender, absence of demented relatives and low education level predicted endorsement of various <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> dementia. Participants who displayed higher level of <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> dementia were less willing to seek treatment in face of dementia and displayed less interest in dementia related information. Conclusion: More {{can be done by}} concerned parties to increase the general public's awareness of dementing features so as to promote its early detection and intervention. Besides looking out for commonly missed symptoms and conducting proper assessments, general practitioners can help clarify myths and advise on the benefits of early treatment. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Teachers’ {{insight into}} <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> simple circuits. Many studies on learners’ <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> {{electricity}} {{have been published}} internationally, but studies on teachers’ awareness of these misconceptions are few. This article reports on a case study to investigate to what extent South African teachers understand learners’ <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> series and parallel circuits, {{and to what extent}} such understandings are integrated into their pedagogical content knowledge. Nine teachers from public schools were purposefully selected to participate in the study. Qualitative data were collected from questionnaires and interviews. It was found that teachers often indicate simple misconceptions as sources of learners’ mistakes, but that misconceptions related to incorrect analysis are seldom mentioned. Furthermore, it was found that these teachers’ knowledge <b>about</b> <b>misconceptions</b> was fragmented and not integrated with their understanding of basic concepts. The results indicate that these teachers display inadequate pedagogical content knowledge regarding <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> series and parallel circuits. It is recommended that pedagogical content knowledge regarding misconceptions should be developed during teacher training...|$|R

This paper reports on pre-service teachers’ <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> the density of decimals. Written test data from 140 Indonesian pre-service teachers, observation of group and classroom discussions provided evidence of pre-service teachers’ difficulties in grasping the density notion of decimals. This research was situated in a teacher education university in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Incorrect analogies resulting from over generalization of knowledge about whole numbers and fractions were identified. Teaching ideas to resolve these difficulties and challenges in resolving pre-service teachers’ misconceptions are discussed. Evidence from this research indicates {{that it is possible}} to remove <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> density of decimals...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} the incidence {{and type of}} <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) harboured by university students.   Method. A convenience sample of 705 university students were recruited and data were collected using an electronic survey. The link to the survey was sent via e-mail to all registered students at Stellenbosch University. The participants had to complete the Common <b>Misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> Traumatic Brain Injury (CM-TBI) questionnaire.   Results. The {{findings of this study}} suggest that the students subscribe to misconceptions from each of the 7 categories of <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> TBIs. The mean percentages of <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> TBIs were calculated and the amnesia (mean 49. 7 %) and unconsciousness (mean 46. 1 %) categories were identified as the categories about which the respondents had the most misconceptions, while the mean percentages of misconceptions were lower for the categories of recovery (mean 27. 6 %), rehabilitation (mean 26. 56 %), prevention (mean 20. 8 %), brain injury sequelae (mean 18. 7 %) and brain damage (mean 8. 4 %).   Conclusion. Generally, these findings appear to be in keeping with previous literature, which suggests that <b>misconceptions</b> <b>about</b> TBIs are common among the general population. This study’s identification of these misconceptions could help create awareness, provide a focus for information provision, and contribute to the development of educational intervention programmes tailored for the South African context...|$|R
