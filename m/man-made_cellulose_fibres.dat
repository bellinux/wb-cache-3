40|$|The {{production}} {{of textile materials}} has undergone {{dramatic changes in the}} last century. <b>Man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> have played an important role for more than 70 years. Today, the man-made cellulose fibre industry is the worldwide second largest biorefinery (next to the paper industry). In the last few years, the interest in <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> has grown as a consequence of increased environmental awareness and the depletion of fossil fuels. However, an environmental assessment of modern <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> has not been conducted so far. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the environmental impact of <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres.</b> Five staple fibre products, i. e., 1) Lenzing Viscose Asia, 2) Lenzing Viscose Austria, 3) Lenzing Modal, 4) Tencel Austria, and 5) Tencel Austria 2012, are analysed by means of Life cycle assessment (LCA). The system boundary is cradle to factory gate. We compare the results with conventional cotton, novel bio-based fibres (PLA fibres), and fossil fuel-based fibres (PET and PP). The inventory data for the {{production of}} <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> were provided by Lenzing AG. The inventory data for cotton, PET, PP, and PLA were obtained from literature sources. The environmental indicators analysed include resources and the impact categories covered by CML 2000 baseline method. The indicators for resources include non-renewable energy use (NREU), renewable energy use (REU), cumulative energy demand (CED), water use, and land use. The environmental impact indicators covered by the CML method are global warming potential (GWP) 100 a, abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation, acidification, and eutrophication. In addition, the system boundary of cradle to factory gate plus end-of-life waste management was analysed for NREU and GWP. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses have been carried out to understand the influence of various assumptions and allocation methods. The LCA results show that Lenzing Viscose Austria and Lenzing Modal offer environmental benefits in all categories (except for land use and water use) compared to Lenzing Viscose Asia. Tencel Austria 2012, Lenzing Viscose Austria, Lenzing Modal, and Tencel Austria are the most favourable choices from an environmental point of view among all the fibres studied. These four <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> offer important benefits for reducing NREU, GWP, toxicity impacts, water use, and land use. Lenzing Viscose Asia has higher impacts than the other <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> with regard to NREU, GWP, abiotic depletion, photochemical oxidation, and acidification. Cotton is identified as the least preferred choice due to its high ecotoxicity impacts, eutrophication, water use, land use, and relatively low land use efficiencies...|$|E

40|$|Apart from {{conventional}} uses of polysaccharide materials, such as food, clothing, paper packaging and construction, new polysaccharide products and materials have been developed. This paper reviews {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) studies {{in order to gain}} insight of the environmental profiles of polysaccharide products (e. g. viscose or natural fibre polymer composites) in comparison with their conventional counterparts (e. g. cotton or petrochemical polymers). The application areas covered are textiles, engineering materials and packing. It is found that for each stage of the life cycle (production, use phase and waste management) polysaccharide-based end products show better environmental profiles than their conventional counterparts in terms of non-renewable energy use (NREU) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Cotton is an exception, with high environmental impacts that are related to the use of fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and high water consumption.

In the regenerated cellulose process the cellulose is converted to cellulose xanthate which dissolves easily in caustic soda. The resulting viscous liquid can be extruded through spinnerettes and regenerated as <b>man-made</b> <b>fibres.</b> <b>Cellulose</b> can also be dissolved in some organic solvents directly and processed to regenerate the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> in different forms.

Zaradi visoke orientacije in kristalinosti vlaken kažejo liocel vlakna močno težnjo k fibriliranju, t. j. cepljenju fibrilov vzdolž vlaken. Nabrekanje in mehanske obremenitve ta pojav pospešijo in ojačajo. Zelo tanki fibrili na površini vlaken in njihovo kodranje povzročijo povečano površino vlaken in s tem spremembo površine tkanin. Metoda, ki so trenutno na razpolago za ocenitev stopnje fibriliranja so še nepopolne. Spremembo površine vlakna kot funkcijo fibriliranja lahko zaznamo optično ali po spremembah otipa. V prispevku smo predstavili novo metodo zasledovanja fibriliranja s spremembo optičnih lastnosti tkanin, in sicer Tencel vlaken.

The {{differences}} in the <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibre</b> forming processes produce some varieties in the morphological structure of fibres, which shows in fibres 2 ̆ 7 different tendency to fibrillate, i. e. to split along the fibre axis.

Fibre swelling and mechanical stress promote this effect. Very fine fibrils on the fibre surface and their crimping increase the fibre surface and thereby influence the surface changes of the fabric. Some methods for following the formation of fibrils, their density and homogeneity have been proposed, but have proved to be insufficient. The changes of the fibre surface due to fibrillation can be followed optically or by handle changes. In the paper a new method for observing the changes of optical properties of lyocell fibres influenced by fibre fibrillation is given. The analyses were performed on Tencel fabrics. Processing and quantitative analysis of microscopic images was involved for studying the form and dimensions of fabric pores that were produced by different treatments, like raw fabric fibrillation, enzyme treatment and crosslinking of lyocell fibres...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the LCA report “Life Cycle {{assessment}} of man-made cellulose fibres” [3] is {{extended to the}} single score analysis {{in order to provide}} an additional basis for decision making. The single score analysis covers 9 to 11 environmental impact categories. Three single score methods (Single Score I, II, and III) are introduced and applied. Single Score I assigns equal importance to all environmental impact categories and it does not apply normalisation. Single Score II also assigns equal importance to all impact categories and it does apply normalisation.

40|$|Global {{production}} and consumption of textiles is increasing {{and as a result}} putting pressure on the environment. In the EU- 25 countries for example, 2 - 10 % of environmental impacts are associated with clothing consumption, with washing during the use phase {{as one of the most}} significant contributors. Antibacterial textiles, which prevent undesirable odours, may reduce the number of washing cycles, thus offering an opportunity to reduce environmental impacts. This article assess to what extent different antibacterial T-shirts offer opportunities. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to assist the producer in making business decisions to create value during product development process. To this end, we conducted an LCA for an antibacterial T-shirt made in Europe from bio-based <b>man-made</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> (modal). The antibacterial property is obtained by silver nanoparticles that are produced with colloidal techniques such as the sol gel process and in-situ formation. It was found that the T-shirt made of 50 % antibacterial fibres with the in-situ process (50 AB in-situ) caused 15 - 20 % lower cradle-to-gate CO 2 emissions than commercial antibacterial T-shirts. The cradle-to-grave comparison with non-antibacterial modal T-shirts showed that the 50 AB in-situ T-shirt exhibited better environmental performance, resulting in 20 - 30 % lower impacts in key categories such as climate change, freshwater toxicity and eutrophication. LCA demonstrated value creation opportunities such as lower environmental impacts, lower costs and risks. Moreover, the product's environmental performance can be transparently communicated to customers, which helps differentiating with competing products in the market, thus offering the producer a competitive advantage.

However, several factors must be considered when designing polypropylene/cellulose composites: the poor compatibility between the hydrophilic fibres and the hydrophobic thermoplastic matrix leads to a weak interface, which has to be improved by coupling agents; the hydrophilic nature of the fibres makes them very sensitive towards water absorption, which also leads to a loss of properties and swelling with subsequent dimensional instability; the reduced thermal stability of <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibres</b> leads to degradation of the fibres at thermoplastic processing temperatures producing odours in the final material; and finally the properties of composites are greatly influenced by the structure, size and quality of the fibres. Pulp fibres modified by different methods in order to enhance the compatibility fibre-matrix, were tested. Modified fibres led to improved mechanical properties and thermal behaviour when used in composites with recycled polypropylene. Four different types of natural fibres were used as reinforcement in two different polypropylene types: virgin and recycled polypropylene. The mechanical properties of the composites were mostly dependent on the fibre loading and slightly dependent on the type of fibre. Moreover, water absorption kinetics was studied by the Fickian diffusion theory. After absorption, a remarkable loss of properties was observed.
