50|$|Myanmar started {{strongly}} and pegged Singapore {{back with}} their high pressing game.

Faris Ramli was given the responsibility of taking the penalty kick and made no mistake, even though Burmese goalkeeper Kyaw Zin Phyo dived the right way he could get no where near Faris' shot. Two minutes later Adam Swandi got away from his defender but despite being unmarked Stanely Ng could not connect with his cross. Although Singapore would boss the game from then on in possession and chances it was Myanmar who would get the game winner as on the hour mark Ye Ko Oo's long range free-kick was well struck, although Singaporean goalkeeper Syazwan Buhari seamed to be fooled by an awkward bounce the ball took. Singaporean substitute Irfan Fandi did score in the 77th minute but it was disalowed for a foul by Irfan on the Burmese goaltender in the buildup. Once again Singaporean star forward Sahil Suhaimi had a poor game, missing many clear-cut chances. Myanmar held on to record a second straight win.|$|R

2500|$|U Hla had nurtured a new {{generation}} of young writers and artists from the University of Mandalay and elsewhere in Upper Burma such as poets Tin <b>Moe,</b> Kyi <b>Aung,</b> Maung Swan Yi, Maung Pauk Si and Ko Lay (Innwa Gon-yi), writers Maung Tha Noe, Maung Tha-ya, Maung Thein Naing and Maung Saw Lwin, artists Paw Oo Thett and Win Pe as well as old established ones such as writers Sagaing U Hpo Thin, Shwe Kaingtha and Marla and artists U Ba Gyan, U Aung Chit and U Saw Maung. The Ludu Daily carried a Monday extra dedicated to poetry, and with U Hla's encouragement the young poets published an anthology titled A-nya myei hkit gabya (Modern Poetry from Upcountry). Book reviews, critical essays on literature and research papers in local history, arts and crafts enjoyed nearly as many column inches as domestic and international news and analysis. U Hla would not try and influence the content or edit out the young writers' efforts but he would ensure that they could back up any assertions or claims they might make. He would never talk down to them although he often complained that they had talent but they lacked effort; one of his dreams was for them to form a writers' co-operative and run their own publishing house.|$|R

A developmental effort is currently underway to replace the aging TOW 2 B and Hellfire missile systems with a common missile that meets both ground and air requirements. With increased range, lethality, and target acquisition capability, the Common Missile (CM) is being designed as the primary weapon system for the Army's Comanche helicopter and {{is a candidate for}} the lethality system of the Future Combat System (FCS) within the Army's Objective Force. Additionally, the CM is designed to be "backwards compatible" with existing TOW 2 B and Hellfire launch platforms. The objective of this research effort is to determine the increase in operational effectiveness through the employment of the CM in the AT company of the SBCT in three different scenarios, using the high-resolution Janus Combat Model. Operational effectiveness will be assessed and statistically analyzed using lethality, survivability, and engagement range for three measures of effectiveness (<b>MOEs)</b> <b>Major,</b> United States Arm...|$|R
