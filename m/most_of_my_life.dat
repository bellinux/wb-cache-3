500|$|The video {{begins with}} Shakira {{getting out of}} bed in the middle of a full-moon night. Her nails begin to grow and she is shown lacing a pair of boots. Shakira then enters a closet, which leads to the inside of a {{glittering}} ruby-red cave, where she begins dancing wearing a black asymmetric bodysuit. The next scene depicts Shakira striking different poses inside a golden cage (with the sign [...] "Do Not Feed the Animal" [...] on top), clad in a skin-toned leotard. Shakira explained the usage of the golden cage in the video, saying that [...] "I just wanted to express what it feels like for a she-wolf to be in captivity. To be in a golden cage. I think I've been in a golden cage <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> And now not anymore". The setting changes and Shakira is seen performing a dance routine in a club with many back-up dancers. A wolf is also shown walking in the club and transforming into a woman. Near to the end of the video, Shakira dances on a rooftop with a backdrop resembling San Francisco. As the song ends, she falls backwards from the roof and lands in her closet. The video ends with Shakira lying back in her bed and smiling as thunder cracks.|$|E
2500|$|The Arkadaş Association was {{established}} in 2003 to preserve the heritage of Turkish Jews, promote the study of Ladino, and strengthen ties between Israel and Turkey. The organization has over 4,000 members since its inception, about 40 volunteers to run its vast operations and its twelve branches throughout the country. Eyal Peretz, chairman of the association, told the Jerusalem Post that Jewish heritage trips to Turkey had stopped because of security concerns and dwindling demand. Peretz stated, [...] "I've devoted <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> as an adult to cultivate ties between the two people and I've seen how a warm relationship has been erased in one fell swoop. It's very painful, very frustrating." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the time}} he was {{studying}} the Qur'an, Stevens began to identify more and more with the story of Joseph, a man bought and sold in the market place, which is how he said he had increasingly felt within the music business. Regarding his conversion, in his 2006 interview with Alan Yentob, he stated, [...] "to some people, it may have seemed like an enormous jump, but for me, it was a gradual move to this." [...] And, in a Rolling Stone magazine interview, he reaffirmed this, saying, [...] "I had found the spiritual home I'd been seeking for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> And if you listen to my music and lyrics, like [...] "Peace Train" [...] and [...] "On The Road To Find Out", it clearly shows my yearning for direction and the spiritual path I was travelling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dyke {{appeared}} on BBC Two's Newsnight programme on 8 July 2011 alongside comedian Steve Coogan, where he confronted former News of the World deputy features editor Paul McMullen over his attitude {{to the events}} of the phone hacking scandal. Dyke told McMullen [...] "You're [...] nothing to do with a free press, or a decent democracy". Distancing himself from McMullen he said [...] "I've spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> being a journalist, and I'm nothing to do with him, and neither are most other journalists." [...] He continued [...] "You could see there are occasionally, very occasionally, public interest cases {{but most of the time}} [...] These guys [...] just tapped anyone they could think of". He was also of the opinion that stronger independent regulation of the press was needed, claiming that broadcast media had always been more strictly regulated.|$|E
2500|$|Hecklers {{interrupted}} Oren's speech ten times, {{with many}} students cheering them in support. Among other slogans, the hecklers yelled, [...] "Michael Oren, propagating murder {{is not an}} expression of free speech," [...] "killers" [...] and [...] "how many Palestinians did you kill?" [...] After the fourth disruption, Oren took a 20-minute leave {{before returning to the}} podium. Before continuing he said, [...] "I've spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> living in and studying the Middle East and one of the great and eternal cultural facets of the Middle East is hospitality... even if you do not agree with them, even if they're ostensibly your enemy. I'm your guest here and I'm asking for the Middle Eastern hospitality for your guest, I've come into your house." [...] By the end of the program, 11 UC Irvine and Riverside students were reportedly arrested.|$|E

It was not a publicity stunt. I was trying to make someone else feel better. And have subsequently caused pain for myself. I am not in a box of any description." [...] In a magazine article and in a programme on RTÉ (Ryan Confidential, broadcast on RTÉ on 29 May 2003), she stated that while most of her sexual relationships had been with men, she has had three relationships with women.|$|E
2500|$|Despite any {{difficulties}} that his suspected Communist sympathies might have posed, Copland traveled extensively during the 1950s and early 60s {{to observe the}} avant-garde styles of Europe, hear compositions by Soviet composers not {{well known in the}} West and experience the new school of Polish music. While in Japan, he was taken with the work of Toru Takemitsu and began a correspondence with him that would last over the next decade. Copland revised his text [...] "The New Music" [...] with comments on the styles that he encountered. He found much of what he heard dull and impersonal. Electronic music seemed to have [...] "a depressing sameness of sound," [...] while aleatoric music was for those [...] "who enjoy teetering on the edge of chaos." [...] As he summarized, [...] "I've spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> trying to get the right note in the right place.
