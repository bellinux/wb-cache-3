25|$|Previously, Canopy Growth {{had been}} {{operating}} {{at a loss}} (-$3.3 million in income in 2015, for example) partly because it was using funds for production expansion and to acquire competitors in preparation for significantly increased cannabis demand by the recreational use market in early 2018. Even after the 2015 results had been published, some analysts remained positive about the company's future value. For example, in early December 2016, Reuter's survey of four <b>market</b> <b>analysts</b> had indicated a consensus rating of Buy. Prior {{to the release of}} the 2016 results, the company had a valuation of $1.6 billion.

25|$|<b>Market</b> <b>analysts</b> had a mixed {{response}} to the October 2016 announcement of the Nintendo Switch. Following the financially under-performing Wii U, analysts had expected that Nintendo would recognize their vulnerable position in the console market when developing their next console, believing that the company would find a means to draw back the core gamer market. Instead, initial promotion of the Switch appeared to appeal to an audience that fell between the core gamer and casual gamer markets, the latter being mobile game players who would want a more engaging experience but would {{not be willing to}} play for hours at a time, according to The New York Times. Analysts were unsure if such a market existed in large enough numbers to justify the Switch. Other concerns about the Switch's announcement were related to yet-to-be-confirmed details that could make or break the system, such as its retail price, whether the unit includes a touchscreen, the unit's battery life, and the type of games that development partners would bring to the console.|$|E

500|$|The Great Southern Group relied {{significantly}} {{on financial}} planners and accountants recommending their MIS products to investors. The company was paying commissions of ten percent – high by industry standards, and {{similar to those}} paid by other failed investment businesses including Westpoint Corporation and Storm Financial. It was also {{spending a lot of}} money on recruiting financial advisers to sell its products. One report indicated that A$137 million was spent on [...] "commissions, marketing and promotion in two years to 2008". Some accountants, with Great Southern's support, were recommending the agribusiness investment schemes, though they did not have a financial services licence; one report suggested over half of Great Southern's MIS sales were coming through accountants, often tax specialists from small practices. These practices had been questioned for several years by the corporate regulator ASIC and some <b>market</b> <b>analysts,</b> and were widely criticised following Great Southern's collapse. Some experts were critical of the lack of knowledge and expertise of the investment advisers recommending agroforestry MIS schemes.|$|E

500|$|Sony Computer Entertainment PlayStation 3 was {{released}} on November 11, 2006 in Japan and November 17, 2006 in the US and Canada. The system's reliance on new technologies such as the Cell microprocessor and Blu-ray format caused difficulties in manufacturing, especially the Blu-ray diode, leading to shortages at launch and the delay of the PAL region launches; however, by early December 2006, Sony announced that all production issues had been resolved. <b>Market</b> <b>analysts</b> and Sony executives noted {{that the success of}} the PlayStation 3 and the Blu-ray format were dependent on each other; Rich Marty, VP of New Business Development at Sony Pictures Home Entertainment stated that the [...] "PS3 is {{critical to the success of}} Blu-ray," [...] while Phil Harrison stated that the PlayStation 3's success would be ensured because [...] "the growth of the Blu-ray Disc movie market ... is a positive factor which will play more into the consumer psyche ... as more consumer electronics firms launch standalone disc players, as more Blu-ray Disc movies become available, and as more shelf space is dedicated to the category at retail." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Bozon {{has refused}} to blame Capcom, the {{publisher}} of the game, for responsibility in the game's failure. This was despite Capcom holding it for 8 months after completion, with the game finally releasing when the Game Boy Advance was already in its first year of existence.

Bozon believed that from a creative standpoint, he never really settled on a target audience, with the character being [...] "iconoclastic", [...] "too sexy to be a kid's brand, and too girly for a male gamer brand". Also, before the game was even released, Bozon claims that he had come to understand anyway that the game [...] "would probably not sell", as during WayForward's search for a publisher, many <b>market</b> <b>analysts</b> were skeptical at {{the idea of having a}} female lead character, and Bozon ultimately acknowledged that they probably [...] "genuinely knew their markets".

500|$|Video game {{industry}} analysts considered 2009 to {{be a critical}} year for rhythm games, and they believed that it {{would allow them to}} gauge the future success of the genre. Both the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises were expanded, and they received entries for handheld gaming devices and mobile phones. Specialized titles that targeted specific genres and demographics, such as Band Hero for pop music and Lego Rock Band for younger players, were released. [...] Sales of music games were down {{in the first half of}} the year. This decline was attributed to fewer purchases of instrument controllers; it was assumed that players had already bought such controllers and were reusing them. While analysts had expected that United States sales of Guitar Hero 5 and [...] would be high—close to or exceeding one million units each in the first month of their release—sales only reached roughly half of those projections. The failure to meet sales projections was partly attributed to the impact of the late-2000s recession on the video game industry; Harmonix's CEO Alex Rigopolis considered that at the time, both Guitar Hero and Rock Band were the most expensive video games on the <b>market.</b> <b>Analysts</b> also considered it to be a sign of market saturation. Further contributing to the decline was genre stagnation; the franchises retained the same basic gameplay over several iterations, giving consumers less incentive to buy additional titles. Harmonix CEO Alex Rigopulos felt that the aggressive competition between the Rock Band and Guitar Hero brands on the belief that the market could only support one franchise also contributed to the decline of these games. As a result, analysts lowered their expectations for future music games; for example, projections of first quarter U.S. sales of DJ Hero, a Guitar Hero [...] "spin-off", were reduced from 1.6 million units to only 600,000. Sales of rhythm games, which totalled $1.47 billion in 2008, reached only $700 million in 2009. Analysts predicted that the market would settle at the same [...] "healthy" [...] $500–600 million level of the Call of Duty series. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter concluded that the saturation of the rhythm game market accounted for one-third of the industry's 12% sales decline in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|In investing, some {{practitioners}} of technical analysis use the golden ratio to indicate {{support of a}} price level, or resistance to price increases, of a stock or commodity; after significant price changes up or down, new support and resistance levels are supposedly found at or near prices related to the starting price via the golden ratio.

2500|$|During the 1980s and 1990s {{the natural}} gas {{industry}} faced {{a new series of}} problems.

Although <b>market</b> <b>analysts</b> regularly forecast the end of the bubble as only a few years away, the bubble refused to burst.

2500|$|<b>Market</b> <b>analysts</b> {{believed}} {{baby boomers}} {{were more likely}} to purchase diet drinks as they aged and remained health- and weight-conscious. Growth in the full-calorie segment would have to come from younger drinkers, who at that time favored Pepsi by even more overwhelming margins than the market as a whole. Meanwhile, the overall market for colas steadily declined in the early 1980s, as consumers increasingly purchased diet and non-cola soft drinks, many of which were sold by Coca-Cola themselves. This trend further eroded Coca-Cola's market share. When Roberto Goizueta became Coca-Cola CEO in 1980, he pointedly told employees there would be no [...] "s" [...] in how the company did business, including how it formulated its drinks.|$|E
