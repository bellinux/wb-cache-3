5|$|In the storm's {{immediate}} aftermath, officials {{enacted a}} widespread curfew after reports of looting and vandalism. The government temporarily restricted constitutional rights for 15days. Officials urged residents to restrict water and fuel use, and alcohol sales were halted. The widespread flooding and the crippled infrastructure forced officials {{to rely on}} a limited number of helicopters to operate search and rescue missions and deliver supplies. A helicopter carrying fourpeople, including Tegucigalpa mayor and potential presidential candidate César Castellanos, crashed on November1 while touring flood damage, killing everyone aboard. In some areas, residents did not receive assistance until November12, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> after Mitch's landfall. About 285,000people remained in 1,375shelters, many of them schools, by three weeks after the hurricane struck. Some sports stadiums and churches were also used as makeshift shelters. Overcrowding at shelters caused various diseases.|$|E

5000|$|The Goshute {{lived in}} the most desolate {{part of what is}} now the western portion of Utah and eastern portion of Nevada. In {{aboriginal}} times they lived at a minimum subsistence level with no economic surplus on which a more elaborate social structure could be built. Organized primarily in nuclear families, the Goshutes hunted and gathered in family groups and would often cooperate with other family groups that usually made up a village. [...] Most Goshutes gathered with other families only {{two or three times a}} year, typically for pine nut harvests, communal hunts for no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> to six <b>weeks,</b> and winter lodging which was for a longer period. These gatherings often lasted no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> to six <b>weeks,</b> although winter gatherings were longer, with families organizing under a dagwani, or village headman.|$|R

5|$|Joss Whedon {{had wanted}} to make a musical episode {{since the start of the}} series. This was {{heightened}} during the fifth season when he hosted a Shakespeare reading at his house, to which the cast was invited. They began drinking and singing, demonstrating to Whedon that certain cast members had musical talents. Whedon knew he would have to write an entire score, which would take weeks or months. During the first three seasons of Buffy, he was unable to take <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> off at a time, and the constraints of writing and directing the show precluded him from putting forth the effort of preparing a musical. Whedon spoke to the show's producer, Gareth Davies, about his idea; they agreed that a musical episode would be written.|$|E
5|$|On the Israeli side, several {{leaders of}} the Jewish city sent {{emergency}} telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate {{and that they could}} not hold out <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according to the terms of the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King Abdullah This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.|$|E
5|$|West Avenal {{departed}} Norfolk on {{a voyage}} to Leith, Scotland on 9 April 1919, but {{was forced to}} return to port after suffering an engine breakdown. Following repairs, she made several voyages between the East Coast of the United States and various destinations in South America, Spain, France and England. A few mentions of the ship crop up in contemporary news accounts. In August 1919, for example, The New York Times shows West Avenal slated for departure to Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 12 August. The following January, the newspaper reported that West Avenal was rammed by the British Leyland Line cargo ship Lacastrian. Departing New York in a dense fog {{on the morning of}} 9 January 1920 for Antwerp, Lacastrian rammed into the port side of West Avenal, which was inbound with a load of onions from Valencia, Spain. The damage was severe enough that West Avenals captain ordered her grounded to avoid sinking in New York Harbor. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> later, The Washington Post printed a photograph of West Avenal, still grounded off the Red Hook flats. Another report in the Times a year later showed her arrival in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 13 August 1920.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to {{one part of}} the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a few days in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions <b>more</b> <b>than</b> about <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|R

5|$|The {{information}} that Ganteaume gleaned from his captive was largely false. A large expeditionary force and fleet under Lord Keith {{was in the}} Mediterranean but would not arrive in Egypt for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> British landings eventually going ahead on 8 March. At the time Ganteaume questioned Peard, the force was anchored at Karamania on the southern coast of Anatolia, struggling with reluctant Ottoman allies and bad weather. In addition, there was little active pursuit of his squadron during February: when Concorde reached Plymouth on 3 February, urgent messages were sent to Earl St Vincent at the Admiralty who ordered the despatch of a fast squadron of six ships of the line, two frigates and a brig in search of Ganteaume's ships. However, attached to command this force was Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder, who traveled in a slow second rate ship of the line that significantly delayed the passage of his squadron. In any case, a miscalculation of Ganteaume's intentions at the Admiralty resulted in orders for Calder's squadron to sail to the West Indies, and they played no further part in the campaign. Warren, whose squadron was based off Cádiz, had learned of Ganteaume's passage on 8 February and sailed to Gibraltar in pursuit before continuing to Menorca on 13 February, arriving on 20 February without seeing any sign of the French and subsequently sailing for Sicily in March after hearing news of the impending Treaty of Florence between France and the Kingdom of Naples. Despite the lack of genuine pursuit, Ganteaume was unnerved by the information gleaned from Peard, and ordered the squadron to sail for Toulon, arriving on 19 February without any further contact with the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Cimaron {{struck the}} Philippines with winds {{estimated}} at 195km/h (120mph) and gusts {{in excess of}} 230km/h (145mph). Along coastal Aurora Province, a mother and daughter were killed when strong winds destroyed their home. Numerous trees and power lines were felled by the winds as well, causing widespread blackouts in Luzon. The majority of Aurora and Isabela provinces were left without power and telecommunications for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> Approximately 90percent of the homes in Dinapigue were damaged. Heavy rains across the region swelled many rivers, flooding low-lying areas along their banks. Several bridges became impassable and officials had to release water from two major dams {{to prevent them from}} overflowing. The most significant flooding occurred along the Allied-Sinocalan and Tagamusing rivers in Pangasinan. Low-lying areas along the Cagayan, Chico, Magat, Pinacanauan, Tuguegarao Pared rivers throughout Cagayan province were also affected by flooding. Numerous roads were blocked off by landslides or washed away by flooding, severely limiting travel. A landslide temporarily isolated four barangays in Nueva Vizcaya. A Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council search and rescue team was later deployed to Kasibu where at least four people were killed by flooding. Fatal landslides took place in Benguet and Kalinga provinces. A traffic accident blamed on the storm in La Union resulted in one death and seven injuries.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Villeneuve's fugitives, the French Mediterranean Fleet had been annihilated. Nine of eleven ships of the line had been captured or destroyed, {{as well as two}} frigates. French casualties totalled more than 3,000 and possibly as many as 5,000, compared to British losses of 218 killed and 677 wounded. However, many of Nelson's ships were seriously damaged, and urgent repairs were required for both his own ships and the captured prizes before they could begin the long voyage back to Britain. For <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> Nelson remained in Aboukir Bay, effecting repairs, writing despatches and assessing the strategic situation in Egypt. The first ship detached from his squadron was Leander, sent on 5 August to the fleet under Earl St. Vincent off Cadiz with reports of the battle. On 8 August Aboukir Island was stormed and captured, and on 12 August Emerald, Alcmene and Bonne Citoyenne finally caught up with the fleet, followed on 17 August by Seahorse and Terpsichore. Mutine was detached on 13 August with despatches for the Admiralty and on 14 August Nelson sent seven ships with the six seaworthy prizes to the mouth of Aboukir Bay under the command of Saumarez. This convoy sailed for Gibraltar on 15 August and the following day Nelson burnt Heureux, followed on 18 August by Mercure and Guerrier, none of which were fit for continued service. On 19 August Nelson separated his remaining ships, leading three vessels northwards towards Naples and leaving a blockade squadron off Alexandria of Zealous, Goliath, Swiftsure and the frigates, under Captain Samuel Hood.|$|E

Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96percent to 13.03percent.|$|E
