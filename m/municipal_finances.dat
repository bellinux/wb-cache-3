25|$|In 1912, the Ministry of Labour {{recommended}} that Parliament pass the Namsos Line {{on the north}} shore of Namsen and that Parliament demand 15 percent district grants from the county and the affected municipalities. The level of the district grants were subject to public debate, as they would affect the <b>municipal</b> <b>finances</b> for a long period. The same year, an additional proposal was made by the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, who wanted a railway from Namsos via Grong to Tunnsjøen, where pyrite mining was planned. The formal decision to build the line was taken by Parliament on 2 June 1913, although the route was not formalized by Parliament until 13 December 1923.|$|E

2500|$|According to secret cables {{published}} by WikiLeaks, the US ambassador to Russia, John Beyrle, stated that Luzhkov sat {{on top of}} a [...] "pyramid of corruption". [...] "Luzhkov oversees a system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behaviour," [...] wrote Beyrle. [...] "Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world. Luzhkov is at the top. The FSB, MVD and militia are at the second level. Finally ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level." [...] Beyrle also suggested that much of Luzhkov's business empire had been acquired using <b>municipal</b> <b>finances</b> to invest in [...] "less than transparent" [...] projects with former Soviet republics. In a further cable, Beyrle reported allegations that Luzhkov's billionaire wife Yelena Baturina, who became Russia's richest woman after he assumed office with her construction company Inteko, had links to major criminal groups, particularly Solntsevskaya Bratva. The couple denied the accusations as [...] "total rubbish".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to conceptually and {{theoretically}} analyse <b>municipal</b> <b>finance</b> and administration in South Africa, taking into account the need for clean audit outcomes which can be achieved through sound and effective municipal financial administration. The rationale for an analysis of <b>municipal</b> <b>finance</b> and the need for clean audit outcomes arose, firstly, from the fact that <b>municipal</b> <b>finance</b> covers the sources of revenue in the form of taxes that are then used by municipal government after intergovernmental transfers. Secondly, municipalities are faced with many challenges in trying to deliver services to the community. Discussion of <b>municipal</b> <b>finance</b> management and administration, and clean audit outcomes, has been on the government agenda for some time. However, the anticipated turn-around in the municipalities is not happening. In 2009, the national government initiated a programme called “clean audit programme”, which is scheduled to be completed in 2014. However, the pace at which the municipal financial management issues are being attended to at the municipal levels leaves much to be desired. It is therefore doubtful whether all the municipalities will achieve the desired clean audit status by 2014. Hence, the objective of this study is to contribute to and promote discussion on the topic in academic circles and among people who have an interest in local government. [URL]...|$|R
