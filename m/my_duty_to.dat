25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it <b>my</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E

25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is <b>my</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} and still {{by the end}} of the war, {{considerable}} controversy abounded over exactly what had happened at Jutland and who, if anyone, was to blame for perceived failings. With the war over, it was decided to publish an official history of the battle. Captain John Harper was appointed by the then First Sea Lord, Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, to review all the available documentation and write the report. At the moment Wemyss retired and was replaced as First Sea Lord by Beatty, the finished book had already reached the stage of proof copies awaiting approval on his desk. Beatty objected to the account, requesting Harper make alterations which Harper refused to do unless Beatty would give him written orders to that effect. It had already become known to the public that Harper was writing the account (questions had been asked about it in Parliament) and he refused to put his name to an account he could not agree with. Instead, Beatty appointed two brothers, Captains Alfred Dewar and Kenneth Dewar to write a 'staff appreciation' of the battle, which would be circulated to navy officers only. The Harper report was passed to Sir Julian Corbett, who was writing an official history of the whole naval war on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Corbett was shown the staff appreciation, and said I 'read it with increasing wonder till at last I felt it <b>my</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> convey to the Admiralty that such a grotesque account of the battle certainly ought not to go out as their considered verdict'. The account was classified as 'secret' and yet another version was commissioned, the 'Admiralty Narrative'. This was shown to Jellicoe, and a long correspondence ensued where he objected to many parts of the narrative. With particular reference to Evan-Thomas, Jellicoe objected to the claim that Evan-Thomas had been responsible for the distance between his ships and Beatty's, which had resulted in Beatty going into battle without the support of the four most powerful ships in his command.|$|E

After his release from the hospital, his condition slowly deteriorated. He died in his sleep while surrounded by his family at his Durham home. He was 80years old. At his funeral, he was eulogized by a childhood friend who said Sanford [...] "took [...] oath when he was twelve years old and kept it. It started out, 'On my honor, I will do my best to do <b>my</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> God and my country,' and included such things as 'help other people at all times.' He believed it. He was the eternal Boy Scout." [...] Sanford is entombed in the crypt of Duke University Chapel.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{was known}} for being {{sometimes}} prickly.

[...] However, many people have defended him, often citing his generosity. [...] Actress May Fortescue recalled, [...] "His kindness was extraordinary. [...] On wet nights and when rehearsals were late and the last buses were gone, he would pay the cab-fares of the girls whether they were pretty or not, instead of letting them trudge home on foot... He was just as large-hearted when he was poor as when he was rich and successful. [...] For money as money he cared less than nothing. [...] Gilbert was no plaster saint, but he was an ideal friend."

500|$|Moscone {{planned to}} {{announce}} White's replacement on November 27, 1978. A half {{hour before the}} press conference, White avoided metal detectors by entering City Hall through a basement window, and went to Moscone's office, where witnesses heard shouting followed by gunshots. White shot Moscone in the shoulder and chest, then twice in the head. White then quickly walked to his former office, reloading his police-issue revolver with hollow-point bullets along the way, and intercepted Milk, asking him to step inside for a moment. Dianne Feinstein heard gunshots and called police, then found Milk {{face down on the}} floor, shot five times, including twice in the head. Soon after, she announced to the press, [...] "Today San Francisco has experienced a double tragedy of immense proportions. As President of the Board of Supervisors, it is <b>my</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> inform you that both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed, and the suspect is Supervisor Dan White."

500|$|Against all expectations, the war {{continued}} for five years. During this period, PedroII's {{time and energy}} were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that [...] "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost." [...] "Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness {{had no effect on}} his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously PedroII remarked: [...] "What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me? Many better kings than I have lost it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is <b>my</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> carry." ...|$|E
500|$|The fashion press {{tends to}} take special {{interest}} in First Ladies. The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. Women's Wear Daily stated that Pat had a [...] "good figure and good posture", as well as [...] "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. [...] "I consider it <b>my</b> <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> use American designers", she said, and favored them because, [...] "they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. [...] "I'm a size 10," [...] she told The New York Times. [...] "I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers." [...] She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably Geoffrey Beene, {{at the suggestion of}} Clara Treyz, her personal shopper. Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as [...] "a schoolteacher on her night out", but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, [...] "Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike." ...|$|E
