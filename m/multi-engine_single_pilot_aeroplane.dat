40|$|It {{is argued}} that the barrier to <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> {{operation}} is not the technology, but the failure to consider the whole socio-technical system. To better understand the socio-technical system we model alternative <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> operations using Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) and analyse those models using Social Network Analysis (SNA). Four potential models of <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> operations were compared to existing two pilot operations. Using SOCA-CAT from CWA, {{we were able to}} identify the potential functional loading and interactions between networks of agents. The interactions formed the basis on the SNA. These analyses potentially form the basis for distributed system architecture for the operation of a future aircraft. The findings from the models suggest that distributed crewing option could be at least as resilient, in network architecture terms, as the current dual crewing operations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} feasibility, {{effectiveness}} {{and benefits of}} implementing a <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> operations variant of the multi-crew Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA) methodology, {{in the management of}} safety in <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> operations. LOSA is designed to provide a proactive snapshot of system safety and flight crew performance as a way of preventing incidents and accidents (Klinect, 2006). The data indicators underlying this effort are based on a conceptual framework known as Threat and Error Management (TEM) (Helmreich et al, 2001). A recent spate of incidents and accidents involving <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> operations both in Australia and New Zealand have given emphasis to the vulnerability of this group to safety issues and confirms statistics that show this category of aviation has a higher incidence of accidents and incidents than in other sectors of the industry (CASA, 2009, NZCAA, 2009). By adapting LOSA to <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> operations (LOSA:SP) the framework/methodology could provide a proactive method of diagnosing operational safety performance strengths and weaknesses under normal operations leading to the identification of additional training requirements and improved procedures without relying on adverse safety events for such information.

5000|$|In 1924, Julian {{shifted his}} focus from {{parachuting}} to <b>piloting</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> and raised funds {{to buy a}} seaplane for a transatlantic flight from New York to Liberia. He named the plane Ethiopia I, decorated its tail with the red, black and green colors of the UNIA. On 4 July 1924, a crowd of thousands gathered {{on the banks of}} the Harlem River at 139th Street to see Julian depart. His take-off was delayed for several hours when the owners of the plane appeared and declared Julian still owed them $1400. His supporters, with the help of UNIA members, eventually collected the money from the crowd. [...] However, soon after Julian took off, one of the pontoons fell off the plane, and it crashed into Flushing Bay.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the conceptual {{design of a}} Virtual Pilot Assistant (VPA) based on {{an analysis of the}} requirements for single-pilot operations of commercial transport aircraft. In particular, the analysis takes into account existing literature on <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> operations from general aviation and military standards. The analysis also considers relevant human factors engineering and system design aspects of Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) and conventional two-pilot aircraft. The VPA performs a real-time assessment of the single-pilot‟s cognitive states as well as making predictions on the performance levels of the <b>single</b> <b>pilot,</b> thereby providing complementary and timely support to the <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> as required. In case of pilot incapacitation, the VPA enables the single-pilot aircraft to be operated as an RPAS, allowing ground operators to take over as necessary and make an emergency landing at a suitable location...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} crew members in {{commercial}} flights has decreased to two members, {{down from the}} five-member crew required 50 years ago. One question of interest is whether the crew should be reduced to one pilot. In {{order to determine the}} critical factors involved in safely transitioning to a <b>single</b> <b>pilot,</b> research must examine whether any performance deficits arise with the loss of a crew member. With a concrete understanding of the cognitive and behavioral role of a co-pilot, aeronautical technologies and procedures can be developed that make up for the removal of the second aircrew member. The current project describes a pre-study walkthrough process {{that can be used to}} help in the development of scenarios for testing future concepts and technologies for <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> operations. Qualitative information regarding the tasks performed by the pilots can be extracted with this technique and adapted for future investigations of <b>single</b> <b>pilot</b> operations...|$|R
