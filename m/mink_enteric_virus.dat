In this study, we developed a broad-spectrum immunocapture method for concentration and purification of <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses.</b> The method involved indirect antibody capture (AbCap) of intact viruses followed by release of virion genomic RNA and reverse transcriptase PCR for amplification and oligoprobe hybridization for detection. The procedure involved concentrating <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> from large volumes of water by standard filtration-elution techniques with IMDS filters and 1 liter of 1 % beef extract- 0. 05 M glycine (BE/G) as an eluate.

Bench-scale experiments were conducted in 2 -liter-batch shrinking reactors containing ozone demand-free 0. 05 M phosphate buffer (pH 6. 9) at 22 degrees C.

40|$|<b>Enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> are viruses which {{replicate}} in {{the intestinal}} tract {{of man and}} animals. One mode of transmission for <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> is the fecal-oral route. Drinking water which has been contaminated with sewage or sewage effluent has been implicated {{as a means for}} the spread of <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses.</b> Monitoring water for virus contamination requires two steps: 1) the collection and the concentration of the water sample and 2) the isolation and identification of the virus present. Current methods for the detection of <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> in water requires the use of animal cell culture. This technique has several drawbacks, such as: 1) long incubation periods, up to two and three weeks, before some <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> are detected, 2) not all viruses can be detected in one cell line, and 3) not all viruses have been grown in cell culture. More rapid techniques, such as fluorescent antibody or radioimmunoassay do not have the needed sensitivity to detect the low levels of virus found in contaminated water. These techniques also require the production of an antibody for each different virus type. An alternative technique for the detection of viruses in water was sought. Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology now makes it possible to detect viruses without the use of cell culture or antibodies. Gene probes that hybridize to the RNA of poliovirus and hepatitis A virus were tested for their ability to detect different <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses.</b> The probes were labeled with ³²P dCTP and ³²P dATP to a specific activity greater then 1. 0 x 10 ⁹ cpm/ug DNA. Gene Screen Plus (NEN) was chosen as the hybridization membrane since it was more sensitive to virus detection than the other membranes tested. A dot-blot apparatus (Bio Rad) was used to apply the samples. Results were visualized by autoradiography for thirty-six hours at - 70 ° C. One infectious unit of poliovirus and hepatitis A virus was detected using labeled cDNA probes. Upon comparison, the dot blot assay was as sensitive as tissue culture for the detection of poliovirus in beef extract, secondary effluent, and tapwater. Environmental samples, such as secondary effluent, reclaimed wastewater and unchlorinated drinking water were also assayed for poliovirus and hepatitis A virus with the use of gene probes.

The primer set exhibiting the lowest detection limit under optimized conditions, EQ- 1 /EQ- 2, was validated through testing urban wastewater, and then utilized in a field survey of 22 recreational bodies of water located around the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Eleven sites tested positive for enterovirus, indicating fecal contamination in a significant portion of Hawaiian waters. Additionally, the filter-feeding phenomenon of indigenous bivalve mollusks was explored as a natural bioconcentration technique to infer microbial quality of the surrounding waters. Shellfish were collected from 12 coastal locations and dissected for subsequent nucleic acid extraction from internal tissues. Optimized RT-PCR/PCR protocols were then applied to test for the presence of various <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses,</b> including enterovirus, adenovirus, norovirus genogroups I and II, and F-specific RNA coliphage.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the presence of influenza viruses inthe stools of adult patients consulting their general practitioner for uncomplicated acutediarrhea (AD) {{and the proportion of}} concurrent infections by <b>enteric</b> and influenza <b>viruses.</b> METHOD: A case-control study was conducted from December 2010 to April 2011. Stool specimenswere collected and tested for influenza viruses A (seasonal A/H 3 N 2 and pandemic A/H 1 N 1) and B, and for four <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> (astrovirus, group A rotavirus, human enteric adenovirus,norovirus of genogroups I - NoVGI - and genogroup II - NoVGII). RESULTS: General practitioners enrolled 138 cases and 93 controls. Of the 138 stool specimenscollected, 92 (66. 7 %) were positive for {{at least one of the}} four <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> analysed and 10 (7. 2 %) tested positive for one influenza virus. None of these 10 influenza positive patientsreported respiratory symptoms. In five influenza-positive patients (3. 6 %), we also detectedone <b>enteric</b> <b>virus,</b> with 4 of them being positive for influenza B (2 had co-detection withNoVGI, 1 with NoVGII, and 1 with astrovirus). None of the 93 controls tested positive forone of the enteric and/or other influenza viruses we investigated. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we showed that the simultaneous detection of influenza and <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> is nota rare event. We have also reported, for the first time in general practice, the presence ofseasonal and pandemic influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting foruncomplicated AD. A simultaneous investigation of <b>enteric</b> and influenza <b>viruses</b> in patientscomplaining of gastrointestinal symptoms could be useful for future studies to better identifythe agents responsible for AD...|$|R

40|$|Human <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> are {{currently}} {{recognized as one}} of the most important causes of food-borne disease. Implication of <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> in food-borne outbreaks can be difficult to confirm due to the inadequacy of the detection methods available. In this study, a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) method was developed in a multiplex format for the specific, simultaneous, and rapid detection of epidemiologically relevant human <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses.</b> Three previously reported primer sets were used in a single reaction for the amplification of RNA target fragments of 474, 371, and 165 nucleotides for the detection of hepatitis A virus and genogroup I and genogroup II noroviruses, respectively. Amplicons were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed by electrochemiluminescence and Northern hybridization. Endpoint detection sensitivity for the multiplex NASBA assay was approximately 10 − 1 reverse transcription-PCR-detectable units (or PFU, as appropriate) per reaction. When representative ready-to-eat foods (deli sliced turkey and lettuce) were inoculated with various concentrations of each virus and processed for virus detection with the multiplex NASBA method, all three human <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> were simultaneously detected at initial inoculum levels of 100 to 102 reverse transcription-PCR-detectable units (or PFU) / 9 cm 2 in both food commodities. The multiplex NASBA system provides rapid and simultaneous detection of clinically relevant food-borne viruses in a single reaction tube and may be a promising alternative to reverse transcription-PCR for the detection of viral contamination of foods...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{developed}} a concentration and purification procedure to facilitate reverse transcription (RT) -PCR detection of <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> in water sample concentrates obtained by conventional filter adsorption-elution methods. One liter of beef extract-glycine eluate with or without humic acid and seeded with poliovirus type 1, hepatitis A virus, and Norwalk virus {{was used as a}} model system, and the eluent was further processed for RT-PCR compatibility. The sample concentration and purification procedures which we used included polyethylene glycol precipitation, Pro-Cipitate precipitation, a second polyethylene glycol precipitation, spin column chromatography, and ultrafiltration. The sample volumes were reduced from 1 liter to 20 to 50 microliters, and the samples were purified enough so that viruses could be detected by the RT-PCR. The ability to detect low levels of <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> by molecular techniques was compared directly with the ability to detect <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> by cell culture infectivity procedures. As little as 3 PFU of poliovirus type 1 in an initial 1 liter of mock eluate was detected by the RT-PCR...|$|R
