40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} in grasslands {{has led to}} {{the decline}} of <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> populations in The Netherlands in the last 60 years. Habitat for <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> chicks has declined in quality and quantity, thereby reducing food availability. Agri-environment schemes (AES) to halt the decline in <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> numbers have thus far been insufficient. These AES are on the level of entire fields, but recent research suggests that margins of fields may be more suitable chick habitat than centres of fields. Therefore, it could be productive to specifically target grass field margins as part of <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> AES. Our study examined the differences in food availability for <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> families in different portions of a grass field. Invertebrates were sampled in different locations on the field and results were compared to known dietary preferences of four species of <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> chicks. We show strong differences in food availability within fields, depending on <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> species. The preferred prey species of chicks of Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa and Redshank Tringa totanus predominantly occurred in field margins, whereas those of Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus chicks were found mostly in {{the main part of the}} field. The prey species of Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus chicks showed no clear pattern within fields. We conclude that food availability within a field differs spatially between <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> species. Particularly for Black-tailed Godwit and Redshank, grass field margins constitute an important part of the field. Therefore, specific management to further enhance food availability in these margins may constitute an important addition to the existing mosaic approach...|$|E
40|$|<b>Meadow</b> <b>bird</b> {{agreements}} {{are the most}} important Dutch agri-environment schemes, both in terms of uptake and of aim. <b>Meadow</b> <b>bird</b> agreements postpone the first agricultural activities on grassland thus reducing egg and chick mortality due to mowing or grazing. We investigated the conservation effects of <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> agreements by analysing settlement densities of meadow birds on 34 fields in 1989, 1992 and 1995 in the province of Zeeland, The Netherlands. We compared territory numbers on fields with <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> agreements with paired nearby control fields that were conventionally managed. In 1995, the number of territories of black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) and the total number of meadow birds were significantly higher on fields with conservation management. These differences were partly caused by the higher quality (i. e. higher groundwater level) of fields with <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> agreements. Population trends were similar on fields with and without <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> agreements and the observed difference in settlement density in 1995 was already present in 1989. Furthermore the effectiveness of the scheme did not increase with time. Thus we found no conclusive evidence that the conservation measures themselves did result in higher territory numbers. Currently, we do not have sufficient ecological and behavioural knowledge of meadow birds to explain why the higher reproductive success does not result in higher settlement densities.

40|$|Between 1990 and 2011, of {{the bird}} species groups from Europe the largest decline is {{observed}} for wader species. Since the Netherlands harbors a relatively {{large proportion of the}} global population of these wader species, it has a responsibility for their persistence. Designated, as one of the major negative influences on <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> breeding success is a decrease in openness, which is related to an increase in predation. In order to reduce predation, reed, brushwood and potential nesting trees for the Common Buzzard, Northern Goshawk, Sparrowhawk, White Stork, Grey Heron and Kestrel are removed from <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> breeding area. In this review I addressed the following question: What are the necessity and the effects of removing tall vegetation (reed and woody plants) from Dutch <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> areas on waders and avian predators? Here I reviewed scientific and grey literature and identified knowledge gaps. Increasing the openness of <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> areas will possibly have positive effects on <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> populations. Since wader populations are still decreasing negative impacts on their reproductive success should be improved. However, many other factors contribute to the negative trends of wader populations, such as water level, mowing date and herbal diversity. Since tall landscape elements such as in the green-blue network (in Dutch ‘groenblauwe dooradering’) have several ecological functions and many species depend on them I would recommend to improve other important habitat demands before a large-scale increase of openness in <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> areas. Especially, since predation levels are highly variable over years. According to the provinces, management of tall vegetation is done on a relatively small scale (in <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> core areas and surrounding grassland areas). The Flora- and Fauna Act regulations restrict the removal of existing bird nests and removal of tall vegetation is restricted by cultural historical value, Natura 2000 designation, Forest Act and APV log regulation. Logging permits {{may or may not be}} granted after consideration of various interests (including the openness benefits for meadow birds). Not vulnerable avian predator species that are distributed throughout the Netherlands will, when tall vegetation is lost from the area, possibly be able to relocate to surrounding areas. For relatively rare species such as the Harriers and Purple Heron it is important to monitor population differences closely. The large-scale removal of reed might have negative effect on Marsh Harrier populations and many reed inhabiting singing birds. Removing reed can also have reverse (positive) impact on predation, since reed provides habitat for alternative prey (Coots, ducks). It is therefore important not to mow all reeds in the (<b>meadow</b> <b>bird)</b> area. It is also important for the conservation of these species to create vole rich places as an alternative food source. When these places are located strategically outside the <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> area this will most likely lower predation pressure in the area. In short, more insight is needed in the effect of increasing openness in <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> areas on the green network of tall vegetation in the Netherlands. This is needed in order to prevent fragmentation of tall vegetation areas, which might lead to a collapse in population numbers of many species (not only avian predators). Therefore, the effects of increased openness in <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> areas should be carefully monitored and compensation of the loss of tall vegetation by strengthening the green network is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} six decades, populations of wader species like the Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa) have sharply {{decreased}} in the Netherlands. Agricultural intensification has led to reduced habitat quality for meadow birds. As a consequence, reproductive success has declined. One of the main drivers of this decline in reproductive success is reduced food availability for <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> chicks. Agri-environment schemes (AES), designed to halt this decline, have so far been insufficient. Most of these AES focus on entire fields, but recent research suggests that differences in suitability exist within fields. Grass field margins may be more suitable for <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> chicks than the center of intensively managed grass lands. To improve existing <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> AES it could be beneficial to implement additional management in field margins of intensively managed grass fields. An already existing type of field margin AES with additional management is the botanical field margin. Here, we evaluate four different types of field margin management, including botanical field margins, focusing on aerial insects (an {{important part of the}} diet of Black-tailed Godwit chicks and Redshank chicks) in field centers and margins. Grass field margins contained more large aerial insects than field centers and, more importantly, additional management of the grass field margin increased the number of aerial insects in the margin. We conclude that combining <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> AES and botanical field margin management may enhance <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> food availability and improve the efficacy of AES...|$|E
40|$|Since 1992 the European Union helps {{member states}} to reverse the loss of {{biodiversity}} in agricultural landscapes by the financial support of agri-environment schemes. Long-term studies investigating {{the effects of these}} schemes are an essential prerequisite for the development of an effective policy to restore biodiversity on farmland. In Dutch meadow landscapes almost all agri-environment schemes focus on the restoration of <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> populations by postponement of the mowing date. Between 1990 and 2002 we measured long-term changes in <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> densities in areas with and without agri-environment schemes in the Netherlands, {{both before and after the}} start of the contract. During these years bird territories were surveyed during five field visits between 15 March and 15 June. Densities of black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), and redshank (Tringa totanus) were higher in the areas with management agreements, but these differences were already present before the start of the contracts. After the start of the management contracts densities of black-tailed godwit and oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) did not increase, while those of lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) and redshank even declined relative to the control areas. It is concluded that the current agri-environment schemes are not sufficient to restore <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> populations in Dutch agricultural landscapes. In addition to the prescribed postponement of the mowing date, it is probably necessary to raise groundwater levels and to reduce fertilization to allow for the development of an open vegetation structure that will increase chick survival to sufficiently high level...|$|E

Methods: Habitat models were developed that link <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> breeding densities to three habitat characteristics that are sensitive to environmental change (landscape openness, land use and groundwater level). These models were used to assess the impact of scenarios of landscape change with and without climate change on <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> breeding habitat quality for a case study area in the peat meadow district of the Netherlands. Results: All scenarios led to significantly reduced habitat quality for all species, mainly as a result of conversion of grassland to bioenergy crops, which reduces landscape openness. Direct effects of climate change on habitat quality were largely absent, indicating that especially human adaptation to climate change rather than direct effects of climate change was decisive for the degradation of ecological network quality for breeding meadow birds. Conclusions: We conclude that scenario studies exploring impacts of climate change on ecological networks should incorporate both land use change resulting from human responses to climate change and direct effects of climate change on landscapes...|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} of breeding birds on the salt marshes along the Frisian coast (NFB) {{has been studied}} for over more than 20 years. Within this period many factors have changed, affecting both vegetation and bird densities. One {{of these is the}} restoration of salt marsh habitat by managed or 'accidental' realignment of dykes. In this paper we evaluate the development of the breeding bird community on NFB and focus on four different parts that were restored to salt marsh in 2001, 1992 and 1990 and 1975 respectively. Since 1991, 60 species of breeding birds have been recorded on NFB, mostly colonial species and <b>meadow</b> <b>birds.</b> Both on the salt marsh area and in the summer polders (separated from the salt marsh by a low dyke and flooded only during exceptionally high tides), the number of breeding bird species has increased. A crash of colonial species (mainly Black-headed Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Pied Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta) after 2000 is assumed to be mainly driven by increased predation (presumably by Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes). Today, highest densities of breeding birds occur in the summer polders. The de-embanked salt marshes generally show declining densities of primary <b>meadow</b> <b>birds,</b> towards densities that are typical of salt marshes. With the restoration into salt marsh, the risk of inundation of nests and drowning of fledglings has increased, reinforced by an increased frequency of storm surges during the breeding season. Also vegetation has changed, to a large extent in interaction with grazing. Although the confounding effects of ditching, predation, local grazing management and regional food availability are relevant when considering the observed trends, a negative effect of restoration on primary <b>meadow</b> <b>birds</b> was nonetheless detected. The strong decrease of colonial species however is not associated with the restoration of salt marsh habitat and has occurred nearly simultaneously in salt marshes along the neighbouring Groningen coast...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of agri-environment schemes (AES) in enhancing biodiversity on farmland {{and creating a}} long-lasting change in farmers’ motivation towards a more environmental-friendly practice is still strongly debated. Applying a regional approach has been advocated widely to make AES more ecologically and socially sustainable.

We hypothesise that these cooperatives enhance farmers’ intention to participate by facilitating the application of AES, but also by generating group pressure.

Maximum photosynthetic uptake of the grass sward (range 2 to 34 mu mol CO 2 m(- 2) s(- 1)) showed a close and similar linear relationship with Leaf Area Index (LAI; range 1 to 5) except in maturing hay meadows, where maximum photosynthetic uptake did not increase further. Apparent quantum yield varied between 0. 02 and 0. 08 (mean 0. 045) mu mol CO 2 mu mol(- 1) photons at both sites and was significantly correlated with LAI during the growth season. Ecosystem Respiration at 10 degrees C (R- 10) calculated from the year round data set was 3. 35 mu mol CO 2 m(- 2) s(- 1) at Stein and 3. 69 mu mol CO 2 m(- 2) s(- 1) at Oukoop.

40|$|Abstract: Effective {{management}} for nature conservation needs a basis in {{scientific research and}} a careful communication of the knowledge to the workers in the field. This is especially the case in agri-environmental schemes, where nature conservation is to be combined with agricultural production. The Netherlands form {{a vital part of}} the natural habitat of a well-known <b>meadow</b> <b>bird,</b> the black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa). A large portion of the European population is breeding in the Netherlands, but numbers are declining rapidly. Therefore, farmers united in agricultural nature conservation groups formulate management schemes to manage their meadows in a mode which is beneficial for the black-tailed godwit. For meadow birds there is a long lasting discussion on this subject, with questions like: what are the minimum conditions which have to be fulfilled? What are the possibilities within agriculture and how does this relate to nature reserves? What area is needed to reach the pre-defined goals? The today’s view is that a so-called mosaic-management is needed, an alternation of several growth stages and type of use, in space and time. In practice there is a gap between scientists and workers in the field how an effective mosaic is defined. To bridge this gap, Alterra’s experts on meadow birds have used ArcGIS to develop a knowledge system. This knowledge system is a spatially explicit model to assess the effectiveness of management schemes i...|$|E

40|$|A {{major part}} of the Netherlands {{consists}} of meadows used for dairy farming. These meadows are relatively wet and are the main habitat for a group of bird species, known as ‘meadow birds’. They are defined as bird species of which the population that occurs in the Netherlands is largely dependent on agriculturally used grasslands as a breeding site. Meadow birds are typically Dutch because nowhere else in the world does this assemblage of species breed together in the same habitat. The Netherlands is especially important for the Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa) of which circa 50 % of the European population breeds in Dutch meadows. Because of a recent decline of <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> species, various studies into many life characteristics have been started. It was found that the decline must be attributed to changes during the breeding season, especially to agricultural intensification resulting in a lowered breeding success. This thesis however focuses on nest site selection of <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> breeding pairs early in the season. Three habitat requirements are important then: land use, groundwater level and landscape openness. When quantifying the relative importance of these three requirements, landscape openness is found to be the most important, followed by land use and groundwater level. Similarly, an open landscape {{has been shown to be}} important in many other habitats characterized by openness like deserts, tundras, coasts, bogs and marshes. Predator visibility is the main reason for the importance of openness: meadow birds want to visually locate their potential predators and deter it from the breeding site. This is only possible in an open landscape setting with few landscape elements. A literature review confirms that meadow birds select nest sites at a distance from landscape elements. Apart from view-obstructing elements (like forest or buildings), also flat elements (like roads) result in disturbance distances. Human-used elements cause the largest disturbance distances, but elements that are not used by human beings also still do. Furthermore, occupied predator nests result in a surrounding area with lowered densities of meadow birds, irrespective whether the predator’s nest is situated in an open or closed landscape. For Black-tailed Godwit, five core breeding areas in lowland Netherlands were identified where it still breeds in the Netherlands in 2020. These core areas are all open meadow landscapes with high water levels, resulting in an agricultural management that can sustain a healthy godwit population. The five core areas are not officially designated as reserves and, also, two of them are located in the western provinces where the largest pressure of landscape clutter, especially due to urbanization, occurs. For the conservation of the relevant flyway population of the Black-tailed Godwit, EU member states can appoint Special Protection Areas (SPAs). However, the Netherlands did not formally appoint SPAs for its breeding population, but only for the period outside the breeding season when the SPAs function as post-breeding staging areas. Connectivity between SPAs and core breeding areas was however found to be not optimal, resulting in a bottleneck in the protection of Black-tailed Godwi...|$|E
40|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of bird species in the Great Basin region are found in riparian habitats. However, most previous research {{on the impact of}} change in habitat condition through degradation on these bird communities failed to account for the large intersite differences in both habitat type and extent of degradation. We examined songbird communities in 4 riparian habitat types (meadows, willow-, birch-, and aspen-dominated forest stands) during summers 1994 (last year of a 7 -yr drought) and 1995 (following the 6 th wettest winter recorded) in the Toiyabe Mountain Range of central Nevada. Habitat degradation significantly influenced bird species richness in riparian areas, but the impact was dependent upon habitat type. While <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> communities were affected adversely by habitat degradation, with significant drops in species richness on degraded sites, bird species richness in forested riparian habitats was consistently greater on degraded sites. Data for the 6 most common species seen during our study indicated that degradation may have influenced distribution of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia), but habitat type was the best predictor of abundance for House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus), and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s Blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus).

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{decline in}} the presence of farmland birds during recent decades has provoked much attention in agri-environmental policy and ecological research. However, the still limited understanding of the socio-economical mechanisms that govern the decline in bird presence hampers the formulation of effective adjustments in land-use and farming practices that could support the return of birds to farmland, i. e. the required fine-tuning of management practices. As a consequence, the existing agri-environmental schemes that offer financial compensation to farmers for implementing generally simple and rather crude measures to stimulate the presence of birds have been limited in their effectiveness and subject to much debate. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a sociological appraisal of farmers¿ experiences with <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> protection in a mainly dairy farming area in the Netherlands. The methodology combined visual map analysis, surveys, interviews with farmers and experts, and monitoring farmers¿ discussions. The results allowed an assessment of (i) farmers¿ views on historical changes in bird numbers in the area and the current distribution of bird nests, (ii) locally adjusted, fine-tuned management practices that were considered to be promising for protecting bird nests, (iii) the importance of farm management with `an eye for birds¿, i. e. farmers and/or birdwatchers paying additional attention to the presence of nests and chicks before carrying out farming activities, and (iv) the views of key experts in the socio-institutional network in the case study area.

Neither the diversity of plants nor the abundance of birds was related to any of the environmental variables. Agri-environment schemes designed to promote plant species richness or bird abundance did have positive side-effects because they enhanced the species richness of bees and hover flies, irrespective of the type of landscape. Furthermore, landscape type, groundwater level (hover flies), and area of wooded edges (bees) significantly affected both species groups. The failure of the schemes to promote the target species {{may be related to the}} high intensity of land use in The Netherlands. Simple conservation measures taken by farmers may not be sufficient to counteract the impact of factors that are often controlled at the landscape level (e. g., hydrology). Similar studies in other countries are needed to place the results of our study into a European context.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the role of intensive and extensive dairy farm practices on CO 2 exchange and the carbon balance of peatlands by means of eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Year long EC measurements were made in two adjacent farm sites on peat soil {{in the western part}} of the Netherlands. One site (Stein) is a new <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> reserve and is managed predominantly by mowing in June and August. The second site (Oukoop) is an intensive dairy farm. Maximum photosynthetic uptake of the grass sward (range 2 to 34 ?mol CO 2 m ? 2 s ? 1) showed a close and similar linear relationship with Leaf Area Index (LAI; range 1 to 5) except in maturing hay meadows, where maximum photosynthetic uptake did not increase further. Apparent quantum yield varied between 0. 02 and 0. 08 (mean 0. 045) ?mol CO 2 ?mol ? 1 photons at both sites and was significantly correlated with LAI during the growth season. Ecosystem Respiration at 10 °C (R 10) calculated from the year round data set was 3. 35 ?mol CO 2 m ? 2 s ? 1 at Stein and 3. 69 ?mol CO 2 m ? 2 s ? 1 at Oukoop. Both sites were a source of carbon in winter and a sink during summer with net ecosystem exchange varying between 50 to 100 mmol CO 2 m ? 2 d ? 1 in winter to below ? 400 mmol CO 2 m ? 2 d ? 1 in summer. Periodically, both sites became a source after mowing. Net annual ecosystem exchange (NEE) for Stein was ? 5. 7 g C m ? 2 a ? 1 and for Oukoop 133. 9 g C m ? 2 a ? 1. When biomass removal, manure applications and estimates of methane emissions ware taken into account, both eutrophic peat meadows are a strong source for C around 420 g C m ? 2 a ? 1...|$|E
40|$|For a long time, {{agricultural}} areas had considerable ornithological value, an ecological richness which in The Netherlands was epitomised {{by the term}} ‘meadow birds’. However, over the last half century, agricultural intensification has negatively affected the quality of <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> habitats. Here we provide a quantitative characterization of agricultural habitats and their use by Black-tailed Godwits Limosa l. limosa in the south-western part of the province of Friesland, The Netherlands, in 2009, to provide a yardstick to evaluate further change. We used groundwater level, vegetation typology, relief in the landscape, the occurrence of foot drains, land use and soil characteristics such as textures and peat to describe the landscape that comprised 43 polders covering 8480 ha. We used a Principal Component Analysis to summarize landscape characteristics and find {{that much of the}} habitat variation is explained by a combination of herb richness of the vegetation, {{the presence or absence of}} foot drains and groundwater level. The modern agricultural landscape of southwest Friesland consists of 80 % of uniform, intensively managed landscape with herb-poor meadows and low groundwater levels, the remaining 20 % being taken by remnants of the former herb-rich meadows. The whole study area was searched weekly and Black-tailed Godwits were mapped between arrival and egg-laying. The positive relationship between godwit density and the first PC axis indicates that Black-tailed Godwits preferred herb-rich polders with high groundwater levels and the presence of foot drains. Soil texture was poorly correlated with godwit breeding densities for intensively managed (herb-poor) parcels, but for herb-rich meadows, soils of sandy clay loam and sandy clay harboured the highest densities of godwits. To protect Black-tailed Godwits, areas should have a herb-rich vegetation, contain foot drains and high groundwater tables should be re-established. ...|$|E
40|$|Earthworms (Lumbricidae) are {{important}} prey for many birds. Based {{on their own}} feeding ecology, earthworms can be separated into two ecotypes: the detritivores that feed on organic material and the geophages that feed on soil particles and organic matter. Detritivores collect their food on the surface during the night when {{they are exposed to}} nocturnal predators. Hungry animals tend to show more risk-prone behaviour and may therefore be more vulnerable to bird predation, so we expect well-fed detritivorous earthworms to visit the surface less frequently. In this study, we tested this hypothesis in dairy farmland in the province of Fryslân, The Netherlands. Two uniform grasslands were split, with each half receiving either an early (1 February 2014) or a late (14 March 2014) farmyard manure application. Every two weeks, nocturnal surface activity of earthworms was measured by counting surfacing earthworms from a slowly pushed cart. Furthermore, soil samples were taken for total abundances and to measure individual body conditions of earthworms. As predicted, the density of surfacing earthworms was on average 2. 5 times higher in the fields before farmyard manure was applied. Immature detritivores had significantly lower body masses in fields not yet manured, suggesting that these growing earthworms were hungry. Differences in surfacing behaviour and body mass disappeared after all fields had been given farmyard manure. We conclude that hunger forces detritivorous earthworms to the surface. After manure application, they appear satisfied and avoid the risk of depredation by birds by staying away from the soil surface. To promote earthworm availability for meadow birds, spreading farmyard manure on the surface should occur as late in spring as possible. In this way, hungry earthworms are forced to the surface and are available as <b>meadow</b> <b>bird</b> prey for longer periods...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: During {{the years}} 2002 – 2003 {{on the area}} of Baranów commune (Kępno district, South Wielkopolska) a {{research}} was conducted to indicate the foraging sites prefered by the White Storks during the breeding season. A great variability between the periods (6 periods, 20 days each) was shown. During periods 3 and 4 (28. 05 do 6. 07) birds foraged almost only on the meadows, while during the other periods they used equally often arable fields. Other foraging sites were used occasionally and especially during the two first periods (18. 04 do 27. 05), when the birds often moved between foraging sites. On the <b>meadows</b> <b>birds</b> were for-aging in 82. 4 % of cases {{where there was no}} agricultural? machines on the field, contrary to the fields where in 61. 2 % storks foraged during agricultural practices.
