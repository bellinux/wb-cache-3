To achieve a fast curing pro cess, we deposi t <b>microw</b> <b>ave</b> energy to the spot w here opt ical bonding is desi red. Conventional <b>microw</b> <b>ave</b> heating technique, how ever, as w e know it, relies on large mass rat io between the epoxy and the components to be bonded. In order to improve the efficiency of heat abso rption by the t iny amount of adhesive used fo r micro optics packaging, we pre-process the components to be bonded, by first polishing the bonding surfaces and then deposi ting a very thin layer of metalized f ilm on them. An infrared(IR) remote temperature senso r is utilized to monito r {{the temperature of the}} adhesive (to prevent over heating). A n automated sy stem can then adjust the pow er output of the <b>microw</b> <b>ave</b> so that a fairly constant curing temperature can be maintained. During the fast curing process, pre-alignment o f micro opt ics, such as fiber optic coupler, w ill inevitably suffer minor misalignment due to non-uniform heating of the components. To compensate for this side-ef fect, we have developed a real time alignment monito ring and feedback contro lled system. As an example to packag ing fiber couplers, such a sy stem can moni to r the insertion loss(IL) o f a component in real time while the adhesive is being cured by the <b>microw</b> <b>ave</b> energy. A 3 -dimensional piezo-elect ric t ransducer (PZT) i s employed to achieve the x-, y-, and z-axis alignment. A level of 10 nanometer alignment can be readi ly achieved which in turn leads to an IL sensit ivity of as smal l as 0. 004 dB. An improvement of a packaging ef ficiency as high as 150 times has been demonst rated, compared to conventional blind oven curing process. Yield of micro optics packaging is also expected to increase due to the use o f real time alignment pro cess.

40|$|Abstract- Log-Periodic Dipole Antenna (LPDA) is {{a common}} and {{important}} broadband antenna, due to its non-frequency dependent characteristic. However, in the conventional design, the physical size is restricted to the longest oscillator dipole w ith the low est resonant frequency, which is quite large and constrains its application. To realize the antenna miniaturization, many methods, including loading technology, fractal technology, meandering line technology etc. {{have been used to}} reduce the size of antenna without reducing the antennaâ€˜s performance. To achieve the purpose of miniaturization of the LPDA, this paper presents a novel structure of log-periodic antenna loaded with symmetrical meandering dipoles. The modeling and simulation of the above design is carried out using a 3 D Electro- magnetic simulator WIPL-D <b>microw</b> <b>ave...</b>|$|E
40|$|Microwave {{mammography}} permits thermal {{changes to}} be estimated {{both within the}} breast and onto its surface. It is obvious that i replace X-ray mammography or ultrasonography (USG) since it gives no information on breast structural changes, which is very ne for a physician. At the same time microwave mammography can yield additional information on the magnitude of proliferative processes and on the thermal activity of tissue. In many cases, this information may be decisive in elaborating treatment policy. Due to its simplicity, non-invasiveness, and safety, decimetric <b>microw</b> <b>ave</b> radiothermometry may be a promising method for diagno sing breast cancer and evaluating the efficiency of its treatment. When used in combination with X-ray study and USG, this technique provides incomparable assistance in defining the management of patients. The concurrent use of mammography, USG, and radiothermometric d iag- nosis of the breast assists in reducing the level of diagnostic errors to 1 - 3 %. </p...|$|E
