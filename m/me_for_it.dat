In an interview that same year, he said that the Soviet Union opposed him because he had invented the Strategic Defense Initiative. [...] "The Soviet government hated <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Gorbachev also hated my guts and called for my assassination and imprisonment and so forth." [...] He asserted that he had survived these threats because he had been protected by unnamed U.S. government officials. [...] "Even when they don't like me, they consider me a national asset, and they don't like to have their national assets killed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Helene {{noted in}} her book that she exposed herself and her family to great danger by {{assisting}} the queen in her efforts to obtain the crown. In an atmosphere of political intrigue, where death was a common punishment for many crimes, Helene apparently had reservations concerning the advisibility of the queen's request: [...] "The queen's request frightened <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> meant great danger {{for me and my}} little children." [...] In her writing she describes how she prayed for success and promised to make a barefoot pilgrimage to Zell. At least two assistants accompanied Helene, who did the breaking in while Helene kept watch. After they got the crown without attracting attention, they locked the doors again and fixed the queen's seal.|$|E
