Today's high number of digital tools are deployed and used to support planners along their activities. However, the challenge remains not only to have better understanding of network configuration and evaluation but also to identify the most suitable digital tool with the required functionalities and capabilities for these purposes and needs. To meet these challenges, a new combined approach for the configuration and the evaluation of production networks using a maturity model has been conceived at the Fraunhofer IPA. The <b>maturity</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> also takes into account recommendations and measures to increase the degree of maturity. In a further step the developed approach is also suitable to measure and evaluate the progress made on {{the configuration of the}} supply chain...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{industry}} {{is reluctant to}} use high volumes of fly ash in concrete due to slower rate of strength gain observed in high volume fly ash concretes. Fly ash, a by-product of coal industry, is readily available on large scale, has cementitious properties {{and can be used}} as cheaper substitute for cement. In case of large concrete structures, a phenomenon known as mass effect is observed which cures the concrete at higher temperature thereby accelerating the rate of strength development in early ages. The aim of this research is to demonstrate that, although the rate of strength gain is slower in HVFA concrete, sufficient early age strength is developed due to mass effect observed in large concrete structures. A 14 -day <b>maturity</b> <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> was adopted to develop prediction models which can estimate in-place strength of HVFA concrete mixtures by taking into account the mass effect of concrete. The results maturity are compared against the existing methods and also with 28 -day based maturity models and attempt is made to select the best approach of in-place strength determination...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of temperature on the autogenous shrinkage of cement paste {{has been studied}} using the <b>maturity</b> <b>approach</b> <b>based</b> on Arrhenius' law. Application of this law requires knowledge of the apparent activation energy, E-a, of cement. In this work, E-a has been determined by the "setting time method. " The external volume change of cement paste was measured by hydrostatic weighing. In order to separate the thermal and autogenous deformations, the thermal dilation coefficient (TDC) was determined at both 20 and 30 degreesC. Investigations have shown that maturity {{can be used to}} predict autogenous shrinkage under isothermal and realistic conditions as long as temperatures remain between 10 and 40 degreesC. Outside of this temperature range, the calculated autogenous deformation and measured isothermal shrinkage are quite different and, as a result, autogenous shrinkage appears to be dependent on more than hydration advancement alone...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{productivity}} and competitiveness are still major challenges for companies. One approach for performance improvement are maturity models. Their main principle is an objective performance evaluation and improvement {{that can be}} applied on different topics (e. g. innovation management, virtual prototyping & simulation). To simplify the application of the principle on new topics, this paper presents a framework that allows an efficient and standardised development of a maturity model that can be conducted as a self-assessment. The framework consists of a standardised architecture for the maturity model, a procedure model for its development and a software-tool. The application of the framework on the topic of Virtual Prototyping & Simulation resulted in the VPS-Benchmark, which serves as an example for a <b>maturity</b> <b>based</b> self-assessment throughout this paper.

These approaches were developed through different paths and generally provided understandings from different angles of the same problem. As shown in numerical simulations, implementa-tions of wavelet frame <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> and PDE <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> quite often end up with solving a similar numerical problem with similar numerical behaviors, even though different approaches have advantages in different applications.

For text mining there are basically two types of approaches; one is term <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> and another is phrase <b>based</b> <b>approach.</b> But term <b>based</b> <b>approach</b> suffered with the problem of polysemy and synonymy.
