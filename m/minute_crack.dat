In 1366 it was renewed and got one only dial that was directed towards the Limmat and only displayed the hours. Around 1460, the sense of time has been refined by half on the quarter-hour strike, and in 1538 the striking clock was replaced, and all four facades got dials. Replacements of the clock mechanism followed in 1593/94 and 1675 and 1826. In 1844 a new movement with quarter-hour strike was installed; the electrification of the work was carried out in 1873. In 1972 the balance was replaced by a fully automatic master clock in the clock room of the St. Peter's tower, and in 1996 the electrified mechanical movement of 1844 was shut down and replaced by a central computer system. The clock tower of St. Peter was for centuries Zürich's 'official local time', and all public city clocks had to conform to it. The church clock of St. Peter has the largest tower clock face in Europe, the outer diameter of each of the four church clocks measures 8.64 m, the minute hand 5.73 m, the hour hand 5.07 m, and the <b>minute</b> <b>crack</b> of the large pointer measures 0.455 m.|$|E
40|$|Analysis {{of fatigue}} samples {{sectioned}} from commercial 319 (Al-Si-Cu-Mg) alloy cylinder block castings showed that shrinkage pore networks and oxide films {{played an important}} role in fatigue failure. A reduced pressure technique was employed to study the relationship between porosity and oxide films. Links between oxide films and porosity were made and mechanisms for the inflation of films into porosity networks were established. Tensile tests performed on samples cast with and without filters showed that the ultimate tensile strengths of the filtered group had a Weibull modulus 2. 4 times that of the unfiltered. Samples with abnormally low strengths were found to contain oxide film defects. These films had an approximately 5 times greater damaging effect on strength than that predicted by reduction in cross sectional area. The fracture strengths of these flawed samples were found to obey a linear elastic fracture mechanics model (LEFM). A LEFM crack growth model was particularly successful in predicting the life of fatigue samples that initiated at oxide films. Having crack-like geometry, and a <b>minute</b> <b>crack</b> tip radius, oxide films effectively acted as preformed cracks. Consequently there was an absence of crack nucleation time, explaining the correlation of predicted propagation life to fatigue life...|$|E
40|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1880, piezoelectric devices have found widespread use in engineering applications {{due to their}} simplicity and ease of application. High {{on the list of}} applications is their versatility in sensor technology applications particularly as the key element in modern day accelerometers. Furthermore, recent advances in piezoelectric crystals have made them even more cost effective for use in low cost sensors for condition monitoring of structure. Traditional methods utilising acceleration and strain gauge signals for detecting an incipient failure in structures suffer from inherent difficulty due to massive damping characteristics of the structures which results in minute fault signals being buried in dominant background signal components. In this paper, common PZT materials such as PZT- 5 A and PZT- 5 H were used in the construction of piezoceramic (PZT) sensors. Experimental tests were performed to evaluate the performance of the PZT sensors in detecting a simulated bearing crack operating at low speeds (100 rpm) and comparisons made with a commercial accelerometer and an ultra-sound prob. The results show that the PZT sensor is a more sensitive device compared to a commercial sensors in detecting a <b>minute</b> <b>crack</b> of a rolling element bearing operating at low speeds.

They will do this by produc-ing stress concentrations around themselves. It is shown that bone is permeated with such stress-concentrators in the form of canaliculi, osteocyte lacunae, blood-vessels, and muscle insertions. However, in mammalian bone the orientation of the lacunae and blood-vessels is such as to reduce, though not abolish, the concentrating powers of these elements in relation to the dangerous stresses acting in the bone. The smooth-ness of the diaphysis shaft and the raising of muscle insertions on to cristae will have similar advantageous effects.
