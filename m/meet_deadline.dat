40|$|Prior {{research}} on schedulability bounds {{focused primarily on}} bounding utilization {{as a means to}} <b>meet</b> <b>deadline</b> constraints. Non-trivial bounds were found for a handful of scheduling policies in which utilization {{is directly related to the}} ability of the policy to meet deadlines. Examples include Rate Monotonic, Deadline Monotonic and EDF scheduling. For most other scheduling policies, however, utilization is not correlated with schedulability. For example, shortest job first can miss deadlines at an arbitrarily low utilization. This raises the question of whether or not some other non-utilization-based metric might be more indicative of schedulability in those cases. This paper answers the above question positively by extending the notion of schedulability bounds, in a uniform manner, to arbitrary priorities and non-utilization metrics. We present a simple function that generates the schedulability metric to be bounded from the definition of a (fixed-priority) scheduling policy, and derive a non-trivial schedulability bound on that metric. It is shown that the generated metrics and bounds are valid in that no deadline misses occur when these bounds are not violated. This result allows efficient real-time admission control to be performed in systems with arbitrary fixed-priority scheduling policies. As an example, we illustrate applying schedulability bounds for admission control to shortest-jobfirst and velocity monotonic scheduling.

40|$|Mission-critical system {{typically}} {{refers to}} a project or system for which the success {{is vital to the}} mission of the underlying organization. The failure or delayed completion of the tasks in mission-critical systems may cause severe financial loss, even human casualties. For example, failure of an accurate and timely forecast of Hurricane Rita in September 2005 caused enormous financial loss and several deaths. As such, real-time guarantee and reliability have always been two key foci of mission-critical system design. Many factors affect real-time guarantee and reliability. From the software design perspective, which is the focus of this paper, three aspects are most important. The first of these is how to design a single application to effectively support real-time requirement and improve reliability, the second is how to integrate different applications in a cluster environment to guarantee real-time requirement and improve reliability, and the third is how to effectively coordinate distributed applications to support real-time requirements and improve reliability. Following these three aspects, this dissertation proposes and implements three novel methodologies: real-time component based single node application development, real-time workflow-based cluster application integration, and real-time distributed admission control. For ease of understanding, we introduce these three methodologies and implementations in three real-world mission-critical application systems: single node mission-critical system, cluster environment mission-critical system, and wide-area network mission-critical system. We study full-scale design and implementation of these mission-critical systems, more specifically: 1) For the single node system, we introduce a real-time component based application model, a novel design methodology, and based on the model and methodology, we implement a real-time component based Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) System. Through component based design, efficient resource management and scheduling, we show that our model and design methodology can effectively improve system reliability and guarantee real-time requirement. 2) For the system in a cluster environment, we introduce a new application model, a real-time workflow-based application integration methodology, and based on the model and methodology, we implement a data center management system for the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) project. We show that our methodology can greatly simplify the design of such a system and make it easier to <b>meet</b> <b>deadline</b> requirements, while improving system reliability through the reuse of fully tested legacy models. 3) For the system in a wide area network, we narrow our focus to a representative VoIP system and introduce a general distributed real-time VoIP system model, a novel system design methodology, and an implementation. We show that with our new model and architectural design mechanism, we can provide effective real-time requirement for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) ...|$|E
40|$|Real-time tasks require {{sufficient}} {{resources to}} <b>meet</b> <b>deadline</b> constraints. A component should provision sufficient resources for its workloads consisting of tasks {{to meet their}} deadlines. Supply and demand bound functions {{can be used to}} analyze the schedulability of workloads. The demand-bound function determines the maximum required computational units for a given workload and the supply-bound function determines the minimum possible resources supplied to the workload. A component will experience an overload if it receives fewer resources than required. An overload will be transient if it occurs for a bounded amount of time. Most work concentrates on designing components that avoid overloads by over-provisioning resources even though some computational units such as control system components can tolerate transient overloads. Overload-tolerant components can utilize resources more efficiently if over-provisioning of resources can be avoided. First, this dissertation presents the design of an efficient periodic resource model for scheduling computation of components that can tolerate transient overloads under the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling policy. We propose a periodic resource model for overload-tolerant components to address three problems: (1) characterize overloads and determine metrics of interest (i. e., delay), (2) derive a model to compute a periodic resource supply for a given workload and a worst-case tolerable delay, and (3) find a periodic resource supply for given control system specifications with a worst-case delay. The derived periodic resource supply can be used to derive an overload-tolerant component interface. Overload-tolerant real-time components can connect with each other in a distributed manner and thus require communication scheduling for reliable and guaranteed transmissions. Moreover, applications may require multi-mode communication for efficient data transmission. Second, this dissertation discusses communication schedules for multi-mode distributed components. Since distributed multi-mode applications are prone to suffer from delays incurred during mode changes, good communication schedules have low average mode-change delays. A key problem in designing multi-mode communication in real-time systems is the generation of schedules to move away the complexity of schedule design from the developer. We propose a mechanism to generate multi-mode communication schedules using optimization constraints associated with timing requirements. We illustrate a workflow from specifications to the generation of communication schedules through a real-time video monitoring case-study. Experimental analysis for the case-study demonstrates that schedules generated using the proposed method reduce the average mode-change delay compared to a randomized algorithm and the well-known EDF scheduling policy. Finally, this thesis discusses the synthesis of schedules for computation and communication to achieve not only performance but also separation of concerns for reducing complexity and increasing safety. To integrate overload-tolerant components using real-time communication, we derive specifications of component interfaces using the characterization of overloads and the proposed periodic resource model. The generation of communication schedules uses the specifications of interfaces which include timing requirements of possible transient overloads. A walk-through case-study explains the steps necessary to generate communication schedules using component interfaces. The interfaces provide safety through isolation of transient overload-tolerant components and the generated communication schedules provide high performance {{as a result of their}} low average mode-change delay...|$|E

The question is whether all tasks can <b>meet</b> their <b>deadlines</b> on one processor. If not, how many processors are needed? For the one-processor problem, we prove two sufficient conditions for a (restricted) periodic task set to <b>meet</b> <b>deadlines.</b> The two conditions {{can be applied to}} both preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling, in sharp contrast to earlier results. If a periodic task set can <b>meet</b> <b>deadlines</b> under any algorithm which does not idle the processor {{as long as there are}} tasks ready to execute, it must satisfy our second condition. We also prove a necessary condition for a periodic task set to <b>meet</b> <b>deadlines</b> under any scheduling algorithm. We present a method for transforming a sporadic task to an equivalent periodic task. The transformation method is optimal with respect to non-preemptive scheduling. With this method, all results on scheduling periodic task sets can be applied to sets of both periodic and sporadic tasks. For the scheduling problem in distributed memory systems, we propose various heuristic algorithms which try to use as few processors as possible to <b>meet</b> <b>deadlines.</b> Although our algorithms are non-preemptive, our simulation results show that they can outperform the heuristic algorithms based on the famous preemptive rate monotonic algorithm in terms of the number of used processors and processor utilization rate. Second, we describe a hard real-time software development environment, called HaRTS, which consists of a design tool and a scheduling tool. The design tool supports a hierarchical design diagram which combines the control and data flow of a hard real-time application. The design diagram is quite intuitive, and yet it can be automatically translated into Ada™ code and analyzed for scheduleability. The scheduling tool schedules precedence-constrained periodic task sets and simulates the task execution with highly animated user interfaces, which goes beyond the traditional way of examining a schedule as a static Gantt chart...|$|R
