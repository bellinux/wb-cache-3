5|$|Obesity and <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{are both}} {{closely related to}} plasma {{triglyceride}} levels. Therefore, the focus on an association between APOA5 and BMI or <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is understandable. Available studies show that minor APOA5 alleles could be associated with an enhanced risk of obesity or <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> development. However, genome wide studies have failed to prove that APOA5 is a gene associated with BMI values and/or obesity, so the effect could be far from clinically significant or at least significantly context-dependent.|$|E
5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse transgenic mouse models (APOA5 transgenic and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a significant association in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E
5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism {{may lead to}} secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency is associated with obesity, raised cholesterol and the <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and estradiol deficiency may lead to osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.|$|E

40|$|Runs of {{homozygosity}} (ROH) are contiguous {{stretches of}} homozygous genome which likely reflect transmission from common ances- tors {{and can be}} used to track the inheritance of haplotypes of interest. In the present paper, ROH were extracted from 50 K SNPs and used to detect regions of the genome associated with susceptibility to diseases in a population of 468 Holstein-Frisian cows. Diagnosed diseases were categorised as infectious diseases, <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> mastitis, reproductive diseases and locomotive disorders. ROH associated with infectious diseases, mastitis and locomotive disorders were found on BTA 12. A long region of homozygosity linked with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> infectious and reproductive diseases was detected on BTA 15, disclosing complex relationships between immunity, metabolism and functional disorders. ROH associated with infectious and reproductive diseases, mastitis and <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndromes</b> were observed on chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 13 and 18. Previous studies reported QTLs for milk production traits on all of these regions, thus substantiating the known negative relationship between selection for milk production and health in dairy cattle...|$|R

Mutations are detected in between 50 and 80% of cases; those without a mutation often have higher triglyceride levels and may in fact have other causes for their high cholesterol, such as combined hyperlipidemia due to <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{emergence}} of studies investigating yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer patients. Yoga is used for treatment of cancer patients to decrease depression, insomnia, pain, and fatigue and to increase anxiety control, {{although there is a}} generally low quality of research and uncertainty for proving this effect. In preliminary research, yoga improved cognitive functioning. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found no evidence that yoga was effective for <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} {{attack of gout}} usually {{resolves}} in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout {{are at increased risk}} of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are at increased risk of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
40|$|Background: Diabetes and <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndromes</b> are chronic, devastating {{diseases}} {{with increasing}} prevalence. Human {{pluripotent stem cells}} are gaining popularity in their usage for human in vitro disease modeling. With recent rapid advances in genome editing tools, these cells can now be genetically manipulated with relative ease to study how genes and gene variants contribute to diabetes and <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Scope of review: We highlight the diabetes and metabolic genes and gene variants, which could potentially be studied, using two powerful technologies – human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and genome editing tools – to aid the elucidation of yet elusive mechanisms underlying these complex diseases. Major conclusions: hPSCs and the advancing genome editing tools {{appear to be a}} timely and potent combination for probing molecular mechanism(s) underlying diseases such as diabetes and <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndromes.</b> The knowledge gained from these hiPSC-based disease modeling studies can potentially be translated into the clinics by guiding clinicians on the appropriate type of medication to use for each condition based on the mechanism of action of the disease...|$|R

5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} {{at some point}} in their lifetimes and is becoming more common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> and high blood pressure. Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, race and the season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, rates are 2%.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with gouty arthritis.|$|E

25|$|It has {{not been}} contested that {{cardiovascular}} risk factors tend to cluster together; the matter of contention has been the assertion that the <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is anything {{more than the sum}} of its constituent parts. Phenotypic heterogeneity (for example, represented by variation in <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> factor combinations among individuals with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome)</b> has fueled that debate. However, more recent evidence suggests that common triggers (for example, excessive sugar-intake in the environment of overabundant food) can contribute to the development of multiple metabolic abnormalities at the same time, supporting the commonality of the energy utilization and storage pathways in <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{associated}} with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

25|$|The {{involvement}} of the endocannabinoid system {{in the development of}} <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is indisputable.

40|$|Background. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>syndromes</b> such as Wernicke’s {{encephalopathy}} {{may present}} {{with a sudden}} neurological deficit, thus mimicking acute onset stroke. Due to current emphasis on rapid admission and treatment of acute stroke patients, {{there is a significant}} risk that these stroke mimics may end up being treated with thrombolysis. Rigorous clinical and radiological skills are necessary to correctly identify such metabolic stroke mimics, in order to avoid doing any harm to these patients due to the unnecessary use of thrombolysis. Patient. A 51 -year-old Caucasian male was admitted to our hospital with suspicion of an acute stroke due to sudden onset dysarthria and unilateral facial nerve paresis. Clinical examination revealed confusion and dysconjugate gaze. Computed tomography (CT) including a CT perfusion (CTP) scan revealed bilateral thalamic hyperperfusion. The use of both clinical and radiological findings led to correctly diagnosing Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Conclusion. The application of CTP as a standard diagnostic tool in acute stroke patients can improve the detection of stroke mimics caused by <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndromes</b> as shown in our case report...|$|R
40|$|Cancer cells often {{depend on}} altered {{metabolism}} {{compared with their}} normal counterparts. [1],[2],[3],[4] As observed in 1924 by Otto Warburg, cancer cells show preferential glucose consumption by way of aerobic glycolysis while normal cells generally assume mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. [4] Another metabolic hallmark of carcinogenesis is altered lipid metabolism, whereby cancer cells may adopt enhanced de novo lipid production (lipogenesis). [1],[2],[3] Enhanced lipid metabolism is also observed in individuals with <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndromes</b> potentially a consequence of increasing popularity of the Standard American Diet, composed of high levels of saturated fats and carbohydrates. [5] A growing body of epidemiological data indicates {{a positive correlation between}} the occurrence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, type- 2 diabetes and associated hyperinsulemia, with the aggressiveness of cancer. [6],[7],[8],[9] Remarkably, it is estimated that for every 1 % reduction in saturated fats, replaced by polyunsaturated, there would be a 2 %- 3 % reduction in cardiovascular disease. [10] Thus, it is conceivable that an equally remarkable attenuation in cancer progression might be achieved with such a reduction in lipid accumulation...|$|R
