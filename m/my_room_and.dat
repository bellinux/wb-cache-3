500|$|McEwan {{has been}} open about the autobiographical {{elements}} in the book, and has called it [...] "a muted and distorted autobiography" [...] and [...] "a muted, or transmuted, memoir {{of myself as a}} young writer." [...] There are, however, significant differences between author and character. Haley is both an academic and a writer of fiction, while McEwan has been a professional author for his entire career. The intelligence agency plot is also completely fictional; there was never a scheme such as the one described in the book run by MI5. As McEwan says himself, [...] "unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> offered me a stipend." ...|$|E
500|$|Drake was {{featured}} in full-page interviews in the pop press. In July, Melody Maker referred to the album as [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "interesting", though NME wrote in October that there was [...] "not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining". It received radio plays from the BBC's more progressive disc-jockeys such as John Peel and Bob Harris. Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve, which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions. In an interview his sister Gabrielle said: [...] "He was very secretive. I knew he was making an album but I didn't know what stage of completion it was at until he walked into <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> said, 'There you are.' He threw it onto the bed and walked out!" ...|$|E
500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come to <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E

2500|$|Milano {{began her}} career at age seven, when her babysitter, without notifying her parents, {{took her to}} an {{audition}} {{for one of the}} four principal parts in a national touring company of Annie. Milano was one of four selected from more than 1,500 girls. During the course of her work in the play, Milano and her mother were on the road for 18 months. After returning to New York, she appeared in television commercials and did several roles in off-Broadway productions, including the first American musical adaptation of Jane Eyre. When accompanying a friend from the Annie production to the office of a New York agent, Milano was introduced to the agent, who began representing her. She does not feel that growing {{up in front of the}} camera harmed her childhood, and has said: [...] "I love my family very much [...] they've really backed my career. I consider myself to be normal: I've got to clean <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> help in the kitchen." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went to <b>my</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department {{released}} the full report, photographs from Cornell's hotel room, and the 911 {{call from the}} MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell's death. The call was made by an hotel employee at 12:56a.m., reporting [...] "a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136". According to the report, Martin Kirsten, Cornell's bodyguard, was at the singer's hotel room at 11:30p.m. {{to help him with}} his computer, [...] "which was not working at that time." [...] It also says that Cornell's wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35p.m., and alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband [...] "because he did not sound like he was OK." [...] A call from Cornell's wife at 12:15a.m. prompted his bodyguard to go to the singer's suite to check on him. Kirsten told police he was in his room watching TV when he {{received a phone call from}} Vicky. [...] "She sounded angry because he [...] wasn’t responding to his phone. She told me to go to the room and check on Chris. I came to the room and was unable to get (in) because of the interior latch. I went back to <b>my</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn’t my room, although I told them that he was my employer and that I had a key." ...|$|E
