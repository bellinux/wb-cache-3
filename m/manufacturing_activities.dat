As well as its rich historical heritage, Gyeongju today {{is affected by the}} economic, demographic, and social trends that have shaped modern South Korean culture. Tourism remains the major economic driver, but <b>manufacturing</b> <b>activities</b> have developed due to its proximity to major industrial centers such as Ulsan and Pohang.

5|$|During the 20th century, Bristol's <b>manufacturing</b> <b>activities</b> {{expanded}} to include aircraft production at Filton by the Bristol Aeroplane Company and aircraft-engine manufacturing by Bristol Aero Engines (later Rolls-Royce) at Patchway. Bristol Aeroplane was known for their World War I Bristol Fighter and World War II Blenheim and Beaufighter planes. During the 1950s they were a major English manufacturer of civilian aircraft, known for the Freighter, Britannia and Brabazon. The company diversified into automobile manufacturing during the 1940s, producing hand-built, luxury Bristol Cars at their factory in Filton, and the Bristol Cars company was spun off in 1960. The city also gave its name to Bristol buses, which were manufactured in the city from 1908 to 1983: by Bristol Tramways until 1955, and from 1955 to 1983 by Bristol Commercial Vehicles.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for determining the}} optimal geographical location for a plant engaged in a specified <b>manufacturing</b> <b>activity.</b> The <b>manufacturing</b> <b>activity</b> {{is defined as the}} conversion of several raw material and sub-assemblies into a finished product. The optimal plant location is defined as the one which minimizes costs of shipping raw materials from various optional sources to the plant, the cost of shipping the finished product to specified markets, and the cost of labor involved in the assembly process. The method of solution is described, as is the computer program for implementing the method. Some illustrative examples are also given. This project was suggested by a problem of the Industrial Research and Information Services of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.

25|$|To attract industry, {{the state}} {{government}} has designated certain areas {{on the outskirts of}} the city as industrial districts where infrastructure is provided and land sales are made under special conditions.

The aeroplane company became famous for the World War I Bristol Fighter, and Second World War Blenheim and Beaufighter aircraft.

25|$|In 1940, just as {{orders for}} {{lightweight}} cars were increasing and sleeping car traffic was growing, the United States Department of Justice filed an anti-trust complaint against Pullman Incorporated in the U.S. District Court at Philadelphia (Civil Action No. 994). The government sought {{to separate the}} company's sleeping car operations from its <b>manufacturing</b> <b>activities.</b> In 1944, the court concurred, ordering Pullman Incorporated to divest itself of either the Pullman Company (operating) or the Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company (manufacturing). After three years of negotiations, the Pullman Company was sold to a consortium of fifty-seven railroads for around US$40million.|$|E
25|$|Formed by Helmut P Martin and George H Handasyde in 1908, the Brooklands-based Martin and Handasyde {{aircraft}} company {{changed its}} name to Martinsyde Ltd in 1915 and then moved its office and aircraft <b>manufacturing</b> <b>activities</b> to the former Oriental Institute in Woking. By 1918, Martinsyde aircraft production had increased {{to such an extent that}} it was Britain's third largest aircraft manufacturer. In 1920, the factory was devastated by fire and aircraft production ended although motorcycle production continued until the company entered receivership in 1922. In 1924, Martinsyde's assets passed to the Aircraft Disposal Company (ADC). In 1926, the site became James Walker Engineering to be renamed Lion Works.|$|E

25|$|However, {{a recent}} {{movement}} to reestablish <b>manufacturing</b> <b>activities</b> in the United States driven by customer demand for American made products, faster product delivery, increased overseas wages, and inflated costs of shipping {{has led to}} a sizeable increase in the local manufacturing base and rapidly growing interest in the region. Few other areas in the country are able to offer such comparatively low costs of living and doing business, including low energy costs, tax incentives and overnight distribution access to more than one-third the total population of the United States. Several large manufacturing companies from countries such as China and Germany have already invested {{tens of millions of dollars}} into establishing significant operations in the Lehigh Valley with the potential to create thousands of new local jobs in this sector.|$|E
25|$|When the Scottish Clan Line {{shipping}} company became {{a joint venture}} partner in the Hunting Group's air transport business in late-1953, {{this resulted in a}} split of the group. As a consequence, Hunting's aircraft <b>manufacturing</b> <b>activities</b> were not transferred to the new holding company that took control of the airline and its maintenance support. At that time, the Clan Line was one of two UK shipping lines controlled by the Cayzer shipping magnates. Sir Nicholas Cayzer, who headed the Cayzer family's shipping businesses, viewed his stake in one of Britain's leading contemporary independent airlines as a defensive move to ward off air transport's growing competitive threat to the shipping industry. During that period, Alan Lennox-Boyd, the contemporary Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, signalled the Government's willingness to let Hunting-Clan shift its base to London Airport (now London Heathrow).|$|E
25|$|By 1975, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>activities</b> {{constituted}} 16% of the Malaysian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), one {{per cent}} {{short of the}} target of the Second Malaysia Plan. Manufacturing grew negligibly in 1975, attributed by the government to the global recession that year. This contrasted with the 15% growth achieved in 1974, which well exceeded the target of 12.5% growth per year during the Second Malaysia Plan. Food, wood products, and chemical products made up the majority of the manufacturing sector. The substantial growth in manufacturing during this period has been attributed to the government's establishment of free trade zones, where any goods brought in would not be subject to customs duties, and goods could be freely exported abroad or transferred to another free trade zone. In 1974, such zones were declared in the states of Penang, Selangor, and Malacca. The industries located in these zones were mostly electronics-, rubber product- and textile-based.|$|E

500|$|Innovation in 18th-century Birmingham {{often took}} the form of {{incremental}} series of small-scale improvements to existing products or processes, but also included major developments that lay {{at the heart of the}} emergence of industrial society. In 1709 the Birmingham-trained Abraham Darby I moved to Coalbrookdale in Shropshire and built the first blast furnace to successfully smelt iron ore with coke, transforming the quality, volume and scale on which it was possible to produce cast iron. In 1732 Lewis Paul and John Wyatt invented roller spinning, the [...] "one novel idea of the first importance" [...] in the development of the mechanised cotton industry. In 1741 they opened the world's first cotton mill in Birmingham's Upper Priory. In 1746 John Roebuck invented the lead chamber process, enabling the large-scale manufacture of sulphuric acid, and in 1780 James Keir developed a process for the bulk manufacture of alkali, together marking the birth of the modern chemical industry. In 1765 Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Manufactory, pioneering the combination and mechanisation under one roof of previously separate <b>manufacturing</b> <b>activities</b> through a system known as [...] "rational manufacture". As the largest manufacturing unit in Europe this come to symbolise the emergence of the factory system.|$|E
