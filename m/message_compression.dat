40|$|Abstract — The {{popularity}} of Web-based transactions {{and the need}} for more sophisticated content distribution methods has helped to fuel the rapid growth of Web Service adoption, specifically, HTTP-bound Web Services. Secure and efficient content delivery has long been a requirement of traditional Web-based distribution schemes, and existing the Web infrastructure provides numerous options for securing and optimizing HTTP. Two exemplary technologies are SSL/TLS and HTTP compression. While efforts to solidify the more granular WS-Security standards are ongoing, and methods for XML <b>message</b> <b>compression</b> schemes continue to be investigated, HTTP provides an interim solution, supporting transactional security and <b>message</b> <b>compression.</b> The SSL/TLS and HTTP compression technologies have become commoditized and pervasive. And with the trend in content delivery toward hardware offload for these functions, modern data centers have begun to raise the bar for performance. In this paper, we examine three different paradigms for implementing SSL/TLS and HTTP compression: softwarebased functionality, server-resident hardware accelerators, and centralized network-resident hardware accelerators. We discuss the trade-offs between the two different offload techniques (i. e., PCI accelerator vs. network proxy) and explore their relationship to the current performance activities, in the field of Web Services. In analyzing the results for SSL/TLS offload, and the effects of compression, in conjunction with SSL/TLS, we draw parallels with the efforts of WS-Security and XML <b>message</b> <b>compression.</b> Although optimizations for software-based cryptography will continue to advance, the potential for hardware-based acceleration should not be overlooked. We discuss our results and address deployment scenarios for optimizing Web-based transactions, and the future optimization of Web Service transactions. I...|$|E

In the one-way relay channel, we analyze a compress-forward scheme without Wyner- Ziv binning but with joint decoding of both the <b>message</b> and <b>compression</b> index. It achieves {{the same rate as}} the original compress-forward scheme with binning and successive decoding. Therefore, binning helps reduce decoding complexity by allowing successive decoding, but has no impact on achievable rate for the one-way relay channel. On the other hand, no binning simplifies relay operation. By extending compress-forward without binning to the two-way relay channel, we can achieve a larger rate region than the original compress-forward scheme when the channel is asymmetric for the two users. Binning and successive decoding limits the compression rate to match the weaker of the channels from relay to two users, whereas without binning, this restriction no longer applies. Compared with noisy network coding, compress-forward without binning achieves the same rate region in certain Gaussian channel configurations, and it has much less delay.

Such systems have an execution dependency among component types and each component type may have multiple instances. The execution dependency differs from deployment dependency in that it considers the runtime data and control flows, instead of the static dependencies [3] among software modules. Stream {{processing systems}} need to achieve a safe state and to maintain the consistency among the states of the components during and after the dynamic reconfiguration. At the same time, due to the continuous nature of the stream it is not feasible to block (or await a quiescent state of) some of the involved components. Another issue is that this sort of system has to handle coordinated adaptations of several – possibly distributed – instances of a same component type. The example by [16] in illustrates a simple scenario, such as a chat application, in which senders interact with the receivers through the execution of a <b>message</b> payload <b>compression</b> and de-compression algorithm, respectively. In a typical distributed system, both sender and receiver nodes have their own local instances of the (de)compression component type.

40|$|In the {{classical}} compress-and-forward relay scheme developed by (Cover and El Gamal, 1979), the decoding process operates in a successive way: the destination first decodes the compression of the relay’s observation, and then decodes the original {{message of the}} source. Recently, several modified compress-and-forward relay schemes were proposed, where, the destination jointly decodes the <b>compression</b> and the <b>message,</b> instead of successively. Such a modification on the decoding process was motivated by realizing that it is generally easier to decode the compression jointly with the original message, and more importantly, the original message can be decoded even without completely decoding the compression.

However, the question remains whether this freedom of selecting the compression necessarily improves the achievable rate of the original message. It {{has been shown in}} (El Gamal and Kim, 2010) that the answer is negative in the single-relay case. In this paper, it is further demonstrated {{that in the case of}} multiple relays, there is no improvement on the achievable rate by joint decoding either.
