The technique improves locating a <b>microseismic</b> <b>event</b> in a velocity model for which the interface boundaries are approximate but where it has the correct mean slowness. Our method designs a signal to be rebroadcasted from the receivers, using only the waves recorded at each receiver, such that the wave field has an optimal temporal focus at the source location. Additionally, this procedure leads to an improved spatial focus of the wave field. The numerical test shown include additive noise. This proposed technique only involves a simple preprocessing step to the recorded data and its cost is hence negligible compared to the total cost of microseismic imaging...|$|E

A key aspect of economic production in these low-permeability rocks is hydraulic fracture stimulation, usually in horizontal wells.

30|$|Several methodologies {{exist for}} extracting induced {{fracture}} network location {{information from a}} cloud of microseismic events, including stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) estimation, clustering geometries, discrete fracture network (DFN) estimation, collapsing, and others (Zimmer 2011; Maxwell 2011; Jones and Stewart 1997; Microseismic Inc. 2011). SRV estimation is typically performed through binning and shrink-wrapping methods, where the hydraulic connection is either assumed between the wellbore and a <b>microseismic</b> <b>event</b> if enough events occupy the space between them, or assuming a hydraulic connection within a whole cloud of events based on proximity relationships, respectively. These cloud-based techniques are valuable for qualitative analyses of stimulation effectiveness and reservoir drainage estimations, but lack in actual fracture geometry predictions. In the literature (Microseismic Inc. 2011) DFN predictions have been made from individual <b>microseismic</b> <b>event</b> moment tensor solutions and determined fault plane predictions. The fault planes for individual events are plotted as their own discrete fracture planes and the cloud of microseismic events becomes a cloud of individual fault plane solutions. These fault planes are then often {{assumed to be a}} complex group of separate but interacting fractures. Though obtaining fault plane solutions for individual events is valuable, assuming each event is part of a separate and competing macro-scale fracture is an oversimplification. Individual <b>microseismic</b> <b>event</b> observations {{can be attributed to the}} main hydraulic fracture growth, but also can be stress- or leakoff-induced natural fracture activation, secondary fracturing occurring non-planar to the main hydraulic fracture, among others. The inability to distinguish which type of fracture is observed from microseismic observations makes macro-scale DFN estimation from single fault plane solutions difficult. It is also often assumed that the microseismic events also stem not from the main hydraulic fracture growth, which in many cases is a slow aseismic tensile opening, but rather from, the induced fractures surrounding the tip of the progressing fracture in the shear stress-dominated zone along with slip at pre-existing surfaces or sliding on the newly induced hydraulic fracture behind the fracture tip. This would mean that fracture plane predictions from individual <b>microseismic</b> <b>event</b> fault plane solutions would be oriented at a wide array of angles from the progressing hydraulic fracture. Though DFNs created from single events can be difficult to interpret, macro-scale fracture estimation from groupings of individual microseismic events can provide reasonable estimations of actual fracture geometries, especially in terms of having possible identifications of the slow tensile opening main fractures that oftentimes reside within a large cloud of located events.|$|E

At a hard-rock mine in the Coeur D'Alene mining district of northern Idaho, two data sets consisting of calibration blast signals from a known source site and origin time and <b>microseismic</b> <b>event</b> signals were recorded using a stope-wide accelerometer array. These seismic signals are used to quantify various sources of error in event location. Five factors influencing source location errors are examined in this US. Bureau of Mines study: (1) biases of the numerical source location techniques, (2) receiver array geometries, (3) uncertainties in receiver positions, (4) errors in picking arrival times, and (5) uncertainties in seismic velocity structure, including the effect of mine openings. In addition, synthetic data (accelerometer positions, travel-time picks and wave velocity) are used to determine the effect of known systematic and random errors on source location calculations. It is shown that the commonly accepted association of minimum travel-time residuals with the best location solution does not necessarily hold true when there is a systematic error in seismic velocity.

Monitoring of microseismic events is useful in predicting and comprehending hazards, and in evaluating the overall performance of a mine design. A robust localization algorithm is used to estimate the source position of the <b>microseismic</b> <b>event</b> by selecting the hypothesized source location that maximizes an energy function generated from the sum of the time [...] aligned sensor signals. The accuracy of localization for the algorithm characterized by the variance depends in part upon the configuration of sensors. Two algorithms, MAXSRC and MINMAX, are presented that use the variance of localization error, in a particular direction, as a performance measure for a given sensor configuration. The variance of localization error depends, in part, upon the energy spectral density of the <b>microseismic</b> <b>event.</b> The energy spectral density characterization of sensor signals received in two potash mines are presented and compared using two spectral estimation techniques: multitaper estimation and combined time and lag weighting. It is shown that the difference between the the two estimation techniques is negligible. However, {{the differences between the two}} mine characterizations, though not large, is significant. An example uses the characterized energy spectral densities to determine the variance of error for a single step localization algorithm. The MAXSRC and MINMAX algorithms are explained. The MAXSRC sensor placement algorithm places a sensor as close as possible to the source position with the maximum variance. The MINMAX sensor placement algorithm minimizes the variance of the source position with the maximum variance after the sensor has been placed. The MAXSRC algorithm is simple and can be solved using an exhaustive search while the MINMAX algorithm uses a genetic algorithm to find a solution. These algorithms are then used in three examples, two of which are simple and synthetic. The other example is from Lanigan Potash Mine. The results show that both sensor placement algorithms produce similar results, with the MINMAX algorithm consistently doing better. The MAXSRC algorithm places a single sensor approximately 100 times faster than the MINMAX algorithm. The example shows that the MAXSRC algorithm has the potential to be an efficient and intuitively simple sensor placement algorithm for mine <b>microseismic</b> <b>event</b> monitoring. The MINMAX algorithm provides, at an increase in computational time, a more robust placement criterion which can be solved adequately using a genetic algorithm...|$|E

We applied this method to a microseismic data set monitoring a Middle Bakken completion in the Beaver Lodge area of North Dakota. Geophone arrays in four observation wells improved the ray coverage for the velocity inversion. Using an accurate anisotropic velocity model is important to correctly assess the height growth of the hydraulically induced fractures in the Middle Bakken. Our results showed that (1) moderate-to-strong anisotropy exists in all studied sedimentary layers, especially in the Upper and Lower Bakken shale formations, where the Thomsen parameters (ϵ and γ) can be greater than 0. 4, (2) all the events selected for high signal-to-noise ratio and used for the joint velocity inversion {{are located in the}} Bakken and overlying Lodgepole formations, i. e., no events are detected in the Three Forks formation below the Bakken, and (3) {{more than half of the}} strong events are in two clusters at approximately 100 and 150 m above the Middle Bakken.

For this purpose, microseismic monitoring has been widely used to estimate the spatiotemporal behavior of reservoirs (e.g., Fehler et al. 1987; Baria et al. 1999). Asanuma et al. (2008) determined the locations of <b>microseismic</b> <b>events</b> in a seismic cluster in Basel, Switzerland, with a 20 -m error using the double-difference (DD) method (Waldhauser and Ellsworth 2000) and suggested that the precise locations (errors on the order of 101  m) of pore-pressure migration can be estimated from the evolution of <b>microseismic</b> <b>events.</b> The assumption of diffusion in fluid-saturated rocks (Shapiro et al. 1997) established a relationship between <b>microseismic</b> <b>events</b> and the water front (Shapiro et al. 2002).

Shapiro and Dinske (2009) developed a theory regarding a linear/nonlinear diffusion process. In addition, several studies attempted to clarify pore-pressure migration by including the selective water flow in permeable fractures and faults (hereafter referred to as the water flow model) (e.g., Evans et al. 2005; McClure and Horne 2011; Mukuhira et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|Monitoring seismic {{activity}} in mines, produced by high stress faults {{in the vicinity}} of the mining operations, is an important issue for mine safety. A seismic event produces a short-time duration acoustic pressure wave that travels through the rock. This low-energy {{seismic activity}} in mines is typically referred to as microseismic events. The location of a <b>microseismic</b> <b>event</b> can be estimated using the pressure wave signals recorded at a set of sensors distributed throughout the mine. The classical process for locating a radiating source involves two steps: an estimation of the time difference of arrival be-tween all sensor pairs followed by the localization, requiring the solution of a set of non-linear equations. This traditional local-ization process has limited success when applied to microseismic events, since they have a short-time duration, and thus gener-ating accurate arrival time estimates is a challenging task in a noisy environment. An alternate approach to traditional localization, that avoids time-delay estimation, is to search over a grid of hypothesized source locations to find the one that best explains the observed measurements. Here, this approach is used with a performance function that is the greatest energy calculated from the sum of the sensor signals, each of which is time-shifted by an amount con-sistent with the hypothesized location of the event. The result is a very robust algorithm that works well with short-time duration signals and given the recent advances in low-cost computational power can be implemented in real time. The paper describes the location algorithm.
