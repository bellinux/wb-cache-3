5000|$|<b>Melorheostosis</b> is a mesenchymal {{dysplasia}} manifesting as {{regions of}} dripping wax appearance or flowing candle wax appearance. It {{is thought to}} be caused by a mutation of the LEMD3 gene. The disorder can be detected by radiograph due to thickening of bony cortex resembling [...] "dripping candle wax". It is included on the spectrum of developmental bone dysplasias including pycnodysostosis and osteopoikilosis. The disorder tends to be unilateral and monostotic (i.e. affecting a single bone), with only one limb typically involved. Cases with involvement of multiple limbs, ribs, and bones in the spine have also been reported. There are no reported cases of involvement of skull or facial bones. <b>Melorheostosis</b> can be associated with pain, physical deformity, skin and circulation problems, contractures, and functional limitation. It is also associated with a benign inner ear dysplasia known as osteosclerosis.|$|E
40|$|To further {{explore the}} allelic {{heterogeneity}} {{within the group}} of LEMD 3 -related disorders, we have screened a larger series of patients including 5 probands with osteopoikilosis or Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome (BOS), 2 families with the co-occurrence of <b>melorheostosis</b> and BOS, and 12 unrelated patients with isolated <b>melorheostosis.</b> Seven novel LEMD 3 mutations were identified, all predicted to result in loss-of-function of the protein. We confirm that loss-of-function mutations in the LEMD 3 gene can result in either osteopoikilosis or BOS. However, LEMD 3 germline mutations were only found in two <b>melorheostosis</b> patients belonging to a different BOS family and one sporadic patient with <b>melorheostosis.</b> The additional presence of osteopoikilosis lesions in these patients seemed to distinguish them from the group of sporadic <b>melorheostosis</b> patients where no germline LEMD 3 mutation was identified.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} loss of function mutations in the LEMD 3 gene, encoding an inner nuclear membrane protein that influences Smad signaling, {{as a cause of}} osteopoikilosis, Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome, and <b>melorheostosis.</b> We investigated LEMD 3 in a three-generation family with osteopoikilosis from the Azores, an affected father and daughter from Ireland with osteopoikilosis (the daughter also had <b>melorheostosis),</b> and two other individuals from the UK with isolated <b>melorheostosis.</b> We found a novel C to T substitution at position 2032 bp (cDNA) in exon 8 of LEMD 3, resulting in a premature stop codon at amino acid position 678. This mutation co-segregates with the osteopoikilosis phenotype in both the Azorean family and the Irish family. It was not detected in any of the six unaffected family members or in 342 healthy Caucasian individuals. No LEMD 3 mutations were detected in the two patients with sporadic <b>melorheostosis.</b> The LEMD 3 mutation reported was clearly the cause of osteopoikilosis in the two families but its relationship to <b>melorheostosis</b> in one of the family members is still unclear. Perhaps unsurprisingly in what is a segmental disease, we did not find LEMD 3 mutations in peripheral-blood-derived DNA from the two other individuals with sporadic <b>melorheostosis.</b> The nature of the additional genetic and/or environmental influences required for the development of <b>melorheostosis</b> in those with osteopoikilosis requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the LEMD 3 gene were {{recently}} incriminated in Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome (BOS) and osteopoikilosis, {{with or without}} <b>melorheostosis.</b> The relationship of this gene with isolated sporadic <b>melorheostosis</b> is less clear. We investigated LEMD 3 in a two-generation BOS family showing an extremely variable expression of the disease, in a sporadic patient with skin features of BOS, and in an additional subject with isolated <b>melorheostosis.</b> We identified two different mutations, both resulting in a premature stop codon, in the two cases of BOS. The mutation (c. 2564 G>A) reported in the familial case is novel, while that observed in the sporadic case (c. 1963 C>T) has been previously reported in an American woman with osteopoikilosis and <b>melorheostosis</b> who had {{a family history of}} isolated osteopoikilosis.

40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Melorheostosis,</b> an {{uncommon}} mesenchymal dysplasia, rarely affects the axial skeleton. We describe the imaging findings of <b>melorheostosis</b> involving the cervical and upper thoracic spine. Radiographs and CT showed unilateral well-marginated undulating zones of cortical hyperostosis involving multiple vertebrae that were contiguous with a coalescent ossified right paravertebral mass. MR imaging showed zones of signal intensity void on all pulse sequences without contrast enhance-ment. Conservative management was elected {{because of lack}} of interval clinical and imaging changes for 8 years. <b>Melorheostosis</b> (Leri disease) is a rare nonhereditary scle-rosing mesenchymal dysplasia of bone originally de-scribedmore than 80 years ago. 1 This dysplasia occurs in early childhood 2 and in 40 %– 50 % of cases is evident by 20 years of age. 2 - 5 The bony lesions commonly present as wavy longitudi-nal bars of hyperostosis resembling molten wax flowing down one side of a candle 6; hence, the common reference to this abnormality as having a “flowing candle wax ” appearance. 7 - 10 One or multiple adjacent bones are often affected, often in a sclerotomal distribution. 7, 11 - 13 <b>Melorheostosis</b> commonly in-volves limb bones andmay extend across synovial joints. 14 - 16 Le-sions may be associated with ossification in adjacent soft tis-sues. 14 - 16 <b>Melorheostosis</b> limited to the spine is rare. 2, 17 <b>Melorheostosis</b> affecting thoracic vertebrae with involvement of facet joints associated with back pain has been described recent-ly. 14 The current report describes the radiographic, CT, andMR imaging features ofmelorheostosis involvingmultiple lower cer-vical and T 1 vertebrae.
