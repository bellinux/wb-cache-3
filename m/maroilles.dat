25|$|This {{system is}} similar to {{appellation}} systems used throughout the world, such as the appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) used in France, the denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) used in Italy, the denominação de origem controlada (DOC) used in Portugal, the denominación de origen (DO) system used in Spain and the Denumire de origine controlată (DOC) system used in Romania. In many cases, the EU PDO/PGI system works parallel with the system used in the specified country, {{and in some cases}} is subordinated to the appellation system that was already instituted, particularly with wine, for example, and in France (in particular) with cheese, for example <b>Maroilles</b> (as most others) has both PDO (Appellation d'origine protégée (AOP) in French) and AOC classifications, but generally only the AOC classification will be shown.|$|E
25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (<b>Maroilles,</b> Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|E
