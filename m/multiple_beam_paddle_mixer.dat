40|$|A {{continuously}} mixed, aseptic <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> {{was used}} successfully for solid-state fermentation (SSF) with Aspergillus oryzae on whole wheat kernels. Continuous mixing improved temperature control and prevented inhomogeneities in the bed. Respiration rates {{found in this}} system were comparable to those in small, isothermal, unmixed beds, which showed that continuous mixing did not cause serious damage to the fungus or the wheat kernels. Continuous mixing improves heat transport to the bioreactor wall, which reduces the need for evaporative cooling and thus may help to prevent the desiccation problems that hamper large-scale SSF. However, scale-up calculations for the <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> indicated that wall cooling becomes insufficient at the 2 -m 3 scale for a rapidly growing fungus like Aspergillus oryzae. Consequently, evaporative cooling will remain important in large-scale mixed systems. Experiments showed that water addition will be necessary when evaporative cooling is applied {{in order to maintain}} a sufficiently high water activity of the solid substrate. Mixing is necessary to ensure homogeneous water addition in SSF. Automated process control might be achieved using the enthalpy balance. The enthalpy balance for the case of evaporative cooling in the <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> was validated. This work shows that continuous mixing provides promising possibilities for simultaneous control of temperature and moisture content in solid-state fermentation on a large scale...|$|R

40|$|Characterisation of {{particle}} flow using Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) {{is based on}} tracking {{the position of a}} single particle in a dynamic system. Recent developments in PEPT have facilitated tracking multiple particles aiming at improvements in data representation. Nevertheless for systems with a wide residence time distribution and/or dead zone, the conditions for getting representative data which could reflect the bulk behaviour of the powders need to be analysed and specified. In the present work, an attempt is made to simulate PEPT experiments for a <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> using Discrete Element Method (DEM), with a view to investigate the effect of increasing the number of tracers on their time-averaged velocity distribution and whether it can represent the data on whole population {{of particle}}s. The time averaged velocity distribution of the individual tracer particles (resembling simulated PEPT) is obtained and compared with the time averaged data on entire particle population. The DEM results indicate that for the investigated <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer,</b> it takes 251. s for one tracer to travel adequately in all the active space of the system. The instantaneous tracer velocity fluctuates around the average value obtained for all the particles, suggesting that the average tracer velocity is adequately representative of the average particle velocity in the system. The data of the PEPT experiment with one tracer with those of DEM with one tracer are in good agreement; however, DEM simulation suggests that increasing the number of tracers in the <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> system does not influence the average velocity distribution. Furthermore, the velocity for all particles in the DEM shows a smooth distribution with a peak frequency of the velocity distribution that is lower than PEPT and DEM tracer. When tracking a single tracer in DEM or PEPT, it may not be detected to have zero velocity at any instant of time, whilst the data for all particles show that about 0. 3 % of particles are stagnant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} a {{detailed discussion of}} various issues involved in designing a medium access control (MAC) protocol for multihop wireless networks with nodes employing <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> smart antennas. <b>Multiple</b> <b>beam</b> smart antennas can form several beams simultaneously and can initiate concurrent transmissions or receptions in them, thereby increasing the throughput of the bottleneck nodes. Traditional on-demand MAC protocols for omnidirectional and single beam directional antennas based on the IEEE 802. 11 distributed coordination function (DCF) mechanism cannot {{take advantage of this}} unique capability of <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> antennas as they do not facilitate concurrent transmissions or receptions by a node. This paper introduces a novel protocol, hybrid MAC (HMAC), which enables concurrent packet reception (CPR) and concurrent packet transmission (CPT) at a node equipped with <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> antennas and is backward compatible with IEEE 802. 11 DCF. Simulation results show the superior performance of HMAC in most ad hoc scenarios. Moreover, in some sample topologies, the throughput of HMAC is close to the theoretical maximum.

For the mathematical description of the mixing process of animal feed ingredients in the presence of chemical reaction the system of differential equations of Academician V. V. Kafarov was used. Proposed by him hypothesis based on the theory of Markov’s processes stating that "any multicomponent mixture can be considered as the result of an iterative process of mixing the two components to achieve the desired uniformity of all the ingredients in the mixture" allows us to consider a process of mixing binary composition in a <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> in the form of differential equations of two ingredients concentration numerous changes until it becomes a homogenous mixture. It was found out that the mixing process of the two-component mixture is determined in a <b>paddle</b> <b>mixer</b> with a constant mixing speed and a limit (equilibrium) dispersion of the ingredients in the mixture i. e. with its uniformity. Adjustment of the model parameters was carried out according to the results of experimental studies on mixing the crushed wheat with metallomagnetic impurity, which was a key (indicator) component.

Over half of power is lost if only one beam is {{selected}} for one path in the finite resolution Rotman lens array.
