40|$|Results and Discussion {{chapters}} {{are considered}} difficult {{to write in}} a thesis, especially for non-native English writers. However, {{few studies have been}} conducted on how writers compose these two genres. This study, therefore, explores the <b>move-step</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> these two chapters in 24 Master’s theses written by Vietnamese postgraduates. Based on the framework by Chen and Kuo (2012) and the discourse-based interviews with actual thesis writers and supervisors, the study found that this group of writers constructed the genres according to their perceived communicative purposes of these chapters. Moreover, the presence of section/chapter introduction-next section/chapter introduction-section/chapter summary cycles tends to reflect the distinctive composition of these texts at the TESOL discourse community in Vietnam. These findings suggest that explicit instructions on rhetorical <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> these two genres should be provided to non-native English writers and attention should also be paid to specific practice of a genre composition in a particular discourse community...|$|R

Genre analysis of 99 introductory chapters was conducted using a revised “Create a Research Space” (CARS) model (Swales, 1990, 2004). Semi-structured interviews were also carried out with seven Japanese supervisors and ten British supervisors. The findings showed that the introductory chapters of literature Ph. D. theses had 13 move-specific steps and five move-independent steps, each of which presented different cyclical patterns, indicating cross-cultural {{similarities and differences between}} the two language groups. The perceptions of supervisors varied in terms of the importance and the sequence of individual steps in the introductory chapters. Based on the textual and interview analyses, a discipline-oriented Open-CARS model is proposed for pedagogical purposes of teaching and writing about this genre in Japanese or English in the field of literature and related fields...|$|R

Studies of ras/effector interactions have focused on three classes, Raf kinases, ral guanylnucleotide-exchange factors, and phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinases.

We solved <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> PLCepsilon <b>RA</b> domains (RA 1 and RA 2) by NMR and the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>RA</b> 2 /ras complex by X-ray crystallography.

40|$|Ras and its {{effector}} Raf are key mediators of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK {{signal transduction}} pathway. Mutants of residue Q 61 impair the GTPase activity <b>of</b> <b>Ras</b> and are found prominently in human cancers. Yet the mechanism through which Q 61 contributes to catalysis has been elusive. It {{is thought to}} position the catalytic water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of GTP. However, we previously solved the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ras</b> from crystals with symmetry of the space group R 32 in which switch II is disordered {{and found that the}} catalytic water molecule is present. Here we present a <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> wild-type <b>Ras</b> with calcium acetate from the crystallization mother liquor bound at a site remote from the active site and likely near the membrane. This results in a shift in helix 3 /loop 7 and a network of H-bonding interactions that propagates across the molecule, culminating in the ordering of switch II and placement of Q 61 in the active site in a previously unobserved conformation. This structure suggests a direct catalytic role for Q 61 where it interacts with a water molecule that bridges one of the γ-phosphate oxygen atoms to the hydroxyl group of Y 32 to stabilize the transition state of the hydrolysis reaction. We propose that Raf together with the binding of Ca 2 + and a negatively charged group mimicked in our structure by the acetate molecule induces the ordering of switch I and switch II to complete the active site <b>of</b> <b>Ras...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ras is a guanine nucleotide-binding {{protein that}} cycles between {{inactive}} GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states to regulate a {{diverse array of}} cellular processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. The guanine nucleotide-bound state <b>of</b> <b>Ras</b> is tightly maintained by regulatory factors to promote regulated growth control. A class of regulatory molecules that lead to Ras activation are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Ras GEFs bind to Ras and facilitate GDP release, followed by GTP incorporation and Ras activation. Nitric oxide (NO) {{has also been shown}} to promote guanine nucleotide exchange (GNE) on Ras and increase cellular Ras-GTP levels, but the process by which NO-mediated GNE occurs is not clear. We initiated NMR structural and biochemical studies to elucidate how nitrosylation <b>of</b> <b>Ras</b> might lead to enhanced GNE. Surprisingly, our studies show that stable S-nitrosylation <b>of</b> <b>Ras</b> at Cys- 118, does not affect the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ras,</b> its association with the Ras-binding domain of Raf (a downstream effector <b>of</b> <b>Ras),</b> or GNE rates relative to non-nitrosylated Ras.

40|$|A class <b>of</b> {{putative}} <b>Ras</b> effectors called Ras association domain family (RASSF) represents non-enzymatic adaptors {{that were}} shown {{to be important in}} tumour suppression. RASSF 5, a member of this family, exists in two splice variants known as NORE 1 A and RAPL. Both of them are involved in distinct cellular pathways triggered by Ras and Rap, respectively. Here we describe the crystal <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ras</b> in complex with the Ras binding domain (RBD) of NORE 1 A/RAPL. All Ras effectors share a common topology in their RBD creating an interface with the switch I region <b>of</b> <b>Ras,</b> whereas NORE 1 A/RAPL RBD reveals additional structural elements forming a unique Ras switch II binding site. Consequently, the contact area of NORE 1 A is extended as compared with other Ras effectors. We demonstrate that the enlarged interface provides a rationale for an exceptionally long lifetime of the complex. This is a specific attribute characterizing the effector function of NORE 1 A/RAPL as adaptors, in contrast to classical enzymatic effectors such as Raf, RalGDS or PI 3 K, which are known to form highly dynamic short-lived complexes with Ras...|$|R

Findings indicated that the PA 6 molecular chains were anchored on the surface of nano-SiO 2 through chemical bonding between the surface amino groups of nano-SiO 2 and &# 949;-caprolactam monomer or prepolymer of PA 6. As a result, a flexible interfacial layer was formed, thereby improving the compatibility of nano-SiO 2 with PA 6 matrix. Moreover, the enhancement effect of nano-SiO 2 led to the improved mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>RA.</b> Besides, due to the hindering effect of nano-SiO 2 particles to the movement of PA 6 molecular chains, the size of the PA 6 spherocrystal was smaller, and its crystalline form was also affected.

The integrity of the mosaic plasmid genome seems to be specified by its regulatory network. In this paper the transcriptional regulator KorC was analyzed. KorCRA 3 (98 amino acids) is encoded in the stabilization region and represses four strong promoters by binding to a conserved palindrome sequence, designated OC {{on the basis of}} homology to the KorC operator sequences in IncP- 1 plasmids. Two of the KorCRA 3 -regulated promoters precede the first two cistrons in the stabilization module, one fires towards replication module, remaining one controls a tricistronic operon, whose products are involved in the conjugative transfer process.

Variant amino acids from R-ras p 23 regions 1 - 30, 52 - 57, 67 - 78, 1 - 30 and 67 - 78 together, and 112 - 124 were substituted for the corresponding Ha-ras p 21 amino acid regions 1 - 4, 26 - 31, 41 - 52, 1 - 4 and 41 - 52 together, and 86 - 98, respectively. Rat fibroblasts transfected with genes encoding these position- 12 valine-substituted chimeric Ha-ras proteins displayed the same properties of morphological transformation and anchorage-independent growth as Ha-ras T 24 oncogene-transformed fibroblasts. However, substitution of variant amino acids from the 80 C-terminal residues (amino acids 138 - 218) of R-ras p 23 for the corresponding p 21 amino acids (residues 112 - 189) inactivated the transforming activity of position- 12 valine-substituted p 21.

40|$|The Ras-related GTPases are small, 20 - to 25 -kDa {{proteins}} which cycle {{between an}} inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound state. The Ras superfamily includes the Ras, Rho, Ran, Arf, and Rab/YPT 1 families, {{each of which}} controls distinct cellular functions. The crystal <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ras,</b> Rac, Arf, and Ran reveal a nearly superimposible structure surrounding the GTP-binding pocket, and it is generally presumed that the Rab/YPT 1 family shares this core structure. The Ras, Rac, Ran, Arf, and Rab/YPT 1 families are activated by interaction with family-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The structural determinants of GTPases required for interaction with family-specific GEFs have begun to emerge. We sought to determine the sites on YPT 1 which interact with GEFs. We found that mutations of YPT 1 at position 42, 43, or 49 (effector loop; switch I), position 69, 71, 73, or 75 (switch II), and position 107, 109, or 115 (alpha-helix 3 –loop 7 [α 3 -L 7]) are intragenic suppressors of dominant interfering YPT 1 mutant N 22 (YPT 1 -N 22), suggesting these mutations prevent YPT 1 -N 22 from binding to and sequestering an endogenous GEF. Mutations at these positions prevent interaction with the DSS 4 GEF in vitro. Mutations in the switch II and α 3 -L 7 regions do not prevent downstream signaling in yeast when combined with a GTPase-defective (activating) mutation.

This study explores the relation <b>of</b> texts generic <b>structure</b> and the context. A corpora of 30 research articles were selected. For the purpose of conducting a comparative study, 15 introductions from locally published journal ‘The English Teacher’ and 15 from internationally published ‘ELT’ Journal' were taken. This study developed a framework for the generic structure analysis based on Swales CARS and OARO model. It was found that the international research articles complied with the CARS model whereas the Malaysian research article introductions adhered to the OARO model. It must be mentioned that two of the Malaysian introductions opaquely complied with the CARS model. This may be due to the exposure that the authors may have had in writing introductions the conventional way. Overall, the findings tend to confirm Swales’s claim that the research in the nonnative speakers’ world tend to be less antagonistic and thus geared more towards establishing readership rather than establishing the research. One prominent feature o f both ELT related introductions is that they are prone to discussing theories, personal experience and personal thoughts.

Figure 1 : Chemical <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> rosmarinic acid <b>RA</b> has a range of biological activities, making it an interesting material for the pharmaceuti-cal, food, and cosmetics industries.

40|$|Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease affecting synovial joints. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α {{is a key}} component <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> pathogenesis and blocking this cytokine {{is the most common}} strategy to treat the disease. Though TNFα blockers are very efficient, one third <b>of</b> the <b>RA</b> patients are unresponsive or present side effects. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic approaches is required. RA pathogenesis is characterized by the hyperplasia of the synovium, closely associated to the pseudo-tumoral expansion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), which invade and destroy the joint <b>structure.</b> Hence, depletion <b>of</b> <b>RA</b> FLS has been proposed as an alternative therapeutic strategy. The TNF family member Fas ligand (FasL) was reported to trigger apoptosis in FLS of arthritic joints by binding to its receptor Fas and therefore suggested as a promising candidate for targeting the hyperplastic synovial tissue. However, this cytokine is pleiotropic and recent data from the literature indicate that Fas activation might have a disease-promoting role in RA by promoting cell proliferation. Therefore, a FasL-based therapy for RA requires careful evaluation before being applied. In this review we aim to overview what is known about the apoptotic and non-apoptotic effects of Fas/FasL system and discuss its relevance in R...|$|R

Background [...] 3. Frequency reconfigurable antennas [...] 4. A polarization reconfigurable antenna [...] 5. A pattern reconfigurable antenna [...] 6. A reconfigurable antenna with frequency and polarization agility [...] 7. Applications of reconfigurable antennas in MIMO systems [...] 8. Conclusions and future work. Reconfigurable antennas (RAs) are at the frontier of current antenna research and are excellent antenna candidates for advanced wireless communication applications. The basic <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> a <b>RA</b> {{is similar to that}} of a conventional one; however, by using electrical, mechanical or other means to change the fundamental operating mechanism of an individual radiator, the frequency and radiation characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>RA</b> can be varied significantly. This makes a single RA equal to multiple antennas with fixed functionalities. Thanks to the agility and diversity <b>of</b> <b>RAs,</b> they find wide application in Software Defined Radios, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, diversity communication systems, satellite communications, and military communication systems. One of the greatest design challenges for antenna reconfigurability is changing one characteristic of an antenna, such as the frequency response, without affecting others (polarization or radiation pattern), since the frequency response and the radiation characteristics of an antenna are always highly related. Furthermore, for RAs using electronic components to achieve reconfigurability, the design of an effective dc bias network that has a limited influence on the antenna performance is another important design issue for antenna engineers. In this dissertation, motivated by the increasing significance <b>of</b> <b>RAs</b> as well as the demand for new design methods for compact RAs with simple dc bias networks, a thorough investigation is presented on <b>RAs</b> in terms <b>of</b> frequency, polarization, pattern, as well as compound frequency and polarization RAs. A few novel RAs with dc bias networks are designed, fabricated and measured. And they have demonstrated many advantages over other corresponding reported designs. In addition, a literature review reveals that, although a considerable number <b>of</b> papers on <b>RAs</b> have been published, much fewer are reported on the study of the applications <b>of</b> <b>RAs</b> in wireless communication systems. In order to examine the practical application <b>of</b> <b>RAs,</b> the proposed polarization and pattern RAs are incorporated separately in 2 x 2 MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Real-time channel measurements are conducted in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. Compared to the systems with non-reconfigurable antennas, a significant enhancement of the system capacity is accomplished.

40|$|The {{export of}} mRNAs is a multistep process, {{involving}} the packaging of mRNAs into messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), their transport through nuclear pore complexes, and mRNP remodeling events prior to translation. Ribonucleic acid export 1 (Rae 1) and Nup 98 are evolutionarily conserved mRNA export {{factors that are}} targeted by the vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein to inhibit host cell nuclear export. Here, we present the crystal <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> human <b>Rae</b> 1 in complex with the Gle 2 -binding sequence (GLEBS) of Nup 98 at 1. 65  Å resolution. Rae 1 forms a seven-bladed β-propeller with several extensive surface loops. The Nup 98 GLEBS motif forms an ≈ 50 -Å-long hairpin that binds with its C-terminal arm to an essentially invariant hydrophobic surface that extends over the entire top face <b>of</b> the <b>Rae</b> 1 β-propeller. The C-terminal arm of the GLEBS hairpin is necessary and sufficient for Rae 1 binding, and we identify a tandem glutamate element in this arm as critical for complex formation. The Rae 1 •Nup 98 GLEBS surface features an additional conserved patch with a positive electrostatic potential, and we demonstrate that the complex possesses single-stranded RNA-binding capability. Together, {{these data suggest that}} the Rae 1 •Nup 98 complex directly binds to the mRNP at several stages of the mRNA export pathway...|$|R
