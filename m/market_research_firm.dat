40|$|Orientation: Actionable {{reporting}} {{ensures that}} a <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firm</b> communicates with clients to achieve business impact {{as opposed to}} merely communicating data to clients. Storytelling communicates with impact as it focuses on creating engagement and inspiring action. Research purpose: This article investigates the use of storytelling {{as a tool for}} actionable reporting by South African <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> Motivation for the study: Clients of <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> often criticise <b>research</b> reports as being too technical and lacking in strategic value. Storytelling is a reporting technique {{that can be used to}} develop actionable research and provide clients with more strategic value. Research design, approach and method: A total of 26 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with client service directors and managers of <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> that deliver quantitative research reports to clients. Main findings: Results indicated that all <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> but one use storytelling. Barriers that impede more regular use are inexperienced research executives and the time intensity associated with creating stories. Practical/managerial implications: Storytelling should be used by <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> to provide clients with more actionable research. Contribution/value-add: The study provides <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> in South Africa with recommendations as to how to implement storytelling as a reporting technique, which will add value to clients and enable <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> to remain competitive and develop relationships with clients.   </span...|$|R
40|$|M. Com. (Marketing Management) The <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> {{industry}} is a highly competitive environment with over one hundred <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> competing for business in the South African market. Literature suggests {{that one of the}} biggest challenges the industry faces is poor positioning. <b>Marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> are seen as data suppliers rather than business or strategic thought partners. This is mainly the result of <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> traditionally providing masses of data with no or limited insights, practical use and strategic value (also known as actionability of research results). This state of affairs in the industry needs to be addressed, otherwise <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> will become less profitable and effective data / research information suppliers. To warrant future business and increased revenues, <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> need to position themselves as professionals who can deliver actionable research results that assist clients strategically. Literature suggests various methods in which <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> can achieve this; amongst which data visualisation and storytelling are identified as two such methods to deliver actionable research results which impact clients’ business. Therefore, the primary research objective of this study was to uncover the strategic use of data visualisation and storytelling by <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> in quantitative <b>research</b> reports. To address this objective, this study was conducted in two phases, first literature on the topic was presented, followed by an empirical study. The empirical study independently followed an exploratory and descriptive research design where two samples were used. The main study (qualitative phase) sampled individuals, working for South African <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms,</b> who oversee teams who create quantitative research reports by means of indepth interviews; and the small-scale complementary study (quantitative phase) sampled clients of <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> who receive these quantitative reports by means of an computer-administered, Internet-based survey. The studies were conducted sequentially; the small-scale complementary study followed after the main study had been completed. The Morse and Field approach was used to analyse the empirical research results of the main study which indicated that <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> do not claim to have a traditional approach to quantitative reporting; the focus is not on data supply, but rather on providing actionable research results to clients which adds value to their business decision-making. The results also indicate that <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> use storytelling to deliver actionable research so as to increase the strategic value thereof, while data visualisation is not used strategically. The results of the small-scale complementary study indicated that although 62 % of clients feel that current quantitative research reports (received from <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms)</b> can be used to make strategic decisions, clients also feel that quantitative research reports need improvement regarding the delivery of strategic and actionable research reports. The exploration of the current quantitative reporting landscape and the evaluation of whether South African <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> strategically use data visualisation and storytelling, have helped in identifying barriers to adoption of these methods and recommended how these could be overcome; it also identified specific measures to bridge the gap between data supply and strategic (actionable) research. The study found that <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> <b>firms</b> should continue and strengthen their focus on actionable research as client demand therefor will continue; this can be achieved through a number of ways such as by focusing on understanding the client’s business, demonstrating thought leadership, being future focused, strengthening storytelling capabilities and developing / possibly investing in data visualisation capabilities...|$|R
