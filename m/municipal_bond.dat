40|$|This Note {{addresses}} {{the constitutionality of}} the selective taxation of conduit bonds, a subset of <b>municipal</b> <b>bonds</b> that finance private enterprise, {{in the aftermath of the}} U.

In Davis, the Court determined that states could tax interest earned on out-of-state <b>municipal</b> <b>bonds</b> while exempting interest earned on its own bonds without violating the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. When issuing this ruling, the Court drew a distinction between <b>municipal</b> <b>bonds</b> issued on behalf of the government and <b>municipal</b> <b>bonds</b> issued on behalf of private industry. The question of whether or not selective taxation was constitutional as applied to <b>municipal</b> <b>bonds</b> issued on behalf of private industry was explicitly left for another day. This Note begins with a discussion of <b>municipal</b> <b>bonds</b> and the dormant Commerce Clause. Next, this Note reviews the arguments for and against subjecting conduit bonds to the selective tax system. Finally, this Note recommends the adoption of a sui generis assessment to identify bonds whose central purpose is economic protectionism so that they may be excluded from the selective tax system...|$|R

In July 2013, the three employees were convicted of conspiracy in the muni market fraud: former UBS Vice President Gary Heinz was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined US$400,000; former UBS global commodities chief Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months and fined US $1 million; and former UBS VP Michael Welty received a 16-month sentence and fined US$300,000. In addition to conspiracy, Ghavami and Heinz also were convicted of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors had asked for much harsher sentences, but U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rebuffed the request. Wood said that the criminal behavior of the three was an aberration from their normal law-abiding lives.|$|E

The higher cost for the dam was attributed to a project that was approved for additional purposes, including hydroelectric power generation and recreation. Additional costs for the dam were covered by the state government and by GRDA <b>municipal</b> <b>bond</b> auctions which appropriated or raised $11 million. Disney had pushed much of the legislation for the dam, comparing the higher electric utility rates in Oklahoma compared to other states. Senator Thomas helped appropriate additional state and public funding for the dam while also being instrumental in its legislation.|$|E

25|$|The {{federal income}} tax system {{provides}} tax advantages {{to state and local}} municipal bonds. Specifically, the interest paid on such securities is exempt from federal taxation. This tax discount allows state and local governments to issue debt at low yields, which reduces their interest costs. By eliminating income taxes, FairTax would remove the federal tax advantage of holding state and local bonds as all investments would become tax free. However, the Treasury department has called for the elimination of these special tax provisions under the current system in an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce corporate tax rates. State and local governments often exempt their own taxes when issuing bonds, so they could still contain some advantages. Issuers may have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors. Americans For Fair Taxation argue that, after the fair tax goes into effect, corporate bond rates would drop; that new tax free yields will roughly equal their previous after tax value under the income tax; and that state and <b>municipal</b> <b>bond</b> holders would not need to change their rates.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{basis for}} municipal finance is local property tax levied {{on real estate}} within the city. Local government can also collect revenue for services, or by leasing land that it owns. However, financing municipal services, as well as urban renewal and other development projects, is a perennial problem, which cities address through appeals to higher governments, arrangements with the private sector, and techniques such as privatization (selling services to into the private sector), corporatization (formation of quasi-private municipally-owned corporations), and financialization (packaging city assets into tradable financial instruments and derivatives). This situation has become acute in deindustrialized cities and in cases where businesses and wealthier citizens have moved outside of city limits and therefore {{beyond the reach of}} taxation. Cities in search of ready cash increasingly resort to the <b>municipal</b> <b>bond,</b> essentially a loan with interest and a repayment date. City governments have also begun to use tax increment financing, in which a development project is financed by loans based on future tax revenues which it is expected to yield. Under these circumstances, creditors and consequently city governments place a high importance on city credit ratings.|$|E
