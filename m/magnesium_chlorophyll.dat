40|$|Production of many cut flowers, such as lilium, is {{very common}} in Iran. Flower quality has special {{importance}} in lilium flower production process, and proper nutrition {{is one of the}} major effective factors. This research was conducted to investigate the effect of different concentrations of potassium silicate, nano-silicon and calcium chloride on concentration of potassium, calcium and <b>magnesium,</b> <b>chlorophyll</b> index and number of florets of Asiatic lily 'Brunello'. The experiment was carried out based on randomized complete blocks design with 9 treatments and 3 replications (each replication included 5 pots), in Educational/Research Greenhouses of Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran. Treatments included drench of potassium silicate at three concentrations (25, 50 and 75 mg/L), spraying of 25 mg/L potassium silicate, spraying of calcium chloride at two concentrations (25 and 50 mg/L), spraying of nano-silicon at two concentrations (12. 5 and 25 mg/L) and control (no treatment). Number of florets, chlorophyll index and concentrations of calcium, magnesium and potassium in stem and leaves were measured. Results showed significant differences between treatments in stem and leaf calcium and magnesium, leaf potassium, chlorophyll index at harvest time and number of florets. Drench of 25 mg/L potassium silicate had maximum number of florets per plant (5. 27) and stem magnesium. Spraying 50 mg/L calcium chloride showed maximum leaf calcium, magnesium and potassium, respectively, with 4. 38, 15. 75 and 16. 43 percent increase as compared to control. Spraying of 25 mg/L calcium chloride, with 38. 9 percent increase as compared to control, had maximum stem calcium. Maximum chlorophyll index at harvesting time was related to spraying 25 mg/L potassium silicate. In general, if the goal is production of more florets, then drench of 25 mg/L potassium silicate is an appropriate treatment...|$|E

This study aimed to study {{the effect of the}} thickness of fresh volcanic ash of Kelud Mountain and dosage of manure on availability and uptake of <b>Magnesium</b> and <b>chlorophyll</b> content of corn in Alfisol. This is greenhouse experiment arranged in factorial completely randomized design with two treatment. The first factor is the thickness of volcanic ash: 0, 2. 4, and 6 cm, and the second factor is the dosage of manure: 0, 2 and 4 tonha- 1, each treatment combination was repeated 3 times. Variables observed include exchangable-Mg, Mg uptake, and chlorophyll content of corn. The results showed that there is no interaction effect of volcanic ash and manure on exchangable-Mg, Mg uptake and chlorophyll content of corn. This proved that they affect nutrient availability in different ways. Both volcanic ash of Kelud eruptionas as well as manure increase exchangable-Mg, especially at 6 cm thickness of volcanic ash treatment, Mg-uptake and chlorophyll content of corn leaf independently.

40|$|Following {{experiments}} which {{studied the}} substitution of the central ion of isolated chlorophylls by heavy metal ions in vitro, in vivo experiments with submersed water plants were carried out. It was discovered that {{the substitution of}} the central atom of <b>chlorophyll,</b> <b>magnesium,</b> by heavy metals (mercury, copper, cadmium, nickel, zinc, lead) in vivo is an important damage mechanism in stressed plants. This substitution prevents photosynthetic light-harvesting in the affected chlorophyll molecules, resulting in a breakdown of photosynthesis. The reaction varies with light intensity. In low light irradiance all the central atoms of the chlorophylls are accessible to heavy metals, with heavy metal chlorophylls being formed, {{some of which are}} much more stable towards irradiance than Mg-chlorophyll. Consequently, plants remain green even when they are dead. In high light, however, almost all chlorophyll decays, showing that under such conditions most of the chlorophylls are inaccessible to heavy metal ions.

40|$|Abstract: As a {{consequence}} of global warming many technologies are being developed in order to remove carbon dioxide from air. Biological carbon fixation through microalgae cultivation {{seems to be the}} most interesting one, since they allow the use of residual waters as media for growth, and industrial gases as carbon sources. Growth kinetics, metabolic behavior, nutrient requirement, biomass composition and carbon fixation capacity are essential data for industrial processes development. Such data were evaluated in four microalga of industrial interest cultivated in artificial medium with CO 2 as carbon source: Spirulina platensis, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Chlorella vulgaris and Botryococcus braunii. A respirometric balance based on gases analysis was used to evaluate carbon dioxide fixation rate and ion chromatography was employed to determine rate of consumption of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and ma nesium for each microalga. The destination of carbon fixed was evaluated in terms of biomass and exopolyssaccharides production and as dissolved carbon, while nitrogen consumption was evaluated for protein and <b>magnesium</b> for <b>chlorophyll</b> production. B. braunii presented the highest CO 2 fixation rate, followed by, S. platensis, D. tertiolecta and C. vulgaris (496. 98, 318. 16, 272. 40, and 251. 64 mg L- 1 day- 1, respectively).

40|$|The {{surprisingly}} small {{effect of}} oxygen on photoelectron transfer in pigmented lipid bilayers is {{traced to a}} short lifetime of the excited states. Decreasing the oxygen concentration by greater than 100 -fold decreases the half saturating concentration of acceptor by only threefold and {{has no effect on}} the maximum photovoltage observed at acceptor saturation. This holds true for both <b>magnesium</b> octaethylporphyrin and <b>chlorophyll</b> with both ferricyanide and methyl viologen as acceptors. Since oxygen quenches excited states at near the encounter limit, the lifetime of reactive state must be short, less than 100 ns. About 100 -fold higher concentrations of acceptor are required to quench the fluorescence (in liposomes) than to saturate the photoeffect. Thus the reactive state is most likely the triplet. The short life of the excited state is caused by concentration quenching, i. e., their reaction with ground state molecules. The increase of photovoltage with increasing pigment concentration shows that this quenching in a condensed form of the pigment produces ions that lead to the observed photovoltage by interfacial reaction of the anion with acceptor...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the review was to analyze the basic {{biochemical}} processes leading to the chlorophyll degradation and ways to control this process in plant product storage. First of all, this is a complex of enzymatic reactions starting with the hydrolysis of chlorophyll {{with the formation of}} acyclic diterpene phytol and water-soluble chlorophyllide. An alternative primary reaction is the removal of <b>magnesium</b> from the <b>chlorophyll</b> tetrapyrrole ring to form pheophytin with the participation of Mg 2 +-dechelatase and/or low-molecular Mg 2 +-dechelating substances. The chlorophyll breakdown can also be caused by free radicals formed in the peroxidase-catalyzed reaction of Н 2 О 2 with phenolic compounds or fatty acids. The unstable product of chlorophyll peroxidation, C 132 –hydroxychlorophyll a decomposes to colorless low-molecular compounds. Expression of the genes of chlorophyll catabolism enzymes is controlled by phytohormones. Methods for controlling the pigment decomposition during storage of plant products are {{associated with the use of}} activators and inhibitors of chlorophyll decomposition. The best known inductor of the synthesis of catabolic enzymes is ethylene, widely used to accelerate fruit ripening. Gibberellins, cytokinins and nitric oxide, on the contrary, slow down the loss of chlorophyll...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>magnesium</b> atom of <b>chlorophylls</b> (Chls) {{is always}} five- or six-coordinated within chlorophyll–protein {{complexes}} {{which are the}} main light-harvesting systems of plants, algae and most photosynthetic bacteria. Due {{to the presence of}} stereocenters and the axial ligation of magnesium the two faces of Chls are diastereotopic. It has been previously recognized that the α-configuration having the magnesium ligand on the opposite face of the 17 -propionic acid moiety is more frequently encountered and is more stable than the more seldom β-configuration that has the magnesium ligand on the same face [T. S. Balaban, P. Fromme, A. R. Holzwarth, N. Krauβ, V. I. Prokhorenko, Relevance of the diastereotopic ligation of <b>magnesium</b> atoms in <b>chlorophylls</b> in Photosystem I, Biochim. Biophys. Acta (Bioenergetics), 1556 (2002) 197 – 207; T. Oba, H. Tamiaki, Which side of the π-macrocycle plane of (bacterio) chlorophylls is favored for binding of the fifth ligand? Photosynth. Res. 74 (2002) 1 – 10]. In photosystem I only 14 Chls {{out of a total of}} 96 are in a β-configuration and these occupy preferential positions around the reaction center. We have now analyzed the α/β dichotomy in the homodimeric photosystem II based on the 2. 9  Å resolution crystal structure [A. Guskov, J. Kern, A. Gabdulkhakov, M. Broser, A. Zouni, W. Saenger, Cyanobacterial photosystem II at 2. 9  Å resolution: role of quinones, lipids, channels and chloride, Nature Struct. Mol. Biol. 16 (2009) 334 – 342] and find that out of 35 Chls in each monomer only 9 are definitively in the β-configuration, while 4 are uncertain. Ab initio calculations using the approximate coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles model CC 2 [O. Christiansen, H. Koch, P. Jørgensen, The second-order approximate coupled cluster singles and doubles model CC 2, Chem. Phys. Lett. 243 (1995) 409 – 418] now correctly predict the absorption spectra of Chls a and b and conclusively show for histidine, which is the most frequent axial ligand of magnesium in chlorophyll–protein complexes, that only slight differences (< 4  nm) are encountered between the α- and β-configurations. Significant red shifts (up to 50  nm) can, however, be encountered in excitonically coupled β–β-Chl dimers. Surprisingly, in both photosystems I and II very similar “special” β–β dimers are encountered at practically the same distances from P 700 and P 680, respectively. In purple bacteria LH 2, the B 850 ring is composed exclusively of such tightly coupled β-bacteriochlorophylls a. A statistical analysis of the close contacts with the protein matrix (< 5  Å) shows significant differences between the α- and β-configurations and the subunit providing the axial magnesium ligand. The present study allows us to conclude that the excitation energy transfer in light-harvesting systems, from a peripheral antenna towards the reaction center, may follow preferential pathways due to structural reasons involving β-ligated Chls...|$|R
40|$|Weak neck is the {{physiological}} weakening at the pedicel of Musa sp. fruit that causes individual fruits {{to be released}} prematurely from the hand. The level of resistance to weak neck is different among groups of Musa sp. with A and B genomes, diploid, triploid and tetraploid. Musa sp. cv. Rastali is AAB genome, but this cultivar is sensitive to weak neck. Sensitivity to weak neck comes from the two A genomes. There is high probability that application of Magnesium (Mg), Boron (B) and Silicon (Si) may solve weak neck on Musa sp. cv. Rastali. <b>Magnesium</b> application increases <b>chlorophyll</b> synthesis and photosynthesis rate. Assimilate accumulation on fruit cells triggers cell elongation and cell wall thickening, especially in the neck zone. Boron {{plays an important role}} in regulating hormone and enzyme levels in plants. Sufficient boron in plant tissue impedes synthesis and activities of Pectate Lyase (PL) and pectinmethylesterase (PME), thus decreasing cell wall hydrolysis. Plant cells and tissues become stronger with Si application. This is caused by the formation of silica-cuticle double layer on the epidermis. Low temperature along with low relative humidity during storage and ripening decreases the activities of PL and PME. The reduction of PL and PME activities result in a decrease in pectin degradation rate and cell wall hydrolysis, thus reducing the occurrence of weak neck...|$|R
40|$|Optimizing {{root system}} {{architecture}} can overcome yield limitations in crop plants caused by water or nutrient shortages. Classic breeding approaches are difficult because the trait {{is governed by}} many genes and is difficult to score. We generated transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants with enhanced root-specific degradation of the hormone cytokinin, a negative regulator of root growth. These transgenic plants form a larger root system, whereas growth {{and development of the}} shoot are similar. Elongation of the primary root, root branching, and root biomass formation were increased by up to 60 % in transgenic lines, increasing the root-to-shoot ratio. We thus demonstrated that a single dominant gene could regulate a complex trait, root growth. Moreover, we showed that cytokinin regulates root growth in a largely organ-autonomous fashion that is consistent with its dual role as a hormone with both paracrine and long-distance activities. Transgenic plants had a higher survival rate after severe drought treatment. The accumulation of several elements, including S, P, Mn, Mg, Zn, as well as Cd from a contaminated soil, was significantly increased in shoots. Under conditions of sulfur or <b>magnesium</b> deficiency, leaf <b>chlorophyll</b> content was less affected in transgenic plants, demonstrating the physiological relevance of shoot element accumulation. Our approach might contribute to improve drought tolerance, nutrient efficiency, and nutrient content of crop plants...|$|R
40|$|Free porphyrins {{and their}} <b>magnesium</b> complexes, {{including}} <b>chlorophylls,</b> are potent photo-sensitizers. Plants usually accumulate these compounds bound to proteins together with protective compounds like carotenoids. Besides their protective role, carotenoids {{can play a}} structural role in these complexes. To analyze the effect of impaired carotenogenesis on plastid membranes we applied to barley seedlings the bleaching herbicide 2 -(4 -chlorophenylthio) triethylamine (CPTA) as a specific inhibitor for the cyclization of lycopene. To avoid interference with photo-oxidation, the essential experiments were performed on seedlings grown in darkness. While the amount of total carotenoids decreased, we found accumulation of more delta-carotene than lycopene in darkness clearly showing that CPTA inhibits the lycopene beta-cyclase more effectively than the lycopene epsilon-cyclase. The CPTA treatment resulted in accumulation of non-photoactive protochlorophyllide a; the amount of photoactive protochlorophyllide and NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase remained constant. Further, the level of Mg protophorphyrin and its monomethyl ester increased to an extent similar to that obtained by application of 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA). The perturbation of the ultrastructure of etioplast inner membranes, observed after CPTA-treatment, was not found after ALA-treatment; this excluded the accumulated tetrapyrroles as responsible for the perturbation. By contrast, the down-regulation of Lhcb and RbcS genes found after CPTA-treatment was compatible with the presumed role of Mg protophorphyrin as "plastid signal" for regulation of nuclear gene expression. Possible mechanisms for enhancement of tetrapyrrole accumulation by non-cyclic carotenoids are discussed...|$|R

Nitrogen (N) deposition to forest ecosystems has been rapidly increasing in this region, due mainly to industrialization and overuse of N fertilizer. Together with excess N, phosphorus (P) {{is considered to}} be the key determinant of tree growth in northeast Asia, because most soils have originated from immature volcanic ash. To predict the response of the F- 1 to increasing N deposition and its relation with soil P availability related to immature volcanic ash soil in northern Japan, planting stocks of F- 1 were grown in potted brown forest soil and categorised into eight treatments, comprising four N treatments covering the amount of N deposition observed and predicted in northeast Asia in combination with two P levels. N application increased the biomass and the light-saturated net photosynthetic rate (A (sat)) of the F- 1 at all concentrations. Despite expectations, P did not have any effect on these parameters. As N application increased the content of potassium (K), <b>magnesium</b> (Mg) and <b>chlorophyll</b> (Chl) in needles, a positive correlation was found between the content of N, K, P and A (sat). These results suggest that N deposition improves the growth of the hybrid larch F- 1 at least by improving the needle N condition, as well as the concentration of other macronutrients in the initial stage of plantation...|$|R
40|$|The tetrapyrrole {{biosynthesis}} pathway {{results in}} the synthesis of both haem and chlorophyll and tight regulation of this pathway during de-etiolation is critical for the safe biogenesis of the photosynthetic apparatus. While much {{attention has been paid}} to light regulation of the total flux through this pathway less is known about the role of light in regulating the key, metal-insertion branchpoint leading either to haem or <b>chlorophyll.</b> <b>Magnesium</b> chelatase, responsible for channelling substrates into the chlorophyll branch, is composed of three subunits (CHLD, CHLH and CHLI), with a regulatory protein, GUN 4, also necessary for full enzyme activity. To understand how light affects branchpoint regulation we have studied the transcriptional regulation of the four genes encoding these proteins in de-etiolating Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using quantitative PCR. Analysis of gene expression in dark-grown seedlings transferred to far-red and red light has shown that CHLH and GUN 4 are strongly induced, while the CHLD and CHLI 1 genes show little change in expression. Comparison of expression profiles in wild-type and photoreceptor-deficient mutant of Arabidopsis indicate that regulation is primarily under the control of phytochromes A and B. These results suggest that phytochrome-mediated induction of GUN 4 and CHLH is a major mechanism for redirecting tetrapyrrole synthesis to the chlorophyll branch of the pathway during de-etiolation. We are now looking to test this hypothesis further by examining protein levels and the flux of tetrapyrrole intermediates through the branch point at this critical stage of plant development...|$|R

40|$|Being a {{macronutrient}} with essential {{functions in}} plant metabolism, a sufficient supply of magnesium to crops {{is important to}} gain high yields and quality. In agriculture and forestry magnesium deficiency has become a problem in some areas. Besides low soil concentrations especially in light and sandy soils, also other parameters such as high concentrations of Ca 2 +, K+, H+, Al 3 + or low soil humidity can lead to suboptimal provision of magnesium to crops. This will lead among other things, {{to the formation of}} chlorosis in the older leaves, reduced growth and the accumulation of sugars in source leaves. Instead of soil amendment, magnesium can also be applied via foliar fertilization. This can be valuable if the magnesium soil availability of magnesium is reduced or if a rapid improvement of the plants nutrient status is needed. Magnesium foliar application has been demonstrated to improve chlorophyll concentration and biomass accumulation in oregano, maize, soybean and apples (Reay et al. 1998; Szulc et al. 2001; Dordas 2009; Teklic et al. 2009). With regards to responses of yield and quality, however, studies present differential results. The impact of foliar MgSO 4 application on plant physiology has also been studied scarcely. In this study, the influence of foliar MgSO 4 fertilization on different aspects, such as the distribution of the major cations Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + and K+ in different plant compartments, the transcript abundance of enzymes related to the appearance of deficiency symptoms and the formation of yield and seed quality in Vicia faba was examined. For this purpose, faba beans were grown in nutrient solution containing either sufficient (0. 5 mM) or low (0. 05 / 0. 015 mM) MgSO 4. Plants growing in nutrient solution containing only low concentrations of MgSO 4 were subjected to foliar applications of MgSO 4 with either 0 mM, 50 mM or 200 mM. Foliar application proved to change the cation relations in the apoplast and symplast in diverse manners. The rise in apoplastically bound Mg 2 + led to a decrease of Ca 2 + while in the symplast the risen Mg 2 + concentration affected on the K+ concentration, if high concentrations of MgSO 4 (200 mM) were applied. Although both cations hold important functions in plant structure and metabolism, negative effects could not be observed with regards to the other parameters measured. It was therefore proposed that these cations can replace each other partially. The concentration of chlorophyll and the photosynthesis rate proved to be enhanced by application of 200 mM MgSO 4. However, the reduced transcript abundance of Mg chelatase H under magnesium deficiency was not changed by foliar magnesium application. This might indicate that under <b>magnesium</b> deficiency <b>chlorophyll</b> synthesis is reduced which is not influenced by foliar application. Instead, a reduced chlorophyll breakdown due to ameliorated magnesium supply is possible. This study revealed that the transcription of the plasmalemma H+-ATPase isoforms is differentially regulated under magnesium deficiency. However, specific functions of different isoforms have not been revealed yet. Magnesium foliar application resulted in a significant increase of seed yield of plants growing in magnesium deficient nutrient solution. This increase was mainly attributable to {{the increase in the number}} of pods per plant. Additionally, the quality of the seeds was raised due to magnesium foliar application as significantly higher protein concentrations could be found.

40|$|We {{have carried}} out quantum {{chemical}} computations {{on the special}} pairs of chlorophyll-a molecules so as to resolve the ambiguity of the large oxidation odor potential of P 680 and establish the identities of P 680 and P 700 by comparing the calculated potentials with the observed ones. The methodology adopted here has been INDO. At first the oxidation potential of chlorophyll-a has been determined from the calculations on model structures prepared from the crystallographic structure of ethyl chlorophyllide-a dihydrate with variously truncated side chains. A good value of the oxidation potential is found only for structures that have most of the side chains and hydrogen-bonded water molecules intact. The calculated oxidation potentials are about 0. 68 V in dichloromethane and 0. 77 V in acetonitrile at pH 4. 5 at 298. 15 K. The calculated numbers are in good agreement with the observed values 0. 74 - 0. 86 and 0. 76 V, respectively, for chlorophyll-a in these solvents. The intact structures {{have been used to}} form the special pairs. The pairs studied include the Shipman model, Strouse model, Svensson model, and a trial model. The new model for the structure of the special pair {{is a result of the}} synthesis of the basic chlorophyll-a structure and the optimum Jr-Jr interaction between two macrocycles facing each other, and it has been specifically studied to complete investigations on structures that, in principle, fill the gap between the Shipman model and the Svensson pair model. The theoretically determined redox potentials are: (1) 0. 45 - 0. 56 V for the Strouse model, 0. 56 - 0. 57 V for the Shipman model, 0. 54 V for the Svensson dimer, 0. 16 V for the trial model (dimer of monohydrates), and 0. 34 V for the trial model (dimer of dihydrates) in the absence of a methionine neighbor; and (2) in the presence of a methionine electrostatically interacting with one of the chlorophylls, 0. 97 - 1. 08 V for the Strouse model, 1. 07 - 1. 08 V for the Shipman model, 1. 05 V for the Svensson pair, 0. 68 V for the trial model (monohydrate dimer) and 0. 85 - 0. 86 V for the trial model (dihydrate dimer). Comparing these values with 0. 46 - 0. 52 V for P 700, one can identify P 700 with all of the dimers except the trial dimer of chlorophyll monohydrates. Pigment P 680 that has a redox potential of 1. 1 V can be identified with the Strouse, Shipman, and Svensson pair models. Interaction with the surrounding dielectric medium and possible bare ions holds the key for the increase of the redox potential from its monomeric value. The formation of the Shipman model from two chlorophyll-a molecules is, in principle, not kinetically favored. The formation of the trial dimer from the mono- or dihydrates is not thermodynamically favored. A reexamination of the experimental spectroscopic data for P 700 is necessary to decide whether the Svensson dimer (without the neighboring methionine) can qualify as P 700. Hence the issue remains open. Relatively recent crystallographic data rule out water as a ligand of <b>magnesium</b> of the <b>chlorophylls</b> in P 680 and thus discount the Strouse, Shipman, and trial models. Our INDO calculations show that the structure of P 680 proposed by Svensson et al. from homology modeling successfully explains the abnormally large oxidation redox potential of this pigment...|$|R

Les données ont fait l'objet d'une Analyse en Composantes principales précédée par une analyse de variance entre saisons et entre stations de mesures afin de déterminer l'importance des hétérogénéités spatiale et temporelle des données. L'eau du fleuve est soumise à un cycle climatique annuel de température et de débit. De brèves fortes eaux de printemps alternent avec de longues périodes de débits stables et inférieurs aux moyennes établies sur plusieurs décennies. Par rapport aux charges de sulfates et de chlorures prises comme référence du drainage du bassin versant, les flux de nitrates ont un pic accentué au printemps, résultant des activités agricoles. Les phosphates présentent aussi un accroissement automnal qui pourrait traduire un cycle annuel de minéralisation-déminéralisation.

Elle indique un gradient de minéralisation croissante de l'hiver au printemps. La qualité de l'eau lors des fortes eaux printanières est homogénéisée et imposée par le fleuve. En phases de faibles débits, la qualité de l'eau évolue parallèlement à celle de la Garonne (concentrations des substances) pour un bras mort ventilé par une communication amont et aval. En revanche, les deux bras morts en simple communication aval présentent un retard à la concentration de l'eau d'autant plus évident que {{la communication}} est étroite. Les substances fertilisantes (nitrates, phosphates, [...] .) augmentant de l'amont vers l'aval dans ces deux derniers bras morts, sont en été en concentration inférieure par rapport au fleuve, en raison : 1) du remplissage printanier par des eaux diluées, puis du retard estival à l’équilibrage par simple communication aval et 2) de la consommation par les organismes végétaux aquatiques. L'élude des différences spatio-temporelles met ainsi en évidence un gradient saisonnier de minéralisation, un gradient aval-amont de productivité et un gradient aval-amont de réchauffement estival. La productivité apparaît donc liée au réchauffement estival plutôt qu'à la minéralisation ou aux teneurs en substances fertilisantes. For two years, water analysis and measurements {{were carried out}} monthly at one station on the Garonne and at three different ancient arms. Spatio-temporal variability was drawn up from 14 {{physical and chemical properties}} (water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, oxygen, oxydability, total alcalinity, ammonia, nitrate, orthophosphate, sulphate, chloride, calcium, <b>magnesium</b> and <b>chlorophyll</b> a) which can have an effect upon the chemical balance of water and upon aquatic life. The data were studied by Principal Component Analysis preceded by Analysis of Variance between date and between station {{in order to determine the}} significance of spatio-temporal heterogeneity. The river water is under the influence of an annual climatic cycle affecting temperature and flow. The flash floods in spring alternate with long periods of flow stability (these periods are lower than the established means for the flow over the last few decades). For each element specific water discharge-concentration relationships can be drawn, which may present time variations according to the hydrological regime. The particulate and dissolved soil-derived components increase with water discharge, whereas groundwater-derived elements are generally diluted during floods. In relation to the sulphate and chloride loads, which are used as a reference for the drainage of the basin, the nitrate levels have an accentuated peak in spring resulting from agricultural practices. Phosphates also display a high autumn level which could be due to an annual cycle of mineralisation-demineralisation. Organic matter increases correlatively with the chlorophyll a rate. The water in the Garonne is of a high quality conforming to the standards expected for this type, except for the ammonia levels which come from the Toulouse agglomeration, and mean that the self cleaning process in this case is offer incomplete. In relation to the Garonne, the three ancient, arms have thermal cycle which characteristically accentuated in the summer. Water temperature, electrical conductivity and pH value were not so varied from one to another ancient arms. This spatial homogeneity was coupled with the temporal homogeneity for the pH value. In the other hand, water temperature and electrical conductivity followed the different seasonal cycle. The temperature variations are parallel in all of the stations, but the amplitude of summer-winter cycle is important in three ancient arms. Within the ancient arms, the longitudinal profile of temperature was similar in summer, characterized by a little warming up according to the downstream-upstream gradient presented in Principal Component Analysis (PCP). This gradient was more pronounced in the ancient arms PV and GF than in ancient arm RB where subsists in summer a weak circulation of river flow. The temperature presents a determinant role in the ancient arm productivity, reflected by the significant correlations between temperature on the one band and, the organic matter contents, chlorophyll a and pH values on the other hand. The increase of temperature in summer is accompanied by the production of organic matter, particularly in the upstream part of PV and GF. This phenomenon could be explained as a result of biological activity growth essentially phytoplankton because it was attached to an increase of chlorophyll a concentration. The biological activity stimulated by the increasing temperature contributes to reduce the pH value, accentuated by the diminution of oxygen saturation vigorously indicated in the morning, at the upstream part of the ancient arms. The percentage of oxygen saturation in the morning was essentially modified by the biological activity. It is stable and high during the spring period which corresponds to high water level of the river Garonne. Outwards this period where the river imposed the oxygen rate closely related to the air saturation, an upstream-downstream gradient occured in the weak water level periods (summer and winter). This is particularly indicated in the ancient arms which have not an upstream communication with the river. In this lentic ecosystem, it appears that the oxygen rate depends to the flora and fauna metabolic activity, confirmed by a highly significant correlation between the chlorophyll a concentration and the oxygen rate measured in the morning. The persistence of weak renewal water by the upstream part of ancient arm RB limited the summer warning up in this ancient arm compared to PV and GF. Thus, the productivity associated, evaluated by the chlorophyll a concentration, organic matter contents and the variations of pH and oxygen values are lower than the two last ancient arms where have only the downstream outlet. The conductivity value in the ancient arms is closely allied to the river Garonne. It constitutes a first evidence to show that the water quality in the ancient arms was affected by the river. In spring, the regular re-covering of the ancient arms by the river water diluted induces an annual drop of conductivity. Dressing by Principal Component Analysis, the mineral content in these three ancient arms shows a seasonal cycle which corresponds to the flow fluctuations of the river Garonne. The winter-spring gradient was indicated. This gradient was more evident for magnesium than for sulphate, chloride and calcium. The high spring water level reflected a low concentration of sulphate, chloride, calcium and magnesium due to water dilution. The water quality at this period is homogeneous because of the influence of the Garonne. When the water demands is weak, the quality of water in one of the ancient arms evolves parallel with that in the Garonne (concentration of matter) as it is alimented both up and downstream by the Garonne. On the other hand, the other two ancient arms have only the downstream outlet causing a delay in water concentration, especially as the connection with the main stream is narrow. The fertilising matter (nitrates, phosphates, etc.) which increases downstream, in summer, is at lower concentration in the ancient arms compared to the main stream for the following reasons : 1) filling of the spring influx by diluted water, then the summer delay in equilibration of water via the single downstream inlet and 2) due to the absorption by the aquatic plants. Finally, the different spatiotemporal studies exhibit a seasonal mineralization gradient, a downstream-upstream productivity gradient and a downstream-upstream summer warning. The productivity therefore appears to be related to the summer warning rather than to the mineralization process or the presence of fertilising constituents...|$|R
