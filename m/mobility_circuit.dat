40|$|La María and Cerro Tres Tetas archaeological localities {{are located}} in the Central Plateau, in the {{province}} of Santa Cruz, Argentine Patagonia. This area presents abundant lithic raw materials of very good quality for knapping including flint, chalcedony and silicified wood. These raw materials were used by the inhabitants of the region {{since the end of the}} Pleistocene until recent historical times. Besides, we have recorded the exploitation of exotic stones in low proportions at the archaeological sites. Among these, the most abundant is obsidian which probably comes from sources located more than 125 kmaway. In this context, the use of this type of raw material should be evaluated in terms of social and symbolic issues. In this paper, we examine the strategies of acquisition and reduction of the obsidian found at the archaeological sites Cerro Tres Tetas 1, Casa del Minero 1, Cueva de La Ventana, La Mesada and Cueva Túnel. We carry out a technomorphological analysis of the obsidian remains from these sites. Results from this work strengthen the idea that the groups which lived in the Central Plateau knew about and exploited an obsidian source known as Pampa del Asador. A raise in the use of this raw material throughout time is recorded, reaching its peak in the late Holocene. We identified two different moments in the exploitation of obsidian at the regional level. During the final Pleistocene and early Holocene, obsidian would not have played a relevant role in the organization of technology. Production sequences indicate that tools probably were entered to the sites already manufactured. During the middle and late Holocene nodules and cores could have been brought into the sites. The strategies involved in their reduction are in broad terms similar to those implemented with local raw materials; there is no evidence that obsidian had more value in any way. On the other hand, it is also not possible to state that there was just an eventual exploitation of this raw material. We believe that obsidian was acquired during <b>mobility</b> <b>circuits</b> which enabled the contact between different groups...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Due to {{miniaturization}} of <b>circuits</b> <b>mobility</b> degradation, velocity saturation {{and power}} dissipation issues are {{critical in the}} design of VLSI circuits. In this paper various techniques to minimize power dissipation due to glitches are discussed. Total power consumption consists of two major parts like static power consumption and dynamic power consumption. In the total power, the static power is 30 % and dynamic power is 70 %. The power due to glitches is 70 % of the dynamic power and 30 % of the total power. Various methods are developed by researchers to minimize the power due to glitches {{and some of them are}} presented here and comparison of various issues related to them is presented here. I...|$|R
40|$|A Ku-band tunable {{oscillator}} operated at {{and below}} 77 K is described. The oscillator {{is based on}} two separate technologies: a 0. 25 mm GaAs pseudomorphic high electron <b>mobility</b> transistor (PHEMT) <b>circuit</b> optimized for cryogenic operation, and a gold microstrip ring resonator patterned on a thin ferroelectric (SrTiO 3) film which was laser ablated onto a LaAlO 3 substrate. A tuning range of up to 3 % of the center frequency was achieved by applying dc bias between the ring resonator and ground plane.

Crystalline GaN provides an alternative choice of material for fabricating Lamb-wave sensors. The advantageous properties {{of this material}} include high acoustic velocity, high chemical, mechanical and thermal stability, and the potential to integrate {{with a wide range}} of GaN-based devices such as high electron <b>mobility</b> transistor (HEMT) <b>circuits,</b> light emitting diodes (LED) and other photonic devices. We successfully developed GaN-based Lamb-wave mass-sensors in small size (membrane size of similar to 1 mm x 1 mm). The sensors showed good signal strength and mass sensitivity, comparable to other mass-sensors using conventional materials. This novel approach not only allows robust low-cost sensors to be fabricated, but also enables future integration with generic GaN-based devices on the same chip (i. e. lab-on-a-chip) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes "MobileSocket" which realizes {{session layer}} {{communication}} continuity support for Java Applications towards the continuous operations for mobile applications. In the mobile computing environment where mobile hosts moves around the network even during applications are {{communicating with the}} remote, maintenance of the communication continuity between the applications is significant. Not only the mobility support but the virtual circuit continuity support is required for communication continuity. Existing approaches have not provided the complete communication continuity for applications. "MobileSocket" is a user-level enhanced socket library written in Java, and provides librarybased session layer <b>mobility</b> and virtual <b>circuit</b> continuity support for applications. Two mechanisms, Dynamic Socket Switching (DSS) and Application Layer Window (ALW) were developed for MobileSocket and enable a simple implementation. MobileSocket applications {{can be used in}} Java mobile applications and the agents, as well as for ordinary network applications. In this paper, after we clarify the communication continuity and existing approaches, we present the MobileSocket design, mechanism, and results of evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the evolution of}} European competence as regards legal migration and in particular it focuses on the role and consistency acquired by estimated <b>mobility</b> <b>circuits</b> in the normative archetype outlined by the supranational legislator. In an attempt to determine if, when and why European Union law acquired ‘differential’ features as regards handling of “others” and {{the role that the}} establishment of mobility pathways in favor of those who do not possess an European citizenship could have into the common space, this study has become an analysis of the appearance of a proper European competence in the field of migration. By retracing backwards the strategy used by the European Union in approaching the migratory phenomenon, it has been observed in the first chapter that this phenomenon has suffered the effects of competence partitioning between ‘centre’ and ‘suburbs’. In the beginning this partitioning excluded the possibility for European institutions to directly affect the conditions of citizens from non-EU countries who legally live in the European territory. Moreover, it has been noticed how the European competence in this field has fluctuated for a long time between the aforementioned State unwillingness to discuss the regulation of this phenomenon and the launch of forms of cooperation between governments, up till the amendments to the normative structure of Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon Treaties. The second chapter is divided in three different subsections each aiming at researching on a different feature of the migratory phenomenon legislation. More specifically, the chapter analyses the consistency of the European acquis as regards legal migration, by acknowledging the fragmentation of this subject as well as the continuous difficulties experienced by the European Union in bringing together member States’ legislations, only partly temperate thanks to the scheduled derogatory clauses in the various normative acts analyzed. The close examination of the sections of the directives adopted on the subject of legal migration has been preceded by an extensive analysis on the abovementioned acts drawn up by the European legislator. This analysis also focused on the reconstruction of the statute of non-EU citizens who are entitled to advantaged mobility rights identified by the European legislator thanks to the family ties with a European citizen. Finally, the last chapter focuses on an emerging aspect of the European legislation as regards the migration subject, i. e. the discipline of mobility in the community territory for workers from other countries. Here we excluded the existence of any international mandatory norms that bind the Member States to grant the access of foreigners on their territory and equally took note of the substantial noninvolvement of non-EU citizens from European initiatives in the field of freedom of circulation. argue that the dilemmas that characterized the supranational intervention in this area are such in a way justifiable according to the tensions between the Member States attempting to keep intact their discretional power over the normative framing of the 'community of citizens’ and the principle of equality. The contradictions that characterized the normative archetype created from the supranational legislator are particularly evident as regards the assignment at the citizens’ categories as well as at foreign workers’ categories of upcoming mobility rights. The final result is a system of mobility rights that prevent the migrant from being integrated in the society and, as a consequence, in the European labour market. This reveals the profoundly compromising and influenced nature of the mobility rights iure proprio recognized to non-EU citizens, {{despite the fact that the}} freedom of circulation is the most visible of the fundamental rights of European citizens...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{crystals}} {{deposited on}} 2 -dimensional (2 D) van der Waals substrates {{have been widely}} investigated due to their unprecedented crystal structures and electrical properties. van der Waals interaction between organic molecules and the substrate induces epitaxial growth of high quality organic crystals and their anomalous crystal morphologies. Here, we report on unique ambipolar charge transport of a “lying-down” pentacene crystal grown on a 2 D hexagonal boron nitride van der Waals substrate. From in-depth analysis on crystal growth behavior and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy measurement, it is revealed that the pentacene crystal at the initial growth stage have a lattice-strained packing structure and unique energy band structure with a deep highest occupied molecular orbital level compared to conventional “standing-up” crystals. The lattice-strained pentacene few layers enable ambipolar charge transport in field-effect transistors with balanced hole and electron field-effect <b>mobilities.</b> Complementary logic <b>circuits</b> composed of the two identical transistors show clear inverting functionality with a high gain up to 15. The interesting crystal morphology of organic crystals on van der Waals substrates is expected to attract broad attentions on organic/ 2 D interfaces for their electronic applications...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic wave sensors have {{numerous}} {{applications in}} physical, {{chemical and biological}} sensing. Among different types of acoustic wave sensors, Lamb-wave sensors are attractive for those applications because of excellent sensitivity, capability to function well in both liquid and gaseous environments, and scalability to be produced in a batch process. Traditionally, piezoelectric materials required {{for this type of}} sensors are based on sputtered or polycrystalline materials such as AlN, ZnO and lead zirconate titanate (PZT). Recently, single crystalline gallium nitride (GaN) is regarded as a good candidate for alternative sensing material. The advantageous properties of GaN include high acoustic velocities, a wide band gap of 3. 4 eV and the stability to operate in harsh environments. In this study, Lamb-wave sensors were designed, fabricated with MOCVD-grown GaN-based thin films on silicon substrates and further developed into a universal platform for physical and biological sensing ranged from a microbalance (mass sensor) and a UV light sensor to a specific protein sensor. Techniques of fabricating membrane sensors were developed and refined to optimize the sensor performance and yield. Experiments were performed to demonstrate the various sensing capability. Good results were obtained including a high mass sensitivity (274 cm 2 /g), a low limit of detection (LOD) of UV intensity (4. 1 μW/cm 2) and a crisp signal response at low concentration of anti-bovine serum albumin (1 μg/ml). The novelty of using GaN thin films on a silicon substrate not only allows for a variety of high-performance sensors to be fabricated on a general platform, but also enables generic GaN-based devices to be integrated on a chip in the future, i. e., systems-on-a-chip (SoC). Potential devices for integration include well-developed GaN-based high electron <b>mobility</b> transistor (HEMT) <b>circuits,</b> light emitting diodes (LED), as well as power and RF devices...|$|R
