This study describes the clinical validation of a low-cost paper-based <b>test</b> for <b>SCA</b> that can accurately identify sickle trait carriers (HbAS) and individuals with SCA (HbSS) among adults and children over 1 year of age. In a population of healthy volunteers and SCA patients in the United States (n = 55) the test identified individuals whose blood contained any HbS (HbAS and HbSS) with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for both visual evaluation and automated analysis, and detected SCA (HbSS) with 93 % sensitivity and 94 % specificity for visual evaluation and 100 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity for automated analysis.

GBS carrier rate in pregnant women varies from 4. 6 to 41 percent in different geographic populations. Contamination of neonates during passage through the birth canal is high (more than 50 %). Of the 191 pregnant women screened in this study, 28 (14. 7 %) were found to be colonized with GBS, by the culture method. Direct CIE and <b>SCA</b> <b>tests</b> on SBM (Selective Broth Medium) containing mixed flora showed that only 11. 5 % and 18. 3 % had positive reaction. A total of 530 patients were studied.

40|$|Although ataxia is by {{definition}} the prominent symptom of ataxia disorders, there are various neurological signs that may accompany ataxia in affected patients. Reliable and quantitative assessment of these signs is important because they contribute to disability, but may also interfere with ataxia. Therefore we devised the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS), a list of neurological signs that allows determining the presence and severity of non-ataxia signs in a standardized way. INAS underwent a rigorous validation procedure that involved a trial of 140 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (<b>SCA)</b> for <b>testing</b> of inter-rater reliability and another trial of 28 SCA patients to assess short-term intra-rater reliability. In addition, data of the ongoing EUROSCA natural history study {{were used to determine}} the reproducibility, responsiveness and validity of INAS. Inter-rater reliability and short-term test-retest reliability was high, both for the total count and for most of the items. However, measures of responsiveness, such as the smallest detectable change and the clinically important change were not satisfactory. In addition, INAS did not differentiate between subjects that were subjectively stable and those that worsened in the 2 -year observation period. In summary, INAS and INAS count showed good reproducibility, but unsatisfactory responsiveness. The present analysis and published data from the EUROSCA natural history study suggest that INAS is a valid measure of extracerebellar involvement in progressive ataxia disorders. As such, it is useful as a supplement to the measures of ataxia, but not as a primary outcome measure in future interventional trials...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Smart or {{responsive}} contrast agents (SCAs) can substantially improve {{specificity of}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) in studying processes on molecular and cellular level. These probes can alternate their MR signals upon change in the local environment, thus reporting occurrence of a particular physiological or pathological process. For instance, monitoring of concentration changes of ions or molecules {{that are involved in}} neuronal signaling can bring MR neuroimaging to the next level and allow investigation of brain activity in unprecedented fashion [1]. Methods We have developed a strategy to synthetically <b>modify</b> our <b>SCAs</b> that respond robustly to calcium and enable their combination with diverse functional molecules. Consequently, coupling of SCAs to dendrimers or nanoparticles or incorporation of SCA with the long hydrophobic chain into lypsomes results in preparation of various types of responsive nanosized probes. Results The dendrimeric SCA retains high longitudinal relaxivity (r 1) change upon saturation with calcium while reducing the diffusion rate in vivo, which leads to the more constant contrast-enhanced signal in rat cerebral cortex (Figure 1). The SCAs covalently attached to the silica-based nanoparticles (NP-SCA) are also active towards calcium. After intravenous administration in mice, NP-SCA changes the MRI signal in both the renal pelvis and parenchyma upon the addition of CaCl 2 solution. Finally, the liposome-based SCA indicates extremely large r 1 changes at low magnetic field upon the relaxometric titration with calcium. Conclusions In vivo experiments performed with dendrimeric SCA showed very advantageous diffusion properties. More importantly, the nanoparticle-based SCAs demonstrated the capability of these responsive probes to report calcium concentration changes by means of MRI. Liposomic SCA indicates the possibility to strongly amplify MRI signal in calcium-dependent manner. A diversity in preparation procedures offers various possibilities to make very potent responsive agents. These nanoprobes hold great promise for use in molecular functional MRI...|$|R
40|$|Snow is an {{important}} and complicated element in hydrological modelling. The traditional catchment hydrological model with its many free calibration parameters, also in snow sub-models, is not a well-suited tool for predicting conditions for which {{it has not been}} calibrated. Such conditions include prediction in ungauged basins and assessing hydrological effects of climate change. In this study, a new model for the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE), parameterized solely from observed spatial variability of precipitation, is compared with the current snow distribution model used in the operational flood forecasting models in Norway. The former model uses a dynamic gamma distribution and is called Snow Distribution_Gamma, (SD_G), whereas the latter model has a fixed, calibrated coefficient of variation, which parameterizes a log-normal model for snow distribution and is called Snow Distribution_Log-Normal (SD_LN). The two models are implemented in the parameter parsimonious rainfall–runoff model Distance Distribution Dynamics (DDD), and their capability for predicting runoff, SWE and snow-covered area (<b>SCA)</b> is <b>tested</b> and compared for 71 Norwegian catchments. The calibration period is 1985 – 2000 and validation period is 2000 – 2014. Results show that SD_G better simulates SCA when compared with MODIS satellite-derived snow cover. In addition, SWE is simulated more realistically in that seasonal snow is melted out and the building up of "snow towers" and giving spurious positive trends in SWE, typical for SD_LN, is prevented. The precision of runoff simulations using SD_G is slightly inferior, with a reduction in Nash–Sutcliffe and Kling–Gupta efficiency criterion of 0. 01, but it is shown that the high precision in runoff prediction using SD_LN is accompanied with erroneous simulations of SWE...|$|R

METHODS: A prospective case control study of SCA patients attending our adult SCA clinic and control subjects from homozygous hemoglobin AA patients attending the staff clinic of the hospital for routine medical tests. Tympanometry and diagnostic audiometry were performed on each patient. MAIN FINDINGS: Forty-six SCA patients (21 males, 45. 7 %) aged 16 - 48 years with a mean age of 22. 9 years +/- 6. 45 and 42 controls (24 males, 57. 1 %) aged 15 - 39 years with a mean age of 23. 7 years +/- 5. 69 were included in this study. The average hearing thresholds of SCA patients were consistently higher than controls in all frequencies tested in both right and left ears. Of the 92 ears of <b>SCA</b> patients <b>tested,</b> 95. 7 % exhibited hearing thresholds within normal limits, and 4. 3 % had mild hearing loss. The controls had thresholds within normal limits.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to extend past outcome-dependent models of Sport Competition Anxiety (SCA) to include {{attribution}} theory as an appraisal process of past performance outcome. It was hypothesized that unstable causal attributions for past unexpected performances would lead to uncertain expectations of future performance and subsequent SCA. Sixty-three male subjects were assessed for initial expectations of how they would perform in a cycling task, i. e., high and low, in which each subject received false feedback about his performance (success or failure). After completing the task, subjects completed questionnaires assessing the discrepancy between expected and actual outcome, attributions for past performance (Causal Dimension Scale), expectation for future performance, and the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory- 2 which measures state cognitive and somatic anxiety and state self-confidence. Contrary to predictions, results indicated that attribution did not mediate SCA, but rather attributions were made systematically in response to success and failure and not unexpected outcome. However, path analysis carried out on a <b>modified</b> model of <b>SCA</b> that includes outcome and expectations of future performance, indicated that somatic anxiety and state self-confidence are mediated by expectation of future success. The findings are discussed in terms of attribution theory and other cognitive constructs (e. g., self-schemata and efficacy expectations) that might have an impact on attributional patterns that lead to performance expectations and SCA. It is noted that because only male subjects were used, generalizability to female competitors may not be appropriate due to differences in sport socialization.

40|$|The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by symptoms {{and signs of}} degeneration in the cerebellum, spinal cord and brainstem. To date, ten different loci causing autosomal dominant SCA have been mapped. In six types of SCA the disease {{is caused by the}} expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat which codes for a polyglutamine tract at the protein level. The overall aim of this research project was to investigate various molecular genetic aspects of the autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias: (1) to assess genetic heterogeneity with linkage studies in suitable families and to study the origin of the MJD/SCA 3 mutation by linkage disequilibrium analysis; (2) to determine the relative frequency of the different types of SCA-(CAG) n mutations in a large group of patients from different ethnic origins; (3) to investigate molecular and clinico-pathological correlations in SCA patients in whom mutations were found and; (4) to investigate whether polyglutamine expansions are present in other forms of SCA using a monoclonal antibody. Three large families segregating autosomal dominant <b>SCA</b> were <b>tested</b> for linkage to the SCA 1, SCA 2 and MJD/SCA 3 loci by the maximum likelihood method. Two-point and multipoint linkage analysis showed that two families (SA and GK) were linked to the SCA 2 locus. The third family (FC) was significantly excluded from the SCA 1, SCA 2 and SCA 3 /MJD loci. Additional markers were typed in the SCA 2 candidate region in the two linked families. We were able to narrow down the SCA 2 candidate region on ch 12 q and construct a fine genetic map of the region that provided important information for the positional cloning of the SCA 2 gene. Linkage disequilibrium studies, using markers around the MJD/SCA 3 gene found evidence of a founder effect in our MJD patients. However, distinct haplotypes were observed in patients originating from each of the two Azorean islands showing the highest disease prevalence; indicating that there are more than one founder mutation in the Azorean MJD population. We studied a large group of unrelated SCA patients {{in order to determine the}} frequency of the SCA 1, SCA 2, MJD/SCA 3 and DRPLA mutations. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a {{group of}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorders that primarily cause the degeneration in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and brainstem. We study the clinical characteristics, radiological features and gene mutation in Chinese families with SCAs. Methods: In this study, we investigated 10 SCAs Chinese families with SCA 1, SCA 3 /Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA 7, SCA 8. There were 27 people who were genetically diagnosed as SCA, of which 21 people showed clinical symptoms, and 6 people had no clinical phenotype that we called them presymptomatic patients. In addition, 3 people with cerebellar ataxia and cataracts were diagnosed according to the Harding diagnostic criteria but failed {{to be recognized as}} <b>SCAs</b> on genetic <b>testing.</b> Clinical characteristic analyses of each type of SCAs and radiological examinations were performed. Results: We found that SCA 3 /MJD was the most common subtype in Han population in China, and the ratio of the pontine tegmentum and the posterior fossa area was negatively correlated with the number of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats; the disease duration was positively correlated with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale score; and the CAG repeats number of abnormal alleles was negatively correlated with the age of onset. Conclusions: Collectively our study is a systematic research on SCAs in China, which may help for the clinical diagnosis and prenatal screening of this disease, and it may also aid toward better understanding of this disease...|$|R
40|$|Red {{blood cell}} (RBC) {{deformability}} is severely decreased {{in patients with}} sickle cell anemia (SCA), which {{plays a role in}} the pathophysiology of the disease. However, investigation of RBC deformability from SCA patients demands careful methodological considerations. We assessed RBC deformability by ektacytometry (LORRCA MaxSis, Mechatronics, The Netherlands) in 6 healthy individuals and 49 <b>SCA</b> patients and <b>tested</b> the effects of different heights of the RBC diffraction patterns, obtained by altering the camera gain of the LORRCA, on the result of RBC deformability measurements, expressed as Elongation Index (EI). Results indicate that the pattern of RBCs from control subjects adopts an elliptical shape under shear stress, whereas the pattern of RBCs from individuals with SCA adopts a diamond shape arising from the superposition of elliptical and circular patterns. The latter represent rigid RBCs. While the EI measures did not change with the variations of the RBC diffraction pattern heights in the control subjects, we observed a decrease of EI when the RBC diffraction pattern height is increased in the SCA group. The differences in SCA EI values measured at 5  Pa between the different diffraction pattern heights correlated with the percent of hemoglobin S and the percent of sickled RBC observed by microscopy. Our study confirms that the camera gain or aperture of the ektacytometer should be used to standardize the size of the RBC diffraction pattern height when measuring RBC deformability in sickle cell patients and underscores the potential clinical utility of this techniqu...|$|R
40|$|Plug and {{abandonment}} (P&A) of subsea wells {{often involves}} removal of steel casing. In {{some parts of}} the well the casing is cemented in place making the operation of retrieving the casing more complex. The conventional methods for retrieving casing are unpredictable in terms of time consumption and consequently cost. This thesis has investigated the current guidelines and regulations that apply for P&A. Further, the conventional methods for removing cemented casing have been analyzed and compared to alternative approaches that have not yet been field proven. A case study on a Cut and Pull operation performed by Statoil was assessed to identify key operational issues. The case study suggested {{that there is a need}} for new approaches for freeing cemented casing. An alternative method for removal of cemented casing has been proposed, namely the Spiral Cut Approach (<b>SCA).</b> Laboratory <b>testing</b> of small scale spiral cut specimens were performed, and it was found that the spiral cut allows the cement to debond successively along the surface of the specimen exposed to torsional loading, thus freeing the casing. FE-analysis were performed to investigate the criticality of the spiral cut pitch and the required torque for a fullscale casing. The method is based on debonding one joint of casing from the cement before moving on to the next casing joint. After the spiral cut has been made between the casing couplings, each casing joint is exposed to sufficient torque to overcome the cement bond between each casing joint (approximately 12 m). Finally, a drillstring deployed pulling tool is connected to the upper section of the casing string and the casing is retrieved in one go. Operational steps and tools necessary to perform the SCA have been assessed. The laboratory testing, FE-analysis and operational assessment indicated that a significant higher number of casing joints can be pulled in one go using the SCA. A time comparison based on the case study and an assessment of the SCA, indicated that a total time saving of 2 days can be made by using the SCA to retrieve 100 m of cemented casing. However, more work will have to be carried out for more detailed verification of the SCA. This includes development of a effective tool for spiral cutting of casing, a combined tool for applying torque and pull for retrieval of cemented casing and lastly an assessment on the effects of using extended diameter couplings. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Arsenic (As) {{is a well}} {{documented}} human carcinogen. Conversely, its mechanisms of toxic deed and carcinogenic possible in animals have not been indisputable. So, {{this study was conducted}} to investigate the biochemical and genotoxic possessions in male wistar rats treated with As, DATS with As and As and vitamin C (positive control). Method: Five groups of six male rats, each weighing approximately 180 - 190 g, were orally administered, daily once for 28 days with a dose of 5 mg/kg BW of sodium arsenate. A control group was also made of 6 animals treated with vehicles alone. At the end of experimentation, the animals were sacrificed, and Chromosome and micronuclei preparation was obtained from bone marrow cells. The activities of plasma 8 -OHdG, as well as the number of structural chromosomal aberrations (SCA), frequency of micronuclei (MN), mitotic index and DNA damage in the bone marrow cells were estimated. Result: Arsenic exposure significantly increased (p˂ 0. 05) the activities of plasma 8 -OHdG, as well as the number of structural chromosomal aberrations (SCA), frequency of micronuclei (MN) and DNA damages in the bone marrow cells. In contrast, the mitotic index in these cells was significantly reduced (p˂ 0. 05). In animals treated with DATS, the altered parameters were significantly recovered. Conclusion: These findings indicate that 8 -OHdG is novel biomarkers for arsenic-induced genotoxicity. Our results also demonstrate that As has a strong genotoxic potential, as measured by the bone marrow <b>SCA</b> and MN <b>tests</b> in wistar rats. DATS has shown the anti-genotoxic effect against As induced genotoxicity in rats...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the longitudinal metric properties of recently developed clinical assessment tools in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). METHODS: A subset of 171 patients from the EUROSCA natural history study cohort (43 SCA 1, 61 SCA 2, 37 SCA 3, and 30 SCA 6) were examined after 1 year of follow-up. Score changes and effect size indices {{were calculated for}} clinical scales (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia [SARA], Inventory of Non-Ataxia Symptoms [INAS]), functional <b>tests</b> (<b>SCA</b> Functional Index [SCAFI] and components), and a patient-based scale for subjective health status (EQ- 5 D visual analogue scale [EQVAS]). Responsiveness was determined {{in relation to the}} patient's global impression (PGI) of change and reproducibility described as retest reliability for the stable groups and smallest detectable change. RESULTS: Within the 1 -year follow-up period, SARA, INAS, and SCAFI but not EQVAS indicated worsening in the whole group and in the groups with subjective (PGI) worsening. SCAFI and its 9 -hole pegboard (9 HPT) component also deteriorated in the stable groups. Standardized response means were highest for 9 HPT (- 0. 67), SARA (0. 50), and SCAFI (- 0. 48) with accordingly lower sample size estimates of 143, 250, or 275 per group for a 2 -arm interventional trial that aims to reduce disease progression by 50 %. SARA and EQVAS performed best to distinguish groups classified as worse by PGI. All scales except EQVAS reached the criterion for retest reliability. CONCLUSION: While both the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia and the SCA Functional Index (SCAFI) (and its 9 -hole pegboard component) had favorable measurement precision, the clinical relevance of SCAFI and 9 -hole pegboard score changes warrants further exploration. The EQ- 5 D visual analogue scale proved insufficient for longitudinal assessment, but validly reflected patients' impression of change...|$|R
40|$|Background: Urinary tract {{infection}} {{is a significant}} cause of morbidity in children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA). Individuals with SCA have increased risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). Facilities for urine culture may not be available in most rural and even some urban areas in most developing countries like Nigeria. It will therefore be useful to have a simple means of screening such children for UTI {{with the intent of}} prompt treatment. Materials and Methods: The study will evaluate the usefulness of the nitrite test in detecting UTI in febrile SCA children. This study was carried out in the Department of Paediatrics University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and State Specialist Hospital Maiduguri. Results: The study consisted of 250 children aged 6 months to 15 years with SCA presenting with fever (temperature ≥ 37. 5 o C). Midstream urine specimen was collected from older children and suprapubic bladder aspiration of urine specimen was collected from infants. Samples were subjected to nitrite test, culture and sensitivity. There was significant bacteriuria in 65 (26 %) children with <b>SCA.</b> A positive <b>test</b> for nitrite was obtained in 43 of the 65 (66. 2 %) children. The nitrite test has a specificity of 93. 5 % in detecting bacteriuria, a sensitivity of 66. 2 %, a positive predictive value of 78. 2 % and a negative predictive value of 93. 5 %. A positive nitrite test was significantly associated with bacteriuria, while a negative test was also significantly associated with an absence of bacteriuria. Conclusions: From this study, the nitrite test is useful as a screening test for UTI in SCA children. However in sick children with SCA, microscopy, culture and sensitivity should still be done in spite of a negative nitrite test...|$|R

Of the resistant clones, it was selected Sca 6 and DRC 15 which performing good potential for yield. This paper reports results on testing yield {{potential of the}} clones in separate trials. <b>Sca</b> 6 was <b>tested</b> in Kottablater Estate (dry climate in the altitude of ± 25 m asl.) and DRC 15 was tested in Mumbulsari Estate (dry climate in the altitude of ± 45 m asl.) both are in Jember. Trials were arranged in the randomized complete block design with 4 blocks. Evaluation for yield performance was conducted during 6 years of harvest and stability performance was analyzed in regression term using year of harvest as the index. The results indicate the yield potential of the clones was quite similar {{in the level of}} 1. 4 kg/plant and performing stability during evaluation and good adaptability in the location. The yield potential was lower than the high yielding clones but use of Sca 6 and DRC 15 in heavily infasted VSD area should be considered than using of the susceptible clones. Sca 6 performed low potential on a dry-weight bean in the range of 0. 65 — 0. 86 g (class C of quality standard) but better performance could be found in the wet area. DRC 15 performed good potential on a dryweight bean of 1. 16 g (class AA of quality standard). Fat content analysis of Sca 6 indicate a better performance of beans which grown up in the wet area (58. 2 %) than in the dry area (49. 6 %). It was reported the fat content potential of DRC 15 in the level of 50. 4 %. Key words : Yield performance, vascular-streak dieback, resistant clone, Theobroma cacao L. </p...|$|R
40|$|The pore-level {{two-phase}} fluids flow mechanism {{needs to}} be understood for geological CO 2 sequestration {{as a solution to}} mitigate anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide. Capillary pressure at the interface of water–CO 2 influences CO 2 injectability, capacity, and safety of the storage system. Wettability usually measured by contact angle is always a major uncertainty source among important parameters affecting capillary pressure. The contact angle is mostly determined on a flat surface {{as a representative of the}} rock surface. However, a simple and precise method for determining in situ contact angle at pore-scale is needed to simulate fluids flow in porous media. Recent progresses in X-ray tomography technique has provided a robust way to measure in situ contact angle of rocks. However, slow imaging and complicated image processing make it impossible to measure dynamic contact angle. In the present paper, a series of static and dynamic contact angles as well as contact angles on flat surface were measured inside a micromodel with random pattern of channels under high pressure condition. Our results showed a wide range of pore-scale contact angles, implying complexity of the pore-scale contact angle even in a highly smooth and chemically homogenous glass micromodel. Receding contact angle (RCA) showed more reproducibility compared to advancing contact angle (ACA) and static contact angle (<b>SCA)</b> for repeating <b>tests</b> and during both drainage and imbibition. With decreasing pore size, RCA was increased. The hysteresis of the dynamic contact angle (ACA–RCA) was higher at pressure of one megapascal in comparison with that at eight megapascals. The CO 2 bubble had higher mobility at higher depths due to lower hysteresis which is unfavorable. CO 2 bubbles resting on the flat surface of the micromodel channel showed a wide range of contact angles. They were much higher than reported contact angle values observed with sessile drop or captive bubble tests on a flat plate of glass in previous reports. This implies that more precaution is required when estimating capillary pressure and leakage risk...|$|R
