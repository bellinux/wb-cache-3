Therefore one of the most vexing questions for investors in metal equities seeking to make a ‘buy’ case on a <b>gold</b> <b>stock</b> is the valuation of the stock and the extent to which the premium makes the stock expensive relative to other gold investments. The purpose of this research was to identify how the recent development of the advent of gol d exchange traded funds (ETFs) on major stock exchanges around the world could influence analysts’ recommendations for direct investment in gold in favour of South African (SA) <b>gold</b> <b>stocks</b> at a premium. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 28 gold analysts based both in SA and in New York City, United States of America (USA). A content analysis was carried out on the data gathered during the interviews. The responses were presented as frequency counts of the concepts extracted from the interview transcripts. The findings of this research suggest that the impact of gold ETFs on analysts’ recommendations is substantial. The study suggests that investing in gold ETFs can be an attractive alternative way of participating in gold price movements with lower risk than <b>gold</b> <b>stocks.</b> The conclusion of this research suggests that it can be argued that the advent of ETFs does take away some of the unique appeal that <b>gold</b> <b>stocks</b> previously held, but that gold ETFs are a different type of investment from <b>gold</b> <b>stocks.</b> Whereas <b>gold</b> ETFs appear to have more investment appeal, SA <b>gold</b> <b>stocks</b> are trading options with inherently higher risk, but which potentially offer greater returns.

40|$|Introduction No lawyer should {{object to}} Jackson’s statement. Indeed, {{to deny it}} is to not only deny the {{international}} rule of law but, for many, the concept of law itself. It would also ignore the only strong (and it was strong) legal foundation for the trials – the Pact of Paris 1 – which was signed by the nations sitting in judgment and those whose citizens were judged. The only objection that might be made is that its force might be confined to mere utility. Yet it is a trite reflection that what Robert Jackson thought was clear was denied institutional expression for the following half century and has been making only slow and uneven progress since. It {{is beyond the scope}} of this chapter to list, let alone determine, the reasons why the powers that established the Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes trials institutionally ignored the laws they had so loudly proclaimed and thereby retrospectively denied the legitimacy of the trials they had established. 2 Despite the enormous progress made by the states parties at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute in Kampala 3 in activating the jurisdiction over crimes of aggression when it is ratified by the required 30 states, there will be many obstacles to its implementation, even within those states that ratify the changes. One of the more intriguing potential obstacles is provided by the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Gold</b> principle that arose from <b>Monetary</b> <b>Gold</b> Removed from Rome in 1943 (<b>Monetary</b> <b>Gold</b> Case) 4 heard by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) soon after Nuremberg. It applies a strong form of consent theory to prevent the court making any finding (positive or negative) about a party that has not agreed to the court’s jurisdiction. This raises two questions for the crime of aggression. First, does the <b>Monetary</b> <b>Gold</b> principle apply solely to the ICJ, or can it be applied to other international bodies? Second, we need to consider the way the crime of aggression introduces issues of consent to the International Criminal Court (ICC). If applied in its strongest form it would not only limit who might be prosecuted but what defences could be run. Mirinda O’Gorman did extensive research in the lead-up, and during an internship at the International Criminal Court in 2011. She developed a powerful argument, grounded in case law and legal commentary, that <b>Monetary</b> <b>Gold</b> applies to the crime of aggression, preventing any consideration of the behaviour of an alleged victim-state who has not consented to the Court’s jurisdiction for the crime of aggression. This argument, based on a strong view of the principle of consent enshrined in international law, had considerable support among lawyers at the ICC but less support among the international lawyers present at the workshop. The authors do not seek to affirm either as the better view and/or the view most likely to be adopted by a court of competent jurisdiction. We seek to outline the ‘strong view’ (of the content and effect of <b>Monetary</b> <b>Gold</b> in international criminal law) and a ‘weak view’ and consider some of the potential implications for each. We argue that the strong view reflects much about past approaches to international law, differences between the international public law and (domestic) public law as well as differences between international and domestic criminal law. We will argue that international law can and should move in the direction of the weaker view of <b>Monetary</b> <b>Gold.</b> In doing so, we get some purchase on some more general issues about including the relationship between public international law and international criminal law, the extent to which domestic law principles influence international law principles, the relationship between various international courts and related issues of impunity and access to justice – the principle concern of this book.

The regressions are run on monthly data for <b>gold</b> and several <b>stock</b> market indices (France, Germany, the UK, the US, the G 7). We find that gold qualifies as a safe haven against all these stock indexes. This result holds for crises defined as recessions or bear markets, as the covariance between <b>gold</b> and <b>stocks</b> returns is found negative or null in all cases.

40|$|This paper revises pre-World War II {{current account}} data for {{thirteen}} countries by treating gold flows {{on a consistent}} basis. The standard historical data sources often fail to distinguish between <b>monetary</b> <b>gold</b> exports, which are capital-account credits, and nonmonetary gold exports, which are current-account credits. The paper also adjusts historical investment data to account for changes in inventories. The revised data are used to construct estimates of saving and investment over the period from 1850 to 1945. Our methodology for removing <b>monetary</b> <b>gold</b> flows from the current account leads naturally to a gold-standard version of the Feldstein-Horioka hypothesis on capital mobility. The regression results are in broad agreement with those of Eichengreen, who found a significantly positive cross-sectional correlation between saving and investment even during some periods when the gold standard prevailed. Despite reaching broadly similar conclusions, we estimate correlations between saving and investment that are somewhat lower and less significant than those Eichengreen found. In particular, we find that in comparison to other interwar subsamples, the saving-investment correlation is markedly low during the fleeting years of a revived world gold standard, 1925 - 1930. ...|$|R
