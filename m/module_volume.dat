This paper de-scribes a drive inverter that is deeply integrated into the electric motor, {{as well as the}} innovative modular power electronics concepts that are substantial for creating more compact and more cost effective electric power trains. The central components of the presented approach towards higher integration are so-called Smart Stator Teeth (SST).

Thus, the current in every tooth can be optimally controlled with respect to efficiency, independently from the other teeth. Furthermore, research is done on the construction of a novel power module based on SiC semiconductor de-vices.

The {{transport}} field {{accounts for}} about 35 % of CO 2 emissions in France, while energy production only involves 16 % of the emissions. The strong contribution of transport to the CO 2 emission pattern in France is mainly ascribed to the great development of the nuclear field as energy vector. Therefore, {{in order to meet}} Kyoto targets, CO 2 emissions in vehicles should be drastically reduced in France in the forthcoming decades. To this aim, taking into account a scenario where thermal engines will keep their supremacy as the main propulsion technology at short and mid terms, in addition to increasing more and more energy efficiency, a possibility to reduce drastically CO 2 emissions from transport could involve direct CO 2 capture and in situ storage from exhaust gases.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 46 - 48). Filters based on multiple mode cavity resonator technique {{have the advantage}} of realizing a given filter function in a reduced volume and weight with the drawback of increased complexity. In order to decrease the dependence on electromagnetic analysis software and to gain a better insight on the physics of the structure, the multiple mode single rectangular cavityfilter structure is investigated with an analytical approach. Expressions are obtained for the modal frequency shifts and for the intermodal coupling due to various types of corner cuts. An algorithm is proposed predicting the physical dimensions of thefinal structure given the corresponding coupling matrix. Example designs are realized. The algorithm is able to determine the physical dimensions of the second and third-orderfilters within a few percent. The classical triple mode rectangular cavityfilter structure is altered to form a triplet. The new triplet structure can be arranged to result in either a lower or higher sideband transmission zero. An example Ka-Band design is fabricated with both machining and a novel 3 D printing technology. The results are in agreement with the expectations.

Using measured current–voltage (I–V) and lock-in thermography (LIT) measurements of amor-phous silicon minimodules, we experimentally validate our model. The entire <b>module</b> <b>volume</b> {{is represented by}} two planes (front and back electrodes) which are coupled in vertical direction using 1 -D models, leading to a large reduction of the degrees of freedom in the numerical model and contributing to an efficient solution ap-proach. As compared to 3 -D models, the vertical coupling of the charge transport is represented by local temperature-dependent I–V curves. These {{can be obtained by}} drift–diffusion calculations, single-cell measurements or, as presented here, by an analytical so-lar cell diode model. Inhomogeneous heat sources such as Joule’s heating in the electrodes lead to nonuniform temperature distribu-tions. The explicit temperature dependence in the local I–V curve, therefore, mediates the feedback of the thermal transport on the lo-cal electrical cell characteristics. We employ measured I–V curves under partial illumination and analytical solutions for the po-tential distribution to validate this approach. Further, with LIT measurements of the same modules with and without artificially induced electrical shunts, we verify the computed temperature distributions.

The volume of the scanhead accomodated an intermediate frequency processor(IFP), that provides the filtering and digitization of the raw data and the interoperable remote component (IRC) adapted to CoSMIR, CoSSIR, and HyMAS that stores and archives the data with time tagged calibration and navigation data. The first element of the work is the demonstration of a hyperspectral microwave receiver subsystem that was recently shown using a comprehensive simulation study to yield performance that substantially exceeds current state-of-the-art. Hyperspectral microwave sounders with approximately 100 channels offer temperature and humidity sounding improvements similar to those obtained when infrared sensors became hyperspectral, but with the relative insensitivity to clouds that characterizes microwave sensors. Hyperspectral microwave operation is achieved using independent RF antenna/receiver arrays that sample the same area/volume of the Earth's surface/atmosphere at slightly different frequencies and therefore synthesize a set of dense, finely spaced vertical weighting functions. The second, enabling element of the proposal is the development of a compact 52 -channel Intermediate Frequency processor module.
