The aim of the project is to be able to give individual advice recommendations for energy optimization of agricultural holdings. This will be achieved inter alia through an operational energy audit and current measurements in different operating ranges. To achieve this, smart meters were installed in selected energy-intensive dairy and pig farms. As part of the project, the installed smart meter information about the consumption of various plants and their components were analyzed, regularities and adaptability in loading history identified, and the energy efficiency of the equipment and systems used verified (especially pumps, ventilators, feeding systems). Then recommendations were formulated to shift electricity-intensive processes to times with low electricity costs and high intrinsic power production. The resulting findings will be used as the basis for intelligent energy management in the further course of the project. Overall, efficiency streamlining measures in the field of ventilation and lighting systems, flexible dry feeding systems by decoupling power purchase and consumption, as well as energy savings and related CO 2 savings were determined...|$|E

This will be achieved inter alia through an operational energy audit and current measurements in different operating ranges. To achieve this, smart meters were installed in selected energy-intensive dairy and pig farms. As part of the project, the installed smart meter information of one of the dairy Farms is used to optimize the energy consumption of the farm and increase the degree of self-sufficiency. A good way to achieve this is by taking a closer look at the cooling process of the produced milk since it {{is one of the}} most energy consuming processes on a dairy farm. In addition an installation of an ice cooling system instead of a direct cooling system enables the possibility to store self-produced energy in the form of ice and use it later on when it is needed to cool the milk. This flattens the usual energy peaks throughout the day and increases the degree of self-sufficiency. To ensure a sufficient amount of self-produced energy with solar power plants of various sizes were designed. The different sizes of the power plants are defined by the use of the gathered smart meter data is used to cover different electric loads in addition to the ice water cooling system. Afterwards the different simulated models are compared to find the best balance between energy production, investment cost and a high degree of self-sufficiency. First results show that using an ice cooling system in combination with a solar power plant improvement the degree of self-sufficiency by up to 7. 8...|$|E
40|$|The study {{analyzes}} {{the challenges and}} prospects of private forest owners’ cooperation based {{on the use of}} machinery in Slovenia applying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats approach (SWOT analysis) in combination with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The data from questionnaires with forest owners and presidents of <b>machinery</b> <b>rings</b> were used to develop and to analyze the strategies for forest owners’ cooperation. The results reveal that the members of <b>machinery</b> <b>rings</b> are only partly satisfied with the operation of the existing rings and that the activities of rings meet the members’ interests related to forest management. Thus, <b>machinery</b> <b>rings</b> are recognized as a suitable form of forest owners’ cooperation. The presidents of <b>machinery</b> <b>rings</b> perceive the integration of farmers and private forest owners, as well as knowing the level of mechanization of members as major strengths of <b>machinery</b> <b>rings.</b> Further, strengthening the operation of <b>machinery</b> <b>rings</b> in the field of forestry is recognized as an important opportunity. The shortage of means for operation is identified as a weakness for <b>machinery</b> <b>rings,</b> and the lack of subsidies for investments in equipment is identified as a critical threat. However, the rank of importance of the SWOT groups leads to defensive approach in the strategic planning where <b>machinery</b> <b>rings</b> have to minimize weaknesses in order to avoid threats.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} that labour and machinery inputs to UK farming are becoming increasingly flexible {{with the growth of}} agricultural contracting and <b>machinery</b> <b>rings.</b> The increased opportunity for farmers to make marginal adjustments to labour and machinery inputs tends to erode sorne of the economies of size with important implications for economically optimum farm structures. The article first describes and explains the increasing flexibility of the inputs before going on to examine the evidence for systematic variation in labour and machinery costs by enterprise size. The analysis suggests that economies of size persist, particularly among the beef and sheep enterprises. The strongest evidence of the erosion of economies of size is found on the cereals and other cropping enterprises. It is concluded that smaller farms and smaller farm enterprises will continue to face the fundamental problem of higher unit costs for the foreseeable future. The problem is likely to be greatest on those farms (small farms involved in beef and sheep production) and in those areas (LFAs, Objective 1, Objective Sb) where farming appears to display its most beneficial externalities in social and environmental terms...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{expansion}} revaluates continuously {{the economic}} and social role of agriculture. Population explosion in the world generates continuously growing demand on foods and industrial raw materials. Supply of increased demand is supported by R&D, at the same time using results of it polarizes the economies. In the agriculture the technical development (i. e. development of technical, technological and biological basis of production, chemicalization, education of human resources) produces potential for increasing efficiency of production. The first period of technical development serves characteristically the supply of quantitative demand, but after it reached the equilibrium of supply and demand, then qualitative development becomes aim. Development releases labour, which can be positive or negative externalities for society. Later on demand of sustainability appears, with its ecological, economical and social aspects. Based on experiences of Hungarian model realized in the 1970 s and 1980 s, the paper examines how technical development is realizable successfully in the frame of segmented farm structure, how competitive and efficient farming could be done in this structure, keeping in mind in advantages of large farms. The paper analyses the competitiveness of virtual large-scale farms (which are based on cooperation and coordination of small farms), and confirms their efficiency with model examinations.

In this case R_Z is called an E-group. Obvious examples of E-rings are subrings of Q. However there is a proper class of examples constructed recently. E-rings come up naturally in various topics of algebra. This also led to a generalization: an abelian group G is an E-group if there is an epimorphism from G onto the additive group of End(G). If G is torsion-free of finite rank, then G is an E-group if and only if it is an E-group. The obvious question was raised a few years ago which we will answer by showing that the two notions do not coincide. We will apply combinatorial <b>machinery</b> to non-commutative <b>rings</b> to produce an abelian group G with (non-commutative) End(G) and the desired epimorphism with prescribed kernel H.

40|$|The conserved CaaX box peroxin Pex 19 p {{is known}} to be {{modified}} by farnesylation. The possible involvement of this lipid modification in peroxisome biogenesis, the degree to which Pex 19 p is farnesylated, and its molecular function are unknown or controversial. We resolve these issues by first showing that the complete pool of Pex 19 p is processed by farnesyltransferase in vivo and that this modification is independent of peroxisome induction or the Pex 19 p membrane anchor Pex 3 p. Furthermore, genomic mutations of PEX 19 prove that farnesylation is essential for proper matrix protein import into peroxisomes, which is supposed to be caused indirectly by a defect in peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP) targeting or stability. This assumption is corroborated by the observation that mutants defective in Pex 19 p farnesylation are characterized by a significantly reduced steady-state concentration of prominent PMPs (Pex 11 p, Ant 1 p) but also of essential components of the peroxisomal import <b>machinery,</b> especially the <b>RING</b> peroxins, which were almost depleted from the importomer. In vivo and in vitro, PMP recognition is only efficient when Pex 19 p is farnesylated with affinities differing by a factor of 10 between the non-modified and wild-type forms of Pex 19 p. Farnesylation is likely to induce a conformational change in Pex 19 p. Thus, isoprenylation of Pex 19 p contributes to substrate membrane protein recognition for the topogenesis of PMPs, and our results highlight the importance of lipid modifications in protein-protein interactions...|$|R
