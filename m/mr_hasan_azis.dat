40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} disappearing {{heritage}} of Yemen’s large wooden boats (dhows), both {{in its current}} socio-economic context and in historical perspective. Fieldwork conducted {{by members of the}} MARES project in February 2009 along the coast between Aden and Salif sought to record remaining evidence of wooden boats and their related industries and practices. Wooden boat use has been in sharp decline in recent decades, as dhow-based commerce has declined, and fishing communities have switched to fibreglass vessels. The fieldwork sought to record remaining dhows through simple survey techniques including photography and illustration, as well as close observation. It also involved ethnographic interviews with people who worked on these vessels, either as builders or mariners. In terms of the vessels themselves, the aim was to produce a typology of Yemeni dhows; to record examples of each; to understand construction sequences; and to inventory the distribution of surviving craft. The findings are compared with previous literature on the subject. This research was conducted as part of the MARES Project, a three-year programme investigating the maritime past and heritage of the Red Sea and Arabian-Persian Gulf. MARES is based at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies of the University of Exeter ([URL] The programme is generously funded by the Golden Web Foundation, an educational charity registered in the UK (www. goldenweb. org).
