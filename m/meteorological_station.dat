5|$|In 1853 the Royal Society's {{project was}} concluded, and the {{observatory}} {{was set to}} be abandoned. After a lengthy debate, the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation. Rather than disappearing like its three counterparts, the Toronto observatory was upgraded, and its mission was expanded as it became a <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> (see Meteorological Service of Canada) {{under the direction of}} the Ministry of Marine and Fisheries. During the expansion, the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure.|$|E

After a week's rest, Scotia departed for Buenos Aires, where she was to be repaired and provisioned for another season's work. Bruce had further business in the city; he intended to persuade the Argentine government to assume responsibility for the Laurie Island <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> after {{the expedition}}'s departure. During the voyage to Buenos Aires, Scotia ran aground in the Río de la Plata estuary, and was stranded for several days before floating free and being assisted into port by a tug, on 24 December.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (SNAE), 1902–04, was {{organised}} {{and led by}} William Speirs Bruce, {{a natural}} scientist and former medical student from the University of Edinburgh. Although overshadowed in prestige terms by Robert Falcon Scott's concurrent Discovery Expedition, the SNAE completed a full programme of exploration and scientific work. Its achievements included {{the establishment of a}} manned <b>meteorological</b> <b>station,</b> the first in Antarctic territory, and the discovery of new land to the east of the Weddell Sea. Its large collection of biological and geological specimens, together with those from Bruce's earlier travels, led to the establishment of the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory in 1906.|$|E

The whole of the {{knowledge}} about the climate in the Kashubian Lake District comes from field research and <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> found in health resorts. Additionally, the Kashubian Lake District has a large variability in weather, which is quite characteristic feature to the region.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, five {{national}} <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> in Anhui province {{are taken}} as typical examples {{to explore the}} effects of local urbanization on their thermal environment by using Landsat data from 1990 to 2010. Satellite-based land use/land cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are used to investigate the effects. The study shows that LULC around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> changed significantly due to urban expansion. Fast urbanization is the main factor that affects the spatial-temporal distribution of thermal environment around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations.</b> Moreover, the normalized LST and NDVI exhibit strong inverse correlations around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> so the variability of LST can be monitored through evaluating the variability of NDVI. In addition, station-relocation {{plays an important role}} in improving representativeness of thermal environment. Notably, the environment representativeness was improved, but when using the data from the station to study climate change, the relocation-induced inhomogeneous data should be considered and adjusted. Consequently, controlling the scale and layout of the urban buildings and constructions around <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> is an effective method to ameliorate observational thermal environment and to improve regional representativeness of station observation. The present work provides observational evidences that high resolution Landsat images can be used to evaluate the thermal environment of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory is a {{historical}} observatory located {{on the grounds of}} the University of Toronto, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The original building was constructed in 1840 as part of a worldwide research project run by Edward Sabine to determine the cause of fluctuations in magnetic declination. Measurements from the Toronto site demonstrated that sunspots were responsible for this effect on Earth's magnetic field. When this project concluded in 1853, the observatory was greatly expanded by the Canadian government and served as the country's primary <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> and official timekeeper for over fifty years. The observatory is considered the birthplace of Canadian astronomy.|$|E
5|$|From September 1895 to June 1896 Bruce {{worked at}} the Ben Nevis summit <b>meteorological</b> <b>station,</b> where he gained further {{experience}} in scientific procedures and with meteorological instruments. In June 1896, again {{on the recommendation of}} Mill, he left this post to join the Jackson–Harmsworth Expedition, then in its third year in the Arctic on Franz Josef Land. This expedition, led by Frederick George Jackson and financed by newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth, had left London in 1894. It was engaged in a detailed survey of the Franz Josef archipelago, which had been discovered, though not properly mapped, during an Austrian expedition 20years earlier. Jackson's party was based at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. It was supplied through regular visits from its expedition ship Windward, on which Bruce sailed from London on 9 June 1896.|$|E
5|$|The college flourished {{during the}} 19th century: the Society of Jesus was re-established in Britain at Stonyhurst in 1803, {{and over the}} century, student numbers rose from the {{original}} twelve migrants from Liège. By {{the turn of the}} following century, it had become England's largest Catholic college. Stonyhurst Hall underwent extensive alterations and additions to accommodate these numbers; the Old South Front was constructed in 1810, only to be demolished and replaced with much grander buildings in the 1880s. A seminary was constructed on the estate, and an observatory and <b>meteorological</b> <b>station</b> erected in the gardens. The 20th century saw the gradual hiring of a mostly lay staff, as the number of Jesuits declined. The seminary at St Mary's Hall was closed, and the school discontinued its education of university-aged philosophers. With the closure of Beaumont College in 1967 and the transfer away from the Society of Jesus of Mount St Mary's College, Spinkhill, Derbyshire, in 2006, Stonyhurst became the sole Jesuit public school in England.|$|E

40|$|Abstract - The {{meteorological}} network in Croatia {{has been operating}} continuously {{since the middle of}} the 19 century. Wars, as signicifant historical events have a tendency to interrupt such continuity. This paper presents a diagram of the <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> network development, since 1850 showing the decrease in the total number of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> during and after World War I, World War II and in the period of aggression on Croatia from 1991 to 1993. The impact of war in the period from 1991 to 1993 is presented in greater detail by a second diagram, showing an evident correlation between actual war activities and the lack of meteorological observations, damage to meteorological equipment and buildings. The horizontal and vertical distribution of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> within the <b>meteorological</b> network is shown for the year when the distribution was in accordance with criteria recomended by The World Meteorological Organization. If we compare the total number of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> on 31 December 1993 with the recommended optimum number of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations,</b> (in accordance with WMO regulations) we can see that only 54. 7 % stations were active. Compared to the total number of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> before the aggression (31 December l 99 O) 3 O. 4 % stations were destroyed or incapacitated from 1991 to the end of 1993 by war activities. The direct damage (destroyed buildings and instruments of the basic {{meteorological network}}) amounts to more than US$ two million. Evidence has been collected from the participants to these events and original reports supplied by the Heads of <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> are quoted. Photographs, diagrams, tables and data from our station catalogues have been used to prepare this article. The period analysed ends on 31 December 1993...|$|R

30|$|Observed daily {{precipitation}} data for 45 <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> {{in the study}} basin is from the National Climate Center of China (NCCC), China Meteorological Administration (CMA). Karl and Knight (1998) {{pointed out that there}} were some errors in precipitation trend analysis if missing data with time dependence were replaced by zero or monthly mean values. In light of this concern, the <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> in the basin were selected based on the length and completeness of precipitation record. If there are more than 10  % days data missing in a year, that year is considered as a data-missing year (Zhai et al. 2005). When the data-missing years at a station are more than 5  years, the station is excluded from the study (Tank and Können 2003).
