Between June and August, the geochemical content of rock glacier outflow {{does not appear to}} differ substantially from that of other surface waters in the Green Lakes Valley. Thus, for this alpine ecosystem {{at this time of year}} there does not appear to be large differences in water quality among rock glacier outflow, glacier and blockslope discharge, and discharge from small alpine catchments. However, in September concentrations of Mg 2 þ in the outflow of the rock glacier increased to more than 900 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1 compared to values of less than 40 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1 at all the other sites, concentrations of Ca 2 þ were greater than 4, 000 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1 compared to maximum values of less than 200 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1 at all other sites, and concentrations of SO 2 4 reached 7, 000 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1, compared to maximum concentrations below 120 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1 at the other sites.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of young allopatric brown trout (Salmo trutta) grouped into YoY (age 0 þ) and older parr (age 1 þ) fish, was studied in acid-sensitive streams in a Norwegian watershed during a 24 -year-period (1987 e 2010). Their abundance {{was assessed by}} electrofishing. Most sites typically had 5. 0 e 5. 5 in pH, 0. 4 e 0. 7 mg L 1 Ca, 10 e 20 mg L 1 inorganic toxic aluminum (Ali) and acid-neutralizing capacity adjusted for organic acids (ANCOAA) of - 15 to þ 25 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1. Densities of both YoY and older parr increased significantly during the study period. Water quality also improved in recent years with respect to pH (5. 8 e 6. 0), Ali (5 e 15 mg L 1) and ANCOAA (10 e 20 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1). However, some negative trends in both fish density and water chemistry were found during both the first (1987 e 1993) and last years (2004 e 2008) of the study. Initially, YoY densities remained at about 16 e 20 specimens 100 m 2 (1987 e 1990), declined to 10 e 15 specimens 100 m 2 in the early/mid 1990 s, and rosed to 30 e 50 specimens 100 m 2 in recent years (1997 e 2010). Their densities correlated significantly with ANCOAA, and at least three stages in the recovery process were recognised: (i) Low density with 10 e 20 specimens 100 m 2 at 18 to 5 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1, (ii) medium and unstable density with 20 e 30 specimens 100 m 2 at 5 to 10 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1, and (iii) increasing density to 40 e 50 specimens 100 m 2 at 10 e 25 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> 1. The decline in brown trout density in the earlymid 1990 s coincided with high sea salt depositions, which caused increased acidification. Component 1 in a PCA explained 51 % {{of the variation in}} fish densities, including conductivity, Mg, Ca, Na, alkalinity and TOC. Component 2 explained an additional 31 % of the variation, including pH, Ali and ANCOAA. Multiple regression analysis coefficients showed that the two components explained 41 % of the variance in total fish density. Young brown trout suffered a high mortality during the initial phase of the study in spite of relative low levels of Ali. This is probabaly because the study streams have very diluted water. The densities of young brown trout have levelled off in recent years, indicating a development towards reaching carrying capacity and hence full recovery. However, still some annual fluctuations in density are recorded, which may be related to an unstable water chemistry...|$|E

40|$|During {{the process}} of {{concentration}} of bile by the gallbladder, water and electrolytes are ab-sorbed, leaving behind bile acids, bilirubin pig-ment, and other substances to which the gall-bladder epithelium is not permeable. It has re-cently been postulated (1) that this resorptive process depends upon a "neutral " ion pump in the gallbladder epithelium that transports sodium, anions, and {{water out of the}} bile into the blood. Hepatic bile is thus progressively converted from a solution in which the major ions are sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and bile acid to concen-trated gallbladder bile, which consists predomi-nantly of sodium and bile acid ions. Bile re-mains isosmotic with the serum during this trans-formation in composition. Since the osmotic co-efficient of sodium bile salt is, on the average, only about 0. 45 (2), the total concentration of ions in concentrated bile must be about twice that of se-rum. Typically, whole bile sodium and bile acid concentrations are of the order of 300 <b>mEq</b> per <b>L</b> each. During this concentrating process, changes also occur in the levels of potassium, which increase from 4 to 5 <b>mEq</b> per <b>L</b> in newly formed hepatic bile to 10 to 14 <b>mEq</b> per <b>L</b> in concentrated gall-bladder bile.

Based on {{an analysis of the}} rate of sodium excre-tion at various sweat rates in adults, evidence (1) has been presented that the sodium concentra-tion of the fluid elaborated by the eccrine secretory coil (secretory fluid) is approximately isotonic to plasma. Hypotonic sweat is produced by reab-sorption of sodium in excess of water by the ec-crine sweat duct. In this paper the sweat sodium concentration and rate of sodium excretion as functions of sweat rate have been studied in normal children and adults and in children and adults with CF to de-termine the reasons for the differences in sweat sodium concentrations in normal adults as com-pared to normal children, and to localize the site of the defect in the sweat gland in CF, i. e., whether the higher sodium concentration is a result of an abnormality of secretion by the coil or reabsorption in the duct.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effect of treated domestic wastewater (TDW) on physical, chemical and microbial properties of three soils. There was no significant change in the sand, silt and clay fractions after 458 days of TDW irrigation. The parameters included soil pH, which remained within moderately alkaline region after 458 days of TDW irrigation. The SAR of A and B soils changed from 3. 27 - 2. 95 and 3. 67 - 2. 15, respectively after 200 days of irrigation. But, the decrease in SAR was less in the same soil when irrigated with TDW continuously for 458 days compared to 200 days due to salt leaching to lower soil depths. The concentration of cations (Na +, K +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) showed significant (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 032) increase after 200 days followed by a significant (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 008) decrease after 458 days of TDW irrigation. The concentrations of Na + in A and B soils decreased with the soil depth except soil C which showed the highest concentration of K as 13. 9 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> - 1 than the control sample as 3. 2 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> - 1 after 200 days of irrigation and at 150 cm soil depth. The K + concentration increased from 0. 2 to 0. 5 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> - 1 and 0. 2 - 0. 8 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> - 1 in A and B soils, respectively. However, at 458 days of irrigation, the K + concentration dropped below, 0. 2 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> - 1 in both samples. The electrical conductivity (EC), sodium absorption ratios (SAR), cations (Na+, K +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) and anions (CO 3 2 ¯, HCO 3 ¯, Cl¯, SO 4 2 ¯) showed similar patterns. But the values of these cations/anions increased after 200 days of irrigation which again dropped below the initial values of soils. The average number of bacteria in soil A, B and C after 200 days and 458 days of TDW irrigation were 99 and 393 cells, 149 and 333 cells and 56 and 559 cells, respectively. In addition to the above, the microbial analysis indicated that E. coli was absent in all the soils irrigated with TDW.

With this view, an effort was made to assess the groundwater quality of a hydrological basin in Bangladesh. Common problems for poor quality irrigation water were cited and the water quality parameter indices determined were precisely evaluated and interpreted. From the analytical result it was observed that the compositions of the groundwater samples were within the permissible range of irrigation use, except an increased Cl- values, responsible for toxicity problem. Standard water quality parameter indices like pH, EC, SAR, SSP, RSBC, KR, PI, MAR and TH were also found within the acceptable range of crop production.

Earlier work in this laboratory suggested that this recipro-cal alteration in the concentration of salivary so-dium and potassium was due predominantly to the simultaneous operation of 1) a fall in the salivary secretion rate and 2) {{an increase in the}} secretion of electrolyte-active adrenal steroids. If suitable al-lowance were made for the effects of variation in the parotid salivary secretion rate and the latency of the response, it was proposed that the salivary Na/K ratio could be used as an index of the re-lease of electrolyte-active steroid into the circula-tion (2 - 5). Cortisol (6), corticosterone (6), and aldosterone (7 - 9) have been identified in sheep adrenal ve-nous blood. In order to obtain a basis for evalu-ating the contribution of each of these components of the adrenal secretion to the fall in parotid sali-vary Na/K ratio observed during different physi-ological states, the effects of these steroids upon salivary Na and K were studied in a series of ex-periments in normal and adrenalectomized sheep.

The fill and drain behavior of SLW leads to long (years to decades) water residence times relative to those in mountain glacier systems. Here, we present the aqueous geochemistry of the SLW water column and pore waters from a 38 -cm-long sediment core. Stable isotopes indicate that the water is primarily sourced from basal-ice melt with a minor contribution from seawater that reaches a maximum of ? 6 % in pore water {{at the bottom of}} the sediment core. Silicate weathering products dominate the crustal (non-seawater) component of lake- and pore-water solutes, and there is evidence for cation exchange processes within the clay-rich lake sediments.

The total deposition of sulfur to the catchment was 164 meq m 2 in 1991, but had declined to 52 meq m 2 by 2000. Although SO 2 emissions in the region declined by 90 % compared to the 1980 s, acidification recovery was small within the period 1990 – 2000.

40|$|A {{considerable}} body {{of evidence}} supports {{the view that the}} bicarbonate diuresis produced by acetazolamide (Diamox®) results from inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity in renal tubular cells (1 - 3). In a preliminary study (4), it was found that this diuresis was reduced if metabolic acidosis was induced prior to the administration of the drug. This phenomenon has subsequently been observed repeatedly in clinical and experi-mental studies (5 - 8). It is now well known that patients with metabolic acidosis do not respond to acetazolamide and that the acidosis resulting from the administration of acetazolamide is an im-portant factor in the development of resistance to continued treatment with this drug (9 - 11). Some workers have found an apparent threshold for acetazolamide activity at plasma bicarbonate levels of approximately 16 <b>mEq.</b> per <b>L.</b> (6).

Other studies have reported marked reduction of aceta-zolamide action in metabolic acidosis but no ab-solute threshold (5).

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{characterized}} {{the changes in}} acid-base equilibrium in dogs exposed over a prolonged period to a 12 per cent carbon dioxide atmosphere (1). Plasma bicarbonate concentra-tion rose in a gradual curvilinear fashion over sev-eral days and became stabilized at maximal levels of 35 to 38 <b>mEq</b> per <b>L.</b> This adaptive response was not influenced by the level of sodium chloride intake. After {{the return of the}} dogs to room air, however, plasma bicarbonate concentration re-mained significantly elevated in dogs ingesting a low-salt diet. The resulting alkalosis persisted until chloride was provided, and then normal acid-base equilibrium was rapidly restored (2). During hypercapnia, the urine remained al-most free of bicarbonate and it was therefore not possible to define fully the effects of hypercapnia on the mechanism for bicarbonate reabsorption; the capacity to reabsorb completely as much as 38 mEq of bicarbonate per L of filtrate may have been rapidly engendered by hypercapnia, but not fully employed for several days because of slow renal generation of bicarbonate. In order to eval-uate further the effect of a high carbon dioxide ten-sion on the renal threshold for bicarbonate, ob-servations have been carried out in dogs whose diets were supplemented with large quantities of sodium bicarbonate. Under these circumstances, the rise in plasma bicarbonate concentration ought not to be limited by renal ability to generate bi-carbonate, but rather by renal reabsorptive ca-pacity.

40|$|The {{syndrome}} {{of inappropriate}} secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is an affectation that causes hyponatremia among other symptoms. Currently {{the family of}} drugs of choice for this syndrome are vaptans, among them the tolvaptan, antagonists of vasopressin. Urea acts as an osmotic diuretic producing sodium retention. We report {{a case in which}} the change from the urea treatment with tolvaptan in SIADH allowed to keep the answer to a much lower cost. Female, 83 years old, was admitted to our hospital as he revealed severe hyponatremia (108 <b>mEq</b> / <b>L)</b> over a scan from a fall at home. Suspecting SIADH during admission was prescribed on three types of treatments: Water restriction and saline for 7 days followed by 15 mg tolvaptan and finally was prescribed 15 grams of urea every 12 hours. Serum sodium levels of patients during the first treatment did not increase enough, so it was changed to tolvaptan, during which serum sodium levels rose to normal ranges. Considering that the treatment would be long-term was changed to urea, during it, the levels of serum sodium had a slight increase. The patient was discharged with the pattern of urea indefinitely.

Hayman, and P. K. Vogt, Cell 11 : 95 – 103, 1977). Two independently maintained sublines of QT 35 {{were found to}} be positive for Marek's disease virus (MDV) -like genes by Southern blotting and PCR assays. Sequence analysis of fragments of the ICP 4, ICP 22, ICP 27, VP 16, meq, pp 14, pp 38, open reading frame (ORF) L 1, and glycoprotein B (gB) genes showed a strong homology with the corresponding fragments of MDV genes. Subsequently, a serotype 1 MDV-like herpesvirus, tentatively name QMDV, was rescued from QT 35 cells in chicken kidney cell (CKC) cultures established from 6 - to 9 -day-old chicks inoculated at 8 days of embryonation with QT 35 cells. Transmission electron microscopy failed to show herpesvirus particles in QT 35 cells, but typical intranuclear herpesvirus particles were detected in CKCs. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the following QMDV transcripts were present in QT 35 cells: sense and antisense <b>meq,</b> ORF <b>L</b> 1, ICP 4, and latency-associated transcripts, which are antisense to ICP 4. A transcript of approximately 4. 5 kb was detected by Northern blotting using total RNA from QT 35 cells. Inoculation of QT 35 cells with herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) -infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) but not with uninfected CEF resulted in the activation of ICP 22, ICP 27, VP 16, pp 38, and gB. In addition, the level of ICP 4 mRNA was increased compared to that in QT 35 cells. The activation by HVT resulted in the production of pp 38 protein.

While the physiological implications of freshwater acidification have been intensively studied in teleost fish and crayfish, much less {{is known about the}} acid-stress physiology of ecologically important groups such as cladoceran zooplankton. This study analyzed the extracellular acid-base state and CO 2 partial pressure (P CO 2), circulation and ventilation, as well as the respiration rate of Daphnia pulex acclimated to acidic (pH 5. 5 and 6. 0) and circumneutral (pH 7. 8) conditions. Results D. pulex had a remarkably high extracellular pH of 8. 33 and extracellular P CO 2 of 0. 56 kPa under normal ambient conditions (pH 7. 8 and normocapnia). The hemolymph had a high bicarbonate concentration of 20. 9 mM and a total buffer value of 51. 5 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> - 1 pH - 1. Bicarbonate covered 93 % of the total buffer value. Acidic conditions induced a slight acidosis (ΔpH = 0. 16 – 0. 23), a 30 – 65 % bicarbonate loss, and elevated systemic activities (tachycardia, hyperventilation, hypermetabolism). pH 6. 0 animals partly compensated the bicarbonate loss by increasing the non-bicarbonate buffer value from 2. 0 to 5. 1 <b>meq</b> <b>L</b> - 1 pH - 1. The extracellular P CO 2 of pH 5. 5 animals was significantly reduced to 0. 33 kPa, and these animals showed the highest tolerance to a short-term exposure to severe acid stress. Conclusion Chronic exposure to acidic conditions had a pervasive impact on Daphnia's physiology including acid-base balance, extracellular P CO 2, circulation and ventilation, and energy metabolism. Compensatory changes in extracellular non-bicarbonate buffering capacity and the improved tolerance to severe acid stress indicated the activation of defense mechanisms which may result from gene-expression mediated adjustments in hemolymph buffer proteins and in epithelial properties. Mechanistic analyses of the interdependence between extracellular acid-base balance and CO 2 transport raised the question of whether a carbonic anhydrase (CA) is involved in the catalysis of the reaction, which led to the discovery of 31 CA-genes in the genome of D. pulex. </p...|$|E

Nosotros evaluamos la relación entre administración de Custodiol y cambios en el sodio y osmolalidad plasmática del paciente llevado a cirugía cardiaca. Introduction: Hyponatremia and {{osmolality}} disorders {{have been}} identified as independent predictors of increased morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay in patients after cardiac surgery. Administration of Custodiol for myocardial protection may alter serum sodium levels and thereby alter the effective plasma osmolality. We evaluated the relationship between administration of Custodiol, and the fluctuation of sodium concentration and plasma osmolality in heart surgery patients. Methods: In this retrospective analysis we reviewed 91 patients who underwent cardiac surgery from 2013 to 2014 in the Fundación Cardioinfantil. Custodiol was administered to all patients. Sodium levels were analyzed and effective plasma osmolality was calculated before, during and after the surgical procedure. Results: All patients were normonatremic at start of surgery. 93. 47 % of patients developed hyponatremia after administering Custodiol with a significant decrease in mean serum sodium 12. 43 mEq/l (P < 0. 001). Upon completion of the surgical procedure average effective plasma osmolality was 278. 47 ± 8. 11 mOsm/L (median= 278) and the mean serum sodium was 135. 35 ± 4. 18 <b>mEq</b> / <b>L</b> (median= 135). Presenting a significant difference before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (p< 0. 001, repeated measures ANOVA Friedman, CM).

40|$|This {{study shows}} that diatom {{sediment}} records {{can be used to}} investigate the long-term inorganic carbon dynamics in oligotrophic and poorly acid-buffered lakes. Using a training set of 115 high-mountain lakes in the Pyrenees, we found that both alkalinity and potential hydrogen (pH) independently explained some of the variability in diatom assemblages. Transfer functions for both variables were developed and applied to a Holocene record from Lake Redon and CO 2 changes calculated. CO 2 saturation broadly followed alkalinity, which in turn was related to summer and autumn air-temperature fluctuations. In general, warmer climate during the ice-free period led to higher supersaturation, due to increased alkalinity, which facilitated retention of CO 2 from respiration, and decreased primary production (assessed by diatom fluxes). Only during the early Holocene, there were periods of extreme undersaturation, corresponding to cold periods of low alkalinity (, 20 micro-equivalents per liter [meq L 21]), and suggesting carbon limitation of primary production. The winter and spring climate, which determines the ice cover duration, appears to be relevant for CO 2 saturation only during periods when the organic-matter content of the sediments was low (, 22 %). Longer periods of ice cover led to lower lake CO 2 saturation, suggesting that the ice cover influence on internal nutrient loading may regulate lake productivity fluctuations under low allocthonous nutrient and organic-matter inputs.
