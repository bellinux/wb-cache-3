40|$|After harvest, <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> fruits show high {{deterioration}} rates when improperly preserved. A {{possible cause}} {{is the high}} fruit water content favoring enzymatic and microbiological degradation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of drying on the mesocarp oil quality during storage and to set the drying curve of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> fruits. For that, two experiments were carried out. In the first, the drying curve of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> fruits was determined at 60 °C, and mathematical models were defined for the process. Drying was performed with freshly harvested fruits (S 0) and with fruits stored for 20 days after harvest (S 20). Fruits were stored for 20 days after harvested and then went through drying. The fruits were dried in a prototype dryer at 60 °C. After drying, the fruits were stored for different periods (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 days) and evaluated for oil physicochemical parameters. When compared to S 0, drying of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> fruits in the S 20 treatment showed a lower drying time until equilibrium moisture was reached. In general, all the mathematical models tested were adequate to describe the drying process. Fruits dried at 60 °C controlled mesocarp oil acidification for up to 90 days in storage. On the other hand, drying impaired the mesocarp oil oxidative stability. We may conclude that the drying process is efficient to maintain acidity during the storage of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> fruits...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of biomass}} for energy {{purposes}} has been highlighted in {{as a way}} to reduce dependence on non- renewable energy sources. <b>Macaw</b> <b>palm,</b> Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.)

The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> residues after the fruit processing to evaluate its use “in natura” and as charcoal. The endocarp showed higher fixed carbon content, heating value and bulk density compared with other residues and lower ashes content. The heating value of endocarp charcoal was the highest, whereas the volatile matter levels of epicarp charcoal showed higher results.

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> crop {{has been}} studied because of its {{bioenergy}} potential due to the high oil yield, which is linked to fruit maturity stage. Digital images have been adopted as a contactless way to obtain information about fruit surface area and volume, acting as a sensor for quality control and the classification of fruits, based on physical aspects during the maturation stage. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the volume of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> fruits from digital models obtained by the Moiré technique using only one camera, associated with digital image-processing tools to unwarp the images, allowing the comparison with conventional methods. The volumes obtained by the Moiré technique were compared with those obtained by water displacement method (WDM) and millet-seed displacement method (SDM). The results show that the volumes measured by the Moiré technique exhibited a mean error of 13. 54 % compared with the SDM, and 11. 09 % when compared to WDM, which indicates that the digital Moiré technique is a robust, low-cost tool to measure the volume of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> fruits...|$|E

50|$|Capuchins are {{considered}} the most intelligent New World monkeys and are often used in laboratories. The tufted capuchin is especially noted for its long-term tool usage, {{one of the few}} examples of primate tool use other than by apes. Upon seeing <b>macaws</b> eating <b>palm</b> nuts, cracking them open with their beaks, these capuchins will select a few of the ripest fruits, nip off the tip of the fruit and drink down the juice, then seemingly discard the rest of the fruit with the nut inside. When these discarded fruits have hardened and become slightly brittle, the capuchins will gather them up again and take them to a large flat boulder where they have previously gathered a few river stones from up to a mile away. They will then use these stones, some of them weighing as much as the monkeys, to crack open the fruit to get to the nut inside. Young capuchins will watch this process to learn from the older, more experienced adults but it takes them 8 years to master this. The learning behavior of capuchins has been demonstrated to be directly linked to a reward rather than curiosity.|$|R
5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} <b>macaw</b> and the <b>palm</b> cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|R
40|$|The {{fruit of}} the native <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> [Acrocomia aculeata (lacq) Lood. ex Mart] is an {{alternative}} for biodiesel production because of the plant characteristics, {{as well as its}} adaptability, hardiness and high vegetable oil yield. However, its exploitation remains extractive and there are significant difficulties in its harvest. This study aimed to determine the mechanical properties of the <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> fruit-rachilla system that will support the design of harvest machines based on mechanical vibration. Ten samples of four accessions in the immature and mature stages of maturity were used. Traction and vibration tests were conducted to determine the mechanical properties of the <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> fruit-rachilla system. The elastic modulus of the rachilla was 188. 39 - 385. 09 MPa for the immature stage and 109. 02 - 320. 54 MPa for the mature stage. The Poisson's ratio for the rachilla varied between 0. 20 and 0. 52 for the immature stage and between 0. 16 and 0. 52 for the mature stage.

40|$|Objetivou-se com este estudo avaliar a qualidade fisiológica de embriões de macaúba [Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lood. Ex Mart. ] e babaçu (Orbignya phalerata Mart.) em função da velocidade de secagem, a fim de otimizar o processo de secagem já existente, bem como, propor uma metodologia mais eficiente para o estabelecimento {{in vitro}} de macaúba e babaçu. Verificou-se que para as duas espécies em estudo, a temperatura de 37 ± 2 °C promoveu perda de água {{inferior}} a de 57 ± 2 °C. Entretanto, foi mais eficiente pelo fato de não inviabilizar os embriões durante esse processo, garantindo elevadas taxas de germinação, mesmo em sementes com teor de água de 9 % para o babaçu e de 19 % para a macaúba. A adoção do teste de tetrazólio proposto inicialmente para macaúba, que utiliza o sal a 0, 5 % e embebição por 4 horas, permitiu a distinção de diferentes classes de vigor também no babaçu. A secagem a 37 °C favoreceu a extração de sementes intactas e, consequentemente, remoção do embrião, para cultura in vitro de macaúba. Não se verificou diferença na germinação in vitro de embriões extraídos de frutos com diferentes cores do epicarpo, que foi abordado como diferentes classes de maturação de macaúba. A germinação in vitro dos embriões foi favorecida com o acréscimo de sacarose no meio de cultivo de 30 a 40 g L- 1. Dessa forma, verifica-se que a secagem dos frutos de macaúba e babaçu a 37 °C garante efetividade no processo, visto que, permite melhor extração das sementes e embriões, com isso, são alcançadas elevadas taxas de germinação in vitro em até 60 dias, encurtando muito o tempo de produção da muda. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the physiological quality of embryos of babassu (Orbignya phalerata Mart.) and <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> [Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lood. Ex Mart. ] according to the drying speed in order to optimize the already existing drying process as well as to propose a more efficient method for the in vitro establishment of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> and babassu. It was observed that for both species under study, the temperature of 37 ± 2 °C promoted loss of water less than 57 ± 2 °C. However, it was more efficient because it did not inhibit the embryo during this process, ensuring high germination rates, even in seeds with 9 % of water content for babassu and 19 % for <b>macaw</b> <b>palm.</b> The adoption of the tetrazolium test, initially proposed for <b>macaw</b> <b>palm,</b> which uses salt at 0. 5 % and imbibition for 4 hours, allowed to distinguish different classes of vigor also in the babassu. Drying at 37 °C favored the extraction of intact seeds and consequently the removal of embryo for in vitro culture of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm.</b> There was no difference in the in vitro germination of embryos extracted from fruit with different colors of the epicarp, which was approached as different maturity classes of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm.</b> The in vitro germination of embryos was enhanced with the addition of 30 - 40 g L- 1 sucrose in the culture medium. Thus, it is found that drying the fruit of babassu and <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> at 37 °C ensures effectiveness in the process, since it allows better extraction of seeds or embryos which enable to achieve high in vitro germination rate within 60 days, making the time for production of seedlings much shorter...|$|E

On the basis of radiographs, D. T. Holyoak claimed that the mandible of the broad-billed parrot was weakly constructed and suggested {{that it would have}} fed on soft fruits rather than hard seeds. As evidence, he pointed out that the internal trabeculae were widely spaced, that the upper bill was broad whereas the palatines were narrow, and the fact that no preserved upper rostrum had been discovered, which he attributed to its delicateness. G. A. Smith, however, pointed out that the four genera Holyoak used as examples of [...] "strong jawed" [...] parrots based on radiographs, Cyanorhamphus, Melopsittacus, Neophema and Psephotus, actually have weak jaws in life, and that the morphologies cited by Holyoak do not indicate strength. Hume has since pointed out that the mandible morphology of the broad-billed parrot is comparable to that of the largest living parrot, the hyacinth macaw, which cracks open palm nuts with ease. It is therefore probable that the broad-billed parrot fed in the same manner.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Reserve {{mobilization}} in seeds occurs after visible germination, {{which is}} marked by the protrusion of the radicle or cotyledonary petiole, as in species of Arecaceae. Acrocomia aculeata (<b>macaw</b> <b>palm),</b> usually produces hard seeds whose endosperm has mannan-rich cell walls. We investigated the composition of storage compounds in <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> seed and the roles of two enzymes (endo-&# 946;-mannanase, &# 945;-galactosidase) during and after germination. The seeds were firstly submitted to pre-established protocol to overcome dormancy and promote germination. Enzyme activity in both embryo and endosperm were assayed from the initiation of germinative activities until leaf sheath appearance, {{and the status of}} seed structures and reserve compounds were evaluated. Protein content of the embryo decreased with the initiation of imbibition while the lipid content began decreasing six days after removal of the operculum. Increases in enzyme activity and starch content were both observed after visible germination. We suggest that endo-&# 946;-mannanase and &# 945;-galactosidase become active immediately at germination, facilitating haustorium expansion and providing carbohydrates for initial seedling development. Protein is the first storage compound mobilized during early imbibition, and the observed increase in the starch content of the haustorium was related to lipid degradation in that organ and mannan degradation in the adjacent endosperm...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Fire is an abiotic {{disturbance}} {{that regulates}} vegetation structure and biodiversity. Some plant species {{have adapted to}} fire prone environments by evolving protective structures. Acrocomia aculeata (<b>macaw</b> <b>palm)</b> is widely distributed throughout tropical America, and is found in environments continuously influenced by anthropogenic fire. We aimed {{to determine whether the}} fruit characteristics of A. aculeata enable seeds to resist the effects of fire and also the consequent effects of fire on fruit biometric traits and embryo viability. After a fire event in a region of pasture-forest transition, we marked 30 individuals of A. aculeata. The trees were separated by UPGMA analysis into 5 groups according to fire exposure, ranging from trees with no exposure to trees with fruit completely exposed to fire. Fruit exposure to high temperatures led to lower values in fruit fresh weight, length, density, and processable mass. Fire had no significant effect on seed biometric variables, because of the structures of the fruit, including its lignified endocarp and its insulating and mucilaginous mesocarp. These structures helped to maintain the embryos viability by preventing oxidative damage. In conclusion, the fruit structure of the <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> may facilitate seed persistence, even when subject to increasingly frequent fire events...|$|E
40|$|The <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> is a {{tropical}} palm with significant potential for biofuel production; however, seed dormancy {{is a major}} factor limiting its agro-industrial use. The present study evaluated the effects of phytoregulators in overcoming <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> seed dormancy. We evaluated the effects of immersion in solutions of gibberellic acid (GA 3) (0, 2000 and 5000 mg L- 1) during two exposure times (24 and 48 hours), associated with the removal or maintenance of the opercular tegument, as well as the effects of the associations between GA 3 (2000 mg L- 1), indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) and benzylaminopurine (BAP) and the effects of repeated applications (one, two or five) of combinations of these phytoregulators. The seeds were sown in vermiculite and incubated in a humid growth chamber at 95 ± 5 % relative humidity and 30 °C for 18 weeks in all experiments. GA 3 application and removal of the opercular tegument had positive effects on germination, but no significant differences were observed in immersion times for this phytoregulator.

This study evaluated the response of three genotypes of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> to increasing rates of nitrogen and potassium, grown in the field until the 2 nd year and to establish reference contents of mineral nutrients in the leaf. The experiment was a split-plot randomized block design with five main treatments (N and K rates) and three secondary treatments (genotypes), with three replications, each plot containing three plants. Plant height, leaf number, vigor, and nutrient contents in leaf tissues were evaluated {{at the end of}} 2 nd year of cultivation. Differential responses were observed among genotypes, indicating that some genotypes are more efficient in the use of mineral inputs. There was a differentiated and positive response to increasing side-dressed N and K rates in the vegetative development of macaw genotypes until the 2 nd year of field cultivation, indicating variability in the species in terms of nutrient use efficiency. The N and K fertilization rate corresponding to 360 g N + 480 g K 2 O per plant, in four split applications over the two years of cultivation, was insufficient to induce maximum vegetative development in the three macaw genotypes.

The present study evaluated the relationship between the biological activity measured by the optical technique of biospeckle laser and firmness, measured in the Acrocomia aculeata fruit pulp between the 41 st and 61 st week after flowering. The biological activity was quantified by biospeckle images, while the fruit pulp firmness was determined by digital penetrometer. Correlations between variables were evaluated during maturation and in the senescence of fruits. According to the results, significant correlation between biological activity and firmness was found for both evaluated conditions, demonstrating that biospeckle laser can be an effective non-invasive indicator of Acrocomia aculeate fruit maturation assisting in the determination of the moment of harvest...|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the {{pericarp}} of the <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> (Acrocomia aculeata) was followed during development. Ovaries of flowers collected at anthesis of the bracts as well as pericarps were evaluated at different development phases using traditional plant anatomy techniques. The ovary wall has two meristematic regions, one adjacent to the external epidermis and the other surrounding the seminal cavity. The external meristematic region {{gives rise to the}} woody exocarp, and the internal meristematic region is responsible for thickening of the oily/fibrous mesocarp as well as the hard endocarp. Sclerification of the exocarp and endocarp occurs approximately 70 days after anthesis and defines the final fruit volume. Lignification of the exocarp cell layers is incomplete, lending porosity to the structure. Numerous canals develop in the mesocarp that are formed by the fusion of raphide-containing idioblasts. Lignification of the sclereids and their generally random arrangement confers impermeability and rigidity to the endocarp. In mature fruits, lipidic reserves are observed in parenchymatic cells of the mesocarp, and the germination pore in the endocarp is composed of parenchymatic cells...|$|E

The effect of imbibition speed (fast or slow) and different concentrations of gibberellic acid (0, 100 or 200 mg L- 1) on the germination percentage and index of germination velocity were evaluated during a third trial. Mechanical scarification to remove the seed tegument in the hilum region enhanced the germination of the seeds in the germination chamber and seedling emergence in the greenhouse, and this type of scarification should be recommended for breaking dormancy in this species.

40|$|<b>Macaw</b> <b>palm</b> (Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart.) is a {{tropical}} species with multiple uses, including oil supply for biodiesel production. However, structural and physiological {{studies of the}} seed are still scarce, {{as well as in}} vitro propagation techniques. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the anatomy, histochemistry and ultrastructure of the seed and the in vitro somatic embryo of A. aculeata, gaining insight into relationships between the post-harvest seed behavior and the somatic embryo conversion to plant. The zygotic embryo and the endosperm show high quantities of protein and lipids, stored in protein and lipid bodies, respectively. The cell wall storage polysaccharides occur in the thickened cell wall of the endosperm. The absence of vacuoles and the few organelles, except for the storage ones, indicate low metabolic state of the zygotic embryo, which suggests a orthodox behavior of the seed at maturity. The somatic embryo shows a shoot meristem with few leaf primordia, vacuolated cells and, occasionally, amyloplasts, but not lipid or protein reserves. These characteristics, common in somatic embryogenesis, could be associated with the maturation phase, and, consequently, with the low conversion of these embryos into plants...|$|E

The aim of this work was to characterize and study the genetic diversity of A. aculeata ex situ collections from different geographical states in Brazil using microsatellite (Simple Sequence Repeats, SSR) markers. A total of 192 accessions from 10 provenances were analyzed with 10 SSR, and variations were detected in allelic diversity, polymorphism, and heterozygosity in the collections. Three major groups of accessions were formed using PCoA—principal coordinate analysis, UPGMA—unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean, and Tocher. The Mantel test revealed a weak correlation (r = 0. 07) between genetic and geographic distances among the provenances reaffirming {{the result of the}} grouping. Reduced average heterozygosity (Ho 0) per locus (or per provenance). AMOVA—Analysis of Molecular Variance revealed higher (48. 2 %) genetic variation within population than among populations (36. 5 %).

To assess water absorption with or without the opercular tegument (OT), seeds were immersed in water for 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 240, 360, 480 and 720 hours and the water content of isolated embryos and seeds was determined. In seeds with or without OT, gibberellic acid (GA 3) solutions at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg. L- 1 were applied on the OT region using a culture medium. In another experiment, the OT was removed or left intact and the seeds immersed in hydrogen cyanamide solutions (0, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2 and 2. 5 %). The percentage germination, germination speed index (GSI) and percentage dead seeds were determined. The OT does not prevent embryo water uptake but reduces water absorption speed. The use of GA 3 in a culture medium applied to the OT region did not effectively release dormancy. The use of cyanamide at these concentrations increased seed mortality, resulting in a low germination. OT removal increased the GSI...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as a prime feed stock for biodiesel industries in the near future coming decades. However, there are no machines for harvesting and detaching fruits in the biofuel industry; hence, the study of the dynamic behavior of the fruit-rachilla system would aid in the development of such machines. Thus, this study seeks to determine the modulus of elasticity and the damping ratio of four different plant accessions obtained from the Active Germplasm Bank of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV). Tensile testing was conducted to determine the modulus of elasticity. From the graphical results of tension versus specific strain, it was possible to determine the modulus of elasticity by using the tangent method. To determine the damping ratio, the logarithmic decrement method was performed using vibration testing. Vibration test consisted of a generated impulse of 100 % of the amplitude of acceleration that was used to excite the system. The acquisition of the generated information was performed by a piezoelectric accelerometer. The average modulus of elasticity ranged from 2. 22 to 3. 17 MPa, and the average damping ratios ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 08. Thus, the macaw fruit-rachilla was an under-damped system...|$|E
40|$|In {{line with}} the social {{objectives}} of the PNPB (Brazilian Program of Production and Use of Biodiesel) and its “Social Seal” Framework, PETROBRAS {{has set up a}} 57 million liter/year biodiesel plant in the semi‐arid region of North of Minas Gerais State, where the socioeconomics indicators are very unfavorable. Despite the potential to boost the agricultural and agro‐industrial sector, the biodiesel plant is using mainly soybean oil from other regions. Funded by the Minas Gerais Government, the ongoing project aims to {{contribute to the development of}} oilseed supply chain in the North of Minas Gerais. To deal with these socioeconomic complex decisions, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used. Organization models were proposed for the following production chain: i) castor seed, ii) jatropha, iii) sunflower seed, iv) cotton seed, v) <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> and vi) soybean. For each chain, investment alternatives were analysed using the software BiodieselFAO. The organizational models and economic results will be discussed with the stakeholder in a workshop, when the alternatives will be selected. Partial results of the project demonstrate that the lack of trust between the stakeholders is the main challenge to the organization of the production chains. The AHP methodology has been proved to be adequate to accomplish the project objectives. Further researches on production chain modeling and building are, especially for the bioenergy sector, highly opportune. biodiesel, oil extraction, AHP, North of Minas, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management, Financial Economics, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Production Economics, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of habitat {{fragmentation}} is a fundamental yet complicated aim of many ecological studies. Beni savanna is a naturally fragmented forest habitat, where forest islands exhibit variation in resources and threats. To understand how the availability of resources and threats affect the use of forest islands by parrots, we applied occupancy modeling to quantify use and detection probabilities for 12 parrot species on 60 forest islands. The presence of urucuri (Attalea phalerata) and macaw (Acrocomia aculeata) palms, the number of tree cavities on the islands, {{and the presence of}} selective logging,and fire were included as covariates associated with availability of resources and threats. The model-selection analysis indicated that both resources and threats variables explained the use of forest islands by parrots. For most species, the best models confirmed predictions. The number of cavities was positively associated with use of forest islands by 11 species. The area of the island and the presence of <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> showed a positive association with the probability of use by seven and five species, respectively, while selective logging and fire showed a negative association with five and six species, respectively. The Blue-throated Macaw (Ara glaucogularis), the critically endangered parrot species endemic to our study area, was the only species that showed a negative association with both threats. Monitoring continues to be essential to evaluate conservation and management actions of parrot populations. Understanding of how species are using this natural fragmented habitat will help determine which fragments should be preserved and which conservation actions are needed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Macauba palm {{stands out}} for having {{favorable}} features to biodiesel production {{such as the}} high oil content of its fruit. Considering the great potential of the species and their applicability in the renewable energy field, it becomes indispensable to establish the right conditions for storing the seeds for propagation purpose. The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of seed moisture content, packaging, and storage conditions such as temperature and relative humidity on the quality of seeds from Minas Gerais State, during a 12 -month storage period. The research had two independent assays: (I) the seeds were stored with three moisture contents/ranges 4. 0 &# 8804; 6. 0 %; 6. 0 &# 8804; 8. 0 % and 8. 0 &# 8804; 10. 0 % in impermeable packages, under room temperature and at 10 ºC; (II) seeds with approximately 5. 9 % of moisture content were stored in three different types of packages: a) permeable, b) semi-permeable and c) impermeable. Three storing conditions were tested: a) room temperature and RH under laboratory conditions; b) 15 ºC and 45 % RH; c) 20 ºC and 55 % RH. Water content, germination rate and germination speed index were evaluated at 0, 4, 8 and 12 months of storing. The best germination results were obtained with the moisture range of 6. 0 &# 8804; 8. 0 %, with seeds kept at room temperature; while the seeds stored at 10 ºC, regardless the moisture range, did not survive. The stored seeds with 5. 9 % moisture content and at both 15 ºC/ 45 %RH and 20 ºC/ 55 % RH conditions, independently of the package type used, showed the best results. Thus, <b>macaw</b> <b>palm</b> seeds can be classified as intermediates seeds...|$|E
