25|$|While PMS {{is linked}} to the luteal phase, the causes of PMS are not clear, but several factors may be involved. Changes in hormones during the menstrual cycle seem to be an {{important}} factor; changing hormone levels affect some women more than others. Chemical changes in the brain, stress, and emotional problems, such as depression, do not seem to cause PMS but they may <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse.</b> Low levels of vitamins and minerals, high sodium, alcohol, and/or caffeine can exacerbate symptoms such as water retention and bloating. PMS occurs more often in women who are between their late 20s and early 40s; have at least 1 child; {{have a family history of}} depression; and have a past medical history of either postpartum depression or a mood disorder.|$|E
25|$|In late 2008, Krugman {{published}} a substantial updating {{of an earlier}} work, entitled The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008. In the book, he discusses {{the failure of the}} United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published End This Depression Now!, a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy – people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{when war}} was declared, Genghis sent orders for a force already {{out to the}} west to {{immediately}} cross the Tien Shan mountains {{to the south and}} ravage the fertile Ferghana Valley {{in the eastern part of}} the Khwarezm Empire. This smaller detachment, no more than 20-30,000 men, was led by Genghis's son Jochi and his elite general Jebe. The Tien Shan mountain passes were much more treacherous than the Dzungarian Gate, and to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse,</b> they attempted the crossing in the middle of winter with 5+ feet of snow. Though the Mongols suffered losses and were exhausted from the crossing, their presence in the Ferghana Valley stunned the Khwarezm leadership and permanently stole the initiative away. This march can be described as the Central Asian equivalent of Hannibal's crossing of the Alps, with the same devastating effects. Because the Shah did not know if this Mongol army was a diversion or their main army, he had to protect one of his most fertile regions with force. Therefore, the Shah dispatched his elite cavalry reserve, which prevented him from effectively marching anywhere else with his main army. Jebe and Jochi seem to have kept their army in good shape while plundering the valley, and they avoided defeat by a much superior force. At this point the Mongols split up and again maneuvered over the mountains: Jebe marched further south deeper into Khwarezm territory, while Jochi took most of the force northwest to attack the exposed cities on the Syr Darya from the east.|$|E

500|$|Like the show, The Stick of Truth satirizes {{political}} and social issues including abortion, race relations, anal probes, drug addiction, sex, extreme violence, and poverty. Creative consultant Jordan Thomas said, [...] "The way we looked at [...] was if this moment was a hot button for the audience, should we <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse,</b> because [...] love to push boundaries and their default response was definitely not to back down, but the really healthy counterbalance was, can we make it funnierand the answer was often yes".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{stated that}} Moore [...] "has the {{superficial}} attributes for the job: The urbanity, the quizzically raised eyebrow, the calm under fire and in bed". However, {{he felt that}} Moore wasn't satisfactory in living up to the legacy left by Sean Connery in the preceding films. He rated the villains [...] "a little banal", adding that the film [...] "doesn't have a Bond villain worthy of the Goldfingers, Dr. Nos and Oddjobs of the past." [...] Chris Nashawaty similarly argues that Dr. Kananga/Mr. Big is the worst villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films. BBC Films reviewer William Mager praised the use of locations, but said that the plot was [...] "convoluted". He stated that [...] "Connery and Lazenby had an air of concealed thuggishness, clenched fists at the ready, but in Moore's case a sardonic quip and a raised eyebrow are his deadliest weapons". Reviewer Leonard Maltin rated the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "barely memorable, overlong James Bond movie" [...] that [...] "seems merely an excuse to film wild chase sequences". Danny Peary noted that Jane Seymour portrays [...] "one of the Bond series's most beautiful heroines" [...] but had little praise for Moore, whom he described as making [...] "an unimpressive debut as James Bond in Tom Mankiewicz's unimaginative adaptation of Ian Fleming's second novel…The movie stumbles along most of the way. It's hard to remember Moore is playing Bond at times – in fact, if he and Seymour were black, the picture could pass as one of the black exploitation films of the day. There are few interesting action sequences – a motorboat chase is trite enough to begin with, but the filmmakers <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse</b> by throwing in some stupid Louisiana cops, including pot-bellied Sheriff Pepper." ...|$|E

"To <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse,</b> {{the word}} 'intersex' began to attract {{individuals}} who are not necessarily intersex, but feel that they might be, because they are queer or trans. Many of these people felt that to be intersex meant a social and biological justification for being who they are, as in it's okay that you're queer or trans because they were literally 'born that way.' This obviously clashes {{with the majority of}} people born with intersex conditions, who despite their intersex bodies feel that they are perfectly ordinary heterosexual, non-trans men and women." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hermann Burchardt, a 19th-century German {{explorer}} and photographer, {{surmised that}} the Pirate Coast deserved its designation, {{and goes on}} to claim that piracy was the main occupation of the inhabitants who were infamous for their fanatacism and bloodthirstiness. A British customs official named John Malcolm who served in the Persian Gulf area from the 18th century to the 19th century wrote that when he questioned an Arab servant named Khudádád about the Jawasmi (the main pirate tribe in the Persian Gulf), Khudádád professed that [...] "their occupation is piracy, and their delight murder; and to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse,</b> they give you the most pious reasons for every villainy they commit".|$|E
2500|$|Current U.S. {{policy is}} not working, {{as the level of}} {{violence}} in Iraq is rising and the government is not advancing national reconciliation. Making no changes in policy would simply delay the day of reckoning at a high cost. Nearly 100 Americans are dying every month. The United States is spending $2 billion a week. Our ability to respond to other international crises is constrained. A majority of the American people are soured on the war. This level of expense is not sustainable over an extended period, especially when progress is not being made. The longer the United States remains in Iraq without progress, the more resentment will grow among Iraqis who believe they are subjects of a repressive American occupation. As one U.S. official said to us, [...] "Our leaving would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>worse.</b> ... The current approach without modification will not make it better." ...|$|E
