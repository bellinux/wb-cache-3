40|$|Historically, {{the mining}} {{industry}} {{has had a}} high incidence of work related injury and disease, and of disasters involving multiple fatalities. It also faces OHS challenges far exceeding those confronting most other industry sectors. Mine safety legislation can {{play an important role in}} meeting those challenges. Although regulation is never likely to be the entire answer, good regulation not only brings laggards up to a minimum legal standard, it also encourages, rewards and facilitates leaders in going beyond them. Bad regulation, in contrast, constrains good enterprises from taking the initiative to improve OHS, while failing to deter bad ones. This book describes mine safety legislation in the “mining states” and analyses its strengths and weaknesses. It also examines the broader policy questions of how best to design, implement and enforce mine safety regulation. It argues that substantial reform will be necessary not only in setting standards, but also in their implementation, if further OHS improvements are to be achieved. This implies substantial changes in the way the <b>mine</b> safety <b>inspectorates</b> go about their tasks: in how they administer and enforce the law; and in the circumstances in which they choose to prosecute. It also requires the nurturing of a degree of trust between employers and workers (individually and collectively) and between both these parties and the <b>mines</b> <b>inspectorates,</b> that has been substantially lacking in recent years...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Kaapvaal Craton in South Africa hosts one of {{the largest}} gold placer {{deposits}} in the world. Mining in the Witwatersrand Basin here has been the source of about one third to one half of the gold ever produced in the world. Gold was discovered in the Johannesburg area in 1886 and after 120 years of continuous operation, mining is currently approaching depths of 4 000 m. In spite of the challenges and risks that the industry has had to deal with including rock temperature, ventilation and water, {{one of the}} most feared hazards in the basin has been the threat from the ongoing occurrence of seismicity and rockbursts. The problem first manifested itself by way of the occurrence of tremors roughly twenty years after the commencement of mining operations. This paper traces the history of the approach to rockbursts and seismicity during the 120 year history of mining in the basin. It portrays a picture of the mining seismicity in terms of monitoring phases, mechanisms and mitigation strategies. The work of research organizations over the years is highlighted with a brief mention of current regulation strategies {{on the part of the}} <b>mining</b> <b>inspectorate...</b>|$|R

30|$|Testimony of {{this kind}} about the scale of {{informal}} extraction from the private mines could easily be multiplied. In part, these moneys were used to fund legitimate state activities. Shenmu and Fugu in particular ploughed large sums raised through “donations” into providing free {{health care and education}} for local residents as well as social security payments. But it seems that often these ad-hoc levies on mine owners were used for what may be best described as conspicuous government consumption. When the Linfen City Public Security Bureau wanted to construct a new administrative building, it sent its staff out to collect fines from coal bosses. Everyone was given a collection target, including staff from offices entirely unrelated to mining. Over RMB 100 million was thus raised. Collection of fines was only reigned in after someone deposited a package of explosives in the Bureau’s courtyard (Oriental Outlook, 2008). In 2003 in Xingren County, Guizhou, the county head financed a large cultural festival with “voluntary” donations from mines (Southern Metropolis Daily 2006), while back in Linfen Prefecture, a county head obliged local mines to “donate” up to several million yuan each to finance the construction of a replica of Tian’anmen Square as well as what is apparently the world’s tallest ceremonial gate complex. Extraction by individual officials proceeded in similar ways. Much probably took place through bribes, especially when licenses had to be obtained or renewed, or in the context of “handling” mine accidents. Thus, the former Head of the Henan Coal <b>Mine</b> Safety <b>Inspectorate</b> amassed at least RMB 19 million in bribes over an 8 -year period in the mid- 2000 s (Caixin Online 2010).

40|$|In {{construction}} industries, blasting is the predominate {{method for}} fragmentation {{when dealing with}} protruded rock. The issue of fly-rock {{is critical to the}} operation of all sites that employ this method especially if it is near to highly sensitive or populated area. This paper takes a risk-based approach to identifying, analysis and managing the fly-rock hazard. The outcomes of the boulder blast should not be underestimated as the fly-rock hazard is less predictable than the primary blasting. A study in the United Kingdom <b>mines</b> and quarries <b>inspectorate</b> (2007) revealed that more than 80 percent of incidents were associated with this type of blasting. The basic cause of fly-rock generation is mismatch between the energy available and the work to be done. This mismatch can be caused by an abrupt decrease in rock resistance (geological weakness), overcharging, inappropriate blast design and inaccurate drilling. In this study, 6 cases of actual blasting operation and their effect of throw due to the amount of explosive used to break a certain volume of rock (powder factor) is examined. A range of various amount of powder factor and distance of throw from initial position of blast are presented. It can be concluded that the wild fly-rock risk can be controlled by managing the powder factor for a given blasting situation...|$|R
40|$|The {{mortality}} {{patterns of}} United Kingdom tin miners {{were examined in}} relation to calendar period and duration of underground work with particular attention to lung cancer and exposure to radon. Subjects were all men {{who had worked for}} at least one year between 1941 and 1984 at one of two United Kingdom tin mines and for whom a complete work history could be constructed from mine records. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using national (England and Wales) rates. The pattern of SMRs in relation to potential explanatory variables was analysed using Poisson regression methods. Mortalities from lung cancer and silicosis (including silicotuberculosis) were significantly raised and showed a significant relation with duration of underground work (mortality from stomach cancer was raised in both underground and surface workers, but not significantly). Excess mortality from silica related disease declined steeply from 35 % among workers first exposed before 1920 to 1 % among those first exposed after 1950. Thirteen surface workers with known exposure to arsenic had high rates of lung and stomach cancer. The SMR for lung cancer showed a consistent pattern in relation to duration of underground exposure, rising from 83 (observed/expected = 8 / 9. 6) for surface workers (without exposure to arsenic) to 447 (15 / 3. 4) for workers with more than 30 years underground exposure. Examination of the SMR for lung cancer by total underground exposure, age, and time since last exposure gave rise to a model for the expression of risk which depends only on total exposure and time since exposure. The fitted model implies that the effect of exposure to radon in a given year has no effect on risk for 10 years, then rapidly rises to a maximum from which the excess risk then declines, halving every 4. 3 years. There were no direct measurements of historic radon levels. A conservative estimate based on measurements taken since 1969 by the National Radiological Protection Board and the <b>Mines</b> and Quarries <b>Inspectorate</b> is that the annual dose to an underground worker was about 10 working level months (WLM). Given this assumption, the risk/exposure slope implied by the present data, and the model fitted to it, was somewhat lower than that given in the fourth Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionisation Radiation (BEIR IV) report (about 40 % lower for lifetime exposures). The present data also imply different risks depending on the age at exposure, with relatively higher lifetime risks for exposure at older ages, and relatively lower risks for exposures at younger ages. In conclusion, there was a clear relation between exposure to radon and death from lung cancer. The relative risk of lung cancer due to exposure to radon was not constant in cessation of exposure. The lifetime excess risk of lung cancer implied by these data for 40 years exposure at the current statutory limit of four WLM a year starting at age 20, was about 8 % (79 excess deaths per 1000 exposed), assuming average smoking habits among the exposed workers.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Hard Rock Miners Phthisis in 19 th and Early 20 th Century Britain: From Diagnosis to CompensationByFredric MintzDoctor of Philosophy in HistoryProfessor Thomas Laqueur, ChairThe {{development}} of new technologies and new patterns of working were indispensable to the accelerated economic growth, which characterized most of nineteenth century Britain. For much of that period the demand for raw siliceous containing materials increased sharply. In this process, equipment, which was ever more sophisticated, generated increasingly fine and more harmful siliceous dust, increasing early disability and death in mines and quarries {{as well as in}} numerous other industries. The present study examines the elaboration of silicosis, the disease, and the {{development of}} social policy directed at its prevention and compensation from the 1830 s until 1918. I concentrate mainly on the nineteenth century and the twentieth century until 1907. In 1907, the law recognized that an occupational disease was a notional injury and a few became compensable. Others, including silicosis were certain to follow. Both the etiological elaboration and prevention of silicosis, and, ultimately compensating its sufferers occurred over a very long period. My major subject is the causes of this time lag. While this study emphasizes mining and quarrying, workers in siliceous industries outside of these occupations had the same issues. Others have reviewed the nature of medical practice in the nineteenth century but medical interest or disinterest in occupational disease during that period has only received cursory coverage. Indeed, this is characteristic of the slighting of occupational disease as opposed sanitation by historians during most of the period I have studied. While some investigators have alluded to the early public health emphasis on worker well-being, I also address how occupational health became a secondary consideration for most of the nineteenth century, despite its promise of achieving as much as &# 8213;Chadwickian&# 8214; sanitation, at much less cost. In this, Chadwick and his coterie of second-generation utilitarians with their stress on engineering as opposed to medical investigation were largely responsible. The government created commissions and committees to learn more about occupational health conditions. However, it appears that it offered these, without much intent to follow through, but rather, as a temporarily sop to placate those with a special interest in the subject. This work studies in more depth than others of which I am aware, the 1862 - 64 Commission of the Condition Of All Mines In Great Britain To Which The Provisions Of The Act 23 & 24 Victoria Do Not Apply (coal mines). During those proceedings, I found that the etiology and partial prevention of silicosis were clearly established. This information was relegated to the blue books for reasons that I also investigate. When interest in silicosis revived, there was little or no reference to this work. 2 Students of the subject have noted that in the 1880 s British medicine was anecdotal and derived from experience in private practice. I have attempted to show how this influenced the elaboration of a specific disease, silicosis. In addition, medical teaching, membership in societies and with an interest in some aspect of medicine, (very likely, what submissions were accepted to medical journals as well) were controlled by a metropolitan medical elite with little or no scientific, social or pecuniary interest in the diseases of miners. This view was transmitted to general practitioners as well. Another aspect of the present work, different from most, has involved a careful reading of all the issues of The Lancet and The British Medical Journals from 1864 through 1906. I found relatively few articles relating to silicosis, confirming that the readers` level of interest was not very great. In addition to demonstrating a paucity of articles about miners` lung disease, these journals also reported on the controversial role of tuberculosis in the elaboration of silicosis. Failure to scientifically address this debate significantly delayed compensating for and preventing silicosis. Additionally, I show that the journals revealed a terminological obfuscation that made the understanding of what silicosis was, very difficult. Various authors commented on this confusion but their criticism {{does not appear to have}} resulted in any editorial attempt to rectify the problem (assuming that any editorial intervention existed). The science of statistics was in advance of other medical tools and did provoke some interest in silicosis but the journals and reports of the commissions also show how statistics were manipulated to minimize the incidence of silicosis. Moreover, organizations presumably having a keen interest in the etiology and prevention of silicosis (and its compensation) were often, themselves, a source for the lag. These included unions, mine and quarry owners, both the Liberal and Conservative Parties, the public health establishment and, to a lesser extent, the <b>mining</b> and quarry <b>inspectorate.</b> Most work on this subject studies the post-WWI period. This work shows that these organizations had distinctly different attitudes about compensation legislation than they held the in the twentieth century. In the process of arriving at the correct etiology of silicosis, and, as a result, whether it should be indemnified, all interested parties picked through what was on offer to patch together some commonality of position that had little to do with any adherence to an overall structure, coherency or rational knowledge. Inevitably, their motives were an admixture of highly parochial and shortsighted deliberations and considerations that were more altruistic. Any attempt on the part of various parties to act in unison was a material and a practical matter and had little to do with systematic logic. The authority of the interested organizations related to the power that sustained them and to what was required to disrupt them and bring about fragmentation. In this process, as Bruno Latour has pointed out, the content of what was achieved, always involved fusion with the context. This work concludes that when problems resist timely solutions, the reasons are always multiple and that they shift over time without result until a reconciliation of various social and cultural differences becomes possible. In fact, reconciliation did occur despite the fact that the motivations of the negotiating parties were contradictory...|$|R

[...] A [...] "gold rush" [...] ensued - [...] "pegs denoting claims went up everywhere" [...] - from all the Fiji islands, [...] "hundreds of people - villagers, shopkeepers and city dwellers - arrived at the diggings". [...] In 1934, a new Mining Ordinance to regulate the fledgling industry was introduced by the British colonial administration. In the same year, the Emperor Gold Mining Company Ltd. established its operations in Vatukoula, followed in 1935 by the Loloma (Fiji) Gold Mines, N.L., and then by Fiji Mines Development Ltd. (later to become Dolphin Mines.Ltd.). These developments ushered in a [...] "mining boom" [...] for Fiji, with gold production rising more than a hundred-fold, from 931.4 oz in 1934 to 107,788.5 oz in 1939, an order of magnitude then comparable to the output of New Zealand and the eastern Australian states. The Ordinance also gave rise to a <b>Mines</b> <b>Inspectorate,</b> His Majesty's Colonial Mines Service recruiting Australian Frank TM White to set up a Mines Department in Suva.

Citing and building on this work, the mineralisation (geology) of Fiji was systematically reviewed by a successor, Mines Inspector James FA Taylor, in 1953. And in the same year, a more detailed review of the geology of the Vatukoula Goldfield (also known as the Tavua Goldfield) was published by A Blatchford, geologist for the Emperor Gold Mining Company Ltd.; mining and milling operations were also reviewed in detail by their respective company superintendents.

40|$|Following {{a series}} of coal mine {{disasters}} in the 80 s and early 90 s in Australia, a trend {{to move away from}} prescriptive to risk based legislative frameworks for mine safety gathered significant momentum. In one Australian jurisdiction, the state of Queensland, two mine safety Acts built on the risk based approach were introduced in 1999 - one for coal mines and one for metalliferous mines - which have led to arguably the best safety performance in a mining jurisdiction in the world. The approach relies on a single integrated safety management system for each mine, anticipation of hazards, control of risk and prevention of incidents.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Following {{a series}} of coal mine {{disasters}} in the 80 s and early 90 s in Australia, a trend {{to move away from}} prescriptive to risk based legislative frameworks for mine safety gathered significant momentum. In one Australian jurisdiction, the state of Queensland, two mine safety Acts built on the risk based approach were introduced in 1999 - one for coal mines and one for metalliferous mines- which have led to arguably the best safety performance in a mining jurisdiction in the world. The approach relies on a single integrated safety management system for each mine, anticipation of hazards, control of risk and prevention of incidents. The legislation has high standards of duty and awareness requirements for everyone involved in the industry, and it demands extensive knowledge at the mine site about managing risk and the need for workforce involvement on mine sites. Formal risk management competencies are required by legislation for many of those holding management and other statutory positions in mines. This paper will cover how the risk based legal framework operates and the role and approach of the <b>mines</b> <b>inspectorate</b> in regulating mine safety under this type of framework. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND On the 7 th August 1994 an explosion occurred at the Moura No 2 underground coal mine in central Queensland. Rescue attempts of the 11 trapped miners were abandoned after a second more violen...|$|E
40|$|In {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (ASCC), across industries in Australia it was found that persons most exposed to loud noise, for longer periods, are employed in the mining industry. In addition, the Queensland Health Improvement and Awareness Committee (HIAC) have ranked noise as the number one health hazard in Queensland mining. Due to the mechanical processes essential to production methods in mining and quarrying, noise exposure control is heavily reliant on the use hearing protectors including ear plugs and muffs. Training is also provided on how to prevent hearing damage. This includes the selection and fitting of hearing protection devices. If the type of hearing protector does not reduce the noise to an acceptable level nor is it fitted correctly, noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) will occur. Permanent noise induced hearing loss is verified through audiometric testing where a permanent threshold shift is observed. As implied, once NIHL is detected the damage to hearing is permanent. It is important that monitoring be carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} hearing conservation programs. Permanent hearing loss is preventable. It is therefore important, that ongoing health surveillance incorporates a measure to detect early hearing loss. Background The Queensland Health Improvement and Awareness Committee (HIAC) is a tripartite committee. HIAC has been established to enable the <b>Mines</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> work in unison, with unions and industry, to provide a greater emphasis on worker health and the prevention of illness and disease. To prioritise health hazards, a broad brush health risk assessment has been completed. HIAC meet quarterly and the meeting minutes and assessment prioritisation table can be viewed by the public at...|$|E
