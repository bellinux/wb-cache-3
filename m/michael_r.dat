5|$|In a {{paper from}} 1998, Alain Connes, <b>Michael</b> <b>R.</b> Douglas, and Albert Schwarz showed that {{some aspects of}} matrix models and M-theory are {{described}} by a noncommutative quantum field theory, {{a special kind of}} physical theory in which the coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy the commutativity property. This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.|$|E

5|$|In Seattle, {{two friends}} argue about {{applying}} for college. Landon Bryce (Christopher Kennedy Masterson) tells his friend Howard Gordon (<b>Michael</b> <b>R.</b> Coleman) to apply, but Gordon has been convinced by school counselor Teresa Roe (Mariangela Pino) that his progress is too mediocre {{to make it}} worthwhile. Bryce accosts Roe, calling her a failure. That night, Gordon is killed, and Bryce is kidnapped. Millennium Group criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) learns that Gordon {{died of a heart}} attack, which the coroner believes was caused by fear. Black visits the crime scene, and sees visions of Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), a woman who killed his friend and colleague Bob Bletcher (in season one's Lamentation). Meanwhile, Bryce is bound and gagged in a remote farmhouse, then left in a room with the would-be escapee. The woman from earlier tells Bryce she loves him.|$|E
