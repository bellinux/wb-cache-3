5|$|By the summer, 1940, the Chain Home radar {{stations}} {{along the}} English and Scottish coasts {{was able to}} track incoming aircraft from continental Europe at all but the lowest altitudes. The best detection altitude was 20,000 feet. Aircraft at this height could be detected over 100 miles away.

5|$|Destroying this {{symbol of}} British naval power by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{submarine}} {{would at least}} be a blow to British morale and, perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor.

5|$|In 1916, a {{plan for}} the city railways, and an Eastern Suburbs {{extension}} was drawn up by the Chief Engineer of the Melbourne Railway Construction, John Bradfield. It was given subsequent approval by Parliament. Bradfield's plan entailed building a City Circle loop, with an extension through to the Eastern Suburbs by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> viaduct over Woolloomooloo. The line was to extend to Rosebery and Waterloo, with ten stations, linking with the Illawarra Line near Erskineville station.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February, the CryoSat-2 {{spacecraft}} was fuelled for launch.

Rollout occurred on 15 February, and the next day the satellite was activated in order to test its systems following integration onto the rocket.|$|E
5|$|Sponges are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making it difficult for them to feed and breathe.

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron by <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E
