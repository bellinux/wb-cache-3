40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women <b>who</b> are HIV-positive in the United States, and to compare HIV prevalence rates between <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women exclusively. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports referencing HIV prevalence and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women. We searched PubMed and Ovid PsycINFO for peer-reviewed, U. S. -based articles reporting on HIV prevalence among <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women. We conducted event rate, effect size, moderation and sensitivity analyses. Results: We estimate that 1. 0 % of U. S. males are bisexually-behaving, and that 121, 800 bisexually-behaving men are HIV-positive. Men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women are less than half {{as likely to be}} HIV-positive as <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only (16. 9 % vs. 33. 3 %; OR = 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 31, 0. 54), but more than five times as likely to be HIV-positive as <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women exclusively (18. 3 % vs. 3. 5 %; OR = 5. 71, 95 % CI: 3. 47, 9. 39). They are less likely to engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse than <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only (15. 9 % vs. 35. 0 %; OR = 0. 36, 95 % CI: 0. 28, 0. 46). Men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women in samples with high racial/ethnic minority proportions had significantly higher HIV prevalence than their counterparts in low racial/ethnic minority samples. Conclusions: This represents the first meta-analysis of HIV prevalence in the U. S. between <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only. Data collection, research, and HIV prevention and care delivery specifically tailored to <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women are necessary to better quantify and ameliorate this population's HIV burden. © 2014 Friedman et al...|$|R

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To explore <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with men's views about condom use when having anal intercourse. Background Internationally, health promotion campaigns use behavioural change strategies to support <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to always use condoms when having anal sex with other men. The health promotion message given {{to this group}} is consistent and explicitly stated that ‘use a condom every time for anal sex regardless of relationship status’. Design Qualitative analysis of data from a cohort of New Zealand <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men.</b> Methods A total of 960 useable questionnaires were completed: 571 online and 389 in hard copy. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic data analytic process. Results Three themes relating to condom use in <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> were identified. These are as follows: ‘Safer sex is good sex’, ‘Condom use is good but …’ and ‘I use condoms sometimes’. Conclusions The range of responses towards condom use for anal sex in <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> in our sample reveal this as a complex public health issue, with not all <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> willing to consistently use condoms. Relevance to clinical practice It is important that nurses do not assume that all <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> are willing to use condoms for anal sex, and should create opportunities for <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to raise any concerns {{about the use of}} condoms. In this way, nurses can assist in providing information that may help <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to make decisions that will minimise risk of contracting infections associated with sexual activity...|$|R
2500|$|Some other {{cultures}} {{do not recognize}} a homosexual/heterosexual/bisexual distinction. It is common to distinguish a person's sexuality according to their sexual role (active/passive; insertive/penetrated). In this distinction, the passive role is typically associated with femininity or inferiority, while the active role is typically associated with masculinity or superiority. For example, an investigation of a small Brazilian fishing village revealed three sexual categories for men: <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex only with men (consistently in a passive role), <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex only with women, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women and men (consistently in an active role). [...] While <b>men</b> <b>who</b> consistently occupied the passive role were recognized as a distinct group by locals, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with only women, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women and men, were not differentiated. Little is known about same-sex attracted females, or sexual behavior between females in these cultures.|$|R

While high HIV seroincidence has been documented among homosexual African-American men, behavioral research has rarely studied the HIV risk issues confronting these men. This study assessed a sample of 253 <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to determine if African-American (n = 79) and white (n = 174) men report different rates of HIV risk behaviors and differ in characteristics indicative of risk.
