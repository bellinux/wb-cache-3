40|$|For the {{experimental}} characterization of behind-armour debris so-called <b>metallic</b> witness <b>packs</b> can be used. A <b>metallic</b> witness <b>pack</b> {{consists of an}} array of metallic plates interspaced by polystyrene foam sheets. To quantify the fragment mass and velocity from the corresponding hole area and position in the individual witness plates, perforation threshold curves must be available to provide the ballistic limit velocity for each plate {{as a function of}} the fragment mass. Furthermore, the relation between the fragment impact velocity and hole size should be known. This paper presents the results of a collaborative study between Defence Research Establishment, Valcartier (DREV) and TNO Prins Maurits Laboratory, The Netherlands.

Long-term desulfurization of high loads of H 2 S under acidic pH was studied in a lab-scale aerobic biotrickling filter packed with metallic Pall rings. Reference operating conditions at steady-state corresponded to an empty bed residence time (EBRT) of 130 s, H 2 S loading rate of 52 gS-H 2 Sm- 3 h- 1 and pH 2. 50 - 2. 75. The EBRT reduction showed that the critical EBRT was 75 s and the maximum EC 100 gS-H 2 Sm- 3 h- 1. Stepwise increases of the inlet H 2 S concentration up to 10, 000 ppmv lead to a maximum EC of 220 gS-H 2 Sm- 3 h- 1. The H 2 S removal profile along the filter bed indicated that the first third of the filter bed was responsible for 70 - 80 % of the total H 2 S removal. The oxidation rate of solid sulfur accumulated inside the bioreactor during periodical H 2 S starvation episodes was verified under acidic operating conditions. The performance under acidic pH was comparable to that under neutral pH in terms of H 2 S removal capacity.

The {{traditional}} coupling {{technology for}} PVC water pipes consists in attaching a belling {{end with a}} normal end of another tube, applying paste for PVC. However it has been reached {{to the conclusion that}} this method is not ideal due to the tendency to create leaks because of pressure. Therefore, research and development works led to {{what is known as the}} RIEBER System. This system consists basically on a special belling of the PVC tubes, where <b>metallic</b> <b>packing</b> covered with rubber is incorporated. This allows joining to tubes without the necessity to use paste for PVC, the two ends are coupled by means of pressure. At the moment most of the belling machines are designed to do belling without packing. For this reason, it becomes necessary to carry out a conversion in these machines. Additionally, to implement the conversion of these machines to the new system it is appealed to the employment of several makers PLC´s. In general, incompatibilities exist between the I/O interfaces among PLC´s. In this project the control and simulation of a belling machine with high level programming (InControl and InTouch) was developed. This allows reusing the generated code without a great effort. Avoiding the dependence of the PLC manufacturers and their incompability of programming languages, that causes of having to generate new code for the control of a specific process. The software used in the project also offers programming flexibility, since it allows the use and interaction of diverse programming languages like: Relay Logic Ladder (RLL), Structured text and Sequential Function Chart (SFC).

40|$|The {{evaporative}} {{gas turbine}} (EvGT), {{also known as}} the humid air turbine (HAT) cycle, is a novel advanced gas turbine cycle that has attracted considerable interest for the last decade. This high-efficiency cycle shows the potential to be competitive with Diesel engines or combined cycles in small and intermediate scale plants for power production and/or cogeneration. A 0. 6 MW natural gas-fired EvGT pilot plant has been constructed by a Swedish national research group in cooperation between universities and industry. The plant is located at the Lund Institute of Technology, Lund, Sweden. The pilot plant uses a humidification tower with <b>metallic</b> <b>packing</b> in which heated water from the flue gas economizer is brought into direct counter current contact with the pressurized air from the compressor This gives an efficient heat recovery and thereby a thermodynamically sound cycle. As the hot sections in high-temperature gas turbines are sensitive to particles and alkali compounds, water quality issues need to be carefully considered. As such, apart from evaluating the thermodynamic and part-load performance characteristics of the plant, and verifying the operation of the high-pressure humidifier, much attention is focused on the water chemistry issues associated with the recovery and reuse of condensate water from the flue gas. A water treatment system has been designed and integrated into the pilot plant. This paper presents the first water quality results from the plant. The experimental results show that the condensate contains low levels of alkali and calcium, around 2 mg/l Sigma(K,Na,Ca), probably originating from the unfiltered compressor intake, About 14 mg/l NO 2 - +NO 3 - comes from condensate absorption of flue gas NOx. Some Cu is noted, 16 mg/l, which originates from copper corrosion of the condenser tubes. After CO 2 stripping, condensate filtration and a mixed bed ion exchanger the condensate is of suitable quality for reuse as humidification water The need,for large quantities of demineralized water has by manY authors been identified as a drawback for the evaporative cycle. However, by cooling the humid flue gas, the recovery, of condensed water cuts the need of water feed. A self-supporting water circuit can be achieved, with no need for any net addition of water to the system. In the pilot plant, this was achieved by cooling the flue gas to around 35 degreesC...|$|E

40|$|Resistive {{random access}} memory (RRAM) is a prime {{candidate}} to replace Flash memory. Of the two classes of RRAM, conductive bridge RAM (CBRAM) is favoured over that based on filaments of oxygen vacancies because of its larger on/off resistance ratio. The nature of the filament in Cu/Al₂O₃-based CBRAM is analysed using density functional theory. The defect and binding energies of Cu interstitials and clusters in Al₂O₃ are calculated. The binding energy per Cu interstitial is shown to significantly increase with increasing Cu coordination, whereas the binding per oxygen vacancy only slightly increases with vacancy concentration. This explains why metal filaments in CBRAM devices tend to be denser than oxygen vacancy filaments. Using three different filament models, we discover that the strong binding between Cu interstitials drives filament formation, resulting in Al ions being driven out of the Cu-rich environment. This leads {{to the formation of}} densely <b>packed</b> <b>metallic</b> Cu filaments with bonding similar to Cu metal, as confirmed by electronic structure calculations...|$|R

Here, we mitigate this problem and use full wave optical simulations to assign effective properties to plasmonic nanocomposites with filling fractions close to the percolation threshold. We show that these effective properties can be used to properly predict the optical action of functional devices that contain nanocomposites in their design. With this contribution we pave the way to consider plasmonic nanocomposites comparably to ordinary materials in the design of optical elements...|$|R

40|$|Developing new {{functional}} {{applications of}} metallic glasses in catalysis {{is an active}} and pivotal topic for materials science as well as novel environmental catalysis processes. Compared to the crystalline materials with highly ordered atomic <b>packing,</b> <b>metallic</b> glass has a simply disordered atomic structure. Recent reports have demonstrated that the metallic glasses are indeed having many superiorly catalytic properties, yet {{the understanding of the}} mechanism is insufficient. In this work, the structural relaxation (α-relaxation) by annealing in an amorphous Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 alloy is studied for unraveling the catalytic mechanism at the atomic scale. The volume fractions of the crystalline structures, such as α-Fe, Fe 2 Si, and Fe 2 B, in the as-received and annealed metallic glasses are fully characterized.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{presented in}} this paper applies to experimental situations where observers or objects to be studied (both stationary, with respect to each other) are located in environments the optical thickness of which is strongly different. By their large optical thickness, non-transparent media are clearly distinguished from their transparent counterparts. Non-transparent media comprise thin <b>metallic</b> films, <b>packed</b> or fluidised beds, the Earth’s crust, and even dark clouds and other cosmological objects. As a representative example, a non-transparent slab is subjected to transient disturbances, and a rigorous analysis is presented whether physical time reasonably could be constructed under such condition. The analysis incorporates mapping functions that correlate physical events, e, in non-transparent media, with their images, f(e), tentatively located on a standard physical time scale. The analysis demonstrates, however, that physical time, in its rigorous sense, does not exist under non-transparency conditions. A proof of this conclusion is attempted in three steps: i) the theorem “there is no time without space and events” is accepted, (ii) images f[e(s,t) ] do not constitute a dense, uncountably infinite set, and (iii) sets of images that are not uncountably infinite do not create physical time but only time-like sequences. As a consequence, mapping f[e(s,t) ] in non-transparent space does not create physical analogues to the mathematical structure of the ordered, dense half-set R+ of real numbers, and reverse mapping, f- 1 f[e(s,t) ] would not allow unique identification and reconstruction of original events from their images. In these cases, causality and determinism, as well as invariance of physical processes under time reversal, might be violated. Existence of time holes could be possible, as follows from the sequence of images, f[e(s,t) ], that is not uncountably infinite, in contrast to R+. Practical impacts are expected for understanding physical diffusion-like, radiative transfer processes, stability models to protect superconductors against quenchs or for description of their transient local pair density and critical currents. Impacts would be expected also in mathematical formulations (differential equations) of classical physics, in relativity and perhaps in quantum mechanics, all as far as transient processes in non-transparent space would be concerned. An interesting problem is whether temporal cloaking (a time hole) in a transparent medium, as very recently reported in the literature, {{can be explained by the}} present analysis. The analysis is not restricted to objects of laboratory dimensions: Because of obviously existing radiation transfer analogues, it is tempting to discuss consequences also for much larger structures in particular if an origin of time is postulated...|$|R
40|$|Investigation of {{the surface}} {{composition}} of powders often requires compaction. To study the effect of compaction on surface analysis, samples have been compacted at various pressures ranging from 0 Pa (i. e. no compaction) up to 2000 MPa (2 × 104 kg cm- 2) Low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) {{was used to determine}} the composition of the outermost atomic surface layer. Using scanning electron microscopy, changes in the morphology due to compaction have been detected in the SiO 2 test samples. The LEIS yield of a compacted silica powder is found to be independent of the applied pressure during compaction between 2 MPa and 2000 MPa (2 × 104 kg cm- 2). Analysis of a submonolayer of Ta 2 O 5 on a silica support shows that the composition of the outermost atomic layer is not changed after compaction up to a pressure of at least 300 MPa. When compaction is applied, the absolute LEIS yield appears to be independent of the specific surface area of silica supports in the range 50 – 380 m 2 g- 1. A minor difference in LEIS signals is observed between compacted silica supports and flat quartz samples. In order to determine the surface roughness factor independently, and to study the material dependence {{of the surface}} roughness factor, angle-dependent LEIS measurements have been carried out on oxidized silicon, gallium and gold surfaces. The results on the oxidized silicon confirm the small influence of surface roughness for silica particles, whereas measurements on the more closely <b>packed</b> <b>metallic</b> gallium and gold surfaces indicate a significant surface roughness effect.

In a certain way, MellapakPlus 752.

The latter is used to quantitatively analyse liquid distribution images in irrigated MellapakPlus 752. Y and Katapak-SP (11 and 12) packings, giving access to spatial distribution of local values of hydrodynamic quantities such as the liquid holdup and gas-liquid interfacial area.

30|$|PMEs with one-dimensionally arrayed {{patterns}} [8, 9, 14 – 19] (i.e., 2 D PMEs) can {{be easily}} fabricated based on the two-beam interference technique [20]; however, the absorption enhancement in OSCs is sensitive to polarization since plasmonic modes cannot be excited at the traverse electric (TE) polarized incidence [10]. PMEs with two-dimensionally (2 D) arrayed patterns (i.e., 3 D PMEs), which can boost light harvesting efficiency polarization insensitively, have been extensively investigated {{in the past few}} years [14, 21 – 31]. Most of 3 D PMEs working as the back contact are opaque. If PMEs are functioned as the front contact, it must be semi-transparent, realized with corrugated thin films [14, 21] or a film with through holes [22, 25]. Except some electrodes with complicated geometries, e.g., the integrated nanopillar-nanowell PME [31], the opaque 3 D PMEs are categorized into two types. The first type is to dress the surface of the metallic electrode with some isolated nanoholes [26, 27], which are filled with organic materials in the real OSCs. In other words, the organic materials contacting the PME are in the form of nanopillars. Such kind of PME {{can be easily}} obtained by firstly imprinting the active layer with some nanopillars and then thermally evaporating the contact film. By the nanoimprinting technique, Li et al. have demonstrated that a nanohole-type of 3 D PME can increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by 24.6 % with respect to the planar electrode, much superior to the 2 D PME [26]. The nanohole-type of PME can also be made from a polystyrene (PS) nanosphere template based on a colloidal self-assembling technique [27]. The other type of opaque 3 D PMEs is to decorate some isolated metallic nanopillars on top of a continuous metallic film [23, 24, 28 – 30], which is exactly the inverse structure of the nanohole one. Le theoretically predicated that there is a great potential of a metallic grating with a 2 D array of Ag nanopillars in enhancing the absorption in a thin active layer [24]. We have also theoretically analyzed the influence of the back contact embossed with <b>metallic</b> nanocylinders <b>packed</b> in a hexagonal array on the absorption of a thin OSC device [28]. If the imprinting molds are selected properly, the active layer can be left with some nanoholes, then the following evaporation would make the metal contact protrude into the active layer (i.e., forming the metallic nanopillars) [29, 30]. Zhou et al. showed that the nanopillar PME can increase the PCE of OSC by 9.33 % as well as improve the performance of organic light-emitting diodes. Successful applications of the nanopillar-type of PMEs were also witnessed in quantum dot-based solar cells [30]. It is known that nanoholes at a metallic surface excite distinct plasmonic resonances from those of metallic nanopillars loaded on a continuous metal film. Though both types of opaque PMEs were frequently applied in OSCs, there are not enough studies addressing their merit and demerit from a comparison standpoint. Thus, it is of great importance to explore how these two strategies of PMEs work differently from each other in OSCs and which one works better for trapping light into the active layer in theory.|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Oxygen {{constitutes}} 30 % {{share of}} the global industrial gas market and is the second largest-volume chemical produced in the world after sulfuric acid. Commercial applications of oxygen {{can be found in}} industry sectors as diverse as metallurgical industry, chemical synthesis, glass manufacturing, pulp and paper industry, petroleum recovery / refining, and health services. Advanced power generation systems, such as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), Oxy-fuel combustion and solid oxide fuel cells, SOFC represent emerging markets for oxygen. Oxygen is commonly produced at industrial scales by air separation using cryogenic distillation and adsorption based technologies. Advanced technologies such as membrane separation (e. g. ion-transport membrane, ITM) and in-situ air separation are also being developed for small-volume point-of-use oxygen generation. While conventional cryogenic and adsorption air separation methods are matured technologies, their energy intensity and high costs can no longer be tolerated under the current economic, energy, and environmental crises. Membrane separation methods whilst less energy intensive remain expensive due to challenges associated with their fabrication, installation and integration. In view of the above, a team of researchers led by Prof Moghtaderi at the University of Newcastle devised the Chemical Looping Air Separation (CLAS) process and its variants including: (i) Integrated Chemical Looping Air Separation (ICLAS) process for oxy-fuel applications and (ii) Redox Energy Storage (RES) process for thermo-chemical energy storage. Depending on the operating temperature and frontend conditions, the energy input into the CLAS process is 50 % - 80 % lower than that required for the cryogenic process and, as such, the CLAS family of processes has a relatively small energy footprint. CLAS works in a cyclic fashion by continuous recirculation of metal oxide particles between a set of two interconnected reactors, where oxidation (O₂ coupling) and reduction (O₂ decoupling) of carrier particles take place, respectively. In the original version of the CLAS process the reduction half cycle is carried out in presence of steam so that the desired oxygen product can be obtained by condensing out the steam. However, the production and condensation of steam is energy consuming and if it can be replaced by an alternative method the overall energy footprint of the CLAS process can be further reduced. Motivated by this, Prof Moghtaderi and his team turned their attention on to yet another variant of CLAS named Membrane Integrated Chemical Looping Air Separation (MICLAS) where the oxygen product from the reduction reactor is separated from steam or other suitable reducing agents (e. g. N₂) using an oxygen transport membrane (OTM) system. The combination of the OTM and CLAS in the MICLAS process creates an air separation platform which is far more cost effective than the standalone OTM based processes because of the smaller volume of gases involved, thereby, smaller physical dimensions and lower capital / operating costs. The principal vision in this PhD project was to determine the fundamental science underpinning the operation of the above integrated membrane systems using a combined theoretical and experimental approach. While both steam and nitrogen compatible OTMs studied theoretically, the primary focus of the experimental investigations was on the use of OTMs compatible with nitrogen as past experience has shown that by and large steam detrimentally impacts on the operation of membranes suitable for oxygen transport. As part of the theoretical component of the project the feasibility of integrating an OTM into the CLAS process was examined using Aspen Plus simulations, in which the net amount of energy required for each process was determined. An empirical model was then developed for calculating the oxygen permeation fluxes of the membranes using both simulation results and literature-based experimental data. It was found that the energy saving of MICLAS over the conventional CLAS was approximately 30 % if a 100 % oxygen recovery was assumed. When the actual oxygen recovery data were employed the energy saving of MICLAS over CLAS was 12 % for BSCF type perovskite membranes reported in the literature and 16 % for BSCF and 22 % for LSCF type perovskite membranes specifically developed as part of this PhD study. The experimental component of the project was designed to address several important research questions fundamental to the effective operation of the MICLAS process. Of these, an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the particle deposition on a membrane {{and its impact on the}} membrane performance (i. e., the oxygen flux across the membrane and thereby the reactions taking place within the CLAS system) was the first research question examined in this study. For this purpose, a fluidised bed chamber was designed and constructed to study particle deposition on surrogate ceramic membranes. Images of the surface coverage of each membrane were taken with a Phantom V 5 high speed camera and analysed using Image J software. Preliminary deposition experiments using the experimental setup with the Perspex fluidised bed created a severe electrostatic charging issue which led to the redesign and construction of the fluidised bed chamber. The modified deposition setup consisted of a combination of a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass window and a complete metallic body machined from aluminium. Grounding the experimental setup, including the new fluidised bed chamber, almost completely eliminated the electrostatic charging problem. The results of this set of experiments showed that the degree of particle deposition and electrostatic forces acting upon the particle deposition in the two phase flow were minimised. The experimental results showed that the surface coverage of the surrogate membranes with particles was less than 3 %. Therefore, the impact of particle deposition which was initially considered to be detrimental to the effectiveness of the membrane was found to be insignificant. The other research questions addressed in the experimental component of the project were related to the effectiveness of membrane materials and identifying the most suitable candidate for MICLAS based processes. In this context, experimental studies were directed toward the synthesis of two types of perovskite membranes and their characterisation. These were namely Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 −δ (BSCF 5582) and La 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 −δ (LSCF 5582) which were prepared at different sintering temperatures and characterised. The BSCF 5582 membranes were also synthesised using a modified Pechini method in collaboration with the FIMLab at the University of Queensland. The BSCF 5582 and LSCF 5582 membranes were sintered in the temperature ranges of 1000 °C - 1150 °C for 8 h and 1050 °C - 1350 °C for 5 h, respectively. The sintered membranes were characterised using an array of complementary techniques to determine the optimum sintering temperature in order to optimise their desired properties and oxygen permeability. The surface morphology of the membranes were examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy, which revealed that the segregation of the cobalt oxide phase occurring at the sintering temperatures of 1250 °C and 1100 °C for the LSCF 5582 and BSCF 5582 membranes, respectively; impacts on the oxygen permeability of the membranes. The sintering experiments also revealed that the sintering temperatures of 1350 °C and 1150 °C were impractical for the sintering of LSCF 5582 and BSCF 5582 membranes due to an excessive liquid phase forming at these temperatures. The phase and crystal structure of the membranes were identified using the X-ray diffraction technique. The presence of segregated phases for the membranes at high sintering temperatures was also verified using XRD and analysed using EDS techniques. The surface areas of the membranes were measured using the BET method in order to study their oxygen adsorption and desorption characteristics. A significantly lower surface area was acquired for the membranes sintered at elevated temperatures due to the formation of larger grain sizes at these temperatures. For example, the LSCF 5582 fresh powder and LSCF 5582 membrane sintered at 1350 °C had the highest (5. 84 m². g - 1) and the lowest (0. 556 m². g - 1) surface areas, respectively. Studies of the oxygen desorption/adsorption characteristics of the membranes showed a significantly higher oxygen adsorption rate over the oxygen desorption rate. The characterisation results demonstrated that the optimum sintering temperatures of the LSCF 5582 and BSCF 5582 membranes were 1200 °C and 1050 °C, respectively. The oxygen permeation experiments were conducted in three permeation cells with: Concentric Tube configuration, Double-Tube configuration and Multi-Tube configuration. The adjustable variables in the Concentric Tube setup were the pressure and flow rate of the sweep gas and the permeation temperature. The Double-Tube setup was used to determine the oxygen recovery of the membranes. However, sealing was the major challenge in the Double-Tube setup; therefore the Multi-Tube setup was designed and constructed. The adjustable parameters in the Multi-Tube setup were the flow rates and pressures of the feed and the sweep gas, as well as the permeation temperature. Oxygen permeation fluxes increased significantly with temperature due to the enhanced formation of oxygen vacancy concentrations in the crystal structure of the membranes with increased temperatures. As oxygen ions migrate through the vacancies, the oxygen permeation fluxes increased at elevated temperatures due to the increased oxygen vacancies. Considerably higher oxygen permeation fluxes were acquired using the Multi Tube setup than with the other permeation setups as the oxygen partial pressure gradient was adjustable in this particular setup. In order to investigate the feasibility of the integration of an OTM into the CLAS process, the reduction reactions of the oxygen carrier particles was initially examined using the TGA instrument and a fixed bed reactor. The equilibrium conversion of the metallic oxides and the concentrations of oxygen produced at different reduction temperatures were determined. Subsequently, the <b>metallic</b> oxides were <b>packed</b> in the vicinity of the LSCF and BSCF membranes using the Multi-Tube apparatus. The permeation fluxes and recoveries of oxygen obtained with the membranes were measured in the course of the reduction of the metallic oxide particles containing 17 weight percent active CuO. Finally, in a set of experiments, hypothetical oxygen carriers containing 10 %, 15 % and 21 % oxygen concentrations were considered as future oxygen carriers for the CLAS process. The permeability and oxygen recovery of the LSCF 5582 and BSCF 5582 membranes were measured under simulated experimental conditions using hypothetical oxygen carriers. A mixture of oxygen and nitrogen was used to simulate the oxygen content of the hypothetical oxygen carriers. The experimental results showed that significantly higher oxygen permeation fluxes and recoveries were obtained for membranes at a 10 % oxygen concentration, compared with a 21 % oxygen concentration. In summary, it has been demonstrated that the OTM integrated CLAS process, even with the existing oxygen carriers which contain 0. 3 % oxygen, is a viable technology that can be usefully applied to a future air separation system...|$|R
