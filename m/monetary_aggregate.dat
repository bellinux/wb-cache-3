25|$|In economics, {{money is}} a broad term that refers to any {{financial}} instrument that can fulfil the functions of money (detailed above). These financial instruments together are collectively {{referred to as the}} money supply of an economy. In other words, the money supply is the number of financial instruments within a specific economy available for purchasing goods or services. Since the money supply consists of various financial instruments (usually currency, demand deposits and various other types of deposits), the amount of money in an economy is measured by adding together these financial instruments creating a <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregate.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of monetary policy in achieving its macroeconomic objectives such as price stability {{and economic growth}} depend on the monetary policy tools that are implemented by the Central Bank. <b>Monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{are one of the}} tools that have been used as indicators of economic activity and as intermediate targets to achieve these economic objectives. Until recently, <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> have been questioned and criticised on their usefulness in monetary policy. This has been attributed to the economic, financial and technological developments that have distorted the relationship between <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and major macroeconomic variables. This study investigates the relevance of monetary aggregation by comparing the traditional simple sum and Divisia index <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> which was constructed for the first time for South Africa using the Tornquist-Theil method. The Polynomial Distributed Lag model is employed to compare the performance of these <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> using their relationship with inflation and manufacturing index. Furthermore, the aggregates are compared in terms of their controllability and information content. Overall, the study found a very strong relationship between inflation and all the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> However, more specifically the results suggested that the Divisia indices are superior to the simple sum in terms of predicting inflation. The evidence further suggests that the Divisia aggregates provide higher information about inflation than the simple sum aggregates. Regarding the controllability of the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> the findings suggest that the monetary authorities can hardly control the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> using <b>monetary</b> base. Finally, the relationship between manufacturing index and all the <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> was very weak. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{research has found}} that the strong short-term relationship between US <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> and macroeconomic fundamentals, as outlined in the classical study of M.

By using the official US data constructed by Porter and Judson (1996) we find that the currency component of M 1 corrected for the foreign holdings of dollars contains valuable information on US macroeconomic fundamentals, such as nominal and real income, as well as inflation. This correction for <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> is required because the rate of foreign holdings in total money creation is large and unstable.

In order to investigate the implications of currency substitution for the stability of the demand functions, the traditional and extended <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> for five EU countries are defined in addition to EU-wide <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> The estimated EU-wide demand for extended money appears to be stable suggesting that there is scope for monetary policy at the European level.

Movement of money from one form to another affects the index whereas it would not affect a simple sum of the money stock; thus the index is more useful to track the money ready-to-transact than a sum would be.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of the Ghanaian macroeconomy, this paper explores the {{monetary}} factors underlying the changing levels of remittance inflows, and the implications of remittance inflows for <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> interest rate, exchange rate, and the domestic price level. The theoretical framework of the study is based on a modified variable-price Mundell-Fleming model. A five-variable Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model is estimated using quarterly data between 1983 (4) and 2005 (4). The estimated static long-run model shows that <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> exchange rate, and interest rate positively impact on remittance inflows while domestic price level negatively impact on remittance inflows. <b>Monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> exchange rate, interest rate and domestic price level impact on one another while remittances positively drive itself, <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> exchange rate and interest rate. The impulse response functions reveal that remittance inflows respond to its own shocks but not to shocks emanating from <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> exchange rate, interest rate, and the price level. Variance decompositions show that, during the first quarter, remittances are self-driven. Since remittances are significantly impacted by <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates,</b> exchange rate, interest rate, and the domestic price level, prudent monetary and exchange rate policies should be specially formulated and selectively conducted to attract international remittances to Ghana.

This smoothing causes important information about the dynamic movements of the monetary stock to be lost. This may offer at least a partial explanation of why so many studies find that money has little economic relevance. To that end, we will conclude the paper by examining a reduced form backward looking IS equation to determine whether monetary aggregates contain information about real GDP gap.
