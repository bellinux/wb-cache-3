5|$|Also, {{the paucity}} of {{morphological}} differences between the Old World mallards and the New World <b>mallard</b> demonstrates {{the extent to which}} the genome is shared among them such that birds like the Chinese spot-billed duck are highly similar to the Old World <b>mallard,</b> and birds such as the Hawaiian duck are highly similar to the New World <b>mallard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with the female <b>mallard.</b> The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female <b>mallard</b> in North America are the American black duck (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the <b>mallard,</b> and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female <b>mallard,</b> and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum.|$|E

5|$|The {{size of the}} <b>mallard</b> varies clinally; for example, birds from Greenland, though larger, have smaller bills, paler plumage, and stockier bodies than birds further south, and are {{sometimes}} classified as a separate subspecies, the Greenland <b>mallard</b> (A.p.conboschas).|$|E

5|$|Since 1998, the <b>mallard</b> {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the content of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in livers and breast muscles of <b>mallards</b> obtained in Warmia and Mazury in 1999 - 2000. Samples from 32 <b>mallards</b> hunted in Łężany, Zembrze, Szestno and Nidzica, as well as samples from 7 pheasants and 6 <b>mallards</b> from the area of Śląsk were analyzed. Concentration of all the four metals was higher in the liver than in breast muscles. Mean contents of copper in livers of juvenile and adult <b>mallards</b> from Warmia and Mazury were similar (6. 567 and 8. 632 mg/kg w. w.). Levels of zinc were approximately the same in both age groups (23. 911 mg/kg w. w. in young birds and 25. 418 mg/kg w. w. in adults). As regards lead, older <b>mallards</b> from Warmia and Mazury had twice as much of the metal in the liver (0. 417 mg/kg w. w.). The content of Pb in the liver was similar in both age groups of the birds from Śląsk. The differences in the concentration of cadmium in the <b>mallards</b> from Warmia and Mazury were smaller. Cd in the amount of 0. 128 mg/kg m. m. was found in the young <b>mallards</b> and 0. 171 mg/kg m. m. in the adult <b>mallards.</b> The birds from the area of Śląsk contained much higher concentrations of Cd in their tissues, over 1 mg/kg m. m. in the liver and over 0. 200 mg/kg m. m. in the breast muscles...|$|R

50|$|The Quad City <b>Mallards</b> were a {{professional}} ice hockey team {{competing in the}} United Hockey League. The <b>Mallards</b> played their home games at The MARK of the Quad Cities in Moline, Illinois. Their team colors were forest green and burgundy.

The <b>Mallards</b> won 50 or more games in 6 consecutive seasons, from 1996-97 to 2001-02, {{a professional}} hockey record.

5|$|The <b>mallard</b> is {{considered}} to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Unlike many waterfowl, mallards are considered an invasive species in some regions. It is a very adaptable species, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The non-migratory <b>mallard</b> interbreeds with indigenous wild ducks of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild <b>mallard</b> is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted by the domesticated and feral <b>mallard</b> populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} as Mr. and Mrs. <b>Mallard</b> fly over various {{potential}} {{locations around the}} city of Boston, Massachusetts (United States) to start a family. Each time Mr. <b>Mallard</b> selects a location, Mrs. <b>Mallard</b> finds something wrong with it. Tired from their search, the mallards land at the Public Garden Lagoon to spend the night. In the morning, a swan boat passes by the mallards. The mallards mistake the swan boat for a real bird and enjoy peanuts thrown by {{the people on the}} boat. Mrs. <b>Mallard</b> suggests that they build their nest in the Public Garden. However, just as she says this, her husband is nearly run down by a passing bicyclist. The mallards continue their search, flying over Boston landmarks such as Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House, and Louisburg Square. The Mallards finally decide on an island in the Charles River. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who feeds them peanuts every day.|$|E

50|$|The Minot <b>Mallards,</b> a team {{playing in}} the {{integrated}} Manitoba-Dakota League or Mandak League, began playing at Corbett Field in May 1950. The name <b>Mallards</b> was an entry submitted by Minot native Bonnie Rae Miller, in a fan-naming contest, beating out the Kernels and the Plainsmen. In the summer of 1950, Satchel Paige pitched three games for the <b>Mallards.</b> After the league folded, the <b>Mallards</b> continued {{to play at the}} ballpark in the 1960s for the Northern League. In 1995, a newly revived Minot <b>Mallards</b> began playing at the park in the Prairie League, but the league folded in 1997.

40|$|Migrating {{waterfowl}} are {{implicated in}} the global spread of influenza A viruses (IAVs), and <b>mallards</b> (Anas platyrhynchos) are considered a particularly important IAV reservoir. Prevalence of IAV infection in waterfowl peaks during autumn premigration staging and then declines as birds reach wintering areas. Migration is energetically costly and birds often experience declines in body condition that may suppress immune function. We assessed how body condition affects susceptibility to infection, viral shedding and antibody production in wild-caught and captive-bred juvenile <b>mallards</b> challenged with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H 5 N 9. Wild <b>mallards</b> (n = 30) were separated into three experimental groups; each manipulated through food availability to a different condition level (220 %, 210 %, and normal 65 % original body condition), and captive-bred <b>mallards</b> (n = 10) were maintained at normal condition. We found that wild <b>mallards</b> in normal condition were more susceptible to LPAIV infection, shed higher peak viral loads and shed viral RNA more frequently compared to birds in poor condition. Antibody production did not differ according to condition. We found that wild <b>mallards</b> {{did not differ from}} captive-bred <b>mallards</b> in viral intensity and duration of infection, but they did exhibit lower antibody titers and greater variation in viral load. Our findings suggest that reduced body condition negatively influences waterfowl host competence to LPAIV infection. This observation is contradictory to the recently proposed condition-dependent hypothesis, according to which birds in reduced condition would be more susceptible to IA...|$|R

5|$|Mallards {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{varieties}} of ducks hunted as a sport. The ideal location for hunting mallards is considered to be where the water level is somewhat shallow. Hunting mallards might cause the population to decline in some places, at some times, and with some populations. In certain countries, the <b>mallard</b> may be legally shot but is protected under national acts and policies. For example, in the United Kingdom, the <b>mallard</b> is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which restricts certain hunting methods or taking or killing mallards.|$|E

5|$|The <b>mallard</b> {{is a rare}} {{example of}} both Allen's Rule and Bergmann's Rule in birds. Bergmann's Rule, which states that polar forms tend to be larger than related ones from warmer climates, has {{numerous}} examples in birds, as in case of the Greenland <b>mallard</b> which {{is larger than the}} mallards further south. Allen's Rule says that appendages like ears tend to be smaller in polar forms to minimise heat loss, and larger in tropical and desert equivalents to facilitate heat diffusion, and that the polar taxa are stockier overall. Examples of this rule in birds are rare as they lack external ears, but the bill of ducks is supplied with a few blood vessels to prevent heat loss, and, as in the Greenland <b>mallard,</b> the bill is smaller than that of birds farther south, illustrating the rule.|$|E
