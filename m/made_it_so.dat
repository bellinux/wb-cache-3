If both the offices governor and lieutenant governor are vacant, the line of succession moves down through the {{senior members of the}} state senate and state house of representatives of the same party as the governor. The lieutenant governor was elected separately from the governor until a 1968 amendment to the constitution <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that they are elected on the same ticket.|$|E
5|$|The FCI {{refused to}} suspend Petacchi, and he {{returned}} to racing in late July. Their decision, however, was not made to exonerate Petacchi, but rather {{because they did not}} believe they should hear the case, instead deferring to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS heard the case, and Petacchi testified to the court, stating that the hot and humid day on which the stage was the run had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that he took several extra puffs from his inhaler, but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage.|$|E
5|$|In the 1998 storyline {{where he}} fakes dissociative {{identity}} disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities {{may not have been}} as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, Téa attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.|$|E

25|$|St. John was {{initially}} brought on as Todd Manning posing as character Walker Laurence. In 2011, with Howarth's return as Todd, the writers decided to rewrite this and instead have St. John's character revealed as Todd's identical twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr., conditioned {{to believe he}} was Todd and to thereby assume Todd's identity. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that Todd never raped Marty for a second time.|$|E

25|$|The eastern {{slopes of}} Silver How above Grasmere are steep and carry trees to the intake wall at half height, the final {{rise to the}} summit being craggy.

There are also crags on the southern side of the ridge, overlooking Chapel Stile in Great Langdale.|$|E
25|$|The Waltham-Lowell system {{pioneered the}} use of a {{vertically}} integrated system. Here there was complete control over all aspects of production. Spinning, weaving, dying, and cutting were now completed in a single plant. This large amount of control <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that no other company could interfere with production. The Waltham mill also pioneered the process of mass production. This greatly increased the scale of manufacturing. Water powered line shafts and belts now connected hundreds of power lines. The increase in manufacturing occurred so rapidly that there was no localized labor supply in the early 19th century that could have sufficed. Lowell solved this problem by hiring young women.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the {{classification}} is determined {{the same way as}} the general classification, with the riders' times being added up after each stage and the eligible rider with lowest aggregate time is dubbed the leader. The Young rider classification is restricted to the riders that are under the age of 26. Originally the classification was restricted to neo-professionals – riders that are in their first three years of professional racing – until 1983. In 1983, the organizers <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that only first time riders were eligible for the classification. In 1987, the organizers changed the rules of the classification to what they are today.|$|E

25|$|Conspicuous leisure, or the {{non-productive}} use of {{time for}} the sake of displaying social status, is used by Veblen as the primary indicator of the leisure class. To engage in conspicuous leisure is to openly display one's wealth and status, as productive work signified the absence of pecuniary strength and was seen as a mark of weakness. As the leisure class increased their exemption from productive work, that very exemption became honorific and actual participation in productive work became a sign of inferiority. Conspicuous leisure worked very well to designate social status in rural areas, but urbanization <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> that conspicuous leisure was no longer a sufficient means to display pecuniary strength. Urban life requires more obvious displays of status, wealth, and power, which is where conspicuous consumption becomes prominent.|$|E
25|$|The Payment Systems and Netting Act 1998 {{gives the}} board power {{in areas of}} the law that were {{previously}} uncertain. It removed the zero hour rule that allowed a bankruptcy to date a bankruptcy the previous midnight and the Act <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> payments the same day could not be undone. Before the removal of the zero hour rule, the Real Time Gross Settlement system had been violated because payments in the system should inherently not be reversed. Some payments systems had previously agreed to pay and receive obligations to the whole system, rather than merely maintaining their own. But {{in the event of a}} bankruptcy, the bankrupt institution did not pay what it owed back to the solvent parties, while they had to pay their dues to the failed bank. This was later changed, when cheques were deemed void if the bankrupt institution doesn't have the funds to back them up, after the Cheques Act 1986 was amended in 1998. The Trade Practices Act 1974 generally does not allow competitors to make cooperative agreements, but if the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is permitted to make exceptions for competitors making agreements among themselves. The ACCC and the Payments Systems Board are encouraged to work together regarding access and rivalry through the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998.|$|E

500|$|The biggest {{victim of}} the {{repeated}} crashes was [...] leader Christian Vande Velde, who had to retire from the Giro with a broken rib and a hairline fracture of his pelvis. The crashes also <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> Mark Cavendish was not with the main peloton as it approached the finish line; he came to within 15 seconds of the group before abandoning the attempt to reach them, and essentially conceding the pink jersey. Petacchi's second straight stage win gave him the race leadership.|$|E
500|$|As Glee initial success {{pulled in}} a large audience, John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that the early shows [...] "felt fresh, mainly because the motley crew of kids {{had a kind of}} square naïveté." [...] Doyle notes that the early success took Glee away from its {{original}} characters and plot, focusing more on celebrity guests. [...] "The gaiety is gone from Glee. You should have set it in its prime, mere months ago". Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe similarly wrote that [...] "It has become a powerful, promotional machine, long on hype and short on the human feeling--the glee--that once <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> addictive".|$|E
500|$|Varietys Brian Lowry {{called it}} [...] "clever, irreverent, satirical and outfitted" [...] {{but that it}} was [...] "just barely" [...] capable of {{sustaining}} a running time longer than a television episode. Lisa Schwarzbaum praised the voice cast but stated that the [...] "'action' sequences sometimes falter". When comparing the film to the early episodes of the show, Stephen Rowley concluded that the film [...] "has more going for it than the show in its later years, but {{is still a long way}} short of what <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> invigorating". The Monthly critic Luke Davies echoed Lowry's concerns about the length: [...] "everything moves with the whip-crack speed of a half-hour episode. And that's the paradox: it makes the film feel like three episodes strung together. We're in a cinema, and we expect something epic." [...] He opined that [...] "in the great arc that is the history of The Simpsons, this film will come to be seen as oddity rather than apotheosis." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics later {{frequently}} praised {{both the}} film's aesthetic quality and its power. Observing that it {{managed to be}} [...] "horrifying without being a bloodbath (you'll see more gore in a Steven Seagal film)", Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a backwoods masterpiece of fear and loathing". TV Guide thought it was [...] "intelligent" [...] in its [...] "bloodless depiction of violence", while Anton Bitel felt {{the fact that it}} was banned in the United Kingdom was a tribute to its artistry. He pointed out how the quiet sense of foreboding at the beginning of the film grows, until the viewer experiences [...] "a punishing assault on the senses". In Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema, Scott Von Doviak commended its effective use of daylight shots, unusual among horror films, such as the sight of a corpse draped over a tombstone in the opening sequence. Mike Emery of The Austin Chronicle praised the film's [...] "subtle touches"—such as radio broadcasts heard in the background describing grisly murders around Texas—and said that what <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> dreadful was that it never strayed too far from potential reality.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were mostly positive, noting its [...] "hilarious beginning and the nice ending." [...] Dan Iverson of IGN praised the episode, stating that the episode [...] "looks to show that this fifth season {{is going to bring}} the series back to the irreverent basics that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> appealing." [...] Iverson went on to comment that some of the jokes were [...] "extremely funny" [...] and that [...] "the episode had it all, from the Electric Company bit to making fun of people who drive Hummers and watch movies like Madagascar." [...] In the conclusion of his review, Iverson gave the episode an eight out of ten. Brett Love of TV Squad also gave the episode a positive review, calling the installment much better than the previous two episode's from the season, [...] "Stewie Loves Lois" [...] and [...] "Mother Tucker", but criticized the storyline's similarity to the South Park episode [...] "Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes". Love commented negatively on the portrayal of Peter working at the superstore, however, stating, [...] "it's a fine line when they go retarded with Peter. Sometimes it plays really funny, and sometimes it just gets annoying." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck, of the Hollywood Reporter, {{believed}} {{that even though}} Zombie's remake of Carpenter's Halloween was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> [...] "brilliant", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character. By contrast, TV Guide's Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a [...] "scary horror movie", not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own. Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more {{in the footsteps of}} Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper's [...] "savage, greasy-haired '70s" [...] films, which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent [...] "torture porn" [...] horror films. Bill Gibron, of PopMatters, believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter's film to Zombie's remake; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield—with Michael acting as a true [...] "boogeyman"—Zombie focuses more on Michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael went through that would result in his [...] "desire for death".|$|E
