40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{neonates}} with {{spina bifida}} aperta (SBA), leg movements innervated by spinal segments located caudal to the <b>meningomyelocele</b> are transiently present. This study in neonates with SBA aimed {{to determine whether}} the presence of leg movements indicates functional integrity of neuronal innervation and whether these leg movements disappear as a result of dysfunction of upper motor neurons (axons originating cranial to the <b>meningomyelocele)</b> and/or of lower motor neurons (located caudal to the <b>meningomyelocele).</b> METHODS: Leg movements were investigated in neonates with SBA at postnatal day 1 (n = 18) and day 7 (n = 10). Upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction was assessed by neurologic examination (n = 18; disinhibition or inhibition of reflexes, respectively) and by electromyography (n = 12; absence or presence of denervation potentials, respectively). RESULTS: Movements, related to spinal segments caudal to the <b>meningomyelocele,</b> were present in all neonates at postnatal day 1. At day 1, leg movements were associated with signs of both upper (10 of 18) and lower (17 of 18) motor neuron dysfunction caudal to the <b>meningomyelocele.</b> In 7 of 10 neonates restudied after the first postnatal week, leg movements had disappeared. The absence of leg movements coincided with loss of relevant reflexes, which had been present at day 1, indicating progression of lower motor neuron dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the presence of neonatal leg movements does not indicate integrity of functional lower motor neuron innervation by spinal segments caudal to the <b>meningomyelocele.</b> Present observations could explain why fetal surgery {{at the level of the}} <b>meningomyelocele</b> does not prevent loss of leg movements...|$|E
40|$|Deficit {{of neural}} tube closure {{in the initial}} phases of intrauterine {{development}} leads to a gamut of abnormalities ranging from spina-bifida occulta, a relatively benign condition, to encephalocele and <b>meningomyelocele,</b> an anomaly in vertebral bodies, spinal cord and sometimes involving brainstem (in cervical <b>meningomyelocele).</b> <b>Meningomyelocele</b> {{is the most common}} nonlethal malformation in the spectrum of neural tube deficits. The intrinsic challenges associated with the latter disorder warrants tailor-made approaches for providing anaesthesia to the requisite therapeutic surgical interventions. Pediatric patients pose a set of natural barriers because of their ever budding and maturing neurophysiological status, apart from the central neural disease process. Hence, in order to provide optimal neuro-anaesthetic care, the anaesthesiologist must have the knowledge of the outcomes of various pharmacologic interventions on cerebral aerodynamics apart from his professional experience in pediatric neuroanaesthesia.

40|$|Aims: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{study the effects of}} medical {{problems}} associated with spinal cord lesions on functioning - with special interest in work participation and sexual functioning. A special aim was to explore bone mineral density and associated factors in persons with <b>meningomyelocele.</b> Methods: The target population comprised persons with traumatic spinal cord injury or <b>meningomyelocele</b> living in the county of Western Götaland in Sweden. The subject characteristics, prevalence of medical problems and other disorders, as well as primary outcomes, were assessed with a structured questionnaire. In the osteoporosis study a physician and a physical therapist examined all subjects and assessed ambulatory status and the neurological level of the lesion. Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine, hip and forearm was measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. In the workplace intervention study each participant was visited by an ergonomist at the workplace where the working conditions were documented by means of video recordings, questionnaires and the ergonomist's evaluation of the workplace. Results: Work participation rate in Swedish spinal cord lesion population is about two thirds of that in the healthy population (50 % against 75 %). Among the men with traumatic spinal cord injury, neuropathic pain and the presence of other somatic or mental disorders were associated with work participation, whereas most of these associations were not observed in the women with traumatic spinal cord injury or in the persons with <b>meningomyelocele.</b> The results of the workplace intervention study showed that the working conditions of persons with spinal cord lesion can be improved by ergonomic measures. Satisfaction with sexual life was rather low in all subgroups except in the women with <b>meningomyelocele.</b> Medical problems associated with spinal cord lesion, such as incontinence and neuropathic pain, affected satisfaction with sexual life in persons with traumatic spinal cord injury. In persons with <b>meningomyelocele,</b> none of the studied medical problems was associated with satisfaction with sexual life. The results also indicated that osteopenia and osteoporosis are more common among young adults with <b>meningomyelocele</b> than in the normative population. The effect of medical risk factors of osteoporosis on bone mineral density was modified by ambulatory status in this patient group. Conclusions: Medical problems affect functioning in persons with spinal cord lesion. There are, however, some gender differences, as well as differences between persons with congenital and acquired spinal cord lesion. Osteoporosis is a medical problem, which must be considered when treating and rehabilitating persons with <b>meningomyelocele.</b> Key-words: spinal cord injuries, <b>meningomyelocele,</b> rehabilitation, osteoporosis, bone density, employment, sexualit...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Stem {{cells with}} {{potential}} to transform into healthy cells and repair damaged cells may prove beneficial in various congenital malformations. Aim: To explore {{the use of}} stem cells in liver cirrhosis and <b>meningomyelocele.</b> Materials and Methods: During July 2005 to July 2006, stem cells were used in 27 patients; 12 with liver cirrhosis and 15 with <b>meningomyelocele.</b> Autologous stem cells were injected during definite surgery into hepatic artery and portal vein or hepatobiliary radicles for liver cirrhosis or spinal cord and caudal space for <b>meningomyelocele.</b> The pre-operative status of the patient served as control for that patient. Results: The patients with liver cirrhosis were between 1. 5 and 9 months (mean 4. 12 months). Liver cirrhosis was due to extra hepatic biliary atresia (EHBA); neonatal hepatitis and choledochal cyst in 8; 2 and 2 patients, respectively. About five patients expired due to late presentation and ongoing cirrhosis. Follow up results evaluated at 3 - 12 months (n= 7) showed absence of cholangitis (4 / 7); yellow stools (5 / 7); decreased liver firmness (3 / 7); improved liver functions (6 / 7) and improved appetite (6 / 7). Hepatobiliary scan was excretory in 6 / 7 with improved uptake in 4 / 7. Histopathology repeated after stem cells demonstrated comparative improvement in fibrosis in three. The <b>meningomyelocele</b> patients were between 0 and 1 month; 1 - 5 months, and 1 - 4 years in 5; 8 and 2 cases, respectively. 5 had history of rupture. 3 had undergone meningocele repair in past with neurological deficits. Redo surgery for tethered cord was done in 1. Follow up (3 - 11 months) in 14 cases showed improved power in 4 (28 &#x 0025;), dramatic recovery in 3 (22 &#x 0025;), and status quo in 7 (50 &#x 0025;). One patient is still under observation.

40|$|Background: In {{spina bifida}} aperta (SBA), leg {{movements}} caudal to the <b>meningomyelocele</b> {{are present in}} utero, but they disappear shortly after birth. It is unclear whether leg movements disappear by impact of the neuro-developmental malformation or by superimposed traumatic damage. If superimposed traumatic damage is involved, targeted fetal intervention could improve motor outcome. Aim: To characterize neuromuscular pathology in association with perinatal motor function loss in SBA. Patients/methods: In fetal SBA(n= 8; 16 - 40 weeks GA), the median time interval between ultrasound registrations of fetal motor behavior and post-mortem histology was 1 week. Histology was assessed cranial, at and caudal to the <b>meningomyelocele</b> and compared with findings in fetal controls (n= 4). Results: Despite fetal movements caudal to the <b>meningomyelocele</b> (5 / 6), histology indicated muscle fiber alterations (6 / 6) that concurred with neuro-developmental and traumatic spinal defects [Neuro-developmentol defects: spinal ependymal denudation (3 / 8), reduced amount of (caspase 3 -negative) lower motor neurons (LMNs; 8 / 8), aberrant spinal vascularization (8 / 8). Traumatic defects: gliosis (7 / 8), acute/fresh spinal hemorrhages near LMNs (8 / 8) ]. Conclusion: In all delivered SBA patients, recent spinal hemorrhages were superimposed upon pre-existing defects. If early therapeutic strategies can prevent these superimposed secondary spinal hemorrhages, motor outcome may improve. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{correlation}} between the electromyographic examination of the external sphincter muscle and the urodynamic findings in patients with <b>meningomyelocele</b> was evaluated. Urodynamic testing, consisting of cystometry with bladder, urethral and abdominal pressure monitoring was performed with simultaneous electromyography of the external and sphincter muscle in 61 children, 29 boys and 32 girls, divided in groups according to age and to the level of lesion. Normal urodynamic studies were always correlated with normal external sphincter electromyography. In all patients with a high lesion and in 79 % of all others detrusor hyperactivity was correlated with pathological sphincter electromyography. The clinical neurological level of the lesion was not correlated with the function of the detrusor-sphincter mechanism. In 29 % of the patients examined with needle electromyography detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia was found, which is less than in most other published studies. And although dyssynergia is a risk factor for renal deterioration, the authors conclude that its effect on the ureter is less important than in subjects with normal perineal musculature, since 80 % of the examined patients with <b>meningomyelocele</b> showed pathological sphincter electromyography. These findings thus show a significant correlation between electromyography of the external sphincter muscle and the urodynamic findings in <b>meningomyelocele</b> patients, and clearly demonstrate the importance of urodynamic testing with simultaneous external sphincter electromyography, in order to improve both diagnostic accuracy and reliability of follow-up and treatment. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Meningomyelocele</b> is a {{malformation}} {{with high}} prevalence, {{and one of}} its main comorbidities is Arnold-Chiari malformation type II. The intrauterine repair of this defect has been studied to reduce the progressive spinal cord damage during gestation. The purpose of the present review was to describe the evolution of fetal surgery for <b>meningomyelocele</b> repair. Searches on PubMed database were conducted including articles published in the last 10 years. Twenty-seven articles were selected, 16 experimental studies and 11 studies in humans. A recent study demonstrated that the fetal correction results in better prognosis of neurological and psychomotor development, but open surgery, which has being used widely, has considerable maternal risks. Studies in animal and human models show that the endoscopic approach is feasible and leads to lower maternal morbidity rates. Two endoscopic techniques are currently under assessment - one in Germany and another in Brazil, and we believe that the endoscopic approach will be the future technique for prenatal repair of this defect...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesThe {{number of}} {{patients}} allergic to latex has increased significantly. It is crucial to recognize the cases {{in order to prevent}} and apply adequate treatment. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the prevalence of allergy to latex in <b>meningomyelocele</b> patients. Materials and methodsA retrospective evaluation of medical records of patients with <b>meningomyelocele</b> diagnosis from January 2002 to December 2007 was conducted. Patients were grouped into allergics and non-allergics. The comparison of groups for gender was made by the Chi-Squared test, the Student's t test was used to compare age, and Mann-Whitney test was used to compare groups for clinical manifestations of allergy, number of procedures under anesthesia, hospital admissions and vesical catheterizations. ResultsThe mean number of procedures under anesthesia was 7 in the group with allergy and 4 in the group without allergy; this difference was statistically significant (p= 0. 028). The mean number of hospital admissions was 4. 5 in the group with allergy and 3. 4 in group without allergy and mean vesical catheterization was 24. 5 in allergic patients and 21. 7 in non allergic ones. ConclusionsMeningomyelocele patients undergoing multiple procedures under anesthesia have high risk of developing clinical signals of allergy to latex. It is necessary that patients with <b>meningomyelocele</b> diagnosis should undergo exclusively latex-free procedures, avoiding high risk of sensitization and its complications. Specific tests to evaluate sensitization, genetic markers and latex-fruit relationship may contribute to a better understanding of risk factors related to allergy to latex and ways to prevent it...|$|E
