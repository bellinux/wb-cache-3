5|$|Early in the war, these {{aircraft}} {{were used}} primarily to conduct raids and gather intelligence on North Korean ground targets, focused on disrupting North Korean {{supply to the}} front lines. However, as soon as UN forces retreated to Pusan Perimeter following the Battle of Taejon, the Naval aircraft were immediately re purposed for close-air support and airstrikes against North Korean ground troops on the front. These missions were significantly <b>more</b> <b>risky</b> and the aircraft suffered much higher losses due to North Korean ground fire. On August 1, Sebille and his squadron moved to Ashiya Air Field and began conducting missions {{in support of the}} ground forces in Korea. By August 5, Sebille had accrued over 3,000 hours of flying time {{over the course of his}} career.

5|$|When {{animals are}} faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the {{discounting}} of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a <b>more</b> <b>risky</b> choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E
25|$|Prime brokers are broker-dealers {{which offer}} custody and other {{services}} to hedge funds. Prime brokerage has generally been considered as <b>more</b> <b>risky</b> than traditional custody, primarily because hedge funds have been viewed as <b>more</b> <b>risky</b> than institutional investors. Moreover, in the US a hedge fund may execute trades through any number of broker-dealers. But in the settlement process, those trades become the trades of the prime broker, as though the hedge fund had executed the trades only through that broker. The risk of the hedge fund's inability to settle those trades becomes that of the prime broker.|$|E

25|$|Virginia Fortna of Columbia University, however, {{holds that}} {{peacekeeping}} interventions actually do substantively matter following {{the end of}} a civil war. She claims that selection bias, where opponents point only to failed peacekeeping interventions and do not compare these missions to those situations where interventions do not occur, is partly to blame for criticisms. Fortna says that peacekeeping missions rarely go into easily resolvable situations while they are sent into tougher, <b>more</b> <b>risky</b> post war situations where missions are more likely to fail, and peace agreements are unlikely to be committed to. When all factors of a certain peacekeeping case study are properly considered, Fortna shows that peacekeeping missions do in fact help increase the chances of sustained peace after a civil war.|$|E
25|$|Impulsivity is {{characterized}} by actions based on sudden desires, whims, or inclinations rather than careful thought. Individuals with substance abuse {{have higher levels of}} impulsivity, and individuals who use multiple drugs tend to be more impulsive. A number of studies using the Iowa gambling task as a measure for impulsive behavior found that drug using populations made <b>more</b> <b>risky</b> choices compared to healthy controls. There is a hypothesis that the loss of impulse control may be due to impaired inhibitory control resulting from drug induced changes that take place in the frontal cortex. The neurodevelopmental and hormonal changes that happen during adolescence may modulate impulse control that could possibly lead to the experimentation with drugs and may lead to the road of addiction. Impulsivity is thought to be a facet trait in the neuroticism personality domain (overindulgence/negative urgency) which is prospectively associated with the development of substance abuse.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the issue of Islamic Banking and its {{differences}} from the classical, anglo-saxon banking system. It investigates the availability, prices and volatility of Islamic financial instruments during the global financial crisis in comparison to the behavior of similar instruments offered by commercial banks. For this purpose 3 hypothesis, based on conclusions from the state-of-the-art research on Islamic Finance, were tested: (1) because of the prohibition of speculation, high risk aversion and a distinctive form of enterprise financing the equity prices of shariah-compliant firms were less volatile and more stable than other equity prices; (2) the asset portfolio of classical banks were much <b>more</b> <b>riskier</b> than of similar Shariah-compliant banks; (3) the higher level of trust between Islamic financial market participants induced by sharing the same religion, values and the same set of moral and formal rules has reduced in comparison to the classical banking scheme the dry-up of interbank money liquidity caused by the recent financial crisis. The results of the conducted tests indicate that there were no major differences between Shariah-compliant and commercial banks during the recent financial crisis. ...|$|R
