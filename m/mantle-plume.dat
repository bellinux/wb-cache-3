A mantle plume may {{be described as a}} portion of mantle material with a higher heat content than its surroundings. The intrusion of a <b>mantle-plume</b> is inferred to be similar to the intrusion of a salt diapir and the process of diapirism is discussed. The theoretical mechanistic and thermal effects of hot diapirs and the tectonic and metamorphic implications are discussed. Two sets of diapirs, i. e. a first order diapir equal to a <b>mantle-plume</b> and, originating from it, second order diapirs causing hot spots, are invoked to give a reasonable explanation for the Palaeozoic evolution of the continental lithosphere of Western Galicia (NW Spain); the heat-flow pattern in the Rio Grande rift is also elegantly explained in a similar way. The sources of heat that might cause a <b>mantle-plume</b> are discussed but no one can be singled out as the most plausible. Mantle-plumes may be held responsible {{for the creation of a}} zone of weakness that is essential to initiate seafloor spreading, but certainly not every <b>mantle-plume</b> will play that role. The behavioural parameters of a <b>mantle-plume</b> are briefly explored and it is inferred that the heat content might be the most important one...|$|E

It provides a new and more complete scenario for the formation of the Central Asian intracontinental mountain belt, compared with the generally accepted model of the "indenta tion " of the Indian plate into the Eurasian plate. The new model is based on the hypothesis of a complex interaction of lithospheric plates and <b>mantle-plume</b> magmatism. Compilation and comparison of new and published structural, geomorphological, paleomagnetic, isotopic, fission-track, and plume magmatism data from the Baikal area, the Altay, Mongolia, Tien Shan, Pamir, and Tibet show that the main stages of their orogenic evolution and basin sedimentation are closely related in time and space.

Deposits of less redox-sensitive metals, such as gold, show long-term temporal patterns {{that relate to}} first-order changes in an evolving Earth, {{as a result of}} progressively declining heat production and attendant changes in global tectonic processes. Despite abundant evidence for plate tectonics in the early Pre-cambrian, it is evident that plume events were more abundant in a hotter Earth. Episodic growth of juvenile continental crust appears to have been related to short-lived (< 100 m. y.) cata-strophic <b>mantle-plume</b> events and formation of supercontinents, whereas shielding <b>mantle-plume</b> events cor-related with their breakup. Different mineral deposit types are associated with this cycle of supercontinent for-mation and breakup. Broadly synchronous with juvenile continental crust formation was the development of subcontinental lithospheric mantle, which evolved due to progressively declining heat flow and decreasing plume activity. Archean subcontinental lithospheric mantle has a distinct mineralogical composition and is buoyant, whereas later lithosphere was progressively more dense. Changes in the buoyancy of both oceanic lithosphere and subcontinental lithospheric mantle led to evolution of tectonic scenarios in which buoyant, roughly equidimensional, early Precambrian cratons were rimmed by Proterozoic or Phanerozoic linear elon...|$|E

Isotope-geochronological methods were applied to orthogneisses from a high-grade complex near Mellid and from the blastomylonitic graben between Malpica and Tuy, a mica-bearing eclogite lens from the same graben, and to a two-mica granite from the area near La Guardia. A gravity survey was carried out in part of the belt of sub-circular complexes surrounding the Ordenes basin. The geochronological investigations revealed ages of about 500 Ma to 320 Ma for older elements in the Hercynian basement of Galicia. Geochemical investigations in the Cabo Ortegal complex showed that the granulites and eclogites form a group that was part of an older, pre-existing continental crust. The ultramafic rocks of the Cabo Ortegal complex may have been derived in two melting episodes from a proposed <b>mantle-plume.</b> It is possible that the metagabbros in the complex originated in the second melting episode. The gravity survey showed the existence of three positive anomalies, situated below high-grade complexes near Santiago de Compostela, near Mellid and near Sobrado, that can be interpreted as ultramafic diapirs.

40|$|The Ethiopian dome, {{comprising}} the Ethiopian and Yemeni Plateaus, {{formed as a}} result of the uplift of Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Ethiopian rift shoulders; the uplift was essentially due to a <b>mantle-plume</b> activity. A digital elevation model of this region before rifting, constructed by using the rotation of its constituent plates and pulling down the rift shoulders, reveals that important high areas existed before rifting. These highs are interpreted to be the result of mantle plume activity. A fast Fourier transform was used to smooth the digital elevation model prerift dome before a tomomorphometric analysis was applied to quantify the orientation of each digital elevation model horizontal slice.

40|$|The Proterozoic Mary Kathleen Fold Belt {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{intensely}} deformed fold belts within the Mt Isa Inlier (northwest Queensland), and contains key evidence for both extension and shortening, as well as a protracted thermal history culminating in a high temperature, low pressure amphibolite facies metamorphism. An early phase of extension (1780 - 1730 Ma) may have initially been responsible for basin development, and was subsequently associated with intense ductile shearing and multiple magma injection in a lower plate, and minor folding, extensional fracturing and emplacement of discrete intrusions in a more brittle upper plate. The subsequent regional deformation (D) and metamorphism (1600 - 1500 Ma) involved east-west directed compression, locally producing a variety of fold interference patterns by overprinting of F folds. This deformation resulted in tight folding of the early zone of high D strains into a large anticlinorium (the Wonga Belt). East of this zone, the effects of D dominate. The peak of regional amphibolite facies metamorphism (550 - 650 °C, 300 - 400 MPa) was synchronous with the F 2 folding event. Retrogression (and F deformation) involved initial isobaric cooling, in common with some other Australian and Antarctic Proterozoic terranes. The belt is thus dissimilar in many regards to modern fold belts developed during plate collisional tectonics. The two-phase history of extension and shortening, with both phases involving elevated geothermal gradients, is explained in terms of a <b>mantle-plume</b> model in an intra-cratonic setting. The extension is inferred to be a consequence of <b>mantle-plume</b> ascent, with subsequent shortening due to thermal decay as the plume subsided. Elevated geotherms in the shortening phase may have been generated by magma underplating at the base of the lithosphere, delamination of the lithosphere, upward magma migration, and/or redistribution of radiogenic elements by magmatism. The general similarity of tectono-thermal styles and synchroneity of radiogenic age groupings across many Australian mid-Proterozoic regions suggests that this proposed two-phase process may have been an important factor in Proterozoic crustal evolution...|$|E
40|$|After > 500 Ma of absence, major Northern Hemisphere glaciations {{appeared}} {{during the}} Plio-Pleistocene, with Greenland leading other northern areas. Here, we propose that three major solid-Earth processes underpinned build-up of the Greenland ice-sheet. First, a <b>mantle-plume</b> pulse, responsible for the North Atlantic Igneous Province at ~ 60 Ma, regionally thinned the lithosphere. Younger plume pulses led to uplift, which accelerated at ~ 5 Ma, lifting {{the parts of the}} East Greenland margin closest to Iceland to elevations of more than 3 km above sea level. Second, plate-tectonic reconstruction shows a ~ 6 ° northward component of Greenland motion relative to the mantle since ~ 60 Ma. Third, a concurrent northward rotation of the entire mantle and crust towards the pole, dubbed True Polar Wander (TPW), contributed an additional ~ 12 ° change in latitude. These global geodynamic processes preconditioned Greenland to sustain long-term glaciation, emphasizing the role of solid-Earth processes in driving long-term global climatic transitions...|$|E

Petrographic examination has revealed three distinct metamorphic mineral assemblages: the pre-peak prograde assemblage (M 1) of hornblende + plagioclase + quartz + ilmenite + magnetite occurring as inclusions within garnet and pyroxene grains, peak assemblage (M 2) of orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene + plagioclase + garnet + hornblende + quartz + ilmenite + magnetite, and post-peak assemblage (M 3) represented by garnet + quartz and garnet + ilmenite/magnetite symplectites. Pseudosection modeling using THERMOCALC in the NCFMASHTO model {{system for a}} representative sample constrains the P-T conditions of M 1, M 2 and M 3 stages at 660 - 730 °C/< 6. 6 kbar, 800 - 820 °C/ 8. 0 - 8. 5 kbar and 686 - 710 °C/ 7. 6 - 8. 6 kbar, respectively. The results of petrology and quantitative P-T pseudosection modeling define an anticlockwise P-T path involving near-isobaric cooling following the peak medium-pressure granulite-facies metamorphism, suggesting that the metamorphism of the Yishui Group was most likely related to the intrusion and underplating of mantle-derived magmas. Although the underplating of voluminous mantle-derived magmas leading to granulite-facies metamorphism with an anticlockwise P-T path involving isobaric cooling may occur in continental magmatic arc regions, above hot spots driven by mantle plumes, or in continental rift environments, a mantle plume model is favored because this model can reasonably interpret many other geological features of Late Archean basement rocks from the Western Shandong Complex in the Eastern Block of the North China Craton {{as well as their}} anticlockwise P-T paths involving isobaric cooling. The relatively cooler <b>mantle-plume</b> head heated the crust initially, causing amphibolite-facies metamorphism (M 1). Subsequently, the relatively hotter <b>mantle-plume</b> tail heated the crust, causing granulite-facies metamorphism (M 2). Finally, a near-isobaric cooling process (M 3) occurred when the mantle plume ceased to heat the crust. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of the Rodinia supercontinent is widely accepted, although the distribution of its constituent cratons and mobile belts and the process and timing of its break-up remain hotly debated. Several models predict that Rodinia break-up involved Neoproterozoic rifting between formerly juxtaposed East Antarctica and Laurentia. However, the paucity of geophysical exploration has hampered tracing Neoproterozoic rifting in East Antarctica, adding uncertainty to Rodinia reconstructions. We interpret new airborne gravity data to reveal the crustal architecture of the Neoproterozoic rifted margin of Rodinia in East Antarctica. A linear, ~ 900 km long, positive Airy isostatic gravity anomaly is recognised along {{the western edge of}} the Wilkes Subglacial Basin. Gravity and magnetic models reveal a ~ 10 km thick mafic body emplaced along the leading edge of the Precambrian craton, beneath interpreted Neoproterozoic rift basins. We infer that voluminous mid-crustal(?) mafic magmatism accompanied Rodinia break-up in this part of East Antarctica, and was perhaps coeval with the more weakly magmatic Adelaide Rift Complex in Australia and with continental rifts and <b>mantle-plume</b> related magmatism in South China...|$|E
40|$|Paradoxically, {{the lists}} of “proxies” of both plate- and plume-related {{settings}} are devoid of even a mention of the high-grade metamorphic rocks (granulite, amphibolite and high-temperature eclogite facies). However, the granulite-gneiss belts and areas which contain these rocks, have a regional distribution in both the Precambrian and the Phanerozoic records. The origin and evolution of the granulite-gneiss belts correspond to the activity of plumes expressed in vigorous heating of the continental crust; intraplate magmatism; formation of rift depressions filled with sediments, juvenile lavas, and pyroclastic flow deposits; and metamorphism of lower and middle crustal complexes under conditions of granulite and high-temperature amphibolite facies that spreads over the fill of rift depressions also. Granulite-gneiss complexes of the East European Craton form {{one of the main}} components of the large oval intracontinental tectonic terranes of regional or continental rank. Inclusion of the granulite-gneiss complexes from Eastern Europe, North and South America, Africa, India, China and Australia in discussion of the problem indicated in the title to this paper, suggests consideration of a significant change in existing views on the relations between the plate- and plume-tectonic processes in geological history, as well as in supercontinent assembly and decay. The East European and North American cratons are fragments of the long-lived supercontinent Lauroscandia. After its appearance at ~ 2. 8 Ga, the crust of this supercontinent evolved {{under the influence of the}} sequence of powerful mantle plumes (superplumes) up to ~ 0. 85 Ga. During this time Lauroscandia was subjected to rifting, partial breakup and the following reconstruction of the continent. The processes of plate-tectonic type (rifting with the transition to spreading and closing of the short-lived ocean with subduction) within Lauroscandia were controlled by the superplumes. Revision of the nature of the granulite-gneiss complexes has led to a fundamental new understanding of: a more important role than envisaged previously for <b>mantle-plume</b> processes in the juvenile additions to the continental crust, especially during the Neoarchaean-Proterozoic; the existence of the supercontinent Lauroscandia from ~ 2. 80 to 0. 85 Ga; the leading role of mantle plumes in the interaction of plate- and plume-tectonics in the Neoarchaean-Proterozoic history of Lauroscandia and perhaps of the continental crust as a whole. We propose that the evolution of the geodynamic settings of the Earth’s crust origin can be represented as a spiral sequence: the interaction of <b>mantle-plume</b> processes and embryonic microplate tectonics during the Palaeo-Mezoarchaean (~ 3. 8 – 2. 8 Ga) → plume-tectonics and local plume-driven plate-tectonics (~ 2. 80 – 0. 55 Ga) → Phanerozoic plate tectonics along with a reduced role of mantle plumes...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{places in the}} Emeishan Large Igneous Province (ELIP) where highly {{magnesian}} volcanic or intrusive rocks accompany more abundant flood basalts. The high-Mg rocks vary in composition from LREE-depleted, low-Ti komatiites to LREE-enriched, high-Ti picrites. These magmas carried cognate olivine phenocrysts with Fo content higher than 91 mol% indicating that these olivines crystallized and equilibrated with high-Mg melts. The maximum measured Fo content from the Dali area is 93. 5 mol% which, depending on the KD value used, indicates a MgO content of 23 – 25 wt. % for the parental melt. The high estimated MgO wt. % values provide evidence for a hot portion of the Emeishan <b>mantle-plume</b> head with a potential mantle temperature of ca. 1700 °C. Melt inclusions trapped within olivine phenocrysts have compositions {{similar to those of}} the host lavas but with a higher variability in the abundance of incompatible trace elements. The inclusions yield a calculated maximum MgO content of ca. 22 wt. % for the melt. The compositional and isotopic variability of the high-Mg magmas in the ELIP is akin to that observed in basaltic rocks, which are divided into low-Ti and high-Ti types, suggesting that most of the basalts were developed in deep crustal magma chambers by fractional crystallization and mixing processes from primitive magmas...|$|E
40|$|Oceanic {{plateaus}} with high–Mg {{rocks in}} the present-day oceanic crust have attracted much attention for their proposed <b>mantle-plume</b> origins and abnormally high mantle potential temperatures (Tp). However, equivalent rocks in ancient oceanic environments are usually poorly preserved because of deformation and metamorphism. Here we present petrological, geochronological and geochemical data for pillow lavas from Cambrian ophiolites in the Lajishan and Yongjing regions of the South Qilian Accretionary Belt (SQAB), from {{the southern part of}} the Qilian Orogen, northern China. Three rock groups can be identified geochemically: (1) sub-alkaline basalts with enriched mid- ocean ridge basalt (E-MORB) affinity; (2) alkaline basalts with oceanic island basalt (OIB) features, probably derived from partial melting of an enriched mantle source; and (3) picrites with MgO (18 – 22 wt. %). Cr-numbers [Cr# = Cr/(Cr + Al) ] of spinels from the picrites suggest 18 – 21 % degree of partial melting at the estimated mantle potential temperature (Tp) of 1489 – 1600 °C, equivalent to values of Cenozoic Hawaiian picrites (1500 – 1600 °C). Zircons from one gabbro sample yielded a U–Pb Concordia age of 525 ± 3 Ma, suggesting the oceanic crust formed in the Cambrian. Available evidence suggests that Cambrian mantle plume activity is preserved in the South Qilian Accretionary Belt, and influenced the regional tectonics: “jamming” of the trench by thick oceanic crust explains the emplacement and preservation of the oceanic plateau, and gave rise to the generation of concomitant Ordovician inner-oceanic island arc basalts via re-organisation of the subduction zones in the region...|$|E
40|$|The European Cenozoic Rift System (ECRIS) transects Variscan basement, Permo-Carboniferous troughs and Late Permian to Mesozoic series, {{deposited}} in thermal sag basins, which are exposed on rift-related arches. We have analysed processes governing {{the transformation of}} the orogenically destabilized Variscan lithosphere into end-Cretaceous stabilized cratonic lithosphere, prior to its renewed Cenozoic rift-related destabilization. In the ECRIS area, crustal and lithospheric thicknesses at present are in the range of 24 - 35 km and 60 - 120 km, respectively. The Variscan orogen was characterized {{at the time of its}} end-Westphalian consolidation by 45 - 60 km deep crustal roots, marking major sutures. During the Stephanian-Early Permian wrench-induced collapse of the Variscan orogen, subducted lithospheric slabs were detached, causing upwelling of the asthenosphere, thermal thinning and/or partial delamination of the lithospheric mantle, and regional uplift. By mid-Permian times, the crust was thinned to 28 - 35 km owing to its regional erosional unroofing, localized mechanical stretching and the interaction of mantle-derived melts with its basal parts. By mid-Permian times, when the temperature of the asthenosphere returned to ambient levels, thermal subsidence of the lithosphere commenced, controlling development of a system of Late Permian and Mesozoic intracratonic basins. These experienced repeated minor subsidence accelerations, related to the build-up of far-field stresses, which did not involve renewed lithospheric destabilization. Modelling of observed subsidence curves indicates that during the mid-Permian lithospheric thicknesses ranged in the ECRIS area between 40 and 80 km, but had increased by the end of the Cretaceous to 100 - 120 km.

Although previous K-Ar determinations divide the three main volcanic formations of the archipelago (Remédios, Quixaba and São José formations) into two age groups, a few ages conflicting with the stratigraphic framework were suspected to suffer from excess argon. To evaluate {{the presence or absence}} of excess Ar and to improve the geochronological database for the archipelago, we have dated, by the laser incremental-heating 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method, the exact same hand specimens previously dated by K-Ar. The 22 samples studied here yield plateau ages for at least one of the two grains analyzed and none of the specimens contain significant excess Ar. Our results derive a chronostratigraphic sequence for the archipelago that is consistent with the earlier K-Ar determinations. The main discrepancy is related to some basanitic rocks of São José formation, interpreted as the youngest eruptive products which are in fact coeval with the oldest subareal volcanic activity at Fernando de Noronha. Our revised eruptive chronology defines a hiatus of nearly 3 Ma separating an older period of volcanism between 12. 5 ± 0. 1 and 9. 0 ± 0. 1 Ma comprising the Remédios and São José formations and a younger episode forming the Quixaba formation between 6. 2 ± 0. 1 and 1. 3 ± 0. 1 Ma. Moreover, these results confirm that much of the activity at Fernando de Noronha was contemporaneous with alkaline volcanism well onshore in northeastern Brazil, supporting the suggestion that this hotspot may be a product of small-scale, plate-driven convection in the upper mantle...|$|E
40|$|Venusian channel meanders {{properties}} generally follow terrestrial river {{trends of}} wavelength (L) to width (W) ratios, suggesting an equilibrium adjustment of channel form. The unusually low L/W values for some sinuous rilles probably indicate modification of original meander patterns by lava-erosional channel widening. A drainage channel constructed by typical basaltic lavas can be significantly deepened and widened by highly fluid and hot superheated tholeiitic basalt or ultramafic lava to form sinuous rilles. Canali-type channels are unique {{because of their}} great lengths (up to 6800 km) and nearly constant channel cross sectional shapes along their paths. Common terrestrial-type tholeiite lava cannot sustain a superheated and turbulent state for the long distances required for thermal erosion of canali within allowable discharge rates. If canali formed mainly by constructional processes, sustained discharge rates might travel the observed distances. An exotic low-temperature, low-viscosity lava like carbonatite or sulfur seems to be required for the erosional genesis of canali. The "Outflow Channel" has a morphology {{similar to that of}} terrestrial catastrophic flood channels and Martian outflow channels. Calculated discharge rates and power/unit area imply that the channel was carved by very energetic lava flows. Valley network formation seems to require sapping processes which may be caused by low-viscosity lavas moving through a relatively permeable, fractured, medium. The close associations of many sinuous rilles with coronae leads to the hypothesis that <b>mantle-plume</b> volcanism caused the high-effusion and sustained lava eruptions essential for sinuous rill formation. Canali lengths exceed the lengths of other common volcanic channel types on Venus, implying a large volume of lava and long duration of the eruption. An hypothesized global resurfacing event late in history may be responsible for canali formation. Longitudinal profiles of canali-type channels show clear evidence of deformation by plains tectonism. Deformation occurred at multiple scales as evidenced in the profiles. The range of lava channel morphology on Venus is wider than for other terrestrial planets and the Moon. This is probably attributed to the volcanological conditions unique to Venus and to a lack of intense erosional processes...|$|E

Bulk rock compositions of 52 analyzed samples (including samples from 32 recent borehole sections), as well as the compositions of olivine and spinel phenocrysts, reveal significant temporal variations in the composition of the Mauritius magmas. Two distinct compositional groups are identified based on their major and trace element compositions. The Group 1 basalts comprise the Younger Series, Intermediate Series and the earlier products of the Older Series rocks, and have higher MgO (7. 6 - 13. 6 wt. %) and lower K 2 O (0. 2 - 0. 5 wt. %) and La/Sm (2. 1 - 3. 5) compared to Group 2 basalts (MgO 6. 2 - 9. 2 wt. %; K 2 O 1. 0 - 1. 5 wt. %; La/Sm 3. 6 - 4. 1), which exclusively encompass the later differentiation products erupted during the end of the Older Series volcanism, denoted as Older Differentiated (OD) Series. Petrographic and mineralogic studies further confirm the presence of two distinct groups. Relatively primitive olivine compositions (Fo: 87 - 80) in Group 1 rocks are characterized by increasing CaO (0. 2 to 0. 3 wt. %) with decreasing Fo content, whereas in Group 2 rocks olivine (Fo: 86 - 80) show decreasing CaO (0. 4 to 0. 3 wt. %) with decreasing Fo content. Olivine-hosted spinel inclusions also show strong compositional differences between groups 1 and 2. Unusually Al-rich spinels (compared to that usually found in plume derived magma) and the positive Sr anomalies in Group I rocks suggest assimilation of crustal gabbros by the plume magmas. We propose a laterally heterogeneous plume and the contributions from variable plume components to account for the compositional differences observed in the two Mauritian lava groups. The early-Shield building Older Series lavas (oldest Group 1 lavas), characterized with a relatively less enriched trace element abundances, most likely derive from extensive melting of a depleted peridotite matrix in the core of the plume. Melting of this already depleted source produced the later Intermediate and Younger Series eruptions. Towards the late-shield stage, melts presumably derive from the enriched pyroxenite/eclogite components in the outer part of the plume...|$|E

The CAMP tholeiites occur only {{in the western part of}} the basin and have been described as low and high-Ti. Here we document the occurrence of two sub-groups among the high-Ti tholeiites in the Western Maranhão basin. The major and trace elements and the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios define three chemical groups corresponding to the low-Ti (TiO 2 3 wt. %) western Maranhão basin tholeiites (WMBT). The new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar plateau ages obtained on plagioclase separates for high-Ti (199. 7 ± 2. 4 Ma) and evolved high-Ti WMBT (197. 2 ± 0. 5 Ma and 198. 2 ± 0. 6 Ma) are indistinguishable and identical to those of previously analyzed low-Ti WMBT (198. 5 ± 0. 8 Ma) and to the mean 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age of the CAMP (199 ± 2. 4 Ma). We also present the first Re-Os isotopic data for CAMP basalts. The low and high-Ti samples display mantle-like initial (187 Os/ 188 Os) i ranging from 0. 1267 to 0. 1299, while the evolved high-Ti samples are more radiogenic ((187 Os/ 188 Os) i up to 0. 184) We propose that the high-Ti WMBT were derived from the sub-lithospheric asthenosphere, and contaminated during ascent by interaction with the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The evolved high-Ti WMBT were derived from the same asthenospheric source but experienced crustal contamination. The chemical characteristics of the low-Ti group can be explained by partial melting of the most fertile portions of the SCLM metasomatized during paleo-subduction. Alternatively, the low-Ti WMBT could be derived from the sub-lithospheric asthenosphere but the resulting melts may have undergone contamination by the SCLM. The occurrences of high-Ti basalts are apparently not restricted to the area of initial continental disruption which may bring into question previous interpretations such as those relating high-Ti CAMP magmatism to the initiation of Atlantic ridge spreading or as the expression of a deep mantle plume. We propose that the CAMP magmatism in the Maranhão basin may be attributed to local hotter mantle conditions due to the combined effects of edge-driven convection and large-scale mantle warming under the Pangea supercontinent. The involvement of a <b>mantle-plume</b> with asthenosphere-like isotopic characteristics cannot be ruled out either as one of the main source components of the WMBT or as a heat supplier...|$|E

In order to enhance the validity of the path-average approximation, we implement the automated inversion of surface- and S-wave forms with a three-dimensional (3 -D) reference model. Linear equations obtained from the processing of all the seismograms of the data set are inverted for seismic velocity variations also relative to a 3 -D reference, in this study composed of a 3 -D model of the crust and a one-dimensional (1 -D), global-average depth profile in the mantle below. Waveform information is related to shear- and compressional-velocity structure within approximate waveform sensitivity areas. We use two global triangular grids of knots with approximately equal interknot spacing within each: a finely spaced grid for integration over sensitivity areas and a rougher-spaced one for the model parametrization. For the tomographic inversion we use LSQR with horizontal and vertical smoothing and norm damping. We invert for isotropic variations in S- and P-wave velocities but also allow for S-wave azimuthal anisotropy—in order to minimize errors due to possible mapping of anisotropy into isotropic heterogeneity. The lateral resolution of the resulting isotropic upper-mantle images is a few hundred kilometres, varying with data sampling. We validate the imaging technique with a ‘spectral-element’ resolution test: inverting a published global synthetic data set computed with the spectral-element method using a laterally heterogeneous mantle model we are able to reconstruct the synthetic model accurately. This test confirms both {{the accuracy of the}} implementation of the method and the validity of the JWKB and path-average approximations as applied in it. Reviewing the tomographic model, we observe that low-Sv-velocity anomalies beneath mid-ocean ridges and backarc basins extend down to 100 km depth only, shallower than according to some previous tomographic models; this presents a close match to published estimates of primary melt production depth ranges there. In the seismic lithosphere beneath cratons, unambiguous high velocity anomalies extend to 200 km. Pronounced low-velocity zones beneath cratonic lithosphere are rare; where present (South America; Tanzania) they are neighboured by volcanic areas near cratonic boundaries. The images of these low-velocity zones may indicate hot material—possibly of <b>mantle-plume</b> origin—trapped or spreading beneath the thick cratonic lithosphere...|$|E
40|$|The complex {{geophysical}} 3 D {{model of}} the Earth's crust and the upper mantle is created for the Archaean Karelian Craton and the Late Palaeoproterozoic accretionary Svecofennian Orogen of the southeastern Fennoscandian Shield {{with the use of}} methods of complex inversion of geophysical data based on stochastic description of interrelations of physical properties of the medium (density, P-wave velocity, and heat generation). To develop the model, we use results of deep seismic studies, gravity and surficial heat flow data on the studied region. Numerical solutions of 3 D problems are obtained in the spherical setting with an allowance for the Earth's surface topography. The geophysical model is correlated with the regional geological data on the surface and results of seismic CMP studies along 4 B, FIRE- 1 and FIRE- 3 - 3 A profiles. Based on results of complex geophysical simulation and geological interpretation of the 3 D model, the following conclusions are drawn. (1) The nearly horizontal density layering of the continental crust is superimposed on the previously formed geological structure; rock differentiation by density is decreasing with depth; the density layering is controlled by the recent and near-recent state of the crust, but can be disturbed by the latest deformations. (2) Temperature variations at the Moho are partially determined by local variations of heat generation in the mantle, which, in turn, are related to local features of its origin and transformation. (3) The concept of the lower continental crust being a reflectivity zone and the concept of the lower continental crust being a layer of high density and velocity are not equivalent: the lower crust is the deepest, high-density element of near-horizontal layering, whereas the seismic image of the reflectivity zone is primarily related to transformation of the crust as a result of magmatic under- and intraplating under conditions of extension and <b>mantle-plume</b> activity. (4) At certain combinations of crustal thickness and temperature at the level of Moho discontinuity, the crust in a platform region can be transformed into eclogites. In this case, the crust–mantle boundary is determined by quantitative proportions of the rocks that underwent eclogitization or escaped this process and by corresponding density and velocity values. (5) High compaction of rocks in the crust under lithostatic loading cannot be explained by «simple» concepts of metamorphism and/or rock compaction, which are based on laboratory studies of rock samples and mathematical simulations; this is an evidence of the existence of additional, quite strong mechanisms providing for reversible changes of the rocks. </span...|$|E
40|$|The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), emplaced at the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) {{boundary}} (- 200 Ma), {{is among}} the largest igneous provinces on Earth. The Maranhao basin in NE Brazil is located around 700 km inland and 2000 km {{from the site of}} the earliest Pangea disruption. The CAMP tholeiites occur only {{in the western part of}} the basin and have been described as low and high-Ti. Here we document the occurrence of two sub-groups among the high-Ti tholeiites in the Western Maranhao basin. The major and trace elements and the Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios define three chemical groups corresponding to the low-Ti (TiO(2)) 3 wt. %) western Maranhao basin tholeiites (WMBT). The new (40) Ar/(39) Ar plateau ages obtained on plagioclase separates for high-Ti (199. 7 +/- 2. 4 Ma) and evolved high-Ti WMBT (197. 2 +/- 0. 5 Ma and 198. 2 +/- 0. 6 Ma) are indistinguishable and identical to those of previously analyzed low-Ti WMBT (198. 5 +/- 0. 8 Ma) and to the mean (40) Ar/(39) Ar age of the CAMP (199 +/- 2. 4 Ma). We also present the first Re-Os isotopic data for CAMP basalts. The low and high-Ti samples display mantle-like initial ((187) Os/(188) Os) (i) ranging from 0. 1267 to 0. 1299, while the evolved high-Ti samples are more radiogenic (((187) Os/ (188) Os) (i) up to 0. 184) We propose that the high-Ti WMBT were derived from the sub-lithospheric asthenosphere, and contaminated during ascent by interaction with the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The evolved high-Ti WMBT were derived from the same asthenospheric source but experienced crustal contamination. The chemical characteristics of the low-Ti group can be explained by partial melting of the most fertile portions of the SCLM metasomatized during paleo-subduction. Alternatively, the low-Ti WMBT could be derived from the sub-lithospheric asthenosphere but the resulting melts may have undergone contamination by the SCLM. The occurrences of high-Ti basalts are apparently not restricted to the area of initial continental disruption which may bring into question previous interpretations such as those relating high-Ti CAMP magmatism to the initiation of Atlantic ridge spreading or as the expression of a deep mantle plume. We propose that the CAMP magmatism in the Maranhao basin may be attributed to local hotter mantle conditions due to the combined effects of edge-driven convection and large-scale mantle warming under the Pangea supercontinent. The involvement of a <b>mantle-plume</b> with asthenosphere-like isotopic characteristics cannot be ruled out either as one of the main source components of the WMBT or as a heat supplier.

40|$|The Curdimurka Subgroup is {{the upper}} {{unit of the}} Callanna Group, the basal group of a thick Neoproterozoic {{metasedimentary}} dominated succession that is preserved as the Adelaide Fold Belt. Throughout the fold belt, the Curdimurka Subgroup typically crops out as megaclasts within breccias, the majority of which formed as salt diapirs or other salt-tectonic related bodies. However, within the Willouran Trough, a depocentre that formed early {{in the evolution of}} the northern Adelaide Fold Belt, the package is less fragmentary, albeit bounded by tectonic and brecciated contacts. In this type area of the Curdimurka Subgroup, about 6, 000 m of semi-coherent strata are preserved. By examining the stratigraphy and structure of the Curdimurka Subgroup, this study intends to develop an understanding of the early development of the northern Adelaide Fold Belt. Deposition of the Curdimurka Subgroup was mainly in low energy, shallow water to emergent conditions, with periods of sub-wave base deposition. Evidence from evaporite mineralogy and stable isotope geochemistry suggest that it was deposited in marine conditions, but a lacustrine setting cannot be ruled out. Curdimurka Subgroup depocentres evolved within a rift environment, subsequent to an initial phase of syn-rift, <b>mantle-plume</b> related volcanism. The outcropping part of the succession is lacking in coarse-grained rudaceous facies, a feature interpreted to record sedimentation distal to basin-marginal sediment input points. Detrital zircon age populations demonstrate a clear upsection trend from proximalto distal-source area contribution, a trend which is consistent with conceptual models of broadening drainage patterns with increasing rift basin maturity. Field relationships show that the area was subject to three deformation events. D 1 produced a diverse array of macroscopic structures, including listric normal faults, inclined to recumbent folds and low angle reverse faults. Deformation is interpreted to have accommodated bulk extension associated with gravity spreading above a décollement positioned at the base of the Curdimurka Subgroup. Localised compressional structures formed in response to translation above perturbations along both the décollement surface, and additional layer-subparallel fault zones positioned higher in the Curdimurka Subgroup succession. Withdrawal and local diapirism of a parent salt layer positioned in older Arkaroola Subgroup strata provided the gravitation instability to drive D 1. The timing of this event is constrained by associated high level accommodation development, involving complex sub-basin growth, during Cryogenian Umberatana Group sedimentation, D 2 produced upright, northwest – southeast trending folds with a penetrative axial plane cleavage, and northeast dipping reverse faults. D 3 produced open, southwest trending folds, local refolding of F 2, and a spaced cleavage oriented at a high angle to bedding. Both D 2 and D 3 occurred during a Cambrian basin inversion event, the Delamerian Orogeny. Monazite geochronology shows that peak metamorphism occurred during the Delamerian Orogen, at 509 ± 5 Ma. A second thermal event occurred at 429 ± 9 Ma, approximately contemporaneous with the intrusion of the British Empire Granite in the Mt Painter Inlier, 130 km east of the study area...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the factors controlling the petrogenesis and chemical alteration of oceanic layer 2 basalts {{recovered from the}} margins and interior of the Nazca plate in the southeast Pacific. Specifically, the extent and nature of fractional crystallization, spreading-rate variations, proximity to mantle plumes and prominent fracture zones, mantle source-rock heterogeneities, and secondary alteration are evaluated {{as some of the}} more salient factors influencing the composition of upper oceanic lithsophere of the plate. A total of 274 analyses from 88 locations are available for this purpose, and many analyses are of crust generated at the fastest spreading part of the world’s mid-ocean ridge system, the East Pacific Rise. We find that oxidative, low-temperature sea-water alteration, extensive shallow-level fractional crystallization, and mantle source-rock inhomogeneities are the most important factors. The most pronounced effects of oxidative alteration (high Fe 2 O 3 /FeO ratios and K 2 O contents; low MgO abundances; preponderance of a celadonite-iron oxide secondary mineral assemblage) are observed in older basalts (< 10 m. y.) dredged from topographic highs on the plate interior, whereas basalts dredged from the crestal portions of the East Pacific Rise and the Galapagos spreading center show only minimal chemical effects of alteration. Only where drilling or recent tectonism has made possible the recovery of basalts from lower in the crustal section are the effects of nonoxidative (hydrothermal) alteration preserved (low Fe 2 O 3 /FeO ratios and K 2 O contents; high MgO abundances; smectite-dominated secondary mineral assemblage). Extensive shallow-level fractional crystallization, involving plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and olivine, is clearly the most important process controlling the range in composition of basalts observed in many areas; Fe-Ti basalts are the end products of this process and are common on the plate. Clinopyroxene fractionation is required for the formation of many of these highly evolved basalts, and this is indicated by observed phenocryst assemblages, normative mineralogy, standard variation diagrams and petrogenetic modeling. First-order regional differences in the composition of mantle source rocks are required to explain the pronounced light-rare-earth-element enrichment and high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of basalts associated with suspected <b>mantle-plume</b> activity of Easter Island and the Galapagos Isalnds. Less pronounced mantle source-rock heterogeneity may be responsible for the occurrence of mid-ocean ridge basalts with similar major-element abundances but markedly different rare-earth-element patterns. Except for fracture-zone offsets near 85 ° and 95 °W longitude along the Galapagos spreading center, we find little evidence supporting the concept that such prominent offsets may be compositional interfaces between opposing rise-crest segments of the East Pacific Rise. Continuous compositional variation exists along the East Pacific Rise, although basalts tend to become somewhat more primitive as the Nazca-Pacific-Cocos triple junction is approached. Compared to basalts from the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge, basalts analyzed from the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise and the Galapagos Rise are significantly more evolved (higher FeO*/MgO ratios and TiCh contents; lower CaO and AI 2 O 3 abundances). Such systematic differences in major-element abundances appear related to a near order-of-magnitude difference in spreading rates of the divergent plate margins and to the size and continuity of subaxial magma chambers that can be physically maintained beneath them. It is proposed that an enhanced thermal regime beneath a fast-spreading center favors the existence of a large, steady-state magma chamber. Primitive magma entering such a reservoir will mix with much larger volumes of highly evolved magma, thereby reducing the probability that primitive magma can be erupted on the sea floor. The observed extensive fractionation required to account for the highly evolved character of Nazca plate basalts would require a thicker layer of oceanic layer 3 cumulate; available seismic refraction data support the existence of such a layer for older crust of the Nazca plate...|$|E
