2500|$|The {{period of}} the 11th and 12th centuries was one of consolidation, {{preceding}} the most momentous era in Mongol history, the era of Genghis Khan. During those centuries, the vast region of deserts, <b>mountains,</b> and <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> was inhabited by people resembling each other in racial, cultural, and linguistic characteristics; ethnologically they were essentially Mongol. The similarities among the Mongols, Göktürk, and Tatars who inhabited this region cause considerable ethnic and historical confusion. Generally, the Mongols and the closely related Tatars inhabited the northern and the eastern areas; the Göktürk (who already had begun to spread over western Asia and southeastern Europe) were {{in the west and}} the southwest; the Tangut, who were more closely related to the Tibetans than were the other nomads and who were not a Turkic people, were in eastern Xinjiang, Gansu, and western Inner Mongolia. The Liao state was homogeneous, and the Khitan had begun to lose their nomadic characteristics. The Khitan built cities and exerted dominion over their agricultural subjects as a means of consolidating their empire. To the west and the northwest of Liao were many other Mongol tribes, linked together in various tenuous alliances and groupings, but with little national cohesiveness. In Gansu and eastern Xinjiang, the Tangut—who had taken advantage of the Tang decline—had formed a state, Western Xia or Xixia (1038–1227), nominally under Chinese suzerainty. Xinjiang was dominated by the Uyghurs, who were loosely allied with the Chinese.|$|R
5000|$|Rundale farming {{systems in}} Ireland existed from the Early Medieval Period {{right up until}} the time of the First World War. The rundale system of {{agriculture}} consisted of nucleated villages known as clachans. Usually the land was of poor quality and the population of people {{trying to make a living}} was intensive. The main [...] "clachan" [...] area where the small thatched cottages were concentrated, was situated in a cluster on the best land (the infields) which was surrounded by <b>mountain</b> or <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> of inferior quality (the outfields) where the livestock was grazed during summer or dry periods, a practice known as transhumance or as [...] "booleying". All the sheep or cattle of the village were grazed together to alleviate pressure on growing crops and also provided fresh pasture for livestock. In the remote western areas of Ireland where the rundale system was most commonly seen, the land was a complex mixture of arable, rough and bogland. It was a difficult task to ensure that each tenant had an equal share of good and poor land. Rundale clachans and their transhumance pastures, also known as Booley, Boley, Bouley, Bualie and Boola can still be seen in the parish of Kilcommon in Erris, County Mayo, in many townlands such as Gortmelia, Inver and Glengad where clusters of cottages can be seen on the hillsides with land in narrow strips running down to the sea. These names survive in place names such as Buaile h'Anraoi in Kilcommon where the landscape still shows very clearly the layout of the Rundale system.|$|R

This study investigated the effectiveness of exclosures established on communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> to restore soil properties and identified the relationship among soil properties, site and vegetation characteristics, and exclosure age. A space-for-time substitution approach to detect changes in soil properties following the establishment of exclosures on communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> was used. Replicated (n? 3) 5 -, 10 -, and 15 -year-old exclosures were selected and paired, each exclosure with an adjacent communal <b>grazing</b> <b>land.</b> All exclosures showed higher soil organic matter (OM), total soil nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) than the adjacent <b>grazing</b> <b>lands.</b> The increases in soil properties between exclosures and <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> in the 0 - to 0. 2 -m depth varied between 58 and 101 % for OM, from 54 to 108 % for N, from 26 to 128 % for P, and from 18 to 28 % for CEC over the <b>grazing</b> <b>lands.</b> Soil properties in exclosures and <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> showed significant (p< 0. 05) correlations with biomass and vegetation cover indicating that vegetation restoration {{is a key to}} restore degraded soils through exclosure establishment. Establishing exclosures on communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> can be effective in restoring the degraded soils in the semi-arid lowlands of Ethiopia. However, further studies are required on the ecological and economic benefits of future exclosures, as expansion of exclosure could cause grazing pressure on the remaining communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and discusses}} data on baseline levels {{the concentration of}} U, Th and K in agricultural and <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> soils across Europe. In total, 2218 samples of agricultural soil and 2127 samples of <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> soil were collected with an average sampling density of 1 site per 2500 km 2 (a grid of 50 x 50 km) over an area of 5. 6 million km 2 across Europe. The uranium concentrations over the survey area vary from < 0. 1 to 23. 55 mg/kg in agricultural soil and from < 0. 1 to 73. 32 mg/kg in <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> soil, with a median value of 0. 77 and 0. 74, respectively. The median Th content is 2. 89 mg/kg in agricultural soil and 2. 5 mg/kg in <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> soil; the range varies from < 0. 1 to 63. 1 mg/kg in agricultural soil and < 0. 1 to 55. 64 mg/kg in <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> soil.

Both exclosures also had significantly (P[*]<[*] 0.05) higher spore density than free <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> without SWC structure.
