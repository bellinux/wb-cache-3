5|$|The {{construction}} of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology, {{leading to the}} development of large stone buildings. Ancillary structures included new town halls, houses, bridges, and tithe barns. Shipbuilding improved {{with the use of the}} rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of <b>mortise</b> and tenon. Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder, both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, <b>mortise</b> and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
25|$|To {{create the}} <b>mortise</b> for the biscuit, a biscuit joiner is usually required. There are other methods of cutting the slot, {{such as a}} slot cutter bit in a router, but the biscuit joiner is the most common. Accuracy is not as {{important}} {{in the creation of}} these mortises as the biscuit joint is designed to allow a bit of flexibility during glue up. The <b>mortise</b> must be located at the correct distance {{from the face of the}} joint in both members but the width of the <b>mortise</b> is not as critical.|$|E

25|$|When the mortises {{have been}} cut, the biscuit is {{inserted}} with some glue {{and the joint}} is brought together, aligned and clamped. The biscuit absorbs some moisture from the glue and swells up in the <b>mortise,</b> creating a tightly fitting joint.|$|E
25|$|Biscuits are {{predominantly}} used in joining sheet goods such as plywood, particle board and medium-density fibreboard. They are sometimes used with solid wood, replacing <b>mortise</b> and tenon joints {{as they are}} easier to make and almost as strong. They are also used to align pieces of wood when joined edge-to-edge in making wider panels. It is important {{to use the same}} face when cutting the slots, so the boards are perfectly flush.|$|E
25|$|Commonly used {{woodworking}} tools included axes, adzes, chisels, pull saws, and bow drills. <b>Mortise</b> and tenon joints are attested {{from the}} earliest Predynastic period. These joints were strengthened using pegs, dowels and leather or cord lashings. Animal glue came to be used only in the New Kingdom period. Ancient Egyptians invented the art of veneering and used varnishes for finishing, though the composition of these varnishes is unknown. Although different native acacias were used, as was the wood from the local sycamore and tamarisk trees, deforestation in the Nile valley resulted in {{the need for the}} importation of wood, notably cedar, but also Aleppo pine, boxwood and oak, starting from the Second Dynasty.|$|E

25|$|This {{traditional}} tail vise {{also uses}} one large screw, either wooden or metal. It {{consists of a}} movable block {{with one or more}} dog holes in it, the movable block rides in a large <b>mortise</b> in the workbench. The jaw has a face that contacts the bench top, and the dog holes are in line with the dog holes on the bench top. The two main varieties of this vise depend on whether the screw nut is mounted in the bench or on the dog hole block. When the screw nut is mounted on the dog hole block the installation is more complicated and expensive, but the screw does not move in and out as the vise is used.|$|E
25|$|Shipwreck D {{provided}} {{the team with}} an unprecedented opportunity to document hull construction {{during a time of}} transition. When observing the sonar signature of Shipwreck D, a long, slender upright feature on the seabed, transformed itself into a wooden mast. Elements rarely present on shallower shipwreck sites are beautifully preserved 200 m below the surface. Disappointingly for ship scholars and historians of technology, there are few indications of how the planks of Sinop D are held together. There are no <b>mortise</b> and tenon fastenings, and no sewing. Shipwreck D {{may be one of the}} earliest lateen-rigged ships to be studied by archaeologists. The angle of the mast and the lack of fittings on it suggest that a lateen sail is the most likely configuration for such a small vessel.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{the large}} joints {{of the lower}} limb are aligned in a {{straight}} line, which represents the mechanical longitudinal axis of the leg, the Mikulicz line. This line stretches from the hip joint (or more precisely {{the head of the}} femur), through the knee joint (the intercondylar eminence of the tibia), and down {{to the center of the}} ankle (the ankle <b>mortise,</b> the fork-like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli). In the tibial shaft, the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide, but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6°, resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174° in a leg with normal axial alignment. A leg is considered straight when, with the feet brought together, both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching. Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the knee joint is lateral to the mechanical axis (intermalleolar distance exceeds 3cm), and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis (intercondylar distance exceeds 5cm). These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.|$|E

25|$|The first {{dedicated}} war galleys {{fitted with}} rams were built with a <b>mortise</b> and tenon technique, a so-called shell-first method. In this, the planking {{of the hull}} {{was strong enough to}} hold the ship together structurally, and was also watertight without the need for caulking. Hulls had sharp bottoms without keelsons in order to support the structure and were reinforced by transverse framing secured with dowels with nails driven through them. To prevent the hull from hogging there was a hypozoma, a thick cable that connected bow with stern. It was kept taut to add strength to the construction along its length, but its exact design or the method of tightening is not known. The ram, the primary weapon of ancient galleys from around the 8th to the 4th century, was not attached directly on the hull but to a structure extending from it. This way the ram could twist off if got stuck after ramming rather than breaking the integrity of the hull. The ram fitting consisted of a massive, projecting timber and the ram itself was a thick bronze casting with horizontal blades that could weigh from 400kg up to 2 tonnes.|$|E
25|$|Local {{fishermen}} {{had always}} {{been aware of the}} existence of the wrecks, and had explored them and removed small artifacts, often using grappling hooks to pull up pieces, which they sold to tourists. In 1446, Cardinal Prospero Colonna and Leon Battista Alberti followed up on the stories regarding the remains and discovered them lying at a depth of , which at that time was too deep for effective salvage. They caused significant damage to the ships by using ropes with hooks to tear planks from them. Alberti learned little more than the type of wood and that it was covered in lead sheathing. In 1535, Francesco De Marchi dove on the wreck using a diving bell. His finds included bricks, marble paving stones, bronze, copper, lead artefacts and a great number of timber beams. He had all of the wood made into items such as walking sticks and boxes. De Marchi apparently sold everything he collected to the nobility and foreign visitors who visited the site to watch his work. From material recovered he added the knowledge that <b>mortise</b> and tenon joints had been used in their construction. Despite the successful salvage of entire structures and parts, there was no academic interest in the ships, so no further research was performed. The objects recovered were lost and their fate remains unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{vessel was}} built by a method of {{construction}} known as shell-first or plating, meaning that the frame was built first with the later addition of a skeleton. It was, however, not built entirely shell-first, but involved some elements of skeleton or frame-first construction. The keel, extended by a long fore foot ending with a concave stempost tilted towards the back, was laid first, then edge jointed by <b>mortise</b> (10 to 12cm deep and 8cm wide) and tenon (20 to 22cm long, 8cm wide, and 1.5cm thick), construction to three strakes. This first section of the ship, the keel and the first three planks, was made from elm. Floor timbers were then bolted directly to the keel, giving greater rigidity to the internal skeleton. Next, {{the rest of the}} framing was added, joined with straight nails and treenails. These few early frames acted as guides and supports during construction. Then, the rest of the planking was added, the lower skeleton first, followed by the upper shell (independent of the frames, with treenails inserted from inside the hull). Futtocks were inserted last and a second skin of thinner planks of fir was fitted to the exterior of the ship and covered in lead. A layer of planks, 6cm thick, was also fitted inside in order to cover the internal frames, strengthening the hull through double planking and elaborate, complex keel scarves. A massive cutwater, over a length of 1.45m, placed against the front-butt protected and strengthened the stern of the axial frame.|$|E

500|$|The {{framing of}} the house is unusual because it has [...] "longitudinal summer beams {{extending}} from the end girts to the chimney girts in both the hall and the parlor. Corner and intermediate posts are flared in gunstock pattern. The walls are sheathed with vertical planking except in the attic gables, where the planks are laid horizontally, alternating the taper. Framing is cased in the parlor and exposed in the hall, where the summers are adzed and roughly chamfered." [...] The attic construction is conventional with equally spaced rafters that have <b>mortise</b> and tenon joints at the ridge.
