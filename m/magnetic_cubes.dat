40|$|We {{describe}} {{design and}} verification {{of a novel}} autonomous sensor system (<b>Magnetic</b> <b>Cubes)</b> for evaluating the distance between two points {{as well as the}} rotation matrix between the coordinate systems attached to the sensors. The system is based on two sensors, each comprising three orthogonal coils wound on foam cubes, and near-field coupling between the sensors, which operate the medium frequency band. Testing and verification of the designed system was done by performing various 2 D and 3 D movements, and comparing positions and orientations estimated by <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Cubes</b> with those measured by an optical motion capture system. In all cases, good agreement is obtained: the RMS error for the estimation of the distances between the cubes is less than 10 mm (less than 2 %), while the RMS errors for the estimation of the Cartesian coordinates are less than 7 %. The discrepancies between the results obtained from the two systems were also assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient (greater than 0. 9 for the Cartesian coordinates and greater than 0. 99 for the distances between the cubes) ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the shape of {{particles}} is an important factor that determines the fluid flow behavior of suspensions. Interactions of cubic particles with one another and with the flow medium are unique because of their sharp edges, corners and flat surfaces. Using theory, simulations and experiments, the structure and flow properties of cube-shaped particles in suspension over a range of volume fractions is studied to understand the effect of shape on fluid structure and rheology. At very low volume fractions, the sharp edges and corners of cubes are found to profoundly alter the velocity field around the cube. The stresslet-strain relationship for a cube is anisotropic and depends on the orientation of the cube with respect to the velocity flow field. The effective viscosity of the suspension in a simple shear flow is obtained by computing the orientationaly averaged stresslet acting on cubes. These calculations yield a universal intrinsic viscosity, [[eta]] = 3. 1 for sharp cubes, which is higher than the corresponding value for spheres [[eta]] = 5 / 2. Using the 2 D velocity flow profile around sharp corners we further find that the pressure becomes singular near the edges of the cube, which results in the increased value of stress and hence the higher viscosity when compared with spherical particles. In the presence of an external torque acting on each cube, the orientation distribution is no longer isotropic. This can be achieved by using <b>magnetic</b> <b>cubes</b> in magnetic field. The general expression for the stress in a suspension of mag- netic cubes subjected to linear velocity field in presence of an external magnetic field is calculated. We find that the intrinsic viscosity for the weakly Brownian suspension in a simple shear flow can be varied between [[eta]] = 3. 25 to [[eta]] = 5. 5 by changing the strength and the direction of the applied magnetic field. At low to moderate volume fractions, Brownian dynamics simulations were carried out to study the structure and flow behavior of suspensions. Simulations were performed over a wide range of volume fractions and Pe to study its rheological properties. Our equilibrium results show that cubic particles behave like spheres interacting with a soft repulsion potential function for volume fractions less than 0. 25. This soft repulsion potential captures the orientationally averaged excluded volume of the cubes and produces identical probability distributions as that of for cubes at very low volume fractions. For higher volume fractions, cubic particles starts to lose their orientational freedom resulting in the deviation of equilibrium properties from that of soft spheres. We also found that suspension of cubic particles when subjected to simple shear will produce higher viscosity when compared with spherical particles in suspensions with equivalent volume. We show that the suspension rheology in this regime can be discussed in terms of ordering and collisions among hard cubic particles. In order to gain insights from experiments, cubic particles of varying sizes (10 nm to 5 micron sized cubes) and chemistries (PbT e,Fe 3 O 4 and MnCO 3) were synthesized. Polymer brushes were also attached on the surfaces of PbT e and Fe 3 O 4 nanocubes to characterize the effect of particle surface chemistry on flow behavior. MnCO 3 spherical particles of similar sizes as that of MnCO 3 cubes were also synthesized and their suspension behavior studied to empirically characterize the effects of shape. A key result from this study is that irrespective of the cube size, size distribution, and surface chemistry, the intrinsic viscosity([[eta]]) for cube-shaped particles is [[eta]] = 3. 1 ± 0. 2 which agrees well with the value estimated from theory. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|E

30|$|As {{early as}} 1959, a second-order cube whose {{rotation}} relies on magnetism was invented. However, this cube is less popular than Rubik’s Cube, whose rotation relies on mechanical in the later.

However, these edge detectors may miss {{some parts of the}} edges. In the aim, to deal with this problem, a new approach is proposed. It is based on Virtual Magnetic Field (VMF) in conjunction with Cubical Voxels (CV). The main idea of this approach is to model a color image as a <b>magnetic</b> <b>cube</b> which has the same height and width as the image. The pixels intensities are modeled by the CV model as voxels that are considered by the VMF model as virtual magnetic moments. This technique allows determining easily the most important three operators that are used to provide approximate gradients for each plane color component. The method is tested on synthesized and real images that show promising results...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{critical}} instantaneous lift force required to move an initially stationary <b>magnetic</b> <b>cube</b> {{from the wall}} of a cylindrical pipe was examined using a novel method in which an electromagnet was employed. The electromagnet was used to control the contact force between the magnetic particle and the pipe wall by, in effect, varying the effective particle density from 1000 kgm⁻³ to more than 12, 000 kgm⁻³. This control over the effective particle density provided a simple and non-intrusive technique of determining {{the critical}} lift force acting on the cubic particle for a broad range of fluid velocities. The cubic particle was chosen to be greater in size than the depth of the von Kármán viscous sub-layer for the range of fluid velocities examined. Critical instantaneous lift forces deduced from the experimental data resulted in an average lift coefficient, CL, of 3 for pipe Reynolds numbers of Re < 20, 000. A wall-corrected drag coefficient, Cᴅᴡ, of Cᴅᴡ = 114 Rep ⁻⁰‧⁸ Cᴅ for 100 < Rep < 1000 was used to calculate the critical lift force, where Rep is the particle Reynolds number and Cᴅ the drag coefficient. The wall-corrected drag coefficient correlation given above was determined in separate experiments in which the horizontal displacement of the cube, after its sudden release from the soffit of the pipe, was recorded. The release was achieved by firstly holding the particle in position using a magnet and then rapidly removing the magnet. This paper appears {{to be the first to}} non-intrusively evaluate the critical instantaneous lift force acting on a specific cubic particle at the pipe wall over a broad range of superficial fluid velocities...|$|R

40|$|Fluids of spherical colloids {{possessing}} an off-centered embedded {{magnetic dipole}} were investigated by using Monte Carlo simulations. Systems of colloids with different strengths and directions of the embedded dipole moment confined in a 2 D space without {{and with an}} external magnetic field applied were considered. The fluids were characterized by radial distribution functions, angular distribution functions, cluster data, and energetic data. In {{the absence of an}} external field, the colloids form dimers and trimers at sufficiently large magnetic moment without the tendency of forming chains of colloids as appearing in systems with particles possessing a central magnetic dipole. In the presence of an external field, chains of colloids aligned in a zigzag fashion were formed for a field parallel to the plane of the particles, whereas the colloidal ordering was suppressed {{in the presence of a}} field perpendicular to that plane. The findings agree surprisingly well with the recent experimental observations on fluids containing spherical polymer colloids with embedded single-domain <b>magnetic</b> hematite <b>cubes</b> (S.

40|$|Quantifying coronal {{magnetic}} field remains a central problem in solar physics. Nowadays the coronal {{magnetic field}} is often modelled using nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) reconstructions, whose accuracy {{has not yet}} been comprehensively assessed. Here we perform a detailed casting of the NLFFF reconstruction tools, such as pi-disambiguation, photospheric field preprocessing, and volume reconstruction methods using a 3 D snapshot of the publicly available full-fledged radiative MHD model. Specifically, from the MHD model we know the magnetic field vector in the entire 3 D domain, which enables us to perform "voxel-by-voxel" comparison of the restored and the true magnetic field in the 3 D model volume. Our tests show that the available pi-disambiguation methods often fail at the quiet sun areas dominated by small-scale magnetic elements, while they work well at the AR photosphere and (even better) chromosphere. The preprocessing of the photospheric magnetic field, although does produce a more force-free boundary condition, also results in some effective `elevation' of the magnetic field components. This `elevation' height is different for the longitudinal and transverse components, which results in a systematic error in absolute heights in the reconstructed <b>magnetic</b> data <b>cube.</b> The extrapolations performed starting from actual AR photospheric magnetogram are free from this systematic error, while have other metrics comparable with those for extrapolations from the preprocessed magnetograms. This finding favors the use of extrapolations from the original photospheric magnetogram without preprocessing. Our tests further suggest that extrapolations from a force-free chromospheric boundary produce measurably better results, than those from the photospheric boundary.

The axial coordination sites of the MII cations are occupied by either H 2 O molecules or Cl?/SCN? anions originating from the MII salt used in the synthesis, resulting in neutral 1, 2 and 4 and the cage in 3 being a 12 + cation; the charge-balancing SO 42 ? anions accommodated {{both inside and outside the}} <b>cube.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> susceptibility and magnetisation measurements reveal weak exchange between nearest neighbour metal ions, mediated via the L? ligands. The modular assembly of the cubes suggests that any combination of [MIIIL 3] metalloligand and MII salt will work, potentially resulting in an enormous family of supramolecular assemblies.
