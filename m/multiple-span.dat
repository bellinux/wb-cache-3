40|$|The 14 -residue peptide (peptide 14) {{corresponding}} to Arg 2410 -Lys 2423 of the insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF-IIR) can activate the adenylate cyclase-inhibitor guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gi, and the 15 -residue beta III- 2 peptide Arg 259 -Lys 273 of the beta 2 -adrenergic receptor (beta 2 AR) can activate the stimulatory protein Gs. In phospholipid vesicles, IGF-IIR and beta 2 AR activate Gi and Gs {{in response to}} IGF-II and isoproterenol, respectively. We constructed a chimeric IGF-II receptor (beta III- 2 /IGF-IIR) by converting its native peptide 14 sequence to the beta III- 2 sequence. In cells expressing beta III- 2 /IGF-IIR, membrane adenylate cyclase activity markedly increased without IGF-II and was further promoted by IGF-II. This was verified by measuring chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in beta III- 2 /IGF-IIR cells with cotransfection of a cAMP response element-CAT construct. This study shows not only the conversion of G-protein specificity of a receptor from Gi to Gs but also the simulation of G protein-coupled receptor signals by using a short receptor region and intact cells.

40|$|Autophagy is a {{cellular}} response to starvation which generates autophagosomes to carry cellular organelles and long-lived proteins to lysosomes for degradation. Degradation through autophagy {{can provide an}} innate defence against virus infection, or conversely autophagosomes can promote infection by facilitating assembly of replicase proteins. We demonstrate that the avian coronavirus, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) activates autophagy. A screen of individual IBV non-structural proteins (nsps) showed that autophagy was activated by IBV nsp 6. This property was shared with nsp 6 of mammalian coronaviruses Mouse Hepatitis Virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus, and the equivalent nsp 5 - 7 of the arterivirus Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus. These <b>multiple-spanning</b> transmembrane proteins located to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they generated Atg 5 and LC 3 II-positive vesicles, and vesicle formation was dependent on Atg 5 and class III PI 3 kinase. The vesicles recruited double FYVE-domain containing protein (DFCP) indicating localised concentration of phosphatidylinositol 3 phosphate, and therefore shared many features with omegasomes formed from the ER in response to starvation. Omegasomes induced by viral nsp 6 matured into autophagosomes that delivered LC 3 to lysosomes and therefore recruited and recycled the proteins needed for autophagosome nucleation, expansion, cellular trafficking and delivery of cargo to lysosomes. The coronavirus nsp 6 proteins activated omegasome and autophagosome formation independently of starvation, but activation did not involve direct inhibition of mTOR signalling, activation of sirtuin 1 or induction of ER stress...|$|R

40|$|Herpesvirus {{glycoprotein}} M (gM) is a <b>multiple-spanning</b> integral {{membrane protein}} {{found within the}} envelope of mature herpesviruses and is conserved throughout the Herpesviridae. gM {{is defined as a}} non-essential glycoprotein in alphaherpesviruses and has been proposed as playing a role in controlling final envelopment in a late secretory-pathway compartment such as the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Additionally, gM proteins have been shown to inhibit cell–cell fusion in transfection-based assays by an as yet unclear mechanism. Here, the effect of pseudorabies virus (PRV) gM and the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) gM/UL 49 A complex on the fusion events caused by the HSV- 1 glycoproteins gB, gD, gH and gL was investigated. Fusion of cells expressing HSV- 1 gB, gD, gH and gL was efficiently inhibited by both PRV gM and HSV- 1 gM/UL 49 A. Furthermore, expression of PRV gM or HSV- 1 gM/UL 49 A, which are themselves localized to the TGN, caused both gD and gH/L to be relocalized from the plasma membrane to a juxtanuclear compartment, suggesting that fusion inhibition is caused by the removal of ‘fusion’ proteins from the cell surface. The ability of gM to cause the relocalization of plasma membrane proteins was not restricted to HSV- 1 glycoproteins, as other viral and non-viral proteins were also affected. These data suggest that herpesvirus gM (gM/N) can alter the membrane trafficking itineraries of a broad range of proteins and this may have multiple functions...|$|R

Further, the interchange has reached its maximum capacity to accommodate traffic volumes, causing significant delays in the area. Our senior design team was tasked with redesigning the Interstate and underpass interchange—which includes the roadway alignments and bridge structures—to meet current and future traffic volumes. We have designed replacements for the two existing structurally-deficient bridges on I- 84, widened the Interstate from two lanes to three lanes, and realigned the underpass. These design elements will increase efficiency and accommodate increased vehicle capacity, functionality, accessibility and safety. A Single Point Urban Interchange (SPUI) —similar {{to those found in}} Ada county at the Vista Avenue, Meridian Road, and Ten Mile Road interchanges—has been designed for the Garrity Boulevard interchange. One, single-span bridge will replace the two existing, <b>multiple-span,</b> structurally-deficient bridges.

40|$|The highway {{transportation}} {{network of}} the United States {{relies on the}} health and integrity of major infrastructure elements such as bridges. Frequently traveled parts of Oregon are within the seismically active Pacific Northwest {{and many of the}} bridges were designed and built to lateral demands that were assumed to be less than the current expectation, a deficiency caused by our growing awareness of seismic hazard and our enhanced understanding of the non-linear response of bridges. This vulnerability to damage from earthquakes can result in not only immediate damage, but also in potentially lingering economic impact caused by the disruption to traffic and freight mobility. Using analytical methods, fragility curves were constructed assuming lognormal capacity and demand distributions. Probability of failure was determined for the four damage state conditions of slight, moderate, extensive, and complete levels of damage. These statistical values were compared to the median and dispersion values proposed by other researchers, in addition to those calculated using guidelines from the HAZUS Technical Manual. Older <b>multiple-span</b> Oregon bridges were found to be significantly more fragile than the HAZUS models.

40|$|Accelerograms {{obtained}} {{during the}} 1979 Coyote Lake, California earthquake {{are used to}} examine the response of a <b>multiple-span,</b> steel girder bridge to strong earthquake loading. The structure studied, the San Juan Bautista 156 / 101 Separation Bridge, is typical of many highway bridges in seismic regions of the United States. Although the bridge was not damaged, the strong-motion records are of significant engineering interest as they are the first to be recorded on such a structure. An engineering seismology study suggests that long-period ground displacements at the bridge site were caused by Rayleigh waves. A three-second period, pseudostatic response of the superstructure is attributed to small amounts of differential support motion induced by the surface waves. A time-domain technique of system identification is used to determine linear models which can closely replicate the observed bridge response. Using time-invariant models, two structural modes at 3. 50 and 6. 33 Hz, are identified in the horizontal direction. Each mode, having approximately ten-percent damping, involves coupled longitudinal and transverse motions of the superstructure. Time-variations of frequency and damping in the horizontal response are also identified using a moving-window analysis. A three-dimensional finite element model which includes soil-structure interaction predicts several important features of the dynamic response of the bridge. The first two computed horizontal frequencies are found to be in excellent agreement with the observed responses provided the model's expansion joints are locked, preventing relative translational motions from occurring across the joints. Locking is confirmed by the observed deformations of the structure in the fundamental mode. Fundamental vertical frequencies of the individual spans, predicted by the finite element model, are in very good agreement with ambient vibration test data. Results of the strong-motion data analysis and the finite element modeling are used to recommend a plan for expansion of the strong-motion instrumentation array on the bridge...|$|E

Although the double integration expression in some responses makes the technique infeasible, a practical way to overcome that difficulty is demonstrated using a standard branch-cut integration to eliminate one integration step analytically. The model and numerical scheme readily allow investigation of additional interesting topics, like the passband and stopband characteristic and the mode localization phenomenon that are observed in ribbed structures. Furthermore, an extension to comprehension of the mechanisms that generate the mode localization phenomenon on disordered structures has been realized;A secondary effort examines natural modes of vibration and acoustic radiation for finite stiffened <b>multiple-span</b> beams with the efficient transfer matrix method. This model shows that the mode localization phenomenon exists on disordered stiffened beams both under free-free and hinged-hinged end conditions. The sensitivity of the response to attachment disorder (perturbations in rib stiffness and location) has also been examined. An elaborate vibrational and acoustic experiment has been carried out on a baffled, stiffened, two-span, hinged beam to examine the existence of the localized modes and verify the predicted acoustic responses. Moreover, the radiation efficiency of finite beams has been investigated for comparison of the radiation behavior presented by the different stiffened beam arrangements;A thorough investigation of mode localization, frequency passbands and stopbands, structural and acoustic intensities and radiated acoustic power is presented for analysis of submerged infinite ribbed plates, with variable rib materials geometry and spacing (periodic and non-periodic).
