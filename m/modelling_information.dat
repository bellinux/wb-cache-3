40|$|Networked control {{strategies}} {{based on}} limited {{information about the}} plant model usually results in worse closed-loop performance than optimal centralized control with full plant <b>model</b> <b>information.</b> Recently, this fact has been established by utilizing the concept of competitive ratio, which {{is defined as the}} worst case ratio of the cost of a control design with limited <b>model</b> <b>information</b> to the cost of the optimal control design with full <b>model</b> <b>information.</b> We show that an adaptive controller, inspired by a controller proposed by Campi and Kumar, with limited plant <b>model</b> <b>information,</b> asymptotically achieves the closed-loop performance of the optimal centralized controller with full <b>model</b> <b>information</b> for almost any plant. Therefore, there exists, at least, one adaptive control design strategy with limited plant <b>model</b> <b>information</b> that can achieve a competitive ratio equal to one. The plant model considered in the paper belongs to a compact set of stochastic linear time-invariant systems and the closed loop performance measure is the ergodic mean of a quadratic function of the state and control input. We illustrate the applicability of the results numerically on a vehicle platooning problem. Comment: Improved presentation, Fixed typo...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{control systems}} are often {{composed}} of several smaller interconnected units. For these systems, {{it is common}} to employ local controllers, which observe and act locally. At the heart of common control design procedures for distributed systems lies the often implicit assumption that the designer has access to the global plant <b>model</b> <b>information</b> when designing a local controller. However, there are several reasons why such plant <b>model</b> <b>information</b> would not be globally known. One reason could be that the designer wants the parameters of each local controller to only depend on local <b>model</b> <b>information,</b> so that the controllers are not modified if the model parameters of a particular subsystem change. It might also be the case that the design of each local controller is done by individual designers with no access to the global plant model, for instance, {{due to the fact that}} the designers refuse to share their <b>model</b> <b>information</b> since they consider it private. This class of problems, which we refer to as limited <b>model</b> <b>information</b> control design, is the topic of the thesis. First, we investigate the achievable closed-loop performance of discrete-time linear time-invariant plants under a separable quadratic cost performance with structured static state-feedback controllers. To do so, we introduce control design strategies as mappings, which construct controllers by accessing the plant <b>model</b> <b>information</b> in a constrained way according to a given design graph. We compare control design strategies using the competitive ratio as a performance metric, that is, we compare the worst case control performance for a given design strategy normalized with the optimal control performance based on full <b>model</b> <b>information.</b> An explicit minimizer of the competitive ratio is sought. As this minimizer might not be unique, we further search for the ones that are undominated, that is, there is no other control design strategy in the set of limited <b>model</b> <b>information</b> design strategies with a better closed-loop performance for all possible plants while maintaining the same worst-case ratio. We study the trade-off between the amount of <b>model</b> <b>information</b> exploited by a control design strategy and the best possible closed-loop performance. We generalize this setup to structured dynamic state-feedback controllers for H_ 2 -performance. Surprisingly, the optimal control design strategy with limited <b>model</b> <b>information</b> is still a static one. This is the case even though the optimal decentralized state-feedback controller with full <b>model</b> <b>information</b> is dynamic. Finally, we discuss the design of dynamic controllers for disturbance accommodation under limited <b>model</b> <b>information.</b> This problem is of special interest because the best limited <b>model</b> <b>information</b> control design in this case is a dynamic control design strategy. The optimal controller can be separated into a static feedback law and a dynamic disturbance observer. For constant disturbances, it is shown that this structure corresponds to proportional-integral control. C 2012020...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} plant <b>model</b> <b>information</b> {{available}} in the control design process is discussed. We design optimal state-feedback controllers for interconnected discrete-time linear systems with stochastically-varying parameters. The parameters {{are assumed to be}} independently and identically distributed random variables in time. The design of each controller relies only on (i) exact local plant <b>model</b> <b>information</b> and (ii) statistical beliefs about the model {{of the rest of the}} system. We consider both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon quadratic cost functions. The optimal state-feedback controller is derived in both cases. The optimal controller is shown to be linear in the state and to depend on the model parameters and their statistics in a particular way. Furthermore, we study the value of <b>model</b> <b>information</b> in optimal control design using the performance degradation ratio which is defined as the supremum (over all possible initial conditions) of the ratio of the cost of the optimal controller with limited <b>model</b> <b>information</b> scaled by the cost of the optimal controller with full <b>model</b> <b>information.</b> An upper bound for the performance degradation ratio is presented for the case of fully-actuated subsystems. Comparisons are made between designs based on limited, statistical, and full <b>model</b> <b>information.</b> Throughout the paper, we use a power network example to illustrate concepts and results.
