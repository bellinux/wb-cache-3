500|$|In 1783, two of Evans's {{brothers}} {{began building}} a mill in Newport {{on part of}} the family's farm estate which they purchased from their father, and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek. When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design, {{but over the next}} five years Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling. Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills. Evans's first innovation was a bucket elevator to facilitate this process. Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology had been used in various guises since antiquity. Evans had seen diagrams of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain, so a series of bucket elevators around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next. Another labor-intensive task was that of spreading meal. This came out of the grinding process warm and moist, needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed. Traditionally the task was done by manually shoveling meal across large floors. In response, Evans developed the [...] "hopper boy", a device which gathered meal from a bucket elevator and spread it evenly over the drying floor—a <b>mechanical</b> <b>rake</b> would revolve around the floorspace. [...] This would even out newly deposited meal for cooling and drying, while a gentle incline in the design of the rake blades would slowly move the flour towards central chutes, from which the material would be sifted. Used in conjunction, the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination.|$|E

Most commercial growers wait for the nuts to drop on their own, rather than using equipment to shake them from the tree.

40|$|The {{management}} experiences {{presented here}} have been realised since 1994 owing to the ‘Conseil Général’ of the North district on the upper beaches of the Flemish dunes owned by the ‘Conservatoire du Littoral’ situated on the Bray-Dunes and Zuydcoote municipalities (France). This experience aims at {{the restoration of the}} habitats on the sea frontline of the border dune. The matter is the space that starts from the annual halo-nitrophilic strip on the upper beach, goes on with the embryo dune and finishes with the quick white dune dominated by the European beachgrass (marram). The requirements of beach cleanness, especially regarding seaside tourism, have led to the destruction of these patrimonial important habitats by the regular and complete <b>mechanical</b> <b>raking</b> of the strand. The first step consisted in limiting this <b>mechanical</b> <b>raking</b> to the rights of sea-side resorts. At the same time, the upper strip of the beach along dunes is managed softly by a selective manual picking up of the biggest trashes. This change of cleaning process rapidly produced the emergence of noticeable habitats that didn’t exist before. It concerns water marks mingled with sand and embryonic dunes with sand couch grass. To a reduced extent, these methods of management lead to a reinforcement of the white dune with marram and sand ryegrass and the white dune which is warmer with marram and sea spurge. Some of these habitats are listed as part of the Guideline ‘Habitat’ and are listed as vulnerable or endangered after the red book of the littoral terrestrial phytocoenoses according to the definitions proposed by the International Union for Nature Preservation. Moreover, the obstacles kept on the upper strip of the beach afford the start of a process of sand accumulation and build the embryonic dune. According to the sedimentary context, this type of operation assists the fertilisation of the upper beach and reduces the retreat phenomenon of the coastline. The cost of operations is much reduced, money is even saved with the reduction of the number of interventions. It was only difficult to convince our partners about modifying their cleaning habits. This successful experience over a 1. 5 km distance of beach, facing preserved dune massifs, shows the large potentialities of spontaneous restoration of these natural environments. The extreme simplicity of this method and its very small cost, except employment, allow us to envisage and adapt it all along the European coastline...|$|R
40|$|Hazelnut (Corylus avellna L.) {{is one of}} the {{important}} nut crops in world. The harvesting of hazelnuts is done either by hand or by manual or <b>mechanical</b> <b>raking</b> of fallen nuts in Iran. Common hazel is widely cultivated for its nuts, including in commercial orchards in Europe, Turkey, and Iran. There are some genotypes of hazelnut in Iran that their growing areas are limited to Gillan, Aredbil, Mazandaran, Golestan, Zanjan and Qazvin Provinces. Varieties, location, composition of soils, usage of fertilizer and irrigation affect the fatty acid, mineral and vitamin composition of hazelnuts, and consequently influence the nutritional value and quality of the product. Therefore, the objective of this study was evaluation of protein, crude fiber, and fatty acids in samples in Tarem and Rudsar County farmlands as two economically important provinces. Samples were collected during the harvest season in 2015 from 10 different distinguished cultivars of trees grown in a replicated trial in an experimental orchard. The chemical and physical properties (crude protein, total fat, crude oil, crude fiber, ash, refractive index) were analyzed according to AOAC methods. In investigation on these two varieties, the highest fatty acid had oleic acid with 85. 026...|$|R
40|$|Beach {{grooming}} {{and beach}} award status are both {{shown to be}} associated with low macroinvertebrate taxon richness in Scotland. Previous studies in California have revealed that <b>mechanical</b> <b>raking</b> to remove wrack from sandy beaches has negative ecological consequences for coastal ecosystems. In the current study the presence and absence of eight common taxa that inhabit beached wrack on sandy beaches in Scotland was assessed at 60 sites, 24 of which were groomed and 29 of which were in receipt of a beach award. On average 4. 86 of the eight taxa were found to be present on ungroomed beaches, whereas only 1. 13 taxa were present on groomed beaches. Thus, beach grooming seems to be having a major effect on the biodiversity of beach macroinvertebrates in Scotland. Fewer macroinvertebrate taxa were also found on award (1. 5) compared to non-award (4. 38) beaches. It was also revealed that award beaches {{were much more likely to}} be groomed than non-award beaches, with 69 % of award beaches surveyed being groomed compared to only 6 % of non-award beaches. This pattern is surprising as the awarding bodies discourage the removal of seaweed and regulations state that beached wrack should only be removed if it constitutes a nuisance. It is concluded that award status, not nuisance level, has the main factor driving most beach grooming and that this has resulted in the substantial loss of macroinvertebrate biodiversity from award beaches in Scotland. In conclusion it is shown that beach grooming has a substantial negative impact upon strandline macroinvertebrate biodiversity in Scotland and that grooming is much more likely to occur on award beaches...|$|R

So far over 1,000 tons of Lyngbya have been removed with <b>mechanical</b> {{harvesters}} and <b>raking.</b> Removing Lyngbya mats does not help the regrowth of native grasses, and if you replant the native grasses it will most likely not succeed due to grazing of manatees.|$|R

He took the paper from his pocket, and, unlocking the money drawer of his counter, folded into a small compass that which now seemed to be the last testament of Elijah Curtis, and placed it in a recess. Then he went to the back door and paused, then returned, reopened the money drawer, took out the paper and again buttoned it in his hip pocket, standing by the stove and staring abstractedly at the dull glow of the fire. He even went through the <b>mechanical</b> process of <b>raking</b> down the ashes,--solely to gain time and as an excuse for delaying some other necessary action.|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{beryllium}} disease (CBD) {{is a rare}} disease characterized by diffuse pulmonary interstitial granulo-matosis. Twenty-four cases of CBD {{have been reported in}} Japan 1). CBD occurs as a result of inhalation exposure to beryl-lium compounds (particularly beryllium oxide [BeO]), and is caused by a type allergic response 2). We report a case of CBD which showed marked improvement both subjectively and objectively following pulse therapy. Case: The patient was a 36 -year-old man with a chief complaint of dyspnea and a dry cough. Past history: There was no remarkable medical or fam-ily history. Occupational history: The patient was employed as an industrial engineer in 1988. Since July 1990, the patient had been working in a beryllium-related field developing an automatic mechan-ical technique for producing beryllium-copper alloy. More specifically, he had been engaged in designing auto-matic <b>mechanical</b> procedures for <b>raking</b> out sludge that was the result of dissolving BeO and copper at the reduc-tion furnace during the production of beryllium-copper alloy (containing approximately 4 % beryllium) and dur-ing the production of beryllium-copper alloy (containing approximately 2 % beryllium) from beryllium alloy.

40|$|The tongue-bite {{apparatus}} {{and its associated}} musculoskeletal elements of the pectoral girdle and neurocranium form the structural basis of raking, a unique prey-processing behaviour in salmonid and osteoglossomorph fishes. Using a quantitative approach, the functional osteology and myology of this system were compared between representatives of each lineage, i. e. the salmonid Salvelinus fontinalis (N = 10) and the osteoglossomorph Chitala ornata(N = 8). Divergence {{was found in the}} morphology of the novel cleithrobranchial ligament, which potentially relates to kinematic differences between the raking lineage representatives. Salvelinus had greater anatomical cross-sectional areas of the epaxial, hypaxial and protractor hyoideus muscles, whereas Chitala had greater sternohyoideus and adductor mandibulae mass. Two osteology-based biomechanical models (a third-order lever for neurocranial elevation and a modified four-bar linkage for hyoid retraction) showed divergent force/velocity priorities in the study taxa. Salvelinus maximizes both force (via powerful cranial muscles) and velocity (through <b>mechanical</b> amplification) during <b>raking.</b> In contrast, Chitala has relatively low muscle force but more efficient force transmission through both mechanisms compared with Salvelinus. It remains unclear if and how behavioural modulation and specializations in the post-cranial anatomy may affect the force/velocity trade-offs in Chitala. Further studies of tongue-bite apparatus morphology and biomechanics in a broader species range may help to clarify the role that osteology and myology play in the evolution of behavioural diversity...|$|R
40|$|Diante da expansÃo dos cultivos agroecolÃgicos e da permanÃncia de Ãreas de aplicaÃÃo da agricultura convencional no semiÃrido, fez-se necessÃrio um estudo cientÃfico para a detecÃÃo, atravÃs de uma anÃlise comparativa, das principais diferenÃas entre as modalidades, observando o espaÃo local em suas caracterÃsticas peculiares e impactos. Objetivamos analisar as prÃticas agrÃcolas em propriedades de uso convencional e agroecolÃgica em duas Ãreas de um mesmo municÃpio - Nova Olinda/CE, com as mesmas caracterÃsticas geofÃsicas e que hÃ mais de dez anos faziam uso de prÃticas especÃficas de cultivo. Tratou-se de um estudo exploratÃrio-descritivo com uma abordagem quanti-qualitativa, utilizando-se para a coleta de dados: formulÃrio, observaÃÃo direta sistemÃtica, entrevista, coleta e anÃlise de solo. Em relaÃÃo Ãs tÃcnicas de cultivo, o modelo agroflorestal destacou-se por utilizar o policultivo e o consÃrcio com outras plantas, onde se incluem em torno de 29 espÃcies nativas, a incorporaÃÃo de resÃduos orgÃnicos, o roÃo seletivo e o plantio direto. Outras tÃcnicas que foram igualmente importantes nesse sistema e amplamente utilizadas por este agricultor foram: coleta e extraÃÃo (frutos, raÃzes, folhas, favos, etc.), as quais envolvem a fruticultura, apicultura e cultivo de hortaliÃas. Neste modelo de cultivo dispensou-se o uso de agrotÃxico, pois a intenÃÃo era alcanÃar o controle natural por meio da cadeia biolÃgica, utilizando espÃcies vegetais. Como benefÃcios dessas tÃcnicas identificaram-se a manutenÃÃo do microclima adequado Ã biologia do solo; o controle de ervas daninhas e da erosÃo; maior permeabilidade Ãs chuvas; proteÃÃo do solo contra investidas direta do sol, da chuva e do vento; estabilizaÃÃo de ravinas e voÃorocas; e promoÃÃo da biodiversidade. JÃ no modelo convencional, encontramos como o tipo de cultivo adotado o consÃrcio e a monocultura, onde as prÃticas de preparaÃÃo da terra incluem o roÃo e o destocamento, a queimada, a utilizaÃÃo de arados mecÃnicos e a capinaÃÃo. Como consequÃncias foram identificadas uma diminuiÃÃo abrupta da biodiversidade, reduÃÃo na capacidade de restituiÃÃo vegetal e desnudaÃÃo do solo com consequente aumento do Ãndice de erosÃo e empobrecimento da camada fÃrtil. Os Ãndices mineralÃgicos de fertilidade do solo sÃo maiores no Sistema Agroflorestal (SAF), e, que dada as tÃcnicas empreendidas pelo agricultor, tÃm uma tendÃncia a elevarem-se ao contrÃrio das empreendidas na Ãrea do Sistema Convencional (SC), que em geral empobrecem o solo, podendo assim levÃ-lo a Ãndices ainda mais crÃticos. Em relaÃÃo Ã produtividade, o Sistema Agroflorestal tambÃm destacou-se graÃas Ãs suas diferentes produÃÃes, que asseguram um maior nÃmero de fontes de renda, com uma consequente lucratividade. Compreendemos assim, que, em termos de produtividade e rentabilidade, o SAF apresentou-se mais vantajoso para o agricultor por diversos motivos, dentre os quais destacaram-se: mais fontes de rendas, maior produÃÃo por tarefa e mais seguranÃa em termos de produÃÃo tanto a nÃvel {{ambiental}} como econÃmico. Identificamos que o Sistema Agroflorestal apontou excelentes resultados e que superou a nÃvel de conservaÃÃo dos solos e dos ecossistemas, bem como de produtividade e rentabilidade, o Sistema Convencional adotado. Com isso, indicamos o modelo agroflorestal como rentÃvel e favorÃvel Ã adoÃÃo para os agricultores do semiÃrido nordestino. In {{the face}} of the expansion of agroecological cultivation and the hitherto use of areas of application of conventional agriculture in the semi-arid region, it showed to be necessary a deeper and more scientific study for the detection, through a comparative analysis, of the main differences between these two types of cultivation, observing the local space in its peculiar characteristics and impact. This study aimed to analyze the agricultural practices in properties of conventional and agroecological use in two areas of the same municipality â Nova Olinda/CE, with the same geophysical characteristics and that they have been using the specific practice of cultivation for more than ten years. This was an exploratory and descriptive study with a quanti-qualitative approach, using for data collection: formulary, systematic direct observation, interview, collection and analysis of soil. In relation to the techniques of cultivation, the agroforest model was put in evidence for using polyculture, partnership with other plants in which was included around 29 native species, incorporation of organic remains, selective cut and direct planting. Other techniques which were equally important in that system and widely used by this cultivator were: collection and extraction (fruits, roots, leaves, honeycombs, etc.), which involve horticulture (fruits and vegetables) and apiculture. In this model of cultivation, agrochemicals were not used, since the intention was to reach the natural control through the biological chain using vegetable species. As the benefits of those techniques, it was identified the maintenance of the microclimate which was adequate for the biology of the soil; control of weeds and erosion; greater permeability to water; protection of the soil against direct sunlight, rain and wind; stabilization of eroded areas; and promotion of biodiversity. In the conventional model, mono and partnership are the adopted types of cultivation; the practices of soil preparation include the cut and removal of remaining stems, fire, use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>rakes</b> and weeding. As consequences, it was identified an abrupt diminishing of the biodiversity, reduction in the capacity for vegetal restitution and soil bareness with the consequent increase in the erosion index and diminishing of the fertile layer. The mineralogical indexes of soil fertility are higher in the Agroforest System (AFS), and, due to the techniques used by the cultivator, they have a tendency to increase; on the contrary, in the Conventional System (CS), the techniques used generally diminish the soil fertility, thereby taking the soil to more critical indexes. In relation to productivity, the Agroforest System was put in focus due to its different productions, which provide a higher number of sources of income with consequent profitability. It was grasped then that in terms of productivity and profitability, the Agroforest System was more advantageous to the cultivator due to various reasons, among them it was highlighted: more sources of income, greater production per hectare and more security and terms of production, not only at the environmental level but also at the economic one. It was identified that the Agroforest System showed excellent results and it outperformed at the level of soil and ecosystem conservation, as well as in productivity and profitability, the adopted Conventional System. Therefore, the Agroforest model is considered profitable and favorable to the adoption by the cultivators from the semi-arid region of the Brazilian North-Eas...|$|R
