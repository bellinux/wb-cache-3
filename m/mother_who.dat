40|$|A mother {{killing her}} {{child is a}} {{disturbing}} and puzzling crime. While extensive {{research has been conducted}} on <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> kill their biological children, little information is known about <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> kill children they have adopted. Previous research has suggested specific typologies and characteristics of <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> kill their biological children. The current research reviews these typologies and investigates whether they {{can be applied to the}} <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> kill adopted children. A review of the cases in the United States from 1993 through 2013 that involved <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> killed children they had adopted was conducted. The similarities and differences between <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> kill their adopted children and <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> kill their biological children are described. The common factors and general patterns that exist among these mothers are examined to help create a new typology and propose a theory for why a mother decides to kill her adopted child...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{attachment}} {{theory and}} recent findings with adults on relations between narrative coherence and well-being, {{we hypothesized that}} <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> are more securely attached and who cope more effectively would be more engaged and more emotionally expressive in mother-child co-constructed narratives about stressful events. Twenty-seven mostly white mixed-SES mothers and their 9 - to 12 -year-old children with asthma were asked to discuss two asthmaspecific stressful events together: a chronic parent-child conflict and an acute asthma attack. Few relations emerged for the asthma attack event, although, against predictions, <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> were more anxiously attached were more engaged and more explanatory in these narratives than <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> were less anxiously attached. For the conflict event, <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> were more anxiously attached talked more about other people’s emotions than did <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> were less anxiously attached, and <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> cope more effectively were more engaged, more emotionally expressive, and more explanatory, and, in turn, their children showed more flexible coping...|$|R
40|$|Although {{high school}} dropout rates have been declining among members of {{virtually}} all major demographic groups, the dropout rates of single mothers remain high. This is troubling, given that the author finds {{that over the last}} quarter century single <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> do not graduate from high school have been more likely to go on welfare than single <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> do graduate. In fact, single mothers on welfare are {{more than twice as likely}} to be {{high school dropout}}s than are single <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> are not on welfare. The author also discovers that the welfare participation rate of single white <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> are high school dropouts has been rapidly rising and is approaching the welfare participation rate of black single <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> are dropouts.

40|$|Scale, CTSPC; and a mother-child observation) were exam-ined {{for their}} ability to {{identify}} mothers with a history of phys-ically abusing or neglecting their child. Participants were mothers of 139 children (age 3 to 6 years; 58 with a history of maltreatment). Mothers with a history of maltreatment re-ported higher scores on the Neglect, Nonviolent Discipline, and Psychological Aggression subscales of the CTSPC. These group differences, however, were limited to <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> ac-knowledged a history of maltreatment, as <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> con-cealed their maltreatment history rated themselves similar to controls. Observation of parental behaviors during a brief, nonstressful task did not discriminate <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> mal-treated from <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> did not maltreat.

Offspring of GDM <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> were diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy had higher prevalence of overweight, higher mean weight for height Z scores, and higher mean BMI for age Z scores at 1 – 5 years old than the offspring of GDM <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> were diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) during pregnancy.

Materials & Methods: A cross-sectional survey (written in Chinese). Questionnaires were distributed to Chinese mothers in Chinese markets and language schools in Ireland. Results & Findings: Analyses was conducted on 236 completed questionnaires from Chinese <b>mothers</b> <b>who</b> had given birth in Ireland. Breastfeeding prevalence among the participants was 71 %.
