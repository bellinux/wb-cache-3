What kind of {{abnormal}} animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...JERRY: I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.MANYA: (angry) I had a pony.(The room goes dead quiet.)JERRY: Well, I didn't, uh, really mean a pony, per se...MANYA: When I {{was a little girl}} in Poland, we all had ponies. <b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> pony, my cousin had pony... So, what's wrong with that? ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard {{remained}} forever grateful {{and loving}} to Cis throughout his life, later {{going on to}} say: [...] "When my mother died she, <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> <b>had</b> become my mother, and more mother to me than any mother could ever have been... I was immensely proud of her... she felt all tragedies except her own." [...] Daddy Ni would occasionally visit the homes of his grown daughters but was otherwise absent. Another important figure in Richard's early life was Ifor, his brother, 19 years his senior. A miner and rugby union player, Ifor [...] "ruled the household with the proverbial firm hand". He was also responsible for nurturing a passion for rugby in young Richard. Although Richard also played cricket, tennis, and table tennis, biographer Bragg notes rugby union football to be his greatest interest. On rugby, Richard said he [...] "would rather have played for Wales at Cardiff Arms Park than Hamlet at The Old Vic". The Welsh rugby union centre, Bleddyn Williams believed Richard [...] "had distinct possibilities as a player".|$|E
60|$|I {{asked in}} wonder whether <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> consented, {{but my mother}} {{seemed to think that}} the break with Darpent had settled that matter for ever.|$|E

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> been {{standing}} {{silent in the}} yard, within hearing,--she was a most unscrupulous spy and listener,--and she instantly looked in {{at one of the}} windows.|$|E
6000|$|... “And so I {{told the}} great lady in grey. I {{told her that}} <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> given {{it to me and}} that surely God would not let her take it away again.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> {{been out}} for a stroll one night, visiting a sick peasant or {{performing}} some other of the numerous acts of charity by which she had made herself beloved by the whole countryside.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} why you should suppose so. We have had no hand in the matter. <b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> {{followed}} her own inclinations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Philippe {{does not}} know about that. He says {{they came from the}} {{direction}} of Nantes, and no doubt <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> been taken there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your {{letters to}} <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>have</b> been charming,' said Christopher. 'And so regular, too. It {{was as good}} as a {{birthday}} every time one arrived.' ...|$|R
60|$|Curious to {{know whether}} Biddy {{suspected}} him of having {{had a hand in}} that murderous attack of which <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> never been able to give any account, I asked her why she did not like him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, Mr Pinch!' said Miss Pecksniff. 'It {{all comes}} of this unfortunate marriage. If <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> {{not been so}} precipitate, and had not united herself to a Wretch, {{there would have been}} no Mr Chuffey in the house.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The wretched girls still sat {{silent and}} obstinate, {{with their heads}} down. I tremble again as I write of what {{happened}} next. Papa fixed his eyes on me. He said, out loud: [...] "Eunice!"--and {{waited for me to}} rise and answer, as <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> done.|$|E
60|$|And Psyche, <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> <b>having</b> won {{her point}} and pacified me, and conquered my scruples and gloom, and seeing me now submissive, smiled a gracious consent.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I am not {{thinking}} of Lord Keith. To speak it out, I cannot believe that <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> heart enough in this to justify her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so--perhaps so," [...] the {{professor}} agreed. [...] "She {{has gone to}} her aunt's, very likely, in Chelsea. <b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> a house there in Bromsgrove Terrace." ...|$|R
60|$|That was the {{conclusion}} which I came {{to at the}} time, and I have reason to know now that I was right, and that <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> even more cause than I had myself for believing {{that there was something}} uncanny about the tenants of Cloomber.|$|E
60|$|Pris took it very well; laughing, and {{blushing}} {{just enough}} to make her appear the loveliest creature I had ever laid eyes on. She shook her head very much as <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> done not long before, and disclaimed the analogy, first in her manner, and next with her tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{sent for}} me, Professor Cherubusco," [...] said the elder woman, wearily. [...] "I {{hope you have}} {{something}} more definite than usual to say. I've about lost the little faith I had in your art. I would not have responded to your call this evening if <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> not insisted upon it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The young American {{answered}} {{without looking}} behind him. [...] "As soon as we're started we'll go all right. <b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> written to a gentleman to come down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not directly. But <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has,</b> I know, {{very strong}} {{opinions}} on such subjects. Now, I {{want to ask}} you one thing. Is it true that--she--remains here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have already}} said, Mr. Nixon, {{answered}} Darsie, 'that I will canvass those matters of which <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> informed me, with my uncle himself, {{and with no}} other person.' ...|$|R
60|$|As for Lucy, she hastened away, {{as soon as}} she had induced me {{to accept}} the box; and I {{had no choice but to}} place all the pearls together, and put them in Grace's room, as <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> desired me to do with her own {{property}} before proceeding on her walk.|$|E
60|$|Without another word, {{she left}} me. I {{turned to look}} for Philip, and saw that <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> joined him while I had been {{speaking}} to Miss Jillgall. It pleased me to find that they were talking in a friendly way when I joined them. A quarrel between Helena and my husband that is to be--no, my husband that shall be--would have been too distressing, too unnatural I might almost call it.|$|E
6000|$|Maria {{opened the}} door; {{she told me}} that <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> already returned, {{accompanied}} by Miss Jillgall. There had been apparently some difference of opinion between them, before they entered the house. Eunice had attempted to go on to some other place; and Miss Jillgall had remonstrated. Maria had heard her say: [...] "No, you would degrade yourself"--and, with that, she had led Eunice indoors. I understood, of course, that <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> been prevented from following Philip to the hotel. There was probably a serious quarrel in store for me. I went straight to the bedroom, expecting to find Eunice there, and prepared to brave the storm that might burst on me. There was a woman at Eunice's end of the room, removing dresses from the wardrobe. I could only see her back, but it was impossible to mistake that figure--Miss Jillgall. She laid the dresses on Eunice's bed, without taking the slightest notice of me. In significant silence I pointed to the door. She went on as coolly with her occupation as if the room had been, not mine but hers; I stepped up to her, and spoke plainly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Violet Helen,' he repeated, with an {{intonation}} as if struck, not unpleasingly, by {{the second}} name. 'Well, {{that is the case}} in our family. <b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> an uncommon name.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know {{it for a}} {{positive}} fact. <b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> just got a new butler, who left Lord Radclyffe's service the very day Philip de Mountford first walked into the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't wear pinafores,' said Mysie, 'but I don't mind pretty aprons like this. 'Why, <b>my</b> <b>sisters</b> <b>had</b> {{them for}} tennis, {{before they went}} out to India. Come along, Dora,' {{grasping}} her hand.|$|R
60|$|My father {{received}} me {{with more}} ceremony than I liked. I had known, from a boy, {{what it meant}} when he chose to be only polite to his own son. What construction he had put on my long absence and my persistence in keeping my secret from him, I could not tell; but {{it was evident that}} I had lost my usual place in his estimation, and lost it past regaining merely by a week's visit. The estrangement between us, which <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> feared, had begun already.|$|E
6000|$|... "A tall old man, with {{a smooth}} face and white hair, looking as proud as Julius Cæsar and Roscoe Conkling on the same post-card, was there to meet her. His clothes were frazzled, but I didn't notice that till later. He took her little satchel, and they started over the plank-walks and went up a road along the hill. I kept along a piece behind 'em, trying to look like I was hunting a garnet ring in the sand that <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> lost at a picnic the {{previous}} Saturday.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Parker's car {{was waiting}} and we drove {{together}} to Covent Garden. I left {{them in the}} vestibule and went to call on some of my friends. <b>My</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> a box in the second tier and I {{was fortunate enough to}} find her there and alone with her husband. Almost directly underneath us in the stalls Mr. Parker and Eve were sitting; and next Mr. Parker was a woman wearing a pearl necklace. I asked my sister her name. She raised her lorgnette and looked {{over the side of the}} box.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is what <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> always said," [...] Sue eagerly assented to his {{suggestion}} of this theory. [...] "I suppose it's what I've always believed, too, somehow, or I couldn't have lived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> lives, or <b>has</b> lived, at Little Worthy, {{the next}} parish, and as unlike it as possible. It has a {{railroad}} in it, and the cockneys {{have come down}} on it and 'villafied' it. My aunt, Mrs. Lacy Clare, has lived there ever since <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> been with her; but now her last daughter is to be married, she wishes to give up housekeeping." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pelagia! <b>Sister!</b> <b>My</b> <b>sister!</b> <b>Have</b> {{mercy on}} me! on yourself! I will hide you! save you! {{and we will}} flee {{together}} out of this infernal place! this world of devils! I am your brother! Come!' ...|$|R
