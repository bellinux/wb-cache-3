5|$|A {{rammed earth}} wall is built by placing damp soil in a {{temporary}} form. The soil is manually or <b>mechanically</b> compacted {{and then the}} form is removed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mechanically</b> {{stabilized}} earth (MSE) {{retaining walls}} {{may be used}} for embankments.|$|E
5|$|Animals use {{muscles to}} move; {{even if we}} don't {{understand}} how they work, we can see they work <b>mechanically,</b> argues Paley, moving joints to and fro. Other organs such as the stomach work chemically to digest food.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{traditional}} applications, iron {{is also used}} for protection from ionizing radiation. Although it is lighter than another traditional protection material, lead, it is much stronger <b>mechanically.</b> The attenuation of radiation {{as a function of}} energy is shown in the graph.|$|E
5|$|As cubic {{boron nitride}} {{consists}} of light atoms {{and is very}} robust chemically and <b>mechanically,</b> {{it is one of}} the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.|$|E
5|$|By May 1921 sixteen were in service, {{and were}} mostly {{allocated}} to the London area, including the new marshalling yard at Feltham. Despite being <b>mechanically</b> sound, changes were made to Urie's original design after the Grouping of railway companies in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Several {{barriers}} protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, {{and biological}} barriers. The waxy cuticle of most leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin {{are examples of}} mechanical barriers that are {{the first line of}} defense against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary tract. In the lungs, coughing and sneezing <b>mechanically</b> eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract. The flushing action of tears and urine also <b>mechanically</b> expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|The muscles exactly {{relate to}} the joints, {{operating}} them <b>mechanically</b> like the wires and strings of a puppet. A complex case is the tongue. Sphincter muscles are admired also.|$|E
5|$|Although in {{operational}} theatres {{such as the}} Gulf War the Jaguar {{proved to}} be <b>mechanically</b> more reliable than the Panavia Tornado, the aircraft's avionics were a hindrance to conducting missions. Owing to the Jaguar A's shortcomings in navigation and target acquisition, French Jaguars had to be escorted by Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft to act as guides. The Jaguar provided a valuable component of the campaign, the RAF detachment of 12 Jaguars flew 612 combat sorties, with no aircraft lost.|$|E
5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are <b>mechanically</b> weaker metals but have useful {{corrosion}} prevention properties. While {{each of them}} will react with air, the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or a mixture of lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be {{inhabited}} by species of limoniid flies, such as Discobola marginata or Limonia yakushimensis, {{as well as}} several species of fungi-dwelling mites. The flies are hosts for the mites in a symbiotic association known as phoresis, whereby the mites are <b>mechanically</b> carried by its host. Mites are small and unable to migrate the relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance; the insect hosts, in comparison, are large and can transfer the mites between their preferred feeding habitats.|$|E
5|$|Girl with Ball was {{exhibited}} at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and was displayed in Newsweek {{review of the}} show. This work significantly alters the original source and is considered exemplary of Lichtenstein's works that exaggerate the <b>mechanically</b> produced appearance although {{the result of his}} painterly work. It is an enduring depiction of the contemporary beauty figure.|$|E
5|$|Lure {{coursing}} is a {{sport for}} dogs based on hare coursing, but involving dogs chasing a <b>mechanically</b> operated lure. Some critics of hare coursing suggest that coursers could test their dogs through lure coursing. However, coursers believe that, while lure coursing is good athletic exercise for their dogs, {{it does not}} approximate the testing vigour and sport of live coursing.|$|E
5|$|One type of {{piezoelectric}} transducer is the Langevin type, {{named after a}} transducer used by Paul Langevin in early sonar research. This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration. It {{can also be used}} on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be <b>mechanically</b> converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.|$|E
5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to defend themselves against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These <b>mechanically</b> reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores above and below ground. The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 is {{the first}} Aston Martin model to be {{designed}} and developed on Ford's aluminium VH (vertical/horizontal) platform. The body structure is composed of aluminium and composites melded together by <b>mechanically</b> fixed self-piercing rivets and robotic assisted adhesive bonding techniques. The bonded aluminium structure is claimed to possess {{more than double the}} torsional rigidity of its predecessor's, despite being 25 percent lighter.|$|E
5|$|The Kclass was {{designed}} to be <b>mechanically</b> similar to the SECR Nclass 2-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. The class was one of the earliest to use the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement in Britain. Production began {{towards the end of the}} First World War, and the prototype rolled out of Ashford Works three years after design work was completed due to wartime production constraints. The class replaced obsolete 4-4-0 passenger locomotives in an SECR fleet standardisation programme.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass was <b>mechanically</b> {{similar to}} the SECR Kclass 2-6-4 {{passenger}} tank engine, also by Maunsell. It influenced future 2-6-0 development in Britain and {{provided the basis for}} the 3-cylinder N1class of 1922. Production was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and the first Nclass rolled out of Ashford Works in 1917, three years after design work was completed. The class replaced obsolete 0-6-0s as part of the SECR's fleet standardisation, as they used parts interchangeable with those of other classes.|$|E
5|$|The Outsider (Billy Lush) {{offers to}} help Corvo in his quest. Described as {{a mixture of}} God and the Devil, The Outsider {{imprints}} his mark on Corvo, imbuing him with magical abilities, and provides him with a <b>mechanically</b> altered human heart (April Stewart) that tells Corvo secrets. The Outsider also grants his mark, and special abilities, to other characters. Smith described the character as an amoral figure who grants abilities, but leaves the choice of {{how to use them}} up to the recipient.|$|E
5|$|The Racz {{procedure}} {{employs a}} wire-bound or spring loaded catheter to <b>mechanically</b> break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibroids, that have formed around the nerve roots, {{and allows for}} local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area. This procedure was assigned a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech is the 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe {{that serves}} as the {{official}} mascot of the student body at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions. Its most noticeable role is leading the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty which the Wreck has performed since 1961. The Ramblin' Wreck is <b>mechanically</b> and financially maintained on campus by students in Ramblin' Reck Club.|$|E
5|$|The regiment, {{with three}} squadrons of tanks, {{would spend the}} next year in training, {{learning}} to use the signalling equipment and guns of the tanks it was expected to use. One squadron was to be equipped with Crusaders {{with the other two}} squadrons operating Shermans. However, the <b>mechanically</b> unreliable Crusaders were later replaced with Shermans. Burrows initially oversaw the transition to armour until he returned to New Zealand on furlough in May 1943 and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel J. W. McKergow.|$|E
5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} transistor in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace <b>mechanically</b> rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the earlier}} T-68 fleet were {{similarly}} equipped, and were known as T-68Ms. <b>Mechanically</b> and electrically the T-68M vehicles remained essentially a T-68, but had modifications to its brakes, mirrors, and speed limiters to suit the Eccles line. Initially only these vehicles were permitted to operate the Eccles line but the entire fleet except for 3 (1018, 1019, 1020) were modified between 2008 and 2012 for universal running, under a programme known as the T-68X Universal Running programme.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{provided}} {{the voice of}} an alien named Mala, a <b>mechanically</b> inclined free-thinker, in Battle for Terra, a 2008 computer-animated science fiction film about a peaceful alien planet that faces destruction from colonization by the displaced remainder of the human race. The film won the 2008 Grand Prize at the Ottawa International Animation Festival. The film showed at the San Francisco International Film Festival, where she received an award at the Midnight Awards along with Elijah Wood.|$|E
5|$|According to Méliès's recollections, much of {{the unusual}} cost of A Trip to the Moon {{was due to the}} <b>mechanically</b> {{operated}} scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular, which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas. Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads, feet, and kneecap pieces in terra cotta, and then created plaster molds for them. A specialist in mask-making used these molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear. One of the backdrops for the film, showing the inside of the glass-roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built, was painted to look like the actual glass-roofed studio in which the film was made.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both <b>mechanically</b> and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed exclusively by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8—have been largely carried over from the VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever, facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E
5|$|Born in Forbes, New South Wales, on 27February 1903, Lester Brain was {{the second}} son of an English mining {{engineer}} and manager, Austin Brain, and his Australian wife, Katie. Originally from Gloucestershire, Austin had emigrated with his parents and siblings in 1885, prospecting for gold in the United States before settling in Australia. By the age of thirteen, Lester owned his own motorcycle bought secondhand for £11; its poor condition and constant need for repair helped him become <b>mechanically</b> adept at an early age. He completed his education at Sydney Grammar School, where he excelled in maths, before being employed by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (CBC) in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Coin-operated {{machines}} to vend food, for amusement, and for gambling became {{popular in the}} 1890s. Such machines could be placed on otherwise unused floor space in businesses, required little maintenance, and brought in money for owners. Beginning about 1898, coin-operated mechanical pianos also became popular. The Mills Novelty Company was a leading producer of such devices; by 1906 it was producing machines ranging from a <b>mechanically</b> played violin to fortune-telling devices. While some {{machines to}}ok cents or other denominations, the nickel was the coin of choice for these machines.|$|E
5|$|Dale Russell {{hypothesized}} that the more lightly built and more common Gorgosaurus may have preyed on the abundant hadrosaurs of the time, while the more robust and less common Daspletosaurus may have specialized on the less prevalent but better-defended ceratopsids, {{which may have been}} more difficult to hunt. However, a specimen of Daspletosaurus (OTM 200) from the Two Medicine Formation preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region. The higher and broader muzzles of tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus are <b>mechanically</b> stronger than the lower snouts of albertosaurines like Gorgosaurus, although tooth strengths are similar between the two groups. This may indicate a difference in feeding mechanics or diet.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2010 {{with the goals}} of {{reworking}} the character Falco Lombardi to <b>mechanically</b> play like he did in Melee and increasing the accessibility of the gameplay style, but the project quickly evolved to a full-scale reworking of Brawl. The game's first demo build was released on February 7, 2011, and development continued until December 1, 2015, when the PMDT announced it would cease further development of Project M. The game has received positive comments from reviewers, amassed a player base of over 500,000, surpassed three million downloads, and been played in many professional tournaments.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, Ingersoll Rand pulled out. Keith {{approached}} the Clark Compressor Company and Worthington Pump and Machinery but they turned it down, {{saying that it}} could not be done. So Keith and Groves saw executives at Allis-Chalmers, who agreed to build a new factory to produce the pumps, even though the pump design was still uncertain. The SAM Laboratories came up with a design, and Westinghouse built some prototypes that were successfully tested. Then Judson Swearingen at the Elliott Company came up with a revolutionary and promising design that was <b>mechanically</b> stable with seals that would contain the gas. This design was manufactured by Allis-Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom <b>mechanically</b> is tedious and means batch process instead of continuous process, it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done <b>mechanically</b> by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF's MirageIII pilots {{generally}} {{found the}} process of converting to the Hornet to be straightforward. While the F/A-18 {{was considered to be}} easier to fly, its more sophisticated avionics and weapons systems required improved cockpit workload management skills. The Hornets have also proven to be <b>mechanically</b> reliable and easy to maintain, though shortages of spare parts reduced availability rates {{during the early years of}} their service with the RAAF. The updates installed as part of the HUG process have further simplified maintenance procedures. In recent years, however, the aging aircraft have required much more servicing than was the case in the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{effect of}} these passages is often further enhanced by textural and/or cyclical devices, such as a sudden shift of musical texture, concomitant with the shift in tonality; the use of <b>mechanically</b> repetitive accompanimental patterns, such as ostinati and repeated chords, in the tonally remote or oscillating passages; and the allusion to previously stated material, which appeared earlier in the piece, in tonally detached passages. Schubert's frequent use of similar harmonic, textural and cyclical devices in his settings of poems depicting such emotional states, only strengthens the suggestion of these psychological connotations.|$|E
