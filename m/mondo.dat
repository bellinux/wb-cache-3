5|$|The {{release of}} Ultime grida dalla savana {{initiated}} a rivalry between Climati and Morra {{and two other}} Italian <b>Mondo</b> film makers, Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni. These two filmmaking teams became the frontrunners of the <b>Mondo</b> genre {{in the late seventies}} and early eighties. The Castiglionis had made two previous <b>Mondo</b> films, Africa segreta and Africa ama, before the release of Ultime grida dalla savana. They later released three additional films: Magia nuda in 1975, Addio ultimo uomo in 1978, Africa dolce e selvaggio in 1982. Climati and Morra made two follow-up films to Ultime grida dalla savana. The first followup, Savana violenta, also known as Savage Man Savage Beast no. 2, was released in 1976. Savana violenta was slightly less graphic in its depiction of violence. The last film, Dolce e selvaggio, was released in 1983 and consisted partly of outtakes and recycled footage from Climati and Morra's two previous films. Each subsequent release by the two parties would attempt to outperform the previous films with more explicit and shocking content.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} film of Climati's and Morra's Savage Trilogy, which also {{includes}} Savana violenta (This Violent World) and Dolce e selvaggio (Sweet and Savage). The best known film of the trilogy, Ultime grida dalla savana became influential in exploitation cinema by use of cinematographic techniques that were repeated in numerous subsequent <b>Mondo</b> films. Two scenes in particular, a lion attack on a tourist in Namibia and the murder of an indigenous man {{by a group of}} mercenaries in South America, have gained notoriety as genuine footage of human death. The film also sparked a rivalry between the team of Climati and Morra and the brothers Alfredo and Angelo Castiglioni. These two teams became the forerunners of the second generation of <b>Mondo</b> cinema.|$|E
