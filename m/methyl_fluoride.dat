Optimization of <b>methyl</b> <b>fluoride</b> concentrations resulted in complete inhibition of acetoclastic methanogenesis. Methane was then exclusively produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and thus allowed determination of the fractionation factors specific for this methanogenic pathway. Acetate, which was then no longer consumed, accumulated and allowed determination of the isotopic signatures of the fermentatively produced acetate.

The isotope data were used for calculation of the relative contribution of hydrogenotrophic vs. acetoclastic methanogenesis to total CH 4 production.

The ions Li+, Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, and Ba 2 + had little effect on the enzyme, and Ca 2 +, can partially promote its activity at low concentration. edu. c...|$|R
30|$|Telescopium telescopium, {{a marine}} mollusc {{collected}} from Sundarban mangrove, {{belongs to the}} largest mollusca phylum {{in the world and}} exudes a blue secretion when stimulated mechanically. The blue secretion was found to metabolize (preferentially) para-amino benzoic acid, a substrate for N-acetyl transferase (NAT), thereby indicating acetyl transferase like activity of the secretion. Attempts were also made to characterise bioactive fraction of the blue secretion and to further use this as a biomarker for monitoring of marine pollution. NAT like enzyme from marine mollusc is a potential candidate for detoxification of different harmful chemicals. A partially purified extract of blue secretion was obtained by fractional precipitation with (NH 4) 2 SO 4. From different fractions obtained by precipitation, the 0 – 30 % fraction (30 S) displayed NAT like activity (using para amino benzoic acid as a substrate with para nitrophenyl phosphate or acetyl coenzyme A as acetyl group donors). Maximum NAT like enzyme activity was attained at 25 °C and at a pH of 6. The enzyme activity was found to be inhibited by 5  mM phenyl <b>methyl</b> sulfonyl <b>fluoride.</b> The divalent metal ions reduced NAT like activity of 30 S. Moreover, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + (at concentration of 1  mM) completely inhibited NAT activity. The thermal stability and bench-top stability studies were performed and {{it was found that the}} enzyme was stable at room temperature for more than 24  hours. Results from the present study further indicate that heavy metal content in blue secretion gradually decreased from pre-monsoon to post-monsoon season, which also corresponded to the change in NAT like activity. Therefore, this article stresses the importance of biomarker research for monitoring pollution.|$|R
40|$|Keratinolytic {{protease}} is an inducible specific proteolytic enzyme, {{which is}} produced by Bacillus licheniformis MZK- 03 in presence of keratin (feather mill) as sole carbon and nitrogen source in growth medium. Maximum level of keratinolytic protease was produced after 42 h at 37 °C {{over a wide range}} of initial pH (5. 0 to 12. 0) under continuous agitation (200 rpm). Keratinolytic protease worked best at 37 °C and at pH 8. 5. The enzyme was quite stable over a wide range of pH (7. 0 to 11. 0) but activity dropped drastically beyond this level (enzyme activity dropped to 8. 8 % and 19. 3 % at pH 6. 5 and 12. 0, respectively). Half-life of keratinolytic protease at 70 ° and 60 °C were found to be 3 and 7 min respectively. The enzyme showed highest stability at 40 °C (> 90 % after 3 h). The half-life at 4 °C was 34 days. The presence of metal ions (5 mM) like Mg 2 +, Mn 2 +, Ca 2 + and K + had no remarkable effect on the keratinolytic protease activity but the activity decreased in presence of Hg 2 + and Cu 2 +. The enzyme may belong to serine protease group as it is inhibited by serine protease inhibitor phenyl <b>methyl</b> sulphonyl <b>fluoride</b> (PMSF). The enzyme is as compatible as other commercially available enzymes used in leather industry with tannery chemicals. It was completely incompatible with Na 2 S and CaO for their high alkalinity (pH> 13. 0), which was also observed for other commercial enzymes except the commercial enzyme supplemented with ammonium sulphate...|$|R
