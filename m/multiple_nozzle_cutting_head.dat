The amount of drosses produced is much smaller than for another tool. These properties are interesting to use the laser tool in hostile environments encounte-red in nuclear dismantling operations. In this specific application, {{it is necessary to}} take into account the constraints of the nuclear environment : radiations, confinment, aerosol products; as also the technolo-gical laser constraints : transportation of the laser beam, crossing of the hot-cell wall, cutting of 3 D structures. The first constraint is this of a remote work. We have been lead to develop a specific tool. This tool consists in five axis arm, slim enough to be introduced in a 10 inches diameter hole. The total length is 1. 70 m, therefore the slenderness is very high compared with the weight (22 Kg). In this paper we present the technical elements of this laser robot : mechanical structures, articulations, actuators, beam handling system, <b>nozzle</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> and the robot controller. We give the first results obtained with this tool on different kind of workpieces in a non-active environment.

40|$|DE 102008027524 B 3 UPAB: 20090928 NOVELTY - The {{laser cutting}} unit is moved conventionally, {{relative}} to the workpiece (1. 4). In a novel arrangement, the <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle</b> (1. 3) fastened to the <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> (1) can also be moved in two axial directions, parallel {{to the surface of}} the workpiece. This additional movement is caused by a separate drive system. The new arrangement increases the working area of the laser cutter. The focusing optic (1. 2) is a telecentric planar field optic and/or a telecentric F-theta optic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle</b> rotates about an axis directed at right angles to the workpiece surface. The rotational axis of the nozzle, or of its opening, is located eccentrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of the <b>cutting</b> <b>head.</b> An eccentric drive moves the <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle.</b> A double-eccentric drive is used, with two drive motors. These are independently-controlled. The eccentric drives are connected. They are arranged one inside the other, or one above the other. Through combined nozzle movement and beam (10) deflection, the operational area achieved on the workpiece reaches at least 7 mm 2. The <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle</b> is alternatively moved by two independently-controlled linear drives. The drives used are: moving coil, pneumatic or hydraulic. The linear drives act on the <b>cutting</b> <b>nozzle</b> from the radial exterior of the unit, and are articulated to it. The laser beam and cutting gas are directed through the nozzle onto the workpiece. The nozzle opening is circular, elliptical or slot-shaped. The nozzle is held by a cross-slide assembly with linear drives to each slide. The beam deflection includes an oscillatory motion. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM IS INCLUDED FOR the corresponding laser cutting method. USE - Agile laser cutting equipment with a mirror deflecting the focused beam. ADVANTAGE - By superimposing mechanical and optical deflections, variation of cutting direction can be achieved with smaller radii. This accelerates the cutting operation, increasing production and saving cutting gas. At the same time, stressing of the equipment by accelerations and torques is reduced. Wear is reduced and equipment life is extended. Movements of individual drives become smoother. Agility is increased without increase in the size of the gas opening, so cutting gas is conserved. The additional drives permit simpler optics to be used if required. This minimizes cost. Advantages of differing types of nozzle drives are discussed further in the disclosure. Gas flow is readily matched with the cutting requirement and either conical-cylindrical or Laval nozzles can be used...|$|R

It is a mixture of water and, usually, bentonite or polymer continuously pumped to the <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> or drill bit to facilitate the removal of cuttings, stabilize the bore hole, cool the <b>cutting</b> <b>head,</b> and lubricate the passage of the product pipe. The drilling fluid is sent into a machine called a reclaimer which removes the drill cuttings and maintains the proper viscosity of the fluid. Drilling fluid holds the cuttings in suspension to prevent them from clogging the bore. A clogged bore creates back pressure on the <b>cutting</b> <b>head,</b> slowing production.|$|R

40|$|An on-car brake lathe resurfaces disk-brake rotors by {{rotating}} them "in place" {{and making a}} light cut along {{the surface of the}} disk. The primary goal of this thesis is to develop an automated <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> for an on-car brake lathe. The new <b>cutting</b> <b>head</b> must produce a surface finish that matches or exceeds that of the current (manual) <b>cutting</b> <b>head.</b> Pro-Cut International, a leading manufacturer of on-car brake lathes, developed functional requirements and cost constraints for the automated <b>cutting</b> <b>head.</b> Technical challenges include design and fabrication of low-cost precision linear bearings and actuators with dynamic stiffness sufficient to suppress chatter. During this thesis, two prototype <b>cutting</b> <b>heads</b> were designed, manufactured, and tested. The first prototype employed modular linear bearings, and produced unacceptable surface finish due to chatter. Cutting-tip vibration measurements combined with modal testing showed that chatter was caused by low structural stiffness of the modular bearing rails. A second prototype employing a unitary ground bearing system produced an acceptable surface finish of 70 [mu] -inch at 0. 015 " depth of cut per side. The key components of this design can be extruded and sliced to form the assembly, thereby meeting cost constraints. by Andrew Kirk Wilson. Thesis (S. M.)
