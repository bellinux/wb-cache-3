By titrating the acid-unfolded cytochrome c with sodium perchlorate, an exothermic reaction was observed. The titration curve obtained from the heat was cooperative and agreed well with the conformational transition curve measured by CD at 222 nm. This result indicated that the salt-induced conformation change is well approximated by a two-state transition between the acid-unfolded and <b>molten</b> globule <b>states.</b> The heat for formation of the <b>molten</b> globule <b>state</b> estimated by isothermal titration calorimetry {{was consistent with the}} enthalpy change for unfolding of the sodium perchlorate-stabilized <b>molten</b> globule <b>state</b> at pH 1. 8, which was measured by differential scanning calorimetry and CD.

The <b>molten</b> globule <b>state</b> of α-lactalbumin has been best characterized, but two major issues {{have yet to be}} clarified. At which stage of the kinetic refolding is the <b>molten</b> globule <b>state</b> stably organized? And what is the major driving force that stabilizes the <b>molten</b> globule <b>state?</b> We address these questions in this paper. ResultsWe have investigated the refolding kinetics of α-lactalbumin using stopped-flow CD and fluorescence, acrylamide quenching and pulsed hydrogen exchange NMR techniques.

2500|$|The {{alkali metal}} ions {{are small and}} mobile; their {{presence}} in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in <b>molten</b> <b>state</b> or at high temperature.

The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance. Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by dealkalization, removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds.

The conformation of the protein was analyzed {{by a combination}} of fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements. The most obvious effect of HFIP was lowering of the transition temperature with an increase in the concentration of the alcohol up to 0. 30 M, beyond which no calorimetric transition was observed. Up to 0. 30 M HFIP the calorimetric and van’t Hoff enthalpy remained the same, indicating the validity of the two-state approximation for the thermal unfolding of -lactalbumin. The quantitative thermodynamic parameters accompanying the thermal transitions have been evaluated. Spectroscopic observations confirm that -lactalbumin is in the <b>molten</b> globule <b>state</b> in the presence of 0. 50 M HFIP at pH 7. 0 and 0. 75 M HFIP at pH 9. 0.

From equilibrium unfolding studies of two paralogous proteins and their variants, glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) and two of its variants [glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) and its isolated domains, and a GluRS− GlnRS chimera], we demonstrate that only GlnRS forms a molten globule-like intermediate at low urea concentrations. We demonstrated that a loop in the GlnRS C-terminal anticodon binding domain that promotes communication with the N-terminal domain and indirectly modulates amino acid binding is also responsible for stabilization of the <b>molten</b> globule <b>state.</b> This loop was inserted into GluRS in the eukaryotic branch after the archaea−eukarya split, right around the time when GlnRS evolved. Because of the structural and functional importance of the loop, it is proposed that the insertion of the loop into a putative ancestral GluRS in eukaryotes produced a catalytically active <b>molten</b> globule <b>state.</b> Because of their enhanced dynamic nature, catalytically active molten globules are likely to possess broad substrate specificity. It is further proposed that the putative broader substrate specificity allowed the catalytically active molten globule to accept glutamine in addition to glutamic acid, leading {{to the evolution of}} GlnRS. Many functional proteins fold into a well-defined threedimensional structure. However, {{it is now clear that}} not all proteins fold into a uniquely defined native state conformation. Many are intrinsically unfolded, while others can be partially folded or present in a molten globule-like structure in which the fold is compact but the internal mobility is significantly enhanced. 1 The molten globule class of compact states is ubiquitous in nature, and in many cases, they are produced under mildly denaturing conditions. 2 However, for many proteins, a <b>molten</b> globule <b>state</b> has not yet been detected under several denaturing conditions, indicating that they are energetically far removed from the native state.
