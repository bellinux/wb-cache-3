5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of}} the sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Eumetazoa.|$|E
5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E

25|$|A peak-sensing {{compressor}} {{responds to}} the instantaneous level of the input signal. While providing tighter peak control, peak sensing might yield very quick changes in gain reduction, more evident compression or sometimes even distortion. Some compressors apply an averaging function (commonly root mean square or RMS) on the input signal before comparing its level to the threshold. This produces a more relaxed compression that <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> human perception of loudness.|$|R

In Denmark, for example, {{it was one}} aspect of Skønvirke ("aesthetic work"), which itself <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> the Arts and Crafts style. Likewise, artists adopted many of the floral and organic motifs of Art Nouveau into the Młoda Polska ("Young Poland") style in Poland. Młoda Polska, however, was also {{inclusive}} of other artistic styles and encompassed a broader approach to art, literature, and lifestyle.|$|R

However, it is known empirically that, for a fixed topology, the power transfer distribution factors are relatively insensitive to the operating point. We demonstrate this result theoretically for systems of arbitrary topology with losses, but only for the special case of having reactive compensation sufficient to keep voltages constant at all busses. We also analyze a power to current distribution factor that <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> thermal constraints. We provide empirical corroboration for the theoretical result...|$|R

5|$|There {{has been}} some debate over the {{relationship}} of Mammuthus to Loxodonta or Elephas.

40|$|Power {{transfer}} distribution factors {{depend on}} the operating point and topology of an electric power system. However, it is known empirically that, for a fixed topology, the power transfer distribution factors are relatively insensitive to the operating point. We demonstrate this result theoretically for lossless systems in two ways: as an exact result for a system having "series-parallel" topology and a single point of injection and a single point of withdrawal and also as an approximate result for systems of arbitrary topology but having reactive compensation sufficient to keep voltages constant at all busses. To the extent that losses are small, the results apply also for more realistic systems with losses. We also analyze two other distribution factors that <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> thermal and steady-state stability constraints...|$|R

5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull and teeth, {{it was later}} thought that monkey lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether the monkey lemurs or the sloth lemurs were <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> today's indriids. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled {{with the discovery of}} new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls and teeth. More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the monkey lemurs were <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indriids and sloth lemurs.|$|E

40|$|Despite its nearly {{thousand}} year {{history as}} a Christian penitent ritual, the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage has undergone rapid transformation {{in the last three}} decades, attracting a specific community of people who see themselves as “authentic” Camino pilgrims. Upon arrival at the shrine of Santiago, the traditional end of the pilgrimage route, many pilgrims express feelings of dissatisfaction. Drawing upon field research and interviews, this paper analyzes the practices of pilgrims along the Camino de Santiago route, at the shrine in Santiago de Compostela, and at the alternative conclusion site in the Galician coastal town of Finisterre. I argue that pilgrim dissatisfaction <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> pilgrim experiences in Santiago that are incongruous with their pilgrimage up until that point. In response, pilgrims have created alternative ritual conclusions that <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> their experience on the Camino route and affirm their identity as “authentic” pilgrims...|$|R
