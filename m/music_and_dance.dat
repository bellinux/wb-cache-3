This paper explores {{the possibility of}} adopting methodology that has been developed for protecting endangered languages and using it {{for the maintenance of}} traditional <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>dances.</b> Background Languages, <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>dances</b> share many traits: they are all used for self-expression and can convey messages of different sorts. Most importantly, they often have a symbolic and identity value and reflect socioeconomic and political changes in society. With regard to small languages – minority or regional languages – <b>and</b> traditional <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>dances,</b> the similarity between them is even more striking, as they belong to the same cultural ecosystem and they are affected in the same way by socio-economic pressures coming from outside the community. Moreover, changes taking place in one are likely to extend to the others as well.

5|$|South Indian {{music and}} dances {{such as the}} Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region. As {{a result of their}} culture policies, North Indian <b>music</b> <b>and</b> <b>dance</b> gained {{popularity}} during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams, and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (courtesans). These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture, and were appointed to teach singing, poetry and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy. This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music, dholak ke geet (household songs based on local Folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. The state government organises the Golconda <b>Music</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dance</b> Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.|$|E
