40|$|ABSTRACT The {{development}} {{and application of}} an automated weighing and analysis system for growth and feed efficiency studies are described. The system consists of an electronic balance connected, via a BCD interface cable, to a portable desk-top computer. Integral features of the computer are a display, paper tape printer, and a cassette tape drive for programs and data storage, {{all of which are}} necessary for efficient data procurement. Twenty-four pens of chicks and the remaining feed can be weighed, with electronic weight transfer to the computer, and a compre-hensive output of raw data, calculated results, and statistical analyses can be obtained in approxi-mately 1 hr. No <b>manual</b> <b>data</b> <b>entries</b> or calculations are necessary after weighing has been initiated. The results of a chick growth and feed efficiency experiment are presented.

Common desktop publishing and word processing applications use spell checkers and grammar checkers, which may pick up on some transcription/transposition errors; however, these tools cannot catch all errors, as some errors form new words which are grammatically correct. For instance, if the user wished to write [...] "The fog was dense", but instead put [...] "The dog was dense", a grammar and spell checker would not notify the user because both phrases are grammatically correct, as is the spelling of the word [...] "dog".

40|$|Introduction: Across Queensland {{midwives}} collect birth related data via the perinatal {{data collection}} form {{in either a}} paper or online format. This data is then transferred to the perinatal data collection unit of Queensland Health who purport that “the quality of information produced from the perinatal data collection depends on the accurate, consistent and timely completion of the forms (QHealth Perinatal Data Unit, 2010 : 201). The version submitted often differs from the medical record {{which means that the}} many and varied services that the perinatal data collection provides information for, funding, resource planning, research, education, are compromised. This research will develop a substantive grounded theory after an in-depth analysis of the processes used by midwives to record birth related data. The objectives of the research are to examine issues that contribute to midwives <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> This research will contribute to knowledge by understanding the factors that influence the practice of midwives in the process of birth related <b>data</b> <b>entry.</b> Specifically, an examination of processes used by midwives to enter data onto paper charts and into the online perinatal data form will be undertaken. Research outcomes will assist nursing management, nurses in informatics and information managers to understand current practice. This knowledge can then be used to provide education and contribute to improved design in information systems that are used to collect data in obstetrics. With the impending move to increase eHealth technologies used in health care, it is necessary to understand the processes midwives use to enter data using eHealth so the move away from <b>manual</b> paper <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> can be done while maintaining data integrity...|$|R

40|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>data</b> {{collection}} and <b>entry</b> {{is one of}} the bottlenecks in conventional disaster management information systems. Time is a critical factor in emergency situations and timely data {{collection and}} processing may help in saving several lives. An effective disaster management system needs to collect data from World Wide Web automatically. A prerequisite for data collection process is document classification mechanism to classify a particular document into different categories. Ontologies are formal bodies of knowledge used to capture machine understandable semantics of a domain of interest and have been used successfully to support document classification in various domains. This paper presents an ontology-based document classification technique for automatic data collection in a disaster management system. A general ontology of disasters is used that contains the description of several natural and man-made disasters. The proposed technique augments the conventional classification measures with the ontological knowledge to improve the precision of classification. A preliminary implementation of the proposed technique shows promising results with up to 10 % overall improvement in precision when compared with conventional classification methods...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedComputer calendaring has matured {{to the point}} where peoples calendars are easily synchronized across devices, shared between other people and organizations, and used to coordinate and schedule mutually agreeable meeting times. These and other advances have made computer calendaring indispensable in peoples personal and professional lives. Despite the recent advances in the scheduling capabilities of computer calendaring software, there are still areas of scheduling that are not so well accomplished or even possible in todays computer calendaring state of the art. Non-fixed date template schedules, used in military exercise and contingency plans (e. g., POA and M), are examples of schedules that are highly flexible and reusable. Because of their unique scheduling properties and relationships, however, they cannot be modeled in mainstream computer calendaring tools. As a result, when applying these types of schedules to a computer calendar, a great deal of human calculation, <b>manual</b> manipulation, and <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> are required to get the schedule information into the calendar. This thesis explores extensions to the iCalendar data model. These extensions will enable schedule hierarchies and temporally related events to be modeled in mainstream calendaring applications. The results will show considerable savings in human processing effort and that reduction in data-entry errors is possible. Lieutenant Colonel, United States Marine Corp...|$|R

The study aims {{to describe the}} type of care in kinship foster care placements in the Nseleni area, Richards Bay. The objectives {{of the study were}} to investigate the physical and material circumstances of the families, to explore the psycho-social needs of the children, to explore whether or not the kinship carer is experiencing physical and emotional problems and to identify support systems available to kinship carers. The study was guided by the ecosystems perspective. This perspective attempts to appreciate and understand people in their environment. The ecosystems perspective was pertinent in this study as it provided a framework for understanding the individual, family, community and society context in which kinship carers operate. A quantitative descriptive (survey) approach guided this study. This design is useful for describing the characteristics of a large population and therefore it was an appropriate design for this study which aimed at describing how children in kinship care are being cared for. The sample comprised of 30 kinship carers who were respondents.
