40|$|Abstract - The <b>meteorological</b> <b>network</b> in Croatia {{has been}} {{operating}} continuously {{since the middle of}} the 19 century. Wars, as signicifant historical events have a tendency to interrupt such continuity. This paper presents a diagram of the meteorological stations network development, since 1850 showing the decrease in the total number of meteorological stations during and after World War I, World War II and in the period of aggression on Croatia from 1991 to 1993. The impact of war in the period from 1991 to 1993 is presented in greater detail by a second diagram, showing an evident correlation between actual war activities and the lack of meteorological observations, damage to meteorological equipment and buildings. The horizontal and vertical distribution of meteorological stations within the <b>meteorological</b> <b>network</b> is shown for the year when the distribution was in accordance with criteria recomended by The World Meteorological Organization. If we compare the total number of meteorological stations on 31 December 1993 with the recommended optimum number of meteorological stations, (in accordance with WMO regulations) we can see that only 54. 7 % stations were active. Compared to the total number of meteorological stations before the aggression (31 December l 99 O) 3 O. 4 % stations were destroyed or incapacitated from 1991 to the end of 1993 by war activities. The direct damage (destroyed buildings and instruments of the basic <b>meteorological</b> <b>network)</b> amounts to more than US$ two million. Evidence has been collected from the participants to these events and original reports supplied by the Heads of meteorological stations are quoted. Photographs, diagrams, tables and data from our station catalogues have been used to prepare this article. The period analysed ends on 31 December 1993...|$|E

This should significantly improve the quality, and therefore the applicability, of the high-resolution data available from such networks.

However, <b>meteorological</b> <b>networks,</b> which can provide the necessary information, are commonly sparse in complex terrains, especially in high mountainous regions. In order to provide temperature data in an adequate temporal and spatial resolution for local scale applications, we have developed a new downscaling method able to scale 3 -hourly ERA-Interim temperature data. The scheme is based on model internal vertical lapse rates derived from different ERA-Interim pressure levels. The results are validated for three meteorological stations, located within the same ERA-Interim grid element: Zugspitze, Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Zugspitzplatt, in the German Alps; they are also compared with two other statistical, lapse rate based downscaling approaches.
