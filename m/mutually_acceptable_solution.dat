2500|$|In August 2009, UN {{mediator}} Matthew Nimetz expressed pessimism {{regarding the}} Greek {{response to the}} names he proposed in his July meetings. Nimetz said [...] "Efforts to solve the name issue continue, even though Greece’s answer is not positive". According to the Greek representative, Athens would not accept a proposed formulation that was only intended for use in bilateral relations, and insisted that any name that is decided must be used internationally. In late August, Nimetz met Zoran Jolevski, the ethnic Macedonian negotiator who said that [...] "Macedonia is committed to active participation in the talks over the name and we expect a <b>mutually</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>solution,</b> which will ensure preserving of the identity, dignity and integrity of the Macedonian citizens {{on the basis of}} Euro-Atlantic values and democratic principles."

40|$|Conflict {{detection}} and resolution {{is a critical}} capacity for realizing free flight. In this paper, an onboard multi-agent system algorithm is proposed to solve the air traffic conflict {{detection and}} resolution problem involving multiple aircraft, where each aircraft may be regarded as an intelligent agent. Multilaterally acceptable resolutions to conflicts are solved as a constraint satisfaction problem, using a pair wise, argumentbased negotiation approach. Ground based air traffic control is included in this system, acting as a high-level supervisor and coordinator. It has authority to approve or override proposals from any aircraft; force an aircraft to accept a proposal; and to open or close a negotiation. It may also join the collaboration to represent those aircraft which lack the capacity to negotiate for themselves. Real-time constraints such as response time and negotiation deadline {{are included in the}} proposed algorithm. Results for a head-on conflict scenario demonstrate that the proposed negotiation system and algorithm is capable of providing <b>mutually</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>solutions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{problems}} often {{result from}} the distributed and uncoordinated land use management practices of individual decision-makers that, when taken together, cause significant environmental impacts. To develop feasible and politically <b>acceptable</b> <b>solutions</b> to such problems it is often necessary to foster compromise and consensus among a diverse set of special interest groups who possess overlapping sets of objectives; some quantifiable, some not. The union of these sets forms a criteria space that constrains the set of feasible solutions that may be adopted by resource managers. As interest groups work toward the common goal of a <b>mutually</b> <b>acceptable</b> resource management plan they often require assistance in the development, representation, and analysis of this criteria space. Furthermore, new tools are needed that form explicit links between criteria space and the geographic space that is being managed. This paper illustrates how genetic algorithms are used to construct a link between criteria and geographic space and to evolve <b>mutually</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>solutions</b> to complex environmental problems. Intelligent agents help decision-makers invoke various criteria and learn from the successes and failures of generated solutions in both geographic and criteria space. This knowledge is used to help users assess the fitness of alternative solutions and generate improved solutions to complexenvironmental problems. Research in cumulative impact assessment illustrates how individually insignificant land use decisions can have significant deleterious impacts on the environment (Johnston e...|$|R

30|$|Lastly, our {{conceptual}} framework of pastoral livelihoods predicts {{a high degree}} of mixing among private and public landowners in recent years. Pastoralists who live in group ranches (communal ranches) also live adjacent to private ranchers and farmers. These households subsequently gain assistance in the form of grants, employment, rations, mobile clinics, and emergency transportation from private neighbouring ranches. In turn, private ranchers use these assistance networks to negotiate with pastoral neighbours for developing wildlife conservancies and eco-tourism and holistic management of grazing patches. We hypothesize that out of necessity, pastoralists and ranchers must engage in shared negotiations in order to find <b>mutually</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>solutions</b> to the problem of shared access to local resources, particularly traditional grazing patches. In many parts of East Africa, pastoral families must compete with endangered species conservation and eco-tourism (Gadd 2005; Muthiani et al. 2011; Wambuguh 2007) for access to grazing. When forage dries up or droughts arise, families have to either rent grazing land from their neighbours or risk migrating across private/public parcels to distant pastures in western and southern highlands (Herren 1988; Huho et al. 2009; et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of multiagent technology for urban planning purposes has already received much attention {{with regard to}} predicting and evaluating the effects of different policy scenarios and plan alternatives. The generation of these plan alternatives, however, remains underexplored in this context. In this paper the authors describe a multiagent model for generating alternative land-use plans, in which the agents are land-use experts that initiate the development of plan proposals and {{communicate with each other}} over time in order to draw up the proposals incrementally. The authors present a probabilistic approach to agent behaviour to enable decisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty. They describe what personal and collective beliefs agents construct and use in order to choose their actions strategically. The negotiation, taking place between the initiating agent and the other agents, aimed at reaching agreement with regard to the various claims, is organized as an iterative process in which both parties consider conciliatory adjustments to their strategies, and thus their decisions, {{in order to try to}} find <b>mutually</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>solutions.</b> A hypothetical case study demonstrates the operation of the model and the effects of its behavioural parameter...|$|R
