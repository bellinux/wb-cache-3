40|$|A {{variable}} resistance device is described {{which includes a}} cylindrical housing having elongated resistance wires. A <b>movable</b> <b>arm</b> having a supporting block carried on the outer end is rotatably carried by the cylindrical housing. An arcuate steel spring member is pivotally supported by the <b>movable</b> <b>arm.</b> A leather wiper member is carried adjacent to {{one end of the}} spring steel member, and an electrically conductive surface is carried adjacent to the other end. The supporting block maintains the spring steel member in compression so that a constant pressure is applied to the conductive end of the spring steel member and the leather wiper. The leather wiper is saturated with a lubricating oil for maintaining the resistance wire clean as the <b>movable</b> <b>arm</b> is manipulated...|$|R

50|$|Lego Technic {{is a line}} of Lego {{interconnecting}} plastic {{rods and}} parts.

25|$|The {{telescopic}} motion {{ability of}} inner shells and their unique mechanical properties will permit {{the use of}} multi-walled nanotubes as main <b>movable</b> <b>arms</b> in coming nanomechanical devices. Retraction force that occurs to telescopic motion caused by the Lennard-Jones interaction between shells and its value is about 1.5nN.|$|R
50|$|The {{generally}} accepted {{definition of a}} crane is a machine for lifting and moving heavy objects by means of ropes or cables suspended from a <b>movable</b> <b>arm.</b> As such, a lifting machine that does not use cables, or else provides only vertical and not horizontal movement, cannot strictly be called a 'crane'.|$|R
50|$|Ta' Kenuna Tower is {{identical}} to the towers at Għaxaq and Għargħur, consisting of three floors, each containing a single room. The floors are linked together and with the roof by a spiral staircase. The signalling equipment, consisting of a wooden pole with three <b>movable</b> <b>arms,</b> was located on the tower's roof.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} shadow plays called nang-talung in Thai. This {{is a show}} in which shadows of pieces of cow or water buffalo hide cut to {{represent}} human figures with <b>movable</b> <b>arms</b> and legs are thrown on a screen for the entertainment of spectators. In India, this kind of show is called Chhaya nataka.|$|R
25|$|A {{precursor}} to the minifigure was released in 1975. These were at the same scale as the current minifigures, but had a different design. They had solid torsos without separate <b>movable</b> <b>arms,</b> solid lower body pieces that were not moveable, and heads without printed features. They had a small variety of headpieces in various colors, including caps, pigtail hair and cowboy hats.|$|R
50|$|Three-point hitches are {{composed}} of three <b>movable</b> <b>arms.</b> The two lower arms—the hitch lifting arms—are controlled by the hydraulic system, and provide lifting, lowering, and even tilting to the arms. The upper center arm—called the top link—is movable, but is usually not powered by the tractor's hydraulic system. Each arm has an attachment device to connect implements to the hitch.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{a current}} {{scenario}} voice and data recognition {{is one of}} the most sought after field in the area of artificial intelligence and robotic 1 engineering. The idea specializes on deriving a voice to voice intelligent system which operates purely on audiovoice instructions using a specialized voice recognition module a micro controller a set of wheels and a <b>movable</b> <b>arm</b> to operate. The working involves real time voice inputs feeded to the VR module which equivalently processes the audio signals and produces the output in audio format. It consists an IDE for both Windows and UNIX based operating system for manipulating and processing instructions both at software and hardware levels. The system also can perform a basic set of manual operations decides through the expert system. The VR module processes the data using multilayer perceptron to generate the required result. <b>Movable</b> <b>arm</b> operates to pick and place objects as per the given voice instructions. Its usability involves substituting manual work at both personal and professional levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{relates to}} {{a tool for}} the mounting of 0 -rings in drilled grooves. The invention is characterized by at least three <b>movable</b> split <b>arms,</b> which apply an external force in the radial direction on the O-ring, and at least three <b>movable</b> power-operated <b>arms,</b> which apply an internal force in the radial direction on the O-ring in order to mount O-rings with different dimensions...|$|R

5000|$|The Model 11 (1922) 70 mm mortar is {{exceptional}} among Japanese mortars in that, {{although a}} muzzle-loading weapon, {{it has a}} rifled bore. The Japanese marking is [...] "11th year model high-angle infantry gun". A monopod, similar to {{the support of the}} US 4.2-inch chemical mortar, is another telling feature. The total weight of the weapon is 133.75 lb, of which 99.5 lb represents the weight of the base plate. The traverse of the piece is 410 mils (23 degrees), and its elevation is 661 to 1,370 mils (37 to 77 degrees). A gunner's quadrant is used to lay in the weapon. It has a level vial, actuated by a knob, a <b>movable</b> <b>arm,</b> and a fixed elevation scale. The elevation scale is graduated in half-degree units from 0 to 55 degrees. The <b>movable</b> <b>arm</b> has a vernier scale which permits readings of 1/16th degree. Before the weapon can be fired, by means of a lanyard attached to a striker arm, a latch pin on the breech end of the tube must be set in its recess.|$|R

25|$|The {{figures of}} the wayang are also present in the {{paintings}} of that time, for example, the roof murals of the courtroom in Klungkung, Bali. They are still present in traditional Balinese painting today. The figures are painted, flat woodcarvings (a maximum of 5 to 15mm thick—barely half an inch) with <b>movable</b> <b>arms.</b> The head is solidly attached to the body.

50|$|Rather than {{employing}} a rigid frame to mount motors and rotors as {{is done in}} quadcopters and other multirotors, in the switchblade mechanism motors and rotors are mounted on <b>movable</b> <b>arms.</b> These arms can pivot and so enable storage of the rotors and motors inside the fuselage, where they do not cause aerodynamic drag and hence enable to aircraft to fly faster and more efficient. Compared to a pure winged aircraft, the VTOL system, including the switchblade mechanism, increases the weight of an aircraft by around 15%.|$|R

For the boxing scenes of Body and Soul (1947), he entered the boxing ring on roller-skates, carrying an early hand-held camera.
