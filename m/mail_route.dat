5|$|The {{various types}} of horse ridden by riders of the Pony Express {{included}} Morgans and thoroughbreds which were often used on {{the eastern end of}} the trail. Mustangs were often used on the western (more rugged) end of the <b>mail</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers {{must carry}} an axe, a cold-weather {{sleeping}} bag, {{a pair of}} snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a <b>mail</b> <b>route.</b> One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.|$|E
5|$|During its {{brief time}} in operation, the Pony Express {{delivered}} approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. Although the Pony Express {{proved that the}} central/northern <b>mail</b> <b>route</b> was viable, Russell, Majors and Waddell {{did not get the}} contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to Jeremy Dehut in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', Ben Holladay, acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} fast <b>mail</b> <b>route</b> to the Pacific coast was {{prompted}} largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After gold was discovered there in 1848, thousands of prospectors, investors and businessmen {{made their way to}} California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000. The demand for a faster way to get mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the American Civil War approached.|$|E
5|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} at Randolph in 1827. In 1829, a mail line was routed between Nashville and Memphis. The route went through Jackson, Bolivar, Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to deliver mail {{to the post}} offices in these towns three times per week. Randolph was {{left out of the}} main route and put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line. Mail on the branch route to Randolph was delivered only once weekly. On the segment from Bolivar through Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to Memphis, the <b>mail</b> <b>route</b> roughly coincides with modern-day U.S. Route 64 (Stage Road).|$|E
5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on {{the fortunes of the}} town. When the <b>mail</b> <b>route</b> was established in 1829, Randolph was put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E

5|$|Randolph is a rural unincorporated {{community}} in Tipton County, Tennessee, United States, {{located on the}} banks of the Mississippi River. Randolph was founded in the 1820s and in 1827, the Randolph post office was established. In the 1830s, the town became an early center of river commerce in West Tennessee. Randolph shipped more cotton annually than Memphis until 1840. In 1834, the first pastor of the Methodist congregation was appointed. The fortunes of the community began to decline in the late 1840s due to failed railroad development, an unfavorable <b>mail</b> <b>route</b> and other factors. The first Confederate States Army fort in Tennessee was built at Randolph early in the Civil War in 1861, a second fortification at Randolph was constructed later that same year. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice by Union Army forces.|$|E

With the rise in shipping in Benton Harbor and the rise in tourism in St. Joseph, permanent and larger operations began operating out of the ports.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} winter {{navigation}} in Finland {{dates back to}} the 17th century when mail was carried year-round between Turku, Finland and Grisslehamn, Sweden, over the Sea of Åland. During the winter season, the postmen used ice boats, strengthened sleigh-boats that were pushed over the ice until it gave in {{under the weight of the}} boat. Once in water, the men began rocking the boat back and forth until it slowly began to break the ice and proceed towards open water. The <b>mail</b> <b>route</b> was often called the most dangerous in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Capt. Sherod Hunter at {{the head}} of the Confederate Arizona Rangers, {{occupied}} southern Arizona during the spring of 1862. He bore orders from Governor Baylor to lure the Apaches into Tucson for peace talks and exterminate the adults. Hunter's frontiersmen spent most of their time expelling Union supporters and skirmishing with Federal troops, so the order was never enforced. A detachment of Hunter's force traveled along the Overland <b>Mail</b> <b>route</b> and destroyed caches of hay to prevent their use by Union forces; it traveled to within eighty miles of Fort Yuma.|$|E
