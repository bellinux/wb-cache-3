5000|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War II, ORT membership had fallen to around 40,000 as the railroads {{became involved in the}} war effort. Railroad telegraphers often had <b>multiple</b> <b>employment</b> as station agents, express agents, and Western Union telegraphers, with each employer paying a portion of the operators' salary. In 1930, the Railway Express Agency, which employed some ORT members as express agents, began handling shipments of perishable items, which had previously been handled as freight shipments on the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. The ORT members who served as express agents as well as telegraphers for the railroad were offered individual pay adjustments on short notice, which the ORT claimed was a violation of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, which required 30 days' notice of any pay adjustment. Additionally, the ORT charged that the individual pay adjustments were in violation of a collective bargaining agreement that had been signed with Railway Express in 1917.|$|E

40|$|Urban {{structure}} is increasingly characterized by decentralization, dispersion, and <b>multiple</b> <b>employment</b> centers. Much is known empirically about such patterns, {{and about how}} the interplay between agglomerative and dispersive forces generates spatial structures that are complex and prone to multiple equilibria and dynamic path-dependence. These forces operate at different spatial scales; many entail unpriced interaction, and external scale economies deriving from product differentiation and endogenous technical change appear particularly important. Because these forces interact in complex ways, inefficiencies in urban structure are resistant to simple policy interventions. ...|$|E

30|$|The United States has {{a complex}} network of public {{disability}} support programs that provide cash, health care, rehabilitation, and employment supports {{to people with}} disabilities. These programs were created {{at different points in}} history—most at least 35 years ago—and have various state and federal agencies that oversee their administration. As a result, there is no single agency that provides a universal set of supports to people with disabilities. Rather, multiple programs exist, each with its own administrative structure, funding stream, and eligibility requirements. As we describe below in greater detail, the program eligibility rules and fragmented support system create barriers for program participants seeking employment as well as for agencies wanting to develop initiatives that address the <b>multiple</b> <b>employment</b> barriers faced by those with disabilities.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of communities are seeking to help individuals faced with <b>multiple</b> <b>employment</b> barriers succeed {{in the labor force}} through transitional jobs (TJ) programs. TJ programs offer temporary, paying jobs with support services and job placement assistance to individuals who are not served by more traditional job training and placement programs.

30|$|We {{identified}} that the workload per day {{was associated with}} mental illness among the female nursing professionals, corroborating the findings in the literature that identify a 33 % higher prevalence of CMD among female urban workers with longer working hours (Farias and Araújo, 2011); in primary health care workers, this difference was 92 % (Oliveira, 2013). Long workdays are common among health professionals, {{as a result of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>employment</b> bonds, which in turn are a reflection of low wages and employment insecurity, due to the precariousness of health work in Brazil. The long hours dedicated to work produce two events that together can potentiate the negative effects of work: (a) prolonged alertness, which increases the production of the so-called stress hormones (Karasek and Theorell, 1990), requiring that the individuals should be prepared {{to meet the demands of}} work—in activities that involve risks for others, such as health activities, the pressure for attention, and vigilance increases even more; (b) reduction of the time for activities of resting, physical activity, and leisure constitute mechanisms of recovery and physical and mental balance.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to address three questions: (1) How unequal is {{access to employment}} and the wellbeing associated with it? (2) What is the money value consumers place on access to employment? and (3) How does the inequality of access to employment correspond to the geographical pattern of variation in social deprivation? On the basis that house prices, once adjusted for property type and size, reflect variation quality of life across space, econometric estimates {{of the impact of}} employment access on house prices can be used to simulate the impact on inequality of wellbeing. With this rationale in mind, we use the Osland and Pryce (2009) house price model to derive an appropriate measure of Access Welfare - the wellbeing associated with locating at a given distance to employment - and to put a money value on that welfare.

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to the debate about portfolio and organizational careers and {{presents the results of}} qualitative research of Russian young employees. During perestroika, Soviet career structures were almost completely destroyed.

Such local uncertainty and instability coincided with intensive globalisation of the national economy and society, which had an even stronger effect: local instability combined with global instability. The analysis of biographical interviews demonstrated that a lot of young Russians on contemporary labour market can be characterised by portfolioability—a property that unites young professionals with different type of employment. We mean by this term a kind of attitude towards work typical for Russian youth, which reflects inner flexibility, experience, transferable skills and <b>multiple</b> <b>employment</b> practices. Moreover, it is portfolioability that in some cases becomes a resource to improve security/confidence concerning the labour market, as well as to develop agency. Besides, the lack of portfolioability results in a more vulnerable position and dependence on conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} the U. S. STEM labor market is stratified in terms of quality of employment. Through a series of cluster analyses and Chi-square tests on data drawn from the 2008 Survey of Income Program Participation (SIPP), the study found evidence of segmentation in the highly-skilled STEM and non-STEM samples, which included workers with a subbaccalaureate diploma or above. The cluster analyses show a pattern consistent with Labor Market Segmentation theory: Higher wages are associated with other primary employment characteristics, including health insurance and pension benefits, as well as full-time employment. In turn, lower wages showed a tendency to cluster with secondary employment characteristics, such as part-time employment, <b>multiple</b> <b>employment,</b> and restricted access to health insurance and pension benefits. The findings also suggest that women have a higher likelihood of being employed in STEM jobs with secondary characteristics. The findings reveal a far more variegated employment landscape than is usually presented in national reports of the STEM workforce. There is evidence that, while STEM employment may be more resilient than non-STEM employment to labor restructuring trends in the new economy, the former is far from immune to secondary labor characteristics. There is a need for ongoing dialogue between STEM education (at all levels), employers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to truly understand not only the barriers to equity in employment relations, but also the mechanisms that create and maintain segmentation and how they may impact women, underrepresented minorities, and the foreign-born...|$|E
