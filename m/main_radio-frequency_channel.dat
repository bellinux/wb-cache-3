40|$|Abstract. Providing {{scalable}} {{and efficient}} routing services in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) is very challenging {{due to the}} unique characteristics of UWSNs. Firstly, UWSNs often employ acoustic channels for communications because radio signals do not work well in water. Compared with <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>channels,</b> acoustic channels feature much lower bandwidths and several orders of magnitudes longer propagation delays. Secondly, UWSNs usually have very dynamic topology as sensors move passively with water currents. Some routing protocols have been proposed to address the challenging problem in UWSNs. However, most of them assume that the full-dimensional location information of all sensor nodes in a network is known in prior through a localization process, which is yet another challenging issue to be solved in UWSNs. In this paper, we propose a depth-based routing (DBR) protocol. DBR does not require full-dimensional location information of sensor nodes. Instead, it needs only local depth information, which can be easily obtained with an inexpensive depth sensor that can be equipped in every underwater sensor node. A key advantage of our protocol {{is that it can}} handle network dynamics efficiently without the assistance of a localization service. Moreover, our routing protocol can take advantage of a multiple-sink underwater sensor network architecture without introducing extra cost. We conduct extensive simulations. The results show that DBR can achieve very high packet delivery ratios (at least 95 %) for dense networks with only small communication cost. ...|$|R

Underwater {{wireless}} communication is {{a rapidly growing}} field of research and engineering as its applications, which were once exclusively military, are extending into commercial fields. The need for underwater {{wireless communication}}s exists {{in a wide range}} of applications including offshore oil field exploration/monitoring, oceanographic data collection, maritime archaeology, seismic observation, environmental monitoring, disaster preventing, port and border security among many others. Although capacity calculations for terrestrial <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>channels</b> have been extensively studied, the literature on the capacity of underwater acoustic (UWA) channels is sporadic with many remaining open questions. Aiming to fill research gaps in this growing field, this thesis makes several contributions to the information theoretical performance analysis of point-to-point and relay-assisted UWA systems. A single-carrier communication architecture and sparse Rician frequency-selective UWA channel with intersymbol interference (ISI) is considered in our work. We assume non-white Gaussian distribution to model the ambient noise and consider Francois-Garrison path loss formula to take into account the effects of environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, pressure as well as system parameters such as distance and frequency. We develop an equivalent channel model for UWA channel with ISI under consideration and show that the capacity of the equivalent channel converges to that of the operating channel in the limit of infinite block length. Using these results, we first obtain a capacity expression for the UWA channel and demonstrate the dependency on channel parameters such as the number and location of significant taps and power delay profile, and environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, and pressure. Then, we use this expression to determine the optimal carrier frequency, input signaling, and bandwidth. A closed-form formula for the optimum carrier frequency is further obtained. In the second part of the thesis, we extend our results to cooperative UWA systems and obtain achievable rates of single-carrier cooperative UWA systems with orthogonal decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. We take into account the effect of relay geometry in the derivations of achievable rates, and use the derived expressions to optimize the location of the relay...|$|R
40|$|In the past, {{radio-frequency}} signals were {{commonly used}} for low-speed wireless electronic systems, and optical signals were used for multi-gigabit wired communication systems. However, as {{the emergence of new}} millimeter-wave technology introduces multi-gigabit transmission over a wireless <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>channel,</b> the borderline between radio-frequency and optical systems becomes blurred. As a result, there come ample opportunities to design and develop next-generation broadband systems to combine the advantages of these two technologies to overcome inherent limitations of various broadband end-to-end interconnect systems in signal generation, recovery, synchronization, and so on. For the transmission distances of a few centimeters to thousands of kilometers, the convergence of radio-frequency electronics and optics to build radio-over-fiber systems ushers in a new era of research for the upcoming very-high-throughput broadband services. Radio-over-fiber systems are believed to be the most promising solution to the backhaul transmission of the millimeter-wave wireless access networks, especially for the license-free, very-high-throughput 60 -GHz band. Adopting radio-over-fiber systems in access or in-building networks can greatly extend the 60 -GHz signal reach by using ultra-low loss optical fibers. However, such high frequency is difficult to generate in a straightforward way. In this dissertation, the novel techniques of homodyne and heterodyne optical-carrier suppressions for radio-over-fiber systems are investigated and various system architectures are designed to overcome these limitations of 60 -GHz wireless access networks, bringing the popularization of multi-gigabit wireless networks to become closer to the reality. In addition to the advantages for the access networks, extremely high spectral efficiency, which is the most important parameter for long-haul networks, can be achieved by radio-over-fiber signal generation. As a result, the transmission performance of spectrally efficient radio-over-fiber signaling, including orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and orthogonal wavelength division multiplexing, is broadly and deeply investigated. On the other hand, radio-over-fiber is also used for the frequency synchronization that can resolve the performance limitation of wireless interconnect systems. A novel wireless interconnects assisted by radio-over-fiber subsystems is proposed in this dissertation. In conclusion, multiple advantageous facets of radio-over-fiber systems can be found in various levels of end-to-end interconnect systems. The rapid development of radio-over-fiber systems will quickly change the conventional appearance of modern communications.

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} hybrid free-space optical (FSO) and <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>channel</b> from an {{information}} theoretic perspective. Since both links operate at vastly different carrier frequencies, we model the hybrid channel {{as a pair}} of parallel channels. Moreover, since the FSO channel signals at a higher rate than the RF channel, we incorporate this key feature in the parallel channel model. Both channels experience fading due to scintillation, which is slow compared to typical signalling rates. Under this framework, we study the fundamental limits of the hybrid channel. In particular, we analyse the outage probability in the large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, and obtain the outage diversity or SNR exponent of the hybrid system. First we consider the case when only the receiver has perfect channel state information (CSIR case), and obtain the exponents for general scintillation distributions. These exponents relate key system design parameters to the asymptotic outage performance and illustrate the benets of using hybrid systems with respect to independent FSO or RF links. We next consider the case when perfect CSI is known at both the receiver and transmitter, and derive the optimal power allocation strategy that minimises the outage probability subject to peak and average power constraints. The optimal solution involves non-convex optimisation, which is intractable in practical systems. We therefore propose a suboptimal algorithm that achieves signicant power savings (on the order of tens of dBs) over uniform power allocation. We show that the suboptimal algorithm has the same diversity as the optimal power allocation strategy.

Mobile Ad Hoc network represents a system of wireless mobile nodes that can self organize freely and for the temporary purpose in the network technology, they can be applied anywhere as the MANET reduces the complexity of the Infrastructures. Routing traffic between MANET nodes experience collisions, end to end delay (E 2 E) and total loss of data packets due to limited bandwidth between nodes. These result in poor Quality of Service (QoS) and E 2 E delay throughput. In this paper we have proposed the application of time division multiple access (TDMA) technique to improve data rate and reduce control and data over-head collisions. We compared the existing normal routing scheme and the TDMA based scheme. TDMA allows a number of clients to access a single <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>channel</b> without interference by allocating unique time slots to each user within each channel, reducing the loss of packets and improving the data rate thereby delivering QoS to the clientsWe have proposed TDMA technique, a BEBA (Binary Exponential Backoff Algorithm) based time dependent data rate improvement technique in MANET, which characterizes improvement of data by reducing loss of control packet and collision effect over a limited channel capacity. Medium capturing is governed by backoff rules. These rules help prevent the collisions between nodes but cannot totally avoid them. When the number of nodes in a medium increases considerably, the avoidance of collision becomes more difficult and bandwidth loss is inevitable. We observe inefficient data throughput and E 2 E delay within a multi hop transmission between mobile nodes as an inherent problem. Collisions between nodes increase dramatically when their number increases in a location. Lost packets and retransmissions cause a decrease in data rates. Thus TDMA technique to control these collisions is quite helpful. The purpose of the project is to show the supplementation of backoff rules by TDMA technique to reduce collisions and increase data rate. Higher data rate is achieved because of the avoidance of collisions and improved performance of the backoff algorithm. Advanced On Demand Vector routing protocol (AODV) is used for routing between the nodes. MAC used for these nodes is IEEE 802. 11. We have devised a technique in which collision is minimized by combining the wireless medium backoff rules with TDMA. TDMA helps in dividing a large number of nodes into groups of smaller number of nodes. At any given instant, communication within a single group is possible and whole medium is dedicated to it. Although a node can transmit only when its group gets the TDMA time slot, the throughput is increased considerably because of less transmitting nodes per time slot. TDMA is used for allowing many users to utilize a common channel. Without TDMA such senders will always collide. We have used TDMA for avoidance of collisions although the same channel can be utilized simultaneously by all the users. In TDMA only one pair of sender and receiver is active. Thus collisions are avoided. Although each pair transmits for 1 / 8 of a second, data rate is much higher than the situation when they transmit all the time. We have compared the existing normal routing scheme and the TDMA based scheme using NS 2 Simulator. This scheme, governed by packet generation and transmission over allocated time slot using the available bandwidth guarantees appreciable reduction in data loss rate and substantial improvement in link capacity utilization. The numerical results obtained shows that the performance of TDMA technique is better when compared to the current Normal route technique. + 46 - 76089674...|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} of wireless communications links against interference {{is a key}} concern in mission critical systems. In particular low probability of interception (LPI) systems which operate below the thermal noise floor of the receiver are particularly vulnerable. To protect against interference it is often necessary to include some form of active interference suppression. Broadband adaptive beamforming is one such technique which {{may be used to}} suppress interference by spatial and spectral filtering of the signals received by an array antenna. The hardware requirements of adaptive Beamforming systems are high in comparison to other approaches. As a result, the total number of adaptable weights realisable in the beamformer may be limited by the size, weight and power constraints of the system. This will limit the degrees of freedom in the beamformer and hence, the interference cancellation capability of the beamformer. The effectiveness of increasing the number of time-taps in space-time adaptive processors (STAP) as a method of increasing the number of interferers the beamformer can simultaneously cancel in an environment containing a mix of narrowband, partialband and broadband interference is studied. An alternative scheme to free up degrees of freedom in the beamformer is proposed based on frequency-domain excision to pre-filter narrowband interference before it reaches the beamformer. This approach frees up degrees of freedom in the beamformer, which would otherwise be consumed by the narrowband interference, for use in cancelling partialband and broadband interference. To enable the excision filters to identify narrowband interference while allowing partialband and broadband interference to pass through, a novel scheme is presented which produces a frequency mask that varies on a per-bin basis. Eigenanalysis of the beamformer's covariance matrix is used to explore the ability of frequency-domain excision to desensitise the beamformer to narrowband interference while bit error rate (BER) simulations demonstrate the enhanced interference protection the scheme affords an LPI communications link. Mismatches between the gain and phase responses of the <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) front-end <b>channels</b> in broadband adaptive beamformers can limit their cancellation performance against higher power partialband and broadband interference. This performance limitation arises from the decorrelation experienced by the received signals across the array due to the interchannel mismatches. In STAP systems this performance limitation may be mitigated by increasing the number of taps per channel in the STAP. However, the computational complexity of adding additional time-taps tends to be high in STAP beamformers. Two new methods of interchannel mismatch compensation are proposed based on efficient frequency-domain methods. Simulations using software models and experiments using a hardware STAP system demonstrate the proposed techniques' ability to improve the cancellation performance where interchannel mismatches are limiting cancellation performance. <br/...|$|R
