They are distantly related to the ratites (order Struthioniformes), that includes the rheas, emus, and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew as {{preserved}} in the Hebrew Bible is composed of multiple linguistic layers. The consonantal skeleton of the text is the <b>most</b> <b>ancient,</b> while the vocalization and cantillation are later additions reflecting a later stage of the language.

5|$|Most British {{orders of}} chivalry {{cover the entire}} kingdom, but the three most exalted ones each pertain to one {{constituent}} country only. The Order of St Patrick, which pertains to Ireland, is the most junior of these three in precedence and age. Its equivalent in England, The Most Noble Order of the Garter, is the oldest order of chivalry in the United Kingdom, dating to the middle fourteenth century. The Scottish equivalent is The <b>Most</b> <b>Ancient</b> and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, dating in its modern form to 1687.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>ancient</b> Egyptians were farmers {{tied to the}} land. Their {{dwellings}} were {{restricted to}} immediate family members, and were constructed of mud-brick designed to remain cool {{in the heat of}} the day. Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread. Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings. Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} bank, where the <b>most</b> <b>ancient</b> {{parts of the}} city lie, the Old Bazaar was {{restored}} and its surroundings were rebuilt with low-rise buildings, so as not to spoil views of the Skopje Fortress. Several institutions, including the university and the Macedonian academy, were also relocated on the north bank in order to reduce borders between the ethnic communities. Indeed, the north bank is mostly inhabited by Muslim Albanians, Turks and Roma, whereas Christian ethnic Macedonians predominantly reside on the south bank.|$|E

5|$|Parts of {{the myth}} appear {{in a wide variety}} of Egyptian texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more {{detailed}} and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth. Yet no Egyptian source gives a full account {{of the myth}}, and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. Greek and Roman writings, particularly De Iside et Osiride by Plutarch, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of <b>most</b> <b>ancient</b> Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} forms a species pair with the Eurasian white-tailed eagle. This species pair {{consists}} of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same ecological niche in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles {{at the beginning of}} the Early Miocene (c. 10Ma BP) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle Oligocene, 28 Ma BP, if the <b>most</b> <b>ancient</b> fossil record is correctly assigned to this genus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>ancient</b> {{recorded}} {{name for}} Bristol is the archaic Welsh Caer Odor (the fort on the chasm), {{which is consistent}} with modern understanding that early Bristol developed between the River Frome and Avon Gorge. It is most commonly stated that the Saxon name Bricstow was a simple calque of the existing Celtic name, with Bric (meaning a break) a literal translation of Odor, and the common Saxon suffix Stow replacing Caer. Alternative etymologies are supported by numerous orthographic variations in medieval documents, with Samuel Seyer enumerating 47 alternative forms.|$|E

5|$|To {{the same}} generic type belongs the famous abbots’ chair of Glastonbury; such chairs might readily {{be taken to}} pieces when their owners travelled.

The most famous, {{as well as the}} <b>most,</b> <b>ancient,</b> English chair is that made {{at the end of the}} 13th century for Edward I, in which most subsequent monarchs have been crowned. It is of an architectural type and of oak, and was covered with gilded gesso which long since disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Although {{probable}} {{prokaryotic cell}} fossils date to almost 3.5billion years ago, most prokaryotes {{do not have}} distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot {{be used to identify}} them as archaea. Instead, chemical fossils of unique lipids are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2.7billion years ago; such data have since been questioned. Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which include Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8billion years ago. The archaeal lineage may be the <b>most</b> <b>ancient</b> that exists on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. <b>Most</b> <b>ancient</b> sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E
