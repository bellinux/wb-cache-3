50|$|The thermal stability, flame resistance, and <b>moisture</b> <b>regain</b> of PBI and its {{conventional}} {{textile processing}} character {{enable it to}} be processed on conventional staple fiber textile equipment. These characteristics lead {{to one of the}} most important applications of PBI: protective apparel. PBI filaments were fabricated into protective clothing like firefighters' gear and astronauts' suits. PBI filaments are dry spun from dimethylacetamide containing lithium chloride. After washing and drying the resulting yarn is golden brown. PBI fiber is an excellent candidate for applications in severe environments due to its combination of thermal, chemical and textile properties. Flame and thermal resistance are the critical properties of protective apparel. This kind of apparel applications includes firefighter’s protective apparel, astronaut’s suits, aluminized crash rescued gear, industrial worker’s apparel, and suits for racing car drivers. The problem of PBI protective apparel is that it keeps heat out but it also keeps the heat in, too. Thus, by the time the firefighters feel heat and pain, it is too late and they will get burnt or killed since it is hard for the heat to penetrate the suit and be released into the air. There are still some major fire departments have not yet switched from old fire gear to PBI due to the fear of what PBI can cause. One example is the Chicago Fire Department, which still relies on the old type of rubber or leather coats.|$|E

This research has targeted at fabrication of the metallic nano-wires through a simple one-step pad-dry method. The effects of mercerizing {{as one of the}} most common and important finishing treatments on cotton fabrics have been investigated. Mercerized and un-mercerized fabrics with the same structures have been treated and compared. SEM micrographs confirmed fabrication of the nano-wires with a high aspect ratio on the fiber surfaces oriented parallel with fiber axes. An enhanced potentiality for growing nano-wires with higher level of orientation has been observed for mercerized fabrics compared to un-mercerized ones. As it is well known, mercerizing can cause some structural changes in cotton fibers. Reduction of crystallinity as a result of this process (mercerizing) leads to increasing the amorphous regions which have a good potentiality for growing nano-structured materials.

Polyelectrolyte microgel technology {{is combined with}} conventional functionalization methods of photo- and thermo-crosslinking to activate the surface of polyester textiles, making them interactive with their environment. The microgels consisted of pH/thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PNIAA) microparticles either alone or complexed with oppositely charged macromolecular chains of the pH-responsive natural polysaccharide chitosan. Microgel incorporation into polyester surface layers was achieved either through UV irradiation {{in the presence of}} the photoinitiator benzophenone or through low temperature treatment using the natural crosslinker genipin. The adaptivity of the functionalized textiles to ambient conditions of pH, temperature and relative humidity was expressed by changes in the textile physicochemical and water management properties. These changes were found to occur within a physiological pH/temperature range of the human body (pH 4 – 8 and 20 – 40 °C). More specifically, functionalized polyester textiles exhibited a shift in surface charge from positive to negative values at pH ranging from 5. 0 to 6. 6, following the trend of the incorporated microgels. Below the microgel Lower Critical Solution Temperature (36 ºC), the chitosan-containing functionalized textiles exhibited improved water wettability compared with reference textiles. Above 36 ºC, functionalized textiles had lower <b>moisture</b> <b>regains</b> and higher water vapor transmission rates than the reference textiles. Microgel incorporation was found to be sufficiently durable, in some cases even after 30 washing cycles.

40|$|ABSTRACT. California’s medium-grain rice {{industry}} {{experiences a}} wide range of head rice yield (HRY). Average moisture of a representative paddy rice sample is the commercially used predictor of optimum harvest date to achieve high HRY. A two-year field study demonstrated that average rice moisture alone is not an adequate predictor of HRY. The history of rice moisture caused by varying meteorological conditions was needed to predict rice quality. Under typical calm conditions in California, daytime relative humidity is low and at night humidity increases, exposing rice to dew. During this meteorological pattern, HRY could be predicted by assuming that all kernels that dried below 15 % moisture during the day would rehydrate at night and fissure, resulting in lost HRY. Harvest weather is also characterized by occasional episodes of dry north wind, lasting several days. These periods have insufficiently long rehydration periods to completely fissure kernels that dropped below 15 % moisture, and actual HRY was much above predicted HRY. HRY dropped significantly during periods of dry north winds; however, rice value (government loan value minus drying costs) did not drop significantly during the windy period because the lower loan value was offset by lower drying costs. After the windy period ended, rice was again subject to nighttime dew and <b>regained</b> <b>moisture,</b> resulting in a large reduction in HRY and value. A combination of the range of individual kernel moisture at harvest and history of rice moisture influenced by weather conditions explained {{a great deal of the}} total HRY variation experienced by the California rice industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Direct use of {{agricultural}} and wood residues as fuel is usually difficult, {{because they have}} poor energy characteristics. Torrefaction {{appears to be an}} attractive option of upgrading biomass to a product which retains about 90 % of its energy. Torrefaction is a pyrolysis process with low heating rate and temperature lower than 3000 C. The important advantages of torrefied biomass include high energy yield and hydrophobicity so that it does not <b>regain</b> <b>moisture</b> during storage, less smoke when burnt, and non fermentable nature. This study reviews and examines the torrefaction process as an alternative treatment to biomass residues, contributing to advance the competitiveness of biomass residues as an energy resource. The aim is to give a good insight into the torrefaction process. During torrefaction process, biomass undergoes changes in physical and chemical properties. The yield of solid product decreases with the temperature and the residence time. The content of carbon in the solid product increases at higher temperature of the torrefaction and longer reaction time while the content of hydrogen and oxygen decrease, increasing the calorific value of the torrefied biomass. The content of CH 4, H 2, CxHy, and CO in the product gases increases when the temperature is increased while the content of CO 2 decreases. It is determined from analysis of data that the temperature of torrefaction has greater influence on the torrefied products than reaction time. For this reason, a temperature range higher than 2500 C with reaction times around 1 hour i...|$|R
