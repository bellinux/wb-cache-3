Sommer and his later <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode</b> (sodium-potassium-antimony-cesium) S20 photocathode discovered in 1956 by accident, that the tubes had both suitable infra-red sensitivity and visible spectrum amplification to be useful militarily. The S20 photocathode has a sensitivity of around 150 to 200 µA/lm. The additional sensitivity made these tubes usable with limited light, such as moonlight, while still being suitable for use with low-level infrared illumination.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} {{image intensifiers}} {{use the same}} <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode</b> that the first generation tubes used, however by using thicker layers of the same materials, the S25 photocathode was developed, which provides extended red response and reduced blue response, making it more suitable for military applications. It has a typical sensitivity of around 230 µA/lm and a higher quantum efficiency than S20 photocathode material. Oxidation of the cesium to cesium oxide in later versions improved the sensitivity {{in a similar way}} to third generation photocathodes. The same technology that produced the fiber optic bundles that allowed the creation of cascade tubes, allowed, with a slight change in manufacturing, the production of micro-channel plates, or MCPs. The micro-channel plate is a thin glass wafer with a Nichrome electrode on either side across which a large potential difference of up to 1,000 volts is applied.|$|E
5000|$|Multialkali (sodium-potassium-antimony-caesium, Na-K-Sb-Cs), {{also called}} S-20. The <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode</b> {{has a wide}} {{spectral}} response from the ultraviolet to near infrared region. It is widely used for broad-band spectrophotometers and photon counting applications. The long wavelength response can be extended to 930 nm by a special photocathode activation processing.|$|E
40|$|A compeletely new {{technique}} of growing (Na,K) 3 Sb <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathodes</b> {{in the high}} vacuum facilities of the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is developed. The main principle of semiconductor technology is used: all sources are operated simultaneously and the vapour concentration of Na and K is well above of the stoichiometric one. The intensity flux cont-rol is provided {{with the help of}} a specially designed quadrupole masspectrometer as well as with the original procedure of atomic beams tomography. Fast baked effusion cells having low heat intertia have been designed. The photocathodes synthesis is provided onto monocrys-talline sapphire substrates, on which the contact tungsten ring is eveporated. The choice of tungsten is determined by its small vapourization during the course of the substrate high temperature (1300 °K) processing. It is important to note that the total cycle of the photocathode growing process does not exceed 15 - 20 minutes for the photocathode thickness of about 1000 Á. We have studied the influence of the substrate temperature on photoemission parameters. Quantum efficiency of the MBE grown photocathodes approaches to ten-forty per-cents at blue sensitivity edge. A qualitative emission theory of the MBE grown photocathodes is suggested...|$|R
50|$|Suboxides are {{generally}} colored compounds indicating {{a degree of}} electron delocalisation. Cs7O has a unit cell containing a Cs11O3 cluster and 10 Cs atoms. The cluster can be visualised as being composed of three face-sharing octahedra. In the picture below the caesium atoms are purple and the oxygen atoms are red. The Cs-Cs distance in the cluster is 376 pm, which {{is less than the}} Cs-Cs distance in the metal of 576 pm. Rb9O2 and Rb6O both contain the Rb9O2 cluster, which can be visualised as two face-sharing octahedra. Rb6O can be formulated as (Rb9O2)Rb3. The Rb-Rb distance in the cluster is 352 pm which is shorter than the Rb-Rb in the metal of 485 pm. It is suggested that caesium suboxides {{play a role in the}} Ag-O-Cs (S1) and <b>multialkali</b> Na-K-Sb-Cs <b>photocathodes.</b>|$|R
40|$|A new hybrid imaging {{detector}} is described {{that is being}} developed {{for the next generation}} adaptive optics (AO) wavefront sensors. The detector consists of proximity focused microchannel plates (MCPs) read out by pixelated CMOS application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips developed at CERN ("Medipix 2 "). Each Medipix 2 pixel has an amplifier, lower and upper charge discriminators, and a 14 -bit chounter. The 256 x 256 array can be read out noiselessly (photon counting) in 286 us. The Medipix 2 is buttable on 3 sides to produce 512 x(n* 256) pixel devices. The readout can be electronically shuttered down to a terporal window of a few microseconds with an accuracy of 10 ns. Good quantum efficiencies can be achieved from the x-ray (open faced with opaque photocathodes) to the optical (sealed tube with <b>multialkali</b> or GaAs <b>photocathode)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{photocathode}} deposition and transport system is to (1) produce a robust, high yield <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode</b> and (2) have a method of transporting the <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode</b> for insertion into a super conducting RF electron gun. This process is only successful if a sufficient quantum efficiency lifetime of the cathode, which is inserted in the SRF electron gun, is maintained. One important element in producing a <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode</b> is the strict vacuum requirements of 10 {sup - 11 } torr to assure success {{in the production of}} longlived photocathodes that will not have their QE or lifetime depleted due to residual gas poisoning in a poor vacuum. A cutaway view of our third generation deposition system is shown in figure 1. There are certain design criteria and principles required. One must be able to install, remove, rejuvenate and replace a cathode without exposing the source or cathode to atmosphere. The system must allow one to deposit Cs, K, and Sb on a cathode tip surface at pressures in the 10 {sup - 10 } to 10 {sup - 9 } torr range. The cathode needs to be heated to as high as 850 C for cleaning and maintained at 130 C to 150 C during deposition. There should also be the capability for in-situ QE measurements. In addition the preparation of dispenser photocathodes must be accounted for, thus requiring an ion source for cathode cleaning. Finally the transport cart must be mobile and be able to negotiate the ERL facility labyrinth...|$|E

The survey is being conducted at a principal bandpass of 8000 - 9000 A supplemented by a V bandpass. The survey {{is the first of}} its type conducted using a small (20 -in. aperture) wide-field telescope, a very large-format (146 mm) image intensifier with a red-extended, <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode.</b> The output phosphor of the intensifier is photographed with IIaD emulsion on film.

40|$|The Cornell University energy {{recovery}} linac (ERL) photoinjector has recently demonstrated operation at 20  mA for approximately 8  hours, utilizing a <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode</b> deposited on a Si substrate. We describe {{the recipe for}} photocathode deposition, and will detail {{the parameters of the}} run. Post-run analysis of the photocathode indicates the presence of significant damage to the substrate, perhaps due to ion back-bombardment from the residual beam line gas. While the exact cause of the substrate damage remains unknown, we describe multiple surface characterization techniques (x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, atomic force, and scanning electron microscopy) used to study the interesting morphological and crystallographic features of the photocathode surface after its use for high current beam production. Finally, we present a simple model of crystal damage due to ion back-bombardment, which agrees qualitatively with the distribution of damage on the substrate surface...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop a long-lifetime MCP-PMT under high rates of circumstance, we {{investigated}} the degradation of the quantum efficiency (QE) of PMT's with a <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode.</b> We found that not only positive ions, but also neutral residual gases would damage the photocathode resulting in an enhancement of the work function; their countermeasures were established in newly manufactured square-shaped MCP-PMT's with 4 or 4 x 4 multi-anodes. The performances of the PMT's were measured: QE was stable up to an integrated amount of anode output charge of 2 - 3 C/cm^ 2, while keeping other basic performances steady, such as the time resolution for single photons of ~ 40 ps, a photoelectron collection efficiency (CE) of 60 %, a multiplication gain (G) of a few x 10 ^ 6, and dark counts of 20 - 300 Hz. The causes of QE degradation are discussed. Comment: 14 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} of bialkali photocathodes growth by {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (MI 3 E) has been developed. The photocathode film was deposited onto the substrate from molecular beams produced by simultaneously operating molecular sources of Sb, Na and K. Thus suggested procedure is noticeably differed from the classical one. Growth rate was about 1 A/sec and complete cycle of photocathode fabrication was 15 - 20 minutes. A special ultra high vacuum (UHV) chamber for MBE of multialkali photocathodes has been designed. The chamber {{is a part of}} UHV system consisting of an analysis vessel supplied with Auger and ESCA electron spectrometer and low energy electron diffractometer (LEED), the MBE chamber itself and a chamber for cold sealing of photocathodes with device body through indium ring. The system gives a possibility to carry out investigations of <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode</b> physics and to produce commercial devices. Developed technique can be used for fabrication of vacuum devices including streak tubes. 1...|$|E
40|$|Field correctors for a one-meter, f/ 15 cassegrainian {{telescope}} {{were designed}} {{as part of}} a NASA-funded study of an astronomical obervatory on board of the Space Shuttle. By means of a Gasgoigne corrector and a biconcave field flattener, astigmatism and field curvature are corrected in a 0. 6 deg field. Applicable wavelength ranges are limited by chromatic aberrations. The upper wavelength is selected to match a photocathode response limit. The lower wavelength limit is defined by a filter. Examples of usable wavelength ranges are: 210 nm - 1100 nm (<b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode,</b> fused-silica corrector elements), 177 nm - 320 nm (cesium telluride photocathode, calcium fluoride correctors); and possibly 134 nm - 190 nm (cesium iodide photocathode, lithium fluoride correctors). Residual rms lateral color is smaller than 0. 02 arc sec, and axial color is smaller than 0. 25 arc sec (blur diameter at the ends of the wavelength range). The correctors introduce a small amount of coma. This is compensated by adjustment of the conic constants of the telescope mirrors...|$|E
40|$|The Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak has two light {{detection}} and ranging (LIDAR) Thomson scattering systems, {{one for the}} core and one dedicated to the edge T-e and n(e) profiles. The LIDAR scheme is unique to JET and is envisaged for use on ITER. The system&# 039;s spatial resolution is defined by the convolution product of its components: laser pulse duration, detector response time, and digitizer speed. The original <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode</b> microchannel plate photomultipliers dictated the response time, resulting in a 12 cm spatial resolution along the line of sight. In the edge LIDAR system, this is improved by aligning the line of sight with the flux surfaces, thus improving the effective spatial resolution to 2 cm depending on the plasma configuration. To meet demands for better edge gradient resolution, an upgrade to higher quantum efficiency detectors was proposed. Four GaAs photocathode detectors have been procured, two of which surpass expectations. These detectors are shown to have a more than two times higher effective quantum efficiency and their response time is at least twice as fast as the multialkali detectors. Combined with a fast digitizer this improves the spatial resolution by a factor of two, down to one centimeter effective, depending on plasma configuration.

40|$|The Position-Sensitive Detector (PSD) for photometrical and {{spectral}} observation on the 6 -meter {{optical telescope}} of the Special Astrophysical Observatory (Russia) is described. The PSD {{consists of a}} position-sensitive tube, amplifiers of output signals, analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and a digital logic plate, which produces a signal for ADC start and an external strob pulse for reading information by registration system. If necessary, the thermoelectric cooler can be used. The position-sensitive tube has the following main elements: a photocathode, electrodes of inverting optics, a block of microchannel plates (MCP) and a position-sensitive collector of quadrant type. The main parameters of the PSD are {{the diameter of the}} sensitive surface is 25 mm, the spatial resolution is better than 100 (μ) m in the centre and a little worse on the periphery; the dead time is near 0. 5 (μ) s; the detection quantum efficiency is defined by the photocathode and it is not less than 0. 1, as a rule; dark current is about hundreds of cps, or less, when cooling. PSD spectral sensitivity depends on the type of photocathode and input window material. We use a <b>multialkali</b> <b>photocathode</b> and a fiber or UV-glass, which gives the short- wave cut of 360 nm or 250 nm, respectively.
