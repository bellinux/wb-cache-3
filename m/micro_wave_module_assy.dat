The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of heating on the amounts of allicin, felavonol, felavonoid, total phenolic components, and antioxidant capacity of garlic. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study which was conducted at Shahr-e-Kord University of Medical Sciences in 2009, the alcoholic extract of fresh, <b>micro</b> <b>waved,</b> and boiled garlic were prepared. Then, their antioxidant capacities were evaluated in linoleic acid and ß-carotene linoleate system. The phenolic contents were measured with Folin–ciocalteu method, felavonoid or felavonol contents with aluminum coloride method, and allicine contents with spectrophotometry method. Collected data were statistically analyzed using the SPSS software. Differences between the means of groups were evaluated by a two-tailed t-test for independent samples. Results: The fresh and fresh boiled garlic had the highest and lowest antioxidant activities, respectively (P 0. 05). The flavonoid and phenolic compounds in fresh garlic were more than <b>micro</b> <b>waved</b> or boiled garlic. The allicin content in fresh garlic was also higher then <b>micro</b> <b>waved</b> or boiled garlic (P< 0. 05). All of these components were low in boiled garlic.

The cell is 3 × 3 mm rectangular tube, whose length is 42 mm. The pressure ratio and rotor speed of the wave rotor were set at 2. 5 and 5000 rpm, respectively.

By use of laser beam expanders, the beam intersection volume of the LDA optics was minimized, and submillimeter spatial resolution is realized while a wide velocity range (- 100 to 300 m/s) is kept. It is shown that the velocity histories at local positions inside the wave rotor cell can be obtained with the LDA optics. The rapid velocity increase and decrease, due to the primary and secondary shock waves, are observed, and the propagation speed of the primary shock wave was estimated.
