5|$|Doria passed near {{or through}} the {{northern}} Caribbean Islands and the Bahamas as a tropical depression, though effects, if any, are unknown. Tropical Storm Doria passed about 160miles (260km) east of Charleston, South Carolina, though its large wind field produced 22mph (35km/h) winds in the town. The storm also dropped light rainfall of up to 1.75inches (44mm), and resulted in a storm tide of 5.7feet (1.7m) above the <b>mean</b> <b>low</b> <b>water</b> level.|$|E
5|$|On the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} a storm surge peaking at 8feet (2.4m) on the Chesapeake Bay in Hoopers Island and 6.5feet (2m) on the Atlantic coast in Ocean City. The {{track of the}} hurricane to the west funneled into the bay and was so strong it negated the normal tide cycle in the bay. Tolchester Beach recorded a record-breaking high tide of 7.91feet (2.4m) above <b>mean</b> <b>low</b> <b>water.</b> Rainfall in the Maryland portion of the Delmarva Peninsula reached 3.2inches (81mm) in Steeles Neck. The large circulation of the hurricane produced strong winds across the area, including maximum sustained winds of 52mph (84km/h) and a gust of 66mph (106km/h) in Cambridge.|$|E

6000|$|This light-house, {{known to}} mariners as the Cape Cod or Highland Light, {{is one of}} our [...] "primary sea-coast lights," [...] and is usually the first seen by those {{approaching}} the entrance of Massachusetts Bay from Europe. It is forty-three miles from Cape Ann Light, and forty-one from Boston Light. It stands about twenty rods {{from the edge of the}} bank, which is here formed of clay. I borrowed the plane and square, level and dividers, of a carpenter who was shingling a barn near by, and using one of those shingles made of a mast, contrived a rude sort of quadrant, with pins for sights and pivots, and got the angle of elevation of the Bank opposite the light-house, and with a couple of cod-lines the length of its slope, and so measured its height on the shingle. It rises one hundred and ten feet above its immediate base, or about one hundred and twenty-three feet above <b>mean</b> <b>low</b> <b>water.</b> Graham, who has carefully surveyed the extremity of the Cape, makes it one hundred and thirty feet. The mixed sand and clay lay at an angle of forty degrees with the horizon, where I measured it, but the clay is generally much steeper. No cow nor hen ever gets down it. Half a mile farther south the bank is fifteen or twenty-five feet higher, and that appeared to be the highest land in North Truro. Even this vast clay bank is fast wearing away. Small streams of water trickling down it at intervals of two or three rods, have left the intermediate clay in the form of steep Gothic roofs fifty feet high or more, the ridges as sharp and rugged-looking as rocks; and in one place the bank is curiously eaten out in the form of a large semicircular crater.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} water {{retention}} measures {{on the water}} discharge and their repercussions on the farm’s technical management and profits were studied in two dairy farms in Twente. The measures involved removing tile drains or reinstalling them more shallowly at the same or narrower or wider spacing. The maximum reduction in water discharge occurred after tile drains had been removed: it was approx. 3 cubic metres per day for a field of 2 hectares. With a rise of almost 30 cm in the mean highest water table, this is a reduction of 0. 16 mm per day; On both farms {{the effects of the}} water-saving measures on the technical and economic operational results were marginal, because 1) they affected a relatively small area of the farms and 2) the influence on the <b>mean</b> <b>lowest</b> <b>water</b> table was small...|$|R
50|$|Like other {{estuaries}} {{along the}} Oregon Coast, Netarts Bay experiences semi-diurnal tides (two high tides and two low tides per day). At <b>mean</b> <b>low</b> <b>low</b> <b>water</b> (the lower <b>low</b> tide), the bay contains approximately 113 million cubic ft of water. Contrasting that with that a mean higher high tide volume of approximately 450 million cubic feet, the bay's tidal prism is about 33 million cubic feet. The tidal range varies between 1.5 and 3 meters(5 - 9 feet), which can vary {{the amount of}} water (40-90%) flushed out of the estuary during each tidal cycle. With a mean tidal period of 745 minutes, bay waters turn over, on average, twice a day. Mixing within the estuary is dependent on local winds and tides. Horizontal mixing is limited, although vertical mixing is strong. Little to no vertical variations in temperature and salinity prevent density-driven current velocities, indicating that Netarts Bay is a well-mixed estuary. This has been further corroborated by water quality and dye studies.|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} action increases the dredging volume {{and frequency of}} dredging in Anchorage Harbor. Dredged material disposal {{will be at the}} existing open water disposal site. Construction of the expanded port facilities requires up to 5. 6 million cubic yards of dredging during this transitional period.

Two to four barge trips (occasionally five trips) each containing approximately 1, 500 cubic yards of dredged material will be made per day to the disposal area during the dredging season. Dredging footprints have changed as described in the EA to accommodate the port expansion project. The disposal site is the same, but expanded to allow for both deeper water areas and ability to maneuver from belugas if necessary.
