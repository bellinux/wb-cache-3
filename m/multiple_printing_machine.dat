50|$|Contact <b>printing</b> <b>machines</b> {{are more}} {{elaborate}} devices {{than the more}} familiar and widely available contact printing frames. They typically combine in a box the light source, intermediate glass stages, and a final glass stage for the negative and paper to be placed upon, {{as well as an}} elastic pressure plate to keep the negative and the paper in tight contact. Dodging can be accomplished by placing fine tissue paper on the intermediate glass stages between the light source and the negative/paper sandwich to modify the exposure locally. The benefit to such time intensive techniques is the ability to then make <b>multiple</b> <b>prints</b> with negligible variation, at full production speed.|$|R

Further the hardware circuit is implemented through the design of operational amplifier to reduce the chattering of the system, and the trapezoidal wave is served as the input signal to reduce the overshoot of <b>printing</b> <b>machine</b> generated at the moment of start and stop, ensuring the smooth start and stop of the system. With the simulation results and the experimental results being consistent, it illustrates the correctness and practicality of the proposed method...|$|R
