This is why a direct bank can afford to offer low-cost or free banking, as well as why in some countries, transaction fees do not exist but extremely high lending rates are the norm. This is the case in the United Kingdom, where they have had free banking since 1984 when the then Midland Bank, in a bid to grab market share, scrapped current account charges. It was so successful that all other banks had no choice but offer the same or continue losing customers. Free banking account holders are now charged only if they use an add-on service such as an overdraft.|$|E

30|$|Due {{to rapid}} industrialization, huge {{quantity}} of pollutants discharges {{in to the}} environment. Fluorine is one such pollutant that threatens living organisms, in particular humans (Koilraj and Kannan 2013). Fluoride is a strongly electronegative element, and its presence in drinking water is essential for human health (Chen et al. 2012). However, excess consumption of fluoride can lead to both dental and skeletal fluorosis (Kierdorf et al. 2016; Death et al. 2015). Previous literature (Mohan et al. 2012) demonstrated that more than 200 million people worldwide are affected by fluoride-contaminated drinking water with very high concentration. As per the guideline adopted by WHO (2011) and Bureau of Indian standard (BIS 1991), the concentration of fluoride in drinking water should not exceed beyond 1.5  mg/L. Many technologies such as precipitation, ion exchange, electrolysis have been developed. However, all the above techniques are not cost-effective. These are high <b>maintenance</b> <b>charge</b> and not easy to regenerate. But there is another technique, called adsorption which is an important cost-effective technique widely used {{in most of the}} developing country for removal of fluoride from drinking water (Mondal and Roy 2015).|$|E

Because of limitation of land and increasing property values has contributes more development on high rise residential. Moreover, this type of residential is more economical than landed property. The purpose of this research was to investigate the residential satisfaction in high rise buildings. It presents the study of factors influencing residential satisfaction in high rise buildings of a sample of subjects in a chosen residential area in Selangor. There are two methods to achieve this research which are primary data and secondary data. It is started with the introduction of this research which that has been discussed in the literature review. In literature review has shown the meaning of the strata high rise residential, the maintenance in high rise residential and also statutory requirement there. To get the primary data, there three case studies has been chosen. From the questionnaire survey, the context is provided by focusing on the determinants which affect residential satisfaction such as safety and security, management personnel, <b>maintenance</b> <b>charge,</b> respondents behavior and managementservices. The study employed by questionnaire to obtain the residents demographic, residents satisfaction with management personnel and scope of work, and their participation as an individual and member of JMB.

40|$|Street {{lighting}} {{is a major}} concern for all Authorities that are required to provide this public service. Concerns about safety, crime reduction, and amenity need to be balanced against operation and maintenance costs, and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This project examined if the current lighting in a selected area of Castlemaine, Victoria met the Australian Standard AS/NZS 1158, and what expenditure would be required to bring it up to this standard. Also, the project looked at energy efficient lamps to determine if it was cost effective to replace the existing items. The Australian Standard has two sections – AS 1158. 1. 1 for high vehicle traffic, and AS 1158. 3. 1 for minor roads and pedestrian areas. After the sample area was broken up into lighting zones, computer modelling indicated that the highways were over-lit, and the minor roads were under-lit. The infrastructure required to bring lighting up to the relevant Standard is substantial. For the minor roads, an extra 28 luminaires will be required at an estimated cost of 174, 000. The replacement of the current luminaires with more energy efficient items ahead of the proposed change over date is not warranted because the life of the energy efficient lamps are significantly less than the current items, and the annual <b>maintenance</b> <b>charge</b> for these 'non standard' luminaires is three times the cost of the current item. The recommendation is that Mount Alexander Shire Council, through the CVGA, lobby PowerCor to include energy efficient lighting in their standard luminaires, and that Council refrains from installing extra luminaires unless there is a well defined need. One aspect that was of interest is that AS 1158 is an advisory standard, and there is no requirement for an Authority who is responsible for Public Lighting to meet this Standard...|$|E

40|$|Industrial battery {{chargers}} {{have provided the}} energy requirements for motive power in industrial facilities for decades. Their reliable and durable performance, combined with their low energy consumption relative to other industrial processes, has left the core charger technology unchanged since its introduction to the market. Recent improvements in charger technology {{have led to a}} new generation of high frequency chargers on the market that can provide energy efficiency improvements over existing Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) and Ferroresonant charger technologies. We estimate there are approximately 32, 000 three phase chargers in use within Pacific Gas & Electric Company?s service area, using roughly 750 to 1, 000 GWh per year. A 10 percent efficiency improvement on every charger would save about 75 to 100 GWh per year. There are three areas of energy losses in the battery and charger system: ? Power Conversion Efficiency (energy out of charger vs. energy into charger) ? Charge Return (energy out of battery vs. energy into battery) : some amount of overcharge is necessary for battery health, but chargers vary in the degree which they overcharge ? Standby losses when no battery is connected. PG&E and Southern California Edison (SCE) are testing industrial {{battery chargers}} according to a California Energy Commission (CEC) approved test procedure. This test procedure, developed with charger manufacturer input as part of the CEC?s Codes and Standards process, specifies test conditions during active charge, <b>maintenance</b> <b>charge</b> and standby modes. The results from this testing are expected to provide independent confirmation of vendor claims of energy efficiency improvements during all modes of charger operation, and will form the foundation of data for utility energy efficiency programs. Initial test results of one battery charger from each technology type show the Hybrid and High Frequency technology as the top performers when compared to the SCR and Ferroresonant chargers. Multiple chargers from each technology group will be tested {{in the first half of}} 2009 to determine an average performance for each technology type. The full set of results will be available in summer 2009...|$|E
