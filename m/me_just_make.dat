It's a neighborhood of friends and artists who come in to taste Pasquale Marino's southern Italian food. His mussels are incredible. Or sometimes he'll say, 'I'm inspired, let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> this dish for you.' Pasquale is from Calabria, very spirited and truly the captain of his ship. Yet, sometimes someone will get on the guitar and just start singing." [...] It is also known for its restroom—Italian Renaissance-themed rooms filled with Italian design and art, which have been voted among the best restaurant restrooms in the United States. In addition, it is known for the live music of its piano bar.|$|E

Taking part in the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion, Philipp Frank intervened in the public debate {{about the causes of}} Nazism and how to defend democracy and liberalism against totalitarian ideas and politics. Could philosophy of science contribute to such a struggle? Philipp Frank thought it could, he even thought that Philosophy of Science should {{play a crucial role in}} it. It"s obvious that this position should be of some interest for philosophers in Austria and Europe today. Of course, any serious analysis of Frank"s position would have to take the whole historical constellation into account. Between the beginning of the conference in 1940 and the publication of the book in 1951 the historical situation had dramatically changed. And therefore one has to distinguish several political dimensions in Frank"s arguments. Let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>make</b> a short remark on the plurality of political perspectives Frank"s discourse opened up. Philipp Frank defined the role science should play in democracy not only in contrast to the role of science as it was conceived by totalitarian governments. Of course he criticised the Nazis" and Soviets" â€?philosophies of scienceâ€? several times (see for instance p. 73, 98, 103 p.). But he also made very clear that in the 40 ies and 50 ies not even the majority of scholars and university teachers in the US supported the specific view of science which Frank thought was so important to the advancement of democracy (for instance 59 pp.). His rather critical comments on the teaching of science in the post war / cold war period show what he thought the really important political impact of science was. As far as I can see, these comments did not loose their significance...|$|E

5000|$|The {{popularity}} and accessibility of strips meant {{they were often}} clipped and saved; authors including John Updike and Ray Bradbury have written about their childhood collections of clipped strips. Often posted on bulletin boards, clipped strips had an ancillary form of distribution when they were faxed, photocopied or mailed. The Baltimore Suns Linda White recalled, [...] "I followed the adventures of Winnie Winkle, Moon Mullins and Dondi, and waited each fall to see how Lucy would manage to trick Charlie Brown into trying to kick that football.

[...] She also drew on her parents' {{marriage}} for inspiration—her father spent the bulk of each week traveling. Despite the story's analogies to her own life, Niffenegger has forcefully stated that Clare is not a self-portrait; [...] "She's radically different.

Who would know a vessel because he has let run his halyards and swayed the yard up again? One would do as much to a Turk for manners' sake.

5000|$|One day Rededjet is bickering {{with the}} maidservant {{and the latter}} one is punished with beating. Infuriated, the maidservant says: “Is it because of that? Is it really because of the three kings you gave birth to? I will go to file charges with the king of Lower- and Upper Egypt, Khufu, justified!” The maidservant leaves the house and goes to her elder brother. He is sitting beside his mother, binding flax and yarn. When he sees his sister, he says: “Where do ye go to, lil' sister?” And the maidservant tells him what she is up to. The brother says: “Shall it truly be done to come to <b>me</b> <b>just</b> to <b>make</b> <b>me</b> sup with betrayal?” He becomes angry and beats her, too. The maidservant now goes away to get some water and a {{crocodile}} snatches her. The brother goes to Rededjet {{to tell her what}} happened. Rededjet sits on the threshold, crying. The brother says: “What are you crying about, mistress?” Rededjet answers: “It's about this little girl that grew up in this house. Look, she went to go to file charges ... to the king.” And the brother replies: “See, she came to me to tell ... that I would go with her, but I beat her and sent her away. When she went off for some water a crocodile snatched her.” ...|$|R

6000|$|We {{waited for}} the moon to rise, {{and of course it}} did not rise; nothing ever does when it is waited for. We went to one window, and went to another; half past eleven came, and no moon. [...] "Let us give it up," [...] said I, feeling rather foolish. However, we agreed to wait another quarter of an hour, and finally Mr. ---- {{announced}} that the moon was risen; the only reason we did not see it was, because it was behind the Eildon Hills. So we voted to consider her risen at any rate, and started out in the dark, threading the narrow streets of the village with the comforting reflection that we were doing what Sir Walter would think rather a silly thing. When we got out before the abbey there was enough light behind the Eildon Hills to throw their three shadowy cones out distinctly to view, and to touch with a gloaming, uncertain ray the ivy-clad walls. As we stood before the abbey, the guide fumbling with his keys, and finally heard the old lock clash as the door slowly opened to admit us, I felt a little shiver of the ghostly come over <b>me,</b> <b>just</b> enough to <b>make</b> it agreeable.|$|R

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Party" [...] {{features}} Beyoncé as {{the female}} protagonist [...] "in {{the mood for}} some loving" [...] as she references to a get-together for two persons.

In the chorus lines, she harmonizes over the sample from [...] "La Di Da Di", [...] "Cause tonight's the night that I give you everything / Music knocking until the morning light / 'Cause we like to party". In the second verse, Beyoncé belts out [...] "in a thick stack of smooth, layered vocals".
