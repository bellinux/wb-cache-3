5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} Magic Wand {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} vibrators, and called it a <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> the device {{was able to bring}} about a orgasm in under sixty seconds. Bright wrote about her experience using the Magic Wand to relieve discomfort during childbirth. Author Kathy Shaidle wrote that the massager is able to give females multiple orgasms. Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the Mütter Museum. Sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of the Magic Wand because it was imported from Japan, and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries, and durability compared to other vibrators.|$|E

25|$|On 24 April 2014, it was {{reported}} in the Italian magazine Credere that the late pope could possibly be beatified on 19 October 2014. This report from the magazine further stated that several cardinals and bishops would meet on 5 May to confirm the <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> had previously been approved, and then present it to Pope Francis who may sign the decree for beatification shortly after that. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints held that meeting and positively concluded that the healing was indeed a <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> could be attributed to the late pope. The matter shall now soon be presented to the pope for approval.|$|E

It was expected that Pope Francis would approve the miracle in the near future, thus, warranting the beatification of the late pontiff.

It was mere hours later that the child had an appointment with her doctor who testified that the girl was normal like all other children with no defects apparent whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|According to a later legend, the {{sanctuary}} was erected by Emperor Leo I the Thracian (r. 457–474) {{because of a}} <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> occurred {{when he was still}} a soldier. Before entering the City, Leo met a blind man who asked him to give him water. A female voice ordered the future Emperor to wet the eyes of the blind man with water from a nearby swamp. The same voice added that she had chosen that very place to be worshiped and that he would one day receive the crown to the empire. Leo followed her order and at once the blind man recovered his eyesight. After his accession to the throne, the Emperor erected a magnificent church on this place. This legend is possibly a later invention of the monks of {{the sanctuary}}. It is possible that, before the Justinian's building was erected, a small monastery had already existed there.|$|E

25|$|Opposition parties claim Berlusconi was {{not able}} to achieve the goals he promised in his Contratto con gli Italiani. Some of his {{partners}} in government, especially the National Alliance and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, admitted the Government fell short of the promises made in the agreement, attributing the failure to an unforeseeable downturn in global economic conditions. Berlusconi himself consistently asserted that he achieved all the goals of the agreement, and said his Government provided un miracolo continuo (a continuous <b>miracle)</b> <b>that</b> made all 'earlier governments pale' (by comparison). He attributed the widespread failure to recognise these achievements to a campaign of mystification and vilification in the print media, asserting that 85% of newspapers were opposed to him. Luca Ricolfi, an independent analyst, held that Berlusconi had managed to deliver only one promise out of five, the one concerning minimum pension rates. According to Ricolfi, the other four promises were not honoured, in particular the undertakings on tax simplification and crime reduction.|$|E
25|$|The {{village is}} named after the 6th century Irish Christian missionary Saint Buriana (also {{sometimes}} called Beriana, Buriena, or Beriena). The local legend describes how, whilst ministering to the local inhabitants from the oratory that stood {{on the site of}} the current church, Saint Buriana was abducted by the local king, Geraint (or Gereint) of Dumnonia. Saint Piran, patron saint of Cornwall and also a fellow missionary, negotiated for her release, but the reticent Geraint agreed only on the caveat that he be awoken by a cuckoo calling across the snow, something which would be highly unlikely in mid-winter. The legend states that Saint Piran prayed through the night whilst the snow fell, and in the morning Geraint was awoken by a cuckoo's song. He was so taken aback by the <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> he honoured his pledge, however, shortly afterwards he changed his mind and tried to recapture Buriana. Buriana is said to have died as Geraint tried to re-imprison her, and was purportedly buried on the site of her chapel.|$|E

500|$|In the mid-1980s, Sam Tellig {{wrote in}} Stereophile that the Rega 3 [...] "is a good-sounding {{turntable}} {{and a good}} value—at the UK price ... it's a <b>miracle</b> <b>that</b> the Rega sounds {{as good as it}} does" [...] compared with the apparently better built Harman-Kardon T60. From a sound quality viewpoint, Tellig noted [...] "a very dynamic sound with powerful, punchy bass—the table conveys the music's excitement... too much emphasis of the mid- to upper-bass [...] tends to sound a little muddy in bass detail". He added that the deck's pitch instability was audible [...] "every so often, particularly with woodwinds". Szabady, in Stereo Times, also agreed that musical expressiveness was the classic [...] strength; its weaknesses included occasional speed inconsistency and slurring of heavily modulated bass transients.|$|E

He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion.

In 2009, The Vancouver Sun named [...] "Home" [...] one of the best stand-alone episodes of the series and wrote that, because of its horrific theme of incest, the episode [...] "doesn't pull any punches". Den of Geek writer Nina Sordi placed the entry as the fourth best of the series in 2009, viewing its bleak humor and [...] "thought-provoking moments" [...] of dialogue as the factors that made it one of the most popular episodes. In 2008, Starpulse gave the installment an honorable mention as one of the 10 best X-Files episodes.

500|$|After the {{publication}} of Eureka, a vehement anonymous censure {{was published in the}} Literary Review. Poe believed it to have been written by John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (1820–1889), a young theological student, who had previously criticized the work as pantheistic and [...] "a damnable heresy" [...] that [...] "conscience would compel him to denounce". Literary critic George Edward Woodberry in 1885 thought the essay was based on a crude understanding of the science a student learns in school [...] "rendered ridiculous" [...] by absurdity and the density of his ignorance. Thomas Dunn English, a writer, lawyer, and doctor who frequently criticized Poe, wrote a news article for the John-Donkey with the headline, [...] "Great Literary Crash".
