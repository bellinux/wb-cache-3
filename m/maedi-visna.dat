5000|$|Visna virus (also {{known as}} visna-maedi virus, <b>maedi-visna</b> virus and ovine lentivirus) from the genus Lentivirus and {{subfamily}} Orthoretrovirinae, is a [...] "prototype" [...] retrovirus that causes encephalitis and chronic pneumonitis in sheep. It {{is known as}} visna when found in the brain, and maedi when infecting the lungs. Lifelong, persistent infections in sheep occur in the lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, joints, central nervous system, and mammary glands; The condition is sometimes known as [...] "ovine progressive pneumonia" [...] (OPP), particularly in the United States, or [...] "Montana sheep disease".

40|$|<b>Maedi-visna</b> is an {{economically}} important viral disease of sheep that occasionally affects goats. The <b>maedi-visna</b> virus (MVV), a lentivirus; infects its hosts for life.

40|$|<b>Maedi-visna,</b> {{a chronic}} viral disease of adult sheep {{characterized}} by progressive dyspnoea or neurological manifestations, was first recognized and described clinically in Canada in 1970. Seroepidemiological {{study was conducted}} in sheep and goats in various areas of Quebec. Sera of 10 % of the animals of selected flocks were collected and specific antibodies against <b>maedi-visna</b> virus were tested by a modified direct complement fixation test. Results show seropositive rate of 67. 6 % for Sherbrooke sheep; of 40. 5, 41. 1 and 47. 1 % for Quebec, Saint-Hyacinthe and Nicolet sheep respectively and only 29. 2 and 20. 0 % positive sera in l'Assomption and Rimouski animals. Prevalence rate of positive goats varied according to geographic areas (0 to 36. 8 %). Statistical analysis of various factors, e. g. age, breed, mode of raising, origin and size of flock showed no relation between these factors and the geographic areas. But, some clinical problems in the sheep flocks such as cough, rapid breathing, mortality and abortion were associated with high infection rate (greater than or equal to 50 %) to <b>maedi-visna</b> virus.

40|$|Conservation {{of genetic}} {{resources}} from endangered breeds may be conducted through germinal banks. Preservation of healthy samples is paramount to avoid preserving pathogens shed with germinal products. The black variety of Manchega sheep (BMS), and endangered breed endemic to south-central Spain, {{is the subject}} of a conservation program; a germinal bank has been recently established. However, several pathogens circulating in BMS flocks may be shed with semen and threaten BMS preservation. Therefore, we investigated the sanitary status of BMS flocks and semen samples from 4 of the 17 flocks in which this variety is bred worldwide. A serological screening for <b>Maedi-Visna</b> virus, bluetongue virus, Pestivirus spp., Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydophila spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, Anaplasma spp., Mycoplasma agalactiae, Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum was performed to assess for pathogens potentially shed by semen. Semen samples from 11 of the 35 BMS rams and 4 samples from coexisting rams of the white variety (WMS) were analyzed by PCR to detect <b>Maedi-Visna</b> virus, C. burnetii, Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and T. gondii. <b>Maedi-Visna</b> virus RNA was detected in 3 semen samples (2 BMS and 1 WMS) while C. burnetii DNA was detected in 3 samples from WMS rams. Pathogens that can be transmitted by semen were present in BMS flocks, and <b>Maedi-Visna</b> virus and C. burnetii showed the highest potential for transmission by artificial insemination. Our results point to the need of testing semen samples kept for conservation purposes of BMS before using them for artificial insemination.

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>Maedi-Visna</b> (MV) {{lentivirus}} causes two slowly progressive eventually fatal {{diseases of}} sheep, Maedi, a progressive interstitial pneumonia, and Visna, a progressive demyelinating {{disease of the}} central nervous system. Other lentiviruses also cause fatal slow infections in their natural hosts, e. g. the HIV virus in humans. Results of experimental vaccination against any lentivirus where vaccinees are challenged by natural routes, may therefore be of general interest. From 1991 – 1998 experiments with formalin-inactivated whole <b>Maedi-Visna</b> virus vaccine were {{carried out in the}} Department of Microbiology at the University of Iceland. Western Blot tests showed good immune response to all major proteins of the virus. When aluminium hydroxide was added to the vaccine all vaccinees developed neutralizing antibodies to the vaccine strain at titers 1 / 8 – 1 / 256. After housing 5 twin pairs, one twin in each pair vaccinated, the other unvaccinated, with infected sheep for 4 years, all the unvaccinated twins became infected, but only 2 of their vaccinated siblings as confirmed by virus cultivation experiments on tissues from their lungs spleens lymph nodes and choroid plexuses. Results One twin in each of 40 female twin pairs, born into a Maedi-Visna-infected sheep flock and kept under natural farming conditions in Cyprus, was vaccinated at birth, 3 weeks and 3 months, with formalin-inactivated whole <b>Maedi-Visna</b> lentivirus vaccine adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide. 17 mothers of the twins were seronegative, 13 seroconverting and 10 had old infection. Of 17 vaccinees born to seronegative mothers 9 were uninfected at 28 months, but only 2 of their unvaccinated siblings. Of 13 unvaccinated twins born to seroconverting mothers, 12 caught infection during their first 10 weeks, but only 4 of their vaccinated siblings. Vaccination had no effects on 10 vaccinees born to mothers with long-standing <b>Maedi-Visna</b> infections and broad andibody response at birth of their lambs. Conclusion Compared with their unvaccinated siblings, natural infection was delayed in significant number of vaccinated twins born by seronegative and seroconverting mothers and vaccinated at birth, 3 weeks and 3 months with formalin inactivated whole MV vaccine adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide.

40|$|Abstract Background Virus rescue from {{transfected}} {{cells is}} an extremely useful technique that allows defined viral clones to be engineered {{for the purpose of}} rational vaccine design or fundamental reverse genetics studies. However, it is often hindered by low primary rescue success rates or yields, especially with field-derived viral strains. Approach We investigated the possibility of enhancing influenza virus rescue by eliciting cell fusion to increase the chances of having all necessary plasmids expressed within the same polykaryon. To this end we used the <b>Maedi-Visna</b> Virus envelope protein which has potent fusion activity in cells {{from a wide range of}} different species. Results Co-transfecting cells with the eight plasmids necessary to rescue influenza virus plus a plasmid expressing the <b>Maedi-Visna</b> Virus envelope protein resulted in increased rescue efficiency. In addition, partial complements of the 8 -plasmid rescue system could be transfected into two separate populations of cells, which upon fusion led to live virus rescue.

40|$|Caprine {{arthritis}} and encephalitis (CAE) is an economically important viral disease of goats. The {{caprine arthritis encephalitis}} virus (CAEV), a lentivirus; infects its hosts for life. Although most infections are subclinical, a minority of animals develops progressive, untreatable disease syndromes including polyarthritis in adults and encephalomyelitis in kids. This virus also causes indurative mastitis, resulting in decreased milk production. CAEV infections decrease lifetime productivity in dairy goats, particularly when the prevalence of infection is high within a herd. In addition, CAEV is a barrier to the exportation of goats from countries where it is endemic, including the United States. CAEV {{is closely related to}} the <b>maedi-visna</b> virus (MVV), which is found most often in sheep.

Although the approach of program 1 is more practical for sheep producers, program 2 is more effective because of the earlier development of a M-V seronegative flock.
