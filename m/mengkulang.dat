[...] Preferred wood species for the tropical carpenter bee include, Syzygium cumini, Cassia siamea, Dyera costulata (jelutong), Agathis alba (damar minyak), Alstonia spp. (pulai), and Shorea spp. (light-red meranti). They tend to avoid nyatoh, kapur, kempas, and <b>mengkulang</b> (local names for native trees of Malaysia).|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{the current}} study reveals {{potential}} of natural sensitizers extracted from rengas and <b>mengkulang</b> wood. The best performance was obtained when the sensitizers were mixed {{at a ratio of}} 60 %: 40 % (M:R). The HOMO and LUMO levels of all of the investigated sensitizers were calculated. The optical band gap value decreased when the sensitizers were mixed. The individual rengas and <b>mengkulang</b> sensitizers exhibited lower energy conversion efficiencies (ŋ) than their mixed forms. The low IPCE percentage was found to contribute to the low energy conversion efficiencies (ŋ) of the DSSCs, with the individual sensitizers achieving a lower IPCE than their mixed forms. The efficiencies obtained using these sensitizers remain low for large-scale practical applications, but the results may serve as a reference for future studies on these new natural sensitizers.|$|E
30|$|Rengas and <b>mengkulang</b> wood were {{collected}} from a local sawmill in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, TiO 2 paste (WER 2, Dyesol), fluorine-doped conducting tin oxide (FTO) glasses (~ 15  Ω sq− 1, Solaronix), redox electrolyte (iodolyte AN- 50, Solaronix), platinum paste purchased from Solaronix, Surlyn (60  μm, Maltonix), organic solvent purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.|$|E
30|$|Dye-sensitized {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) are {{fabricated}} using natural sensitizers extracted from rengas (Gluta spp.) and <b>mengkulang</b> (Heritieraelata) wood. The natural sensitizers are extracted using a cold extraction and the Soxhlet extraction methods. This paper {{presents the results}} of the analysis of the optical characteristics of the sensitizers via ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The optical band gap and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of each investigated sensitizer are calculated {{on the basis of the}} analyzed data collected from photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry. The DSSCs with the <b>mengkulang</b> sensitizer have better conversion efficiency (ŋ =  0.1695 %) than the DSSCs with the rengas sensitizer (ŋ =  0.109 %). The performance of the DSSCs indicates an increment as the ratios of the mixed mengkulang:rengas (60 %: 40 %) and mengkulang:rengas (40 %: 60 %) sensitizers increase up to 0.296 and 0.292 %, respectively.|$|E
40|$|In this study, a glulam as an {{engineered}} wood product (EWP) was produced using <b>Mengkulang.</b> The withdrawal capacity tests were conducted on the <b>Mengkulang</b> Glulam using bolts of 12 mm and 16 mm in diameter for parallel and perpendicular grain directions. The {{results indicated that the}} withdrawal capacity of 12 mm diameter bolt is lower than 16 mm bolt diameter by 80. 16 % when the bolts are inserted parallel to the grain direction. Meanwhile, the bolt withdrawal capacity for 12 mm is also lower than 16 mm by 64. 82 % when the bolts are inserted perpendicular to the grain direction. Twelve (12) mm bolt diameter inserted perpendicular to the grain provided higher withdrawal capacity than those inserted parallel by about 62. 82 %. On the other hand, the withdrawal capacity of 16 mm diameter bolt was observed to be higher in perpendicular to grain direction when compared to parallel insertion which differs by 33. 82 %. Hence, it can be concluded that the higher bolt diameter provides the better withdrawal capacity. The bolt performs better when it is inserted perpendicular to the grain rather than parallel to the grain direction...|$|E
30|$|The {{interest}} {{in this study is}} towards effective natural sensitizers. In the last two decades, {{a number of studies have}} tested variable plant parts, such as flowers, leaves, barks, and roots, in search of effective natural sensitizers. However, most of the studies in the open literature did not investigate potential sensitizers extracted from the wood of forest trees. Malaysia is known for the biodiversity of its tropical rainforests that are home to various tree species. Hence, exploring the contribution of trees to fields other than the furniture industry, such as the field of solar energy, is important. The present study introduces sensitizers extracted from rengas (Gluta spp.) and <b>mengkulang</b> (Heritieraelata) wood and examines their optical properties and performance in DSSCs. In addition, the ratios of the mixtures of these sensitizers are manipulated to investigate their effectiveness on device performance.|$|E
30|$|Photo {{electrodes}} {{were prepared}} by depositing TiO 2 paste (WER 2, Dyesol) into fluorine-doped conducting tin oxide (FTO) glasses (~ 15  Ω sq− 1, Solaronix), which {{were used as}} the conductive glass plates in the doctor blading technique. The electrodes were then sintered at 450  °C for 30  min. The photo electrodes were subsequently dipped in the sensitizers, that is, <b>mengkulang</b> (M), rengas (R), and their mixtures [M:R (50 %: 50 %), M:R (60 %: 40 %), and M:R (40 %: 60 %)] for 24  h at room temperature to allow sufficient time to graft the dye molecules on the TiO 2 surface. Then, TiO 2 electrodes were extracted and rinsed with methanol before being dried with nitrogen gas. The DSSCs were assembled by introducing a redox electrolyte (iodolyte AN- 50, Solaronix) between the dyed TiO 2 electrode and the platinum counter electrode. The platinum paste purchased from Solaronix was deposited on to the FTO glasses (~ 8  Ω sq− 1, Solaronix) and heated at 450  °C for 30  min. Surlyn (60  μm, Maltonix) was used to assemble the photo and counter electrodes of the cells.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is {{generate}} connection data that can employed {{in the design of}} connections for Malaysian timber species particularly for glulam products. This investigation focuses on evaluating dowel-bearing strength for timber based products. Thus far, limited studies on dowel-bearing strength were published and reported. <b>Mengkulang,</b> (Heritiera spp), was used to evaluate the dowel-bearing strength properties, Two bolt diameters 16 and 20 mm consecutively were selected in this study. The project comprised experimental work that was based ASTMD 5 764, using half-hole testing setup. The dowel-bearing strength, Fₑ for 16 mm and 20 mm diameter were determined from 5 % diameter offset yield load method. Through the experimental work and analysis, the percentage difference between 16 mm and 20 mm was found 15 % increased from 16. 24 N/mm² to 19. 2 IN/mm², respectively. The dowel-bearing strength increased when the dowel diameter increased. The comparison between dowel-bearing strength of 5 % diameter offset load, Fₑ and maximum load, Fh of glulam without glue line has successfully analysed. The Fe and Fh was found 16. 24 N/mm² and 18. 50 N/ mm² for the 16 mm diameter while was 19. 2 IN/ mm² and 22. 69 N/ mm² for the 20 mm diameter respectively...|$|E
