This layout is optimized to reduce the demand on the voltage of the crab cavities, while substantially improving the optics squeeze-ability, both in ATS [1] and non-ATS mode.

The initial displacement impressed to the structure has the same order of magnitude of the design displacement. The design isolation system is made of High Damping Rubber Bearings (HDRB), on which <b>mechanical</b> qualification, and <b>acceptance</b> tests have been run.

30|$|Cardaciotto, Herbert, Forman, Moitra, and Farrow (2008) conceptualize {{mindfulness}} as our {{tendency to}} be highly aware of our inner and outer experiences with a posture of acceptance rather than one of judgment as to these experiences. Therefore, there are two fundamental and independent mindfulness dimensions: Acceptance and Awareness. Awareness refers to the monitoring of internal or external experience at the moment it occurs, {{in such a way}} that we do not exhibit <b>mechanical</b> behavior. The <b>acceptance</b> construct refers to an attitude of openness and non-judgment, free of defenses, beliefs and interpretations of one’s internal or external experience (Cardaciotto et al., 2008), which may also be related to the tendency of noticing the experience in a complete manner, without avoidance.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the contact absorbers on the kinetics of the hydrogen isolation from steel has been investigated. The periodic reversible failures of the mechanical properties of the thick-sheet rolled stock have been detected. The new principles of the efficiency increase in steel dehydrogenation have been developed. For the first time, the industrial tests on the steel contact dehydrogenation have been perfomed. The mechanical properties of the thick-sheet rolled stock of the low-alloyed steels have been improved and stabilized in time. The industrial test of the new technology of the dehydrogenation intensification has been performed. The rejection of the ready rolled stock has been reduced at the <b>acceptance</b> <b>mechanical</b> tests.

40|$|The LHC Upgrade studies, formalized {{into the}} High- Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project, {{relies on the}} {{feasibility}} of very low, and in particular on a novel achromatic squeezing mechanism, the ATS scheme [1] which is presently under test in the LHC. We present two optics and layout scenarios for the HL-LHC using the ATS scheme, one based on Nb 3 Sn triplet quadrupoles with a coil aperture compatible with an operational gradient of 150 T/m, and a backup scenario based on the NbTi technology compatible with an operational gradient of 100 T/m.

40|$|The main {{guidelines}} of the LHC IR upgrade Phase I project are the development of wider aperture (120 mm) and lower gradient (120 T/m) quadrupoles using the wellcharacterized Nb-Ti technology {{in order to build}} new inner triplets (IT) for the ATLAS and CMS experimental insertions, while minimizing the hardware modifications in the other parts of these insertions, in particular leaving unchanged the so-called "matching section" (MS) and "dispersion suppressor" (DS). While one of the initial goal was to squeeze the optics down to a B* of 25 cm, optics solutions with a B* of 30 cm are already at the edge of feasibility, both in terms of the IT and MS <b>mechanical</b> <b>acceptance,</b> gradients of the MS and DS quadrupole magnets, and correctability by the arc sextupoles of the huge chromatic aberrations generated at low B*.

40|$|A {{large number}} of the small optics {{procurements}} for the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) {{will be in the}} form of completely assembled, tested, and cleaned subsystems. These subsystems will be integrated into the NIF at LLNL. To accomplish this task, the procurement packages will include, optical and <b>mechanical</b> drawings, <b>acceptance</b> test and cleanliness requirements. In January 1999, the first such integrated opto-mechanical assembly was received and evaluated at LLNL. With the successful completion of this important trial procurement, we were able to establish the viability of purchasing clean, ready to install, opto-mechanical assemblies from vendors within the optics industry. 32 vendors were chosen from our supplier database for quote, then five were chosen to purchase from. These five vendors represented a cross section of the optics industry. From a ''value'' catalog supplier (that did the whole job internally) to a partnership between three specialty companies, these vendors demonstrated they have the ingenuity and capability to deliver cost competitive, NIF-ready, opto- mechanical assemblies. This paper describes the vendor selection for this procurement, technical requirements including packaging, fabrication, coating, and cleanliness specifications, then testing and verification. It also gives real test results gathered from inspections performed at LLNL that show how our vendors scored on the various requirements.

40|$|The Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in rapid prototyping. 3 D printers for home desktop applications are usually employed to make non-structural objects. When the mechanical stresses are not excessive, this technology can also be successfully employed to produce structural objects, not only in prototyping stage {{but also in the}} realization of series pieces. The innovative idea of the present work is the application of this technology, implemented in a desktop 3 D printer, to the realization of components for aeronautical use, especially for unmanned aerial systems. For this purpose, the paper is devoted to the statistical study of the performance of a desktop 3 D printer to understand how the process performs and which are the boundary limits of <b>acceptance.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> and geometrical properties of ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) specimens, such as tensile strength and stiffness, have been evaluated.

40|$|Aggregates of {{intrusive}} rocks {{are the major}} source of crushed fine and coarse aggregates for use in concrete in several countries and they have to meet a number of specifications relating to strength and durability. This research reports the evaluation of aggregates of granitoids and associated rocks of Santa Marta Batholith, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Massif, Colombia, based on petrographic analysis and <b>mechanical</b> and chemical <b>acceptance</b> tests. The strength and durability of a particular rock type depends on its intrinsic characteristic, thus petrographic analysis is very important to understand its mechanical and chemical properties. Numerous standard tests used to ensure aggregates meet the appropriate specifications; however, petrographic analysis represents the most valuable test for predicting the overall performance of concrete aggregates in any control test. Aggregates were analyzed to determine their petrographic, physical, mechanical and chemical properties. Samples were categorized as hornblendite, gabbro, quartzmonzodiorite, monzodiorite and monzonite groups. Among these, of the quartzmonzodiorite was the dominant group. Specific gravity indicates values in the range 2673 - 2956 kg/m 3. Water absorption values are in the range 0. 908 - 1. 194 %. Aggregate impact values of samples (37. 82 to 61. 36 %) showed good soundness only for one of the aggregates, which are considered acceptable for use in the preparation of a good quality concrete. Values of Methylene Blue Adsorption reveal the organic matter content is below the threshold. Magnesium sulphate values ranged between 0. 11 and 4. 75 % suggesting good resistance against chemical atmospheric agents. The compressive strength test shows values in the range 35. 22 - 59. 45 MPa indicating that the geomechanical behavior of rock cylinders is satisfactory. The geomechanical behavior of rock tablets under flexion is also satisfactory for SMA- 2 sample (16. 53 MPa), although not for SMA- 6 and SMA- 8 samples, which showed values of 7. 52 and 8. 74 MPa, respectively. Comparing with the existing American Standard of Testing Material, the studied samples are suitable for concrete...|$|R
