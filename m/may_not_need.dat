5|$|Many long-distance {{migrants}} {{appear to}} be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length. Species that move short distances, however, <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> such a timing mechanism, instead moving in response to local weather conditions. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as wallcreeper Tichodroma muraria and white-throated dipper Cinclus cinclus, may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground. Other species such as merlin Falco columbarius and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5km in their lives.|$|E

Typically, the omnidirectional microphone mode is used in quiet listening situations (e.g. living room) whereas the directional microphone is used in noisy listening situations (e.g. restaurant).

25|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multi-faceted, age-dependent, {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder, {{and is a}} {{major cause}} of dementia. According to the Amyloid hypothesis, the accumulation of extracellular amyloid betapeptides (Aβ) into plaques via oligomerization leads to hallmark symptomatic conditions of AD through synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Immunotherapy via exogenous monoclonal antibody (MAB) administration has been known to treat various central nervous disorders, such as AD, by inhibiting Aβ-oligomerization thereby preventing neurotoxicity. However, MABs are large for passive protein channels and are therefore inefficient due to the blood-brain barrier preventing MAB passage into the brain. However, the Peripheral Sink hypothesis proposes a mechanism where MABs <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, many research studies are being conducted from failed attempts to treat AD in the past.|$|E
25|$|In vitro studies {{identified}} that {{a modified version}} of imatinib can bind to gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP). GSAP selectively increases the production and accumulation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid plaques, which suggests that molecules which target GSAP and are able to cross blood–brain barrier are potential therapeutic agents for treating Alzheimer's disease. Another study suggests that imatinib <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to cross the blood–brain barrier to be effective at treating Alzheimer's, as the research indicates the production of beta-amyloid may begin in the liver. Tests on mice indicate that imatinib is effective at reducing beta-amyloid in the brain. It is not known whether reduction of beta-amyloid is a feasible way of treating Alzheimer's, as an anti-beta-amyloid vaccine has been shown to clear the brain of plaques without having any effect on Alzheimer symptoms.|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{selected the}} song as a highlight {{in his review}} of Justified. Peter Robinson of NME called it a [...] "twisted epic" [...] and [...] "an acidic, filthy little song teeming with spite and retribution, with Timbaland's pounding." [...] Rolling Stones Ben Ratliff viewed his production of [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] as exceptional. Denise Boyd of BBC Music felt that the song's lyrics play as large a role as Timbaland's production, unlike other songs on Justified. [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly concluded that the song is [...] "a genuine stunner" [...] that should leave Timberlake's fellow 'N Syncers concerned that he truly <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> them any more. John Mitchell of MTV News called [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] "kiss-off songs", with Timberlake's revenge on Spears present throughout the lyrics. Idolator staff opined it {{is the sound of}} an artist who is [...] "relishing ripping up people's perceptions of him as a sweet-natured teen heartthrob." [...] VH1's Emily Exton wrote, [...] "By stretching the boundaries of pop–and fusing it with notes of R, lots of electric goodness, and haunting choral vocals–Timberlake’s kiss-off song instantly becomes more poignant, a pointed reaction to the hurt he’s experienced by someone he once loved." [...] According to Complex, the song [...] "made people completely forget about 'N Sync and start asking what Timberlake would do next." [...] The single won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 award ceremony. It was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards.|$|E

Individuals are more likely to free ride if vaccination rates are high enough so as to convince a person that he or she <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to be immune since a sufficient number of others already are.

2500|$|Initial {{treatment}} involves {{stabilizing the}} patient enough to ensure adequate airway, breathing, and circulation, and identifying other injuries. [...] Surgery {{may be needed}} to repair injured organs. Surgical exploration is necessary for people with penetrating injuries and signs of peritonitis or shock. [...] Laparotomy is often performed in blunt abdominal trauma, and is urgently required if an abdominal injury causes a large, potentially deadly bleed. The main goal is to stop any sources of bleeding before moving onto any definitive find and repair any injuries that are found. Due to the time sensitive nature, this procedure also emphasizes expedience in terms of gaining access and controlling the bleeding, thus favoring a long midline incession. Intra-abdominal injuries are also frequently successfully treated nonoperatively as there is little benefit shown if there is no known active bleeding or potential for infection. The use of CT scanning allows care providers to use less surgery because they can identify injuries that can be managed conservatively and rule out other injuries that would need surgery.
