25|$|Historically, lensing {{analyses}} were conducted on galaxy clusters detected via their baryon content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys). The sample of galaxy clusters studied with lensing was thus subject to various selection effects; for example, only the most luminous clusters were investigated. In 2006, David Wittman of the University of California at Davis and collaborators published the first sample of galaxy clusters detected via their lensing signals, completely independent of their baryon content. Clusters discovered through lensing are subject to <b>mass</b> <b>selection</b> effects because the more massive clusters produce lensing signals with higher signal-to-noise.|$|E
25|$|Maize {{breeding}} in prehistory {{resulted in}} large plants producing large ears. Modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties {{in their fields}} and then sold seed to other farmers. James L. Reid {{was one of the}} earliest and most successful developing Reid's Yellow Dent in the 1860s. These early efforts were based on <b>mass</b> <b>selection.</b> Later breeding efforts included ear to row selection, (C. G. Hopkins ca. 1896), hybrids made from selected inbred lines (G. H. Shull, 1909), and the highly successful double cross hybrids using 4 inbred lines (D. F. Jones ca. 1918, 1922). University supported breeding programs were especially important in developing and introducing modern hybrids. (Ref Jugenheimer Hybrid Maize Breeding and Seed Production pub. 1958) by the 1930s, companies such as Pioneer devoted to production of hybrid maize had begun to influence long term development. Internationally important seed banks such as International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the US bank at Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign maintain germplasm important for future crop development.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} MS techniques, MS/MS techniques {{allow for}} mass analysis {{to occur in}} a sequential manner in {{different regions of the}} instruments. The TQMS follows the tandem-in-space arrangement, due to ionization, primary <b>mass</b> <b>selection,</b> collision induced dissociation (CID), mass analysis of fragments produced during CID, and detection occurring in separate segments of the instrument. Sector instruments tend to surpass the TQMS in mass resolution and mass range. However, the triple quadrupole has the advantage of being cheaper, easy to operate, and they are highly efficient. Also, when operated in the selected reaction monitoring mode, the TQMS has superior detection sensitivity as well as quantification. The triple quadrupole allows the study of low-energy low-molecule reactions, which is useful when small molecules are being analyzed.|$|E

Analysis of yield components revealed that C22 was superior to C0 in grain weight, number of rows per ear, number of grains per row, and total yield per unit area (Table 3). Because the two genotypes were phenologically different, planting density optima are probably different for each population.|$|E
