5000|$|Cheerleading {{is one of}} the few {{fields that}} still uses {{acoustic}} <b>megaphones.</b> Cheerleaders at the University of Minnesota are credited with first using acoustic <b>megaphones</b> in routines in 1898. Since then, cheerleaders have relied heavily on acoustic <b>megaphones</b> during performances at sporting events. Generally, female cheerleaders would use pom pons while male cheerleaders, with loud booming voices, would project cheers through <b>megaphones.</b> [...] Vocal projection is an important aspect for cheerleading, so experts recommend the use of acoustic <b>megaphones</b> not only to increase the volume of sound, but also to protect performers’ voices in the process.|$|R

When all four men began fighting inside the ring, Neidhart attacked Mr. Fuji, who was on the ring apron. At the end of the match, Bret Hart attempted a piledriver but Ax hit him a <b>megaphone</b> given by Jimmy Hart sneaking back to the ring. Smash then pinned Bret Hart for the win.|$|E

North Carolina's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over Brennan to collect the rebound and was called for over the back. Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling, while Chamberlain threw {{the ball out of}} bounds on the subsequent possession. Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain's error when Kearns missed the front end of a one–and–one. Kansas came down the court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham. This sparked an altercation between the two teams, which resulted in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a <b>megaphone</b> and his knee being scarred by a Carolina cheerleader.
