Maslin said of the final scene of the movie, [...] "Anything this moment reveals about Vietnam and about America, not to mention about dogs and merry-go-rounds, has been said better elsewhere." [...] Critic Richard Freeman found Barbara Hershey's character [...] "moronic", and referred to the film as [...] "twaddle." [...] Freeman said it was [...] "fraught with symbolism. Or <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just fraught". He further said of the film, [...] "Actually, it's about David Carradine, of whom the less said the better". The Kokomo Tribune called the story [...] "pointless". When Carradine read the reviews, {{he went back to}} the hotel bathroom and threw up.

500|$|During {{their writing}} sessions, Malay noticed Ocean's use of gender pronouns in his lyrics, but {{attributed}} it to Ocean's poetic license {{rather than his}} sexuality. In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> and it's a metaphor the way he did it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E
500|$|Twilight {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Based on 209 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} a rating of 48%, with a weighted average score of 5.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads: [...] "Having {{lost much of its}} bite transitioning to the big screen, Twilight will please its devoted fans, but do little for the uninitiated." [...] On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, it has an average score of 56 from the 37 reviews. New York Press critic Armond White called the film [...] "a genuine pop classic", and praised Hardwicke for turning [...] "Meyer's book series into a Brontë-esque vision." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "I saw it at a sneak preview. Last time I saw a movie in that same theater, the audience welcomed it as an opportunity to catch up on gossip, texting, and laughing at private jokes. This time the audience was rapt with attention". In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "Twilight is unabashedly a romance. All the story's inherent silliness aside, it is intent on conveying the magic of meeting that one special person you've been waiting for. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible to be 13 and female for a few hours after all". USA Today gave the film two out of four stars and Claudia Puig wrote, [...] "Meyer {{is said to have been}} involved in the production of Twilight, but her novel was substantially more absorbing than the unintentionally funny and quickly forgettable film". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman praised Hardwicke's direction: [...] "She has reconjured Meyer's novel as a cloudburst mood piece filled with stormy skies, rippling hormones, and understated visual effects".|$|E

500|$|Jordan Farley from SFX {{magazine}} {{named the}} episode the eighth of the [...] "Top Groundhog Days" [...] episodes. Farley applauded the show's gall to seemingly kill {{one of the}} leads in the teaser and appreciated the entry's mix of humor—during the scenes with Mulder and his water bed—and its alternative scenarios in the bank. Natalie Prado from Just Press Play gave the episode an A– and wrote, [...] "The episode is well-written and tense. As an audience, we become increasingly frustrated that the two people that we know can solve the problem are unaware that it exists, which makes the payoff when they finally {{find a way out}} much more satisfying. There are a few leaps in logic, especially towards the end, but overall it’s solid and enjoyable." [...] Jamie Jeffords, writing for the Dallas Morning News, awarded the episode four out of five stars and praised Hamilton's performance, saying, [...] "What makes 'Monday’ is the performance of Hamilton [...] When she is killed in the end, she almost possesses a quiet glee when she realizes her death never happened before, so <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> over now. Her performance is haunting. Very powerful." [...] Michigan Daily writer Melissa Runstrom, in a review of the sixth season, said [...] "Monday" [...] was [...] "well made and entertaining." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris called the episode [...] "ingenious and heart-wrenching," [...] and noted that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson's acting was the best of the season. Furthermore, she praised Kim Manners' directing style, calling the same scenes shot in different ways [...] "new". UGO Networks listed the episode as number 95 in a countdown of the [...] "100 Greatest Moments in Time Travel".|$|E

2500|$|Aside from {{a part in}} the {{suspense}} drama Sherlock Holmes and the Strange Case of Miss Faulkner and her desire to play more-challenging roles, Entwistle was often cast as a comedian, most often the attractive, good-hearted ingénue. In 1929 she told a reporter:"I would rather play roles that carry conviction. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> because they are the easiest and yet the hardest things for me to do. To play any kind of an emotional scene I must work up to a certain pitch. If I reach this in my first word, the rest of the words and lines take care of themselves. But if I fail, I have to build up the balance of the speeches, and in doing this the whole characterisation falls flat. I feel that I am cheating myself. I don't know whether other actresses get this same reaction or not, but it does worry me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, J. C. C. Mays {{pointed out}} that [...] "Coleridge's {{claim to be a}} great poet lies in the {{continued}} pursuit of the consequences of 'The Ancient Mariner,' 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' on several levels." [...] Adam Sisman, in 2006, questioned the nature of the poem itself: [...] "No one even knows whether it is complete; Coleridge describes it as a 'fragment,' but there is a case for doubting this. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a poem at all. Hazlitt called it 'a musical composition' ... Though literary detectives have uncovered some of its sources, its remains difficult to say what the poem is about." [...] In describing the merits of the poem and its fragmentary state, he claimed, [...] "The poem stands for itself: beautiful, sensuous and enigmatic." [...] During the same year, Jack Stillinger claimed that [...] "Coleridge wrote only a few poems of the first rank – perhaps no more than a dozen, all told – and he seems to have taken a very casual attitude toward them ... he kept 'Kubla Khan' in manuscript for nearly twenty years before offering it to the public 'rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the grounds of any supposed poetic merits'". Harold Bloom, in 2010, argued that Coleridge wrote two kinds of poems and that [...] "The daemonic group, necessarily more famous, is the triad of The Ancient Mariner, Christabel, and 'Kubla Khan.'" [...] He goes on to explain the [...] "daemonic": [...] "Opium was the avenging daemon or alastor of Coleridge's life, his dark or fallen angel, his experiential acquaintance with Milton's Satan. Opium was for him what wandering and moral tale-telling became for the Mariner – the personal shape of repetition compulsion. The lust for paradise in 'Kubla Khan,' Geraldine's lust for Christabel – these are manifestations of Coleridge's revisionary daemonization of Milton, these are Coleridge's countersublime. Poetic genius, the genial spirit itself, Coleridge must see as daemonic when it is his own rather than when it is Milton's." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dom Sinacola of Slant Magazine said, [...] "More than that, it furthers {{the general}} {{message of the}} whole album, which is that for all his posturing and charm, Glover may not have it in him to {{participate}} in the kind of bacchanalia required of his position as a young, burgeoning, multi-talented rap star. Halfway between throwaway wordplay and trenchant comment about fame, the lyric says a lot about where Glover's head is at: As a former sketch comedian, writer on 30 Rock, and star of the sitcom Community, he leans on his wit as his most formidable weapon." [...] Philip Cosores of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "Yes, the dedication that Glover has seemingly displayed in the project is admirable. But he just doesn't seem to get music on this album. Maybe it's because of his taste, or because he is trying too hard to stand out, or because of his hubris, or because he has lost touch with reality, or <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> because of the internet." [...] Phillip Mlynar of Spin said, [...] "The only reaction that Because the Internet elicits is the uncontrollable urge to skip to the next song, in hopes that things couldn't possibly get any sloppier. But they do, beginning with the cod-wailing that blights [...] "Crawl" [...] and volleying with the psychedelic muzak of [...] "The Worst Guys" [...] (co-starring Chance the Rapper) and [...] "Zealots of Stockholm (Free Information)," [...] which sounds like Glover has inadvertently locked himself in his practice space and is attempting to muster up a loud enough mess so that some kindly passerby will hear his cries for help. As the album collapses into itself with the closing cut, [...] "Life: The Biggest Troll (Andrew Auernheimer)," [...] we're resigned to existence as a gloopy mess of random thoughts. [...] "Where's the line between Donny G and Gambino?" [...] the rapper muses, but it's unclear whether this is meant as a genuine identity crisis or an all-knowing middle finger to critics. Maybe the entire album is a meme itself, a grand existential joke critiquing the all-conquering rise of Internet culture by parodying its overwhelming randomness. Whatever it is, though, it's a bad rap record." ...|$|E
