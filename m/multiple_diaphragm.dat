The invention is a <b>multiple</b> <b>diaphragm</b> piezoresistive {{pressure sensor}} {{for measuring the}} pressure of a liquid, comprising an inner deformable diaphragm formed on a silicon substrate, the inner deformable diaphragm having a first thickness an outer deformable diaphragm formed on the silicon substrate, the outer deformable diaphragm having a second thickness which {{is greater than the}} first thickness, positioned below the inner deformable diaphragm to support the inner deformable diaphragm, a first piezoresistive bridge embedded in the inner deformable diaphragm, a second piezoresistive bridge embedded in the outer deformable diaphragm and possibly a third piezoresistive bridge embedded in the silicon substrate to compensate for temperature variations...|$|E
40|$|Micro-optical systems, that utilize {{multiple}} {{channels for}} imaging {{instead of a}} single one, are frequently discussed for ultra-compact applications such as digital cameras. The strategy of their fabrication differs due to different concepts of image formation. Illustrated by recently implemented systems for multi-aperture imaging, typical steps of wafer-level fabrication are discussed in detail. In turn, the made progress may allow for additional degrees of freedom in optical design. Pressing ahead with very short overall lengths and <b>multiple</b> <b>diaphragm</b> array layers, results {{in the use of}} extremely thin glass substrates down to 100 microns in thickness. The desire for a wide field of view for imaging has led to chirped arrays of microlenses and diaphragms. Focusing on imaging quality, aberrations were corrected by introducing toroidal lenslets and elliptical apertures. Such lenslets had been generated by thermal reflow of lithographic patterned photoresist and subsequent molding. Where useful, the system's performance can be further increased by applying aspheric microlenses from reactive ion etching (RIE) transfer or by achromatic doublets from superimposing two moldings with different polymers. <b>Multiple</b> <b>diaphragm</b> arrays prevent channel crosstalk. But using simple metal layers may lead to multiple reflections and an increased appearance of ghost images. A way out are low reflecting black matrix polymers that can be directly patterned by lithography. But in case of environmental stability and high resolution, organic coatings should be replaced by patterned metal coatings that exhibit matched antireflective layers like the prominent black chromium. The mentioned components give an insight into the fabrication process of multi-aperture imaging systems. Finally, the competence in each step decides on the overall image quality...|$|E

50|$|A passive air coupled {{diaphragm}} fitted {{over the}} array of digital drivers {{can act as a}} mechanical low pass filter. However, a sharp frequency cutoff is impossible, so significant ultrasonics would still be present. <b>Multiple</b> passive <b>diaphragms</b> could improve this, but would never remove all ultrasonics, and only add further to the system's already high cost and complexity.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA gridless {{variation}} of the cylindrical ion mirror {{has been designed to}} create an electric field that is nonlinear in the axial direction and nearly homogeneous in the radial direction. The designs may include one or two chambers that consist of truncated cones. This new design concept yields ion mirrors with improved energy focusing over conventional single-field and multiple-field mirrors. Conventionally, ion mirrors with nonlinear field gradient use <b>multiple</b> <b>diaphragm</b> electrodes to which distinct voltages are applied. In this work, optimized nonlinear field distributions are achieved through shaping only two or three electrodes and applying only one or two voltages on the electrodes. The designs presented here offer high resolving power and low ion dispersion.

40|$|In {{order to}} expand {{undergraduate}} education in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and nanotechnology, {{a series of}} sensors were designed {{with the intent of}} integrating the design process into the project portion of a micro/nano systems course. The majority of the design work was focused around piezoresistive, diaphragm-based pressure sensors, utilizing <b>multiple</b> <b>diaphragm</b> sizes and geometries. These sensors were chosen for their geometrical simplicity and their ability to be manufactured using available photolithographic techniques. In order to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} stress distribution in these sensors, leading to better design decisions, the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) technique was used. Results from this analysis were validated using analytical models available in the literature. Once this validation was accomplished, multiple iterations of FEA were performed in order to gain further understanding of the stress variation relative to diaphragm specifications. The results of these simulations were used to optimize the placement of the piezoresistors on the diaphragm and to assess the effect of process variation on the performance of the device. This analysis procedure aided in the design of pressure sensors with different sets of diaphragm geometries. The design and analysis procedures were documented and followed by students enrolled in the next offering of the course to design and analyze the sensor type of their choice...|$|E

Data are given on discharge and cycling characteristics, open-circuit potentials, polarization, internal resistance, temperature effects, self-discharge, and the mechanism of failure. Outputs as high as 2. 4 watt min/g (18 watt hr / lb) were observed and could be increased appreciably by minimizing cell weight. Electrode polarization was low, self-discharge rates high. The bromine-zinc storage battery is old in general concept (1), {{but there is little}} published information on it. The present study was undertaken to obtain realistic data on energy density, optimum power den-sity, cycling characteristics, and electrode polarization.

40|$|Advances in {{material}} technology have given carbon fiber composites a high strength and stiffness to weight ratios, making them an attractive resource for industry. However, manufacturing parts from sheets of composite laminate is difficult. A forming machine must prevent the laminates from draping over the tool to prevent thickness variations and supply the tensile and shear forces during forming to prevent part wrinkling. The machine must also {{allow for the}} easy loading of laminates and removal of formed parts. There are several methods of diaphragm forming in use, the most promising of which is inflated tool forming. Inflated tool forming relies on a diaphragm inflated around the tool to support the laminate during loading and apply forces during forming. Currently this process does not perform up to the industry's expectations. It may be improved by taking greater control over the diaphragm inflated around the tool. Three methods of diaphragm control were explored through experimentation: inflating <b>multiple</b> <b>diaphragms,</b> using dense fluid to inflate the diaphragm, an...|$|R
40|$|Background. To {{demonstrate}} the clinical features, diagnosis, {{and treatment of}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug- (NSAID-) induced diaphragm disease (DD). Methods. A literature search between January 1973 and August 2015 was undertaken. The clinical data of patients with NSAID-induced DD were recorded and analyzed. Results. 159 patients were included. The ratio of male to female was 1 [*]:[*] 2. 3; the mean age was 65 ± 11 years. The most common clinical manifestations were gastrointestinal bleeding and obstruction. 121 (84 %) patients took traditional NSAIDs. The durations of NSAIDs use ranged from 2 to 300 months. A majority (59. 7 %) of DD were seen in the small bowel, were seen secondly in the colon (30. 2 %), and were mainly located in the ileum (57. 9 %) and right colon (91. 7 %), respectively. 80 % of patients had <b>multiple</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> 41. 5 % of small bowel DD were diagnosed preoperatively by capsule endoscopy and/or double-balloon enteroscopy, 52. 1 % at laparotomy. Nearly 75 % of patients underwent surgery, endoscopic balloon dilation was performed in 22 patients, and NSAIDs were withdrawn in 53 patients. Conclusions. NSAID-induced DD is relatively rare. The small bowel is most commonly involved. Preoperative diagnosis of small bowel DD is relatively difficult. Discontinuation of the NSAIDs is recommended, surgical resection is the main treatment presently, and endoscopic balloon dilation {{should be considered as}} an alternative therapy...|$|R

40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} {{drugs are}} a common cause of intestinal injury. A variety of NSAID-induced injuries may occur including ulcers, erosions, colitis, strictures, and diaphragm disease. Diaphragm disease refers {{to the development of}} multiple thin, concentric, stenosing strictures in the intestine. Strictures occur most often in the midintestine and are thought to be pathognomonic of NSAID damage. They can lead to intermittent or complete bowel obstruction. Diagnosis may be elusive as there is nothing specific about NSAID-induced injury at endoscopy and histology is also nonspecific. Even at laparotomy, the diagnosis of diaphragm disease may be missed as the serosa may appear normal and strictures can be difficult to palpate. While most NSAID-induced lesions tend to resolve quickly following withdrawal of the offending drug, diaphragm-like strictures usually require intervention such as stricturoplasty or surgical resection of the involved segment of bowel. Here we report the case of a 60 -year-old male patient who presented with iron deficiency anaemia and recurrent subacute bowel obstruction. Following endoscopy and repeated CT scanning of his abdomen, he was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. He was treated with 5 -ASAs and immune suppression until a perforated duodenal ulcer resulted in emergency laparotomy and the subsequent discovery of <b>multiple</b> intestinal <b>diaphragms</b> attributable to long-standing NSAID use...|$|R
40|$|Panel SessionPg. 193 - 198 Special purpose {{machinery}} {{applications of}} flexible disc couplings with <b>multiple</b> convoluted <b>diaphragms</b> or disc packs {{at each end}} of the spacer are discussed. Couplings in this category were retrofitted on two compressor trains at a large ethylene plant. The couplings were a 44, 000 hp multiple convolution flexible disc coupling and a 25, 000 hp bolted disc pack flexible disc coupling. The installations were retrofits, as part of a program to uprate the compressor trains beyond the original mechanical ratings, at a minimum cost and with limited machine downtime. The user had overall engineering responsibility for selection of the type of coupling, and performance of the total installation. Selection of the coupling type, coordination meetings, design audits, quality control and installation procedures, and contingency plans were done with the full cooperation of the coupling, compressor, and turbine vendors. This resulted in uprating the trains with a high degree of reliability made possible by the careful application of these types of couplings. Based on experience gained from these installations, the following are problem areas: ? Multi-convolution coupling application ? Disc pack coupling application ? Quality control and installation procedures These comments are meant to convey experience with specific flexible membrane couplings, and to suggest considerations that may be applicable to them, and not to exclude other vendors, designs or circumstances that may be available or may result in different decisions or selections...|$|R
