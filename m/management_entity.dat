However, those plans were scuttled once planning for Staples Center (two miles directly up the street from the Sports Arena) were taking place, and the Clippers decided to become a tenant at Staples.|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of a minimum grazing lease rate in Hawai‘i is important for several reasons. First, it provides a means to adjust lease rate values according to fluctuations in livestock markets, or the rancher’s ability to pay, and agricultural land use values. Second, it provides a statewide standard that can easily be applied by state, federal, and private land <b>management</b> <b>entities,</b> and this will help to eliminate the large discrepancies that currently exist in statewide lease rates. Third, a minimum grazing lease rate provides a means for ranchers and land <b>management</b> <b>entities</b> to objectively determine {{the value of the}} land unit for grazing and the value of grazing for that land unit. Ranchers have a greater incentive to pay a higher lease rate if more services are provided or if the quality of the grazing unit is higher. On the other hand, land <b>management</b> <b>entities</b> must make decisions about the overall management of the land unit. They are more likely to choose grazing as a land management practice if the price or the services they receive provides a greater benefit than other alternative means of management.
