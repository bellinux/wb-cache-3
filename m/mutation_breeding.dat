25|$|Wheat {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} <b>mutation</b> <b>breeding,</b> with the use of gamma, x-rays, {{ultraviolet}} light, and sometimes harsh chemicals. The varieties of wheat created through these methods are in the hundreds (going as far back as 1960), more of them being created in higher populated countries such as China. Bread wheat with high grain iron and zinc content was developed through gamma radiation breeding. Modern bread wheat varieties have been cross-bred to contain greater amounts of gluten, which affords significant advantages for improving the quality of breads and pastas from a functional point of view. Gluten is appreciated for its unique viscoelastic properties. It gives elasticity to dough and is responsible for dough’s gas-retaining properties.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of gamma radiation in the formation, multiplication of callus and plant regeneration of P. vulgaris cultivar 'ICA Pijao' via indirect organogenesis. Seeds were irradiated with doses of 70 to 100 Gy and then it placed to in vitro germinate. From these, calli were formed and were regenerated. The number of germinated seeds was quantified and root length was measured. Callus formation in the number of explants that formed calli were recorded and fresh weight was determined at 21 days of culture as in multiplication. In plant regeneration, the number of shoots per callus and the number of shoots with roots were quantified and coloration that they had described. The application of gamma radiation on seeds from the lowest dose, induced a reduction in the percentage of explants with callus formation below 50 % compared to control unirradiated, fresh mass of the callus and the shoot regeneration were below 30 % compared to control, which showed values higher than 70 %.   Keywords: beans, in vitro <b>mutations,</b> <b>breeding,</b> gamma radiation, seed...|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{hybridization}} {{is difficult}} to carry out in roselle due to its cleistogamous nature of reproduction. Because of this, a <b>mutation</b> <b>breeding</b> programme was initiated to generate new genetic variability. The use of induced mutations for its improvement was initiated in 1999 in cooperation with MINT (now called Malaysian Nuclear Agency) and has produced some promising breeding lines. Roselle is a tetraploid species; thus, segregating populations require longer time to achieve fixation as compared to diploid species.

The best-documented mutation for muscle development in sheep is callipyge (CLPG), which causes a postnatal muscle hypertrophy that is localized to the pelvic limbs and loin. Enhanced skeletal muscle growth is also observed in animals with the Carwell (or rib-eye muscling) mutation, and a double-muscling phenotype has been documented for animals of the Texel sheep breed.

30|$|The 58  years-old KDML 105, {{selected}} from a widely adapted aromatic landrace found in the lowland rainfed area, has become an iconic rice cultivar since 1959. To continue its productivity into the next century, KDML was rigorously and carefully enriched for new traits using <b>mutation,</b> conventional <b>breeding,</b> and MABC while conserving its superb cooking quality and adaptive advantages in the lowland rainfed area. After 13  years of MABC, new generations of KDML backcross inbred lines were carefully developed by pyramiding six QTLs with six gene-specific alleles into KDML 105. Salt tolerance KDML Plus- 1 and Drought tolerance CSSLs are integrating into the HM 84. This newly emerging HM 84 will have advantages over KDML 105 in that affected area where bacterial leaf blight, blast, brown planthopper, and flooding are problems. With these adaptive advantages and superb cooking quality, the innovative KDML 105 will be more productive in the subsistence and pesticide-free lowland rainfed area.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{interaction}} between ion beam and biological cells {{has been studied}} to apply ion-beam-induced <b>mutation</b> to <b>breeding</b> of crops and gene transfer in cells. Formation of micro-craters has been observed after ion bombardment of plant cells and they are suspected to act as pathways for exogenous macromolecule transfer in the cells. A technique of in-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the ion beam line is being developed to observe ion bombardment effects on cell surface morphology during ion bombardment. A commercial AFM is designed to place inside the target chamber of the bioengineering ion beam line at Chiang Mai University. In order to allow the ion beam to properly bombard the sample without the risk of damaging the scanning tip and affecting normal operation of AFM, geometrical factors have been calculated for tilting the AFM with 35 degree from the normal. In order to avoid vibrations from external sources, mechanical designs have been done for a vibration isolation system. Construction and installation of the in-situ AFM facility to the beam line have been completed and are reported in details...|$|R

40|$|Porcine stress {{syndrome}} (PSS) is {{a genetic}} disorder {{caused by a}} recessive mutation in the halothane (HAL) gene and results in sudden death of pigs when placed under stress during transport and pre-slaughtering conditions.

However, natural <b>mutations,</b> spontaneous <b>breeding</b> between varieties and alien grain contamination can introduce undesir- able variability. NRVC 980385 is a temperate japonica rice cultivar (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) first regis- tered in Spain in 2002. In 2005 certification tests detected a plot differing from the original traits in terms of uniformity and height suggesting the pres- ence of a certain heterozygosis. This material was therefore seen as an opportunity to obtain newly stabilized doubled haploid (DH) lines which could compete in the Spanish short grain seed market. In this study, an in vitro anther culture protocol is defined which also covers the field tests selection to obtain four new, improved and stabilized DH derived lines ready to be registered for commercial proposes. This took just 4 years from the initial anther collection until new lines were grown in large scale field trials. Consequently, this protocol reduces the time for obtaining field assessed DH lines thereby having considerable advantages over other techniques by both maintaining the original registered cultivars and/or generating new derived varieties...|$|R
