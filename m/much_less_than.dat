Some 6,300 Jewish-owned businesses were liquidated before 1942, and 600 were Aryanized. Around 600 million Belgian francs was raised from the seizures, <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> anticipated.|$|E

The creation of leonine busts was considered repetitive and could be consigned to low calibre stonecutters, and Tamagnino was paid <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the average payment received by Cairano for artefacts of the same type.|$|E

Strong waves struck {{much of the}} East Coast of the United States, killing 2 and {{injuring}} numerous others. In 2011 the National Hurricane Center reported that Edouard had caused a total of US$20million with the greatest damage occurring on Cape Cod, where moderate wind gusts resulted in $4.6million (2007USD).|$|E

5|$|September 5, 2016 - Hurricane Hermine meanders off {{the coast}} of southeastern New York as a {{powerful}} extratropical cyclone. The state prepares for the storm's arrival during the long holiday weekend, but Hermine moved further east than forecasted and the impacts were <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> expected.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} passing of noble titles or ranks, {{inheritance}} practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property. Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune. Daughters received {{a portion of the}} family fortune through their marriage dowries, though this was usually <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will, but it is unclear how common this was.|$|E
5|$|Both stadia had {{approximately}} east-west alignment: the rugby {{ground to}} the north (Castle Street) end; the National Stadium to the south (Wood Street) end. The original capacity was 65,000 but {{this had to be}} reduced in later years to 53,000 for safety reasons. 11,000 of these were on the East Terrace and the conversion to all-seater stadium would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to 47,500. This capacity would have been <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> Twickenham and the other major rugby venues and also less than the demand for tickets to major events.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} with the tensions in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry had the support of the local church hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} repatriations, {{returned}} prisoners were generally treated with pity, suspicion and disdain by French civilians. Many {{believed that they}} had only been allowed to return in exchange for agreeing to collaborate. Later Vichy propaganda had implied that prisoners lived in good conditions, so many civilians believed that the prisoners had suffered <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> civilians during the conflict. As veterans of the 1940 Battle of France, the prisoners were blamed for the French defeat and portrayed as cowards who had surrendered, rather than fight to the death. They were also unfavourably compared with other men of their generation who {{had served in the}} Free French Forces or Resistance.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the busy preceding season, this season had much lower activity than usual, with only 36days {{in which there was}} a tropical storm or cyclone active; this was 17 less than normal. However, the number of days with a tropical cyclone was slightly above normal at 15. In general, the southern hemisphere as a whole had the least active season since 1954. There were only five named storms, only the fifth such time {{since the beginning of the}} satellite era in 1967. As most storms formed toward the eastern periphery of the basin, damage was <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> the preceding year.|$|E

Rainfall was <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> {{elsewhere in the}} typhoon's path, and a 24-hour total of 38.6mm (1.52in) was reported at Rota's airport. The storm inflicted heavy damage to crops and fisheries, and 60% of farmers reported a total loss. Chataan also damaged roads on the island, many due to fallen trees. Nine huts were destroyed, and damage was estimated at $2.7million.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the storm}} {{weakened}} considerably from its peak intensity, damage was <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> initially anticipated. In all, damages {{from the storm}} amounted to 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD). Three people {{were killed by the}} storm, all of whom were found in irrigation ditches. The first fatality was an 81-year-old man, the second was a 30-year-old man who lost control of his car and crashed into a ditch, and the last fatality was a 3-year-old boy who fell in a ditch near his home. Two 11-year-old boys, initially reported as missing, were later found in a ditch after being swept away by flood waters.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Roman {{army of the}} Principate (30 BC – 284 AD) {{underwent}} a significant transformation {{as a result of}} the chaotic 3rd century. Unlike the army of the Principate, the army of the 4th century was heavily dependent on conscription and its soldiers were paid <b>much</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> in the 2nd century. Barbarians from outside the empire probably supplied a much larger proportion of the late army's recruits than in the army of the 1st and 2nd centuries, but there is little evidence that this adversely affected the army's performance.|$|E
