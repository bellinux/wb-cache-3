5|$|Izuna 2 was {{released}} in several different containers. Sofmap, a Japanese retailer, released a collector's box depicting Izuna and Shino bathing in an onsen, <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> design of many eroge games. Each American release contained one of two pinup-styled mini-posters of Izuna. Copies of the game purchased through either GameStop or Amazon each included an additional, retailer-exclusive mini-poster.|$|E
5|$|Several weeks later, a despondent Mulder calls Scully {{to inform}} {{her that the}} X-Files have been shut down. Meanwhile, in a scene <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} to the pilot, the Smoking Man stores the alien fetus in the massive evidence room within the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Harris Wittels and {{directed}} by Alex Hardcastle. It featured stand-up comedian Louis C.K. in his third guest appearance as Dave Sanderson, a Pawnee police officer who develops a romantic interest in Leslie. The episode also featured a fictional sex scandal <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> real-life 2009 scandal of South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford.|$|E
50|$|The park {{features}} a layout that <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> neighboring Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. <b>The</b> brick sidewalks <b>mirror</b> <b>the</b> walls and nave {{of the cathedral}} while a semicircular colonnade featuring fountains <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> apse.|$|R
50|$|Looking {{through a}} mirror from {{different}} positions (but necessarily {{with the point}} of observation restricted to the halfspace {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>mirror)</b> is like looking at <b>the</b> 3D <b>mirror</b> image of space; without further <b>mirrors</b> only <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image of <b>the</b> halfspace before <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is relevant; if there is another <b>mirror,</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image of <b>the</b> other halfspace is too.|$|R
25|$|A {{plane mirror}} forms a virtual image {{positioned}} behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Although <b>the</b> rays of light {{seem to come}} from behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> light from <b>the</b> source only exists in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> image in a plane mirror is not magnified (that is, the image is {{the same size as}} the object) and appears to be as far behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as <b>the</b> object is in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in {{conflict}} with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> style of the original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built {{down the center of}} Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{may take}} its overall {{structure}} from traditional Italian commedia dell'arte, which sometimes featured a magus and his daughter, their supernatural attendants, {{and a number}} of rustics. The commedia often featured a clown known as Arlecchino (or his predecessor, Zanni) and his partner Brighella, who bear a striking resemblance to Stephano and Trinculo; a lecherous Neapolitan hunchback who corresponds to Caliban; and the clever and beautiful Isabella, whose wealthy and manipulative father, Pantalone, constantly seeks a suitor for her, thus <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> relationship between Miranda and Prospero.|$|E

50|$|For flat <b>mirrors,</b> <b>the</b> law of {{reflection}} implies that images of objects are upright {{and the same}} distance behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as <b>the</b> objects are in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> image size {{is the same as}} the object size. (The magnification of a flat mirror is equal to one.) The law also implies that mirror images are parity inverted, which is perceived as a left-right inversion.|$|R

5|$|The initial {{scale was}} {{developed}} by Saffir, a structural engineer, who in 1969 went on commission for the United Nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas. While performing the study, Saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. <b>Mirroring</b> <b>the</b> utility of the Richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1–5 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} {{to an extreme}} length of time is accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during the verses, by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. Partly {{as a result of}} the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic.|$|E
5|$|While making The Gold Rush, Chaplin {{married for}} the second time. <b>Mirroring</b> <b>the</b> {{circumstances}} of his first union, Lita Grey was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could {{have been charged with}} statutory rape under California law. He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924. Their first son, Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr., was born on 5 May 1925, followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926.|$|E

50|$|A mirror {{does not}} just produce {{an image of}} what would be there without it; it also changes the light {{distribution}} in the halfspace in front of and behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> A <b>mirror</b> hanging on <b>the</b> wall makes the room brighter because additional light sources appear in <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image. However, <b>the</b> appearance of additional light does not violate the conservation of energy principle, because some light no longer reaches behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> simply re-directs <b>the</b> light energy. In terms of the light distribution, <b>the</b> virtual <b>mirror</b> image has <b>the</b> same appearance and the same effect as a real, symmetrically arranged half-space behind a window (instead of <b>the</b> <b>mirror).</b> Shadows may extend from <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> into <b>the</b> halfspace before it, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Inkjet {{printers}} are {{not capable}} of printing white. So, anywhere that the image requires white, the garment's existing colour shows through. <b>The</b> <b>mirror</b> of <b>the</b> image is printed on the paper. When it is transferred, the result is <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> (<b>the</b> original) results. Inkjet transfer paper for dark garments is covered with transferable white ink. For dark garments, the image is printed without mirroring.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} light rail and urban {{streetcar}} {{projects have been}} proposed to extend or supplement service provided by Metro. Like the Silver Line in Virginia, the proposed Purple Line has been in planning since the 1980s. The project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of the Metrorail system, in a pattern roughly <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> Capital Beltway. The current proposal would create a light rail system in Maryland between the Bethesda and New Carrollton stations by way of Silver Spring and College Park. Such a plan would connect both branches of the Red Line to the Green and Orange Lines, and would decrease the travel time between suburban Metro stations.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|In 1700, the {{population}} of Ashton, the Tame Valley's main urban area, was an estimated 550. The town's 18th-century growth was fuelled by an influx {{of people from the}} countryside attracted by the prospect of work in its new industries, <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> rest of the region. In the early 19th century, Irish immigrants escaping from the Great Irish Famine were also drawn to the area by the new jobs created, The availability of jobs created by the growth of the textile industry in the town led to Ashton's population increasing by more than 400% between 1801 and 1861, from 6,500 to 34,886. The population dropped by 9% during the 1860s {{as a consequence of the}} cotton famine caused by the American Civil War. The table below details {{the population}} change since 1851, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E
50|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts the}} young artist (then twenty one) {{in the middle}} of a room, distorted by the use of a convex <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> hand in the foreground is greatly elongated and distorted by <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> work was painted on a specially-prepared convex panel in order to mimic the curve of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> used.|$|R

5|$|In {{its largest}} market, the U.S., the Lexus LS was the top-selling {{flagship}} luxury sedan for 15 {{of the first}} 17 years following its debut. In Japan, the next-largest market for the Lexus LS, {{the introduction of the}} 2007 LS 460 attracted 12,000 pre-orders, and the Lexus LS has gone on to sell successfully in its class. Following the introduction of the LS 460 and Lexus' expanded global launch in 2007, sales of the Lexus flagship have increasingly come from outside the brand's traditional U.S. strongholds. By 2007, the Lexus LS ranked second globally in flagship sales, next to the Mercedes-Benz S-Class' 85,500 units, with 71,760 Lexus LS sedans sold worldwide, and over half the total coming from outside the U.S. market. In 2008, U.S. sales fell 42% amidst the late-2000s recession, <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> overall decline of the luxury car market.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E
5|$|Journeys {{story is}} told wordlessly through {{gameplay}} and using cutscenes. The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins {{at the end of}} each area are stones at which the traveler rests; these stones give the traveler the vision of meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> player's journey. The player must also contend with the ancient automatons left over from a war which ended the civilization, and which still roam the city looking for intruders.|$|E
50|$|The Demon Sword of Rubis (Rubisu no Maken) is {{a device}} {{designed}} specifically for Makai to safely enter <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>the</b> Horror Karma is housed in. When thrown at <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> <b>the</b> Demon Sword, initially just a bell-shaped hilt, splits open and produces a small blade, which impales <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and creates a temporary portal into Karma's realm.|$|R

5|$|<b>Mirroring</b> <b>the</b> {{role that}} {{track and field}} events have at the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is {{featured}} within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among {{some of the first}} of these events to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932. The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them. Typically, track and field events are hosted at the main stadium of the games.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} riverbank, the route turns eastward {{to follow the}} eastern bank of the Schroon River through an undeveloped portion of Warrensburg comprising little more than forests. The route winds along the bank of river to the hamlet of Warrensburg, where the route becomes River Street and heads past several blocks of houses. At Alden Avenue, the route curves to the northeast, <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> curvature of the river through Warrensburg. It continues along the waterway to the junction of Ridge and River Streets, where NY418 turns north onto Richards Avenue and finally crosses the river on a truss bridge. The route meets Water Street (CR9) on {{the opposite}} bank before continuing northward past several commercial properties {{to the center of}} Warrensburg, where NY418 ends at an intersection with US9 (Main Street).|$|E
5|$|TCI's {{independence}} as {{a separate}} legal entity from its parent corporation ended in 1952, a century after {{the founding of the}} Sewanee Furnace Company, when the it became the Tennessee Coal & Iron Division of U. S. Steel. The memory of the historic importance of TCI was not lost when a short book to celebrate the Tennessee Company's centenary was published by U. S. Steel in 1960: Biography of a Business. Stagnation and decline began in 1962 when a majority of the mines in the Birmingham region were closed as domestic ores and coal were superseded by cheaper foreign products, especially from Venezuela. The 1970s and 80s brought about a downsizing and eventual consolidation of the Fairfield and Ensley works, <b>mirroring</b> <b>the</b> general decline of heavy industry in the USA throughout those decades.|$|E
50|$|The {{observer}} sees <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> {{covered in}} a pattern of stripes that reveal the shape of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> pattern is compared to a mathematically generated diagram (usually done on a computer today) of what it should look like for a given figure.
