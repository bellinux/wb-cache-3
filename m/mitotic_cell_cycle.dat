40|$|Development of a fertilized {{human egg}} into an average sized adult {{requires}} about 29 trillion cell divisions, thereby producing enough DNA to stretch to the Sun and back 200 times (DePamphilis and Bell, 2011) ! Even more amazing {{is the fact that}} throughout these <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cycles,</b> the human genome is duplicated once and only once each time a cell divides. If a cell accidentally begins to re-replicate its nuclear DNA prior to cell division, checkpoint pathways trigger apoptosis. And yet, some cells are developmentally programmed to respond to environmental cues by switching from <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> to endocycles, a process in which multiple S phases occur in the absence of either mitosis or cytokinesis. Endocycles allow production of viable, differentiated, polyploid cells that no longer proliferate. What is surprising is that among the 516 (Manning et al., 2002) to 557 (BioMart web site) protein kinases encoded by the human genome, only eight regulate nuclear DNA replication directly. These are Cdk 1, Cdk 2, Cdk 4, Cdk 6, Cdk 7, Cdc 7, Chk 1 and Chk 2. Even more remarkable is the fact that only four of these enzymes (Cdk 1, Cdk 7, Cdc 7 and Chk 1) are essential for mammalian development. Here we describe how these protein kinases determine when DNA replication occurs during <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cycles,</b> how mammalian <b>cells</b> switch from <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> to endocycles, and how cancer cells can be selectively targeted for destruction by inducing them to begin a second S phase before mitosis is complete...|$|R
40|$|Trophoblast stem (TS) cells proliferate in the {{presence}} of fibroblast growth factor 4, but in its absence, they differentiate into polyploid trophoblast giant (TG) cells that remain viable but nonproliferative. Differentiation is coincident with expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) -specific inhibitors p 21 and p 57, of which p 57 is essential for switching from <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> to endocycles. Here, we show that, in the absence of induced DNA damage, checkpoint kinase- 1 (CHK 1), an enzyme essential for preventing mitosis in response to DNA damage, functions as a mitogen-dependent protein kinase that prevents premature differentiation of TS cells into TG cells by suppressing expression of p 21 and p 57, but not p 27, the CDK inhibitor that regulates <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cycles.</b> CHK 1 phosphorylates p 21 and p 57 proteins at specific sites, thereby targeting them for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. TG cells lack CHK 1, and restoring CHK 1 activity in TG cells suppresses expression of p 57 and restores mitosis. Thus, CHK 1 is part of a “G 2 restriction point” that prevents premature <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> exit in <b>cells</b> programmed for terminal differentiation, a role that CHK 2 cannot play...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the time course of}} protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the meiotic <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> of Xenopus laevis oocytes and the <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> of Xenopus eggs. We have identified two proteins that undergo marked changes in tyrosine phosphorylation during these processes: a 42 -kDa protein related to mitogen-activated protein kinase or microtubule-associated protein- 2 kinase (MAP kinase) and a 34 -kDa protein identical or related to p 34 cdc 2. p 42 undergoes an abrupt increase in its tyrosine phosphorylation at the onset of meiosis 1 and remains tyrosine phosphorylated until 30 min after fertilization, at which point it is dephosphorylated. p 42 also becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after microinjection of oocytes with partially purified M-phase-promoting factor, even in the presence of cycloheximide. These findings suggest that MAP kinase, previously implicated in the early responses of somatic cells to mitogens, is also activated at the onset of meiotic M phase and that MAP kinase can become tyrosine phosphorylated downstream from M-phase-promoting factor activation. We have also found that p 34 goes through a cycle of tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation prior to meiosis 1 and mitosis 1 but is not detectable as a phosphotyrosyl protein during the 2 nd through 12 th <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cycles.</b> It may be that the delay between assembly and activation of the cyclin-p 34 cdc 2 complex that p 34 cdc 2 tyrosine phosphorylation provides is not needed in <b>cell</b> <b>cycles</b> that lack G 2 phases.

To examine the expression pattern and function of CDC 25 inCaenorhabditis elegans, we characterized acdc 25 homolog,cdc- 25. 1, during early embryonic development. The CDC- 25. 1 protein localizes to oocytes, embryonic nuclei, and embryonic cortical membranes.

At the M phase of the embryonic <b>cell</b> <b>cycle,</b> Cdc 2 phosphorylates Myt 1 on Thr 478 and thereby creates a docking site for Plx 1.

Finally, and interestingly, Myt 1 is phosphorylated on Thr 478 even during the meiotic <b>cell</b> <b>cycle,</b> but its interaction with Plx 1 is largely inhibited by p 90 rsk-mediated phosphorylation.

40|$|Primary human {{fibroblasts}} arrest {{growth in}} response to the inhibition of mitosis by mitotic spindle-depolymerizing drugs. We show that the mechanism of mitotic arrest is transient and implicates a decrease in the expression of cdc 2 /cdc 28 kinase subunit Homo sapiens 1 (CKsHs 1) and a delay in the metabolism of cyclin B. Primary human fibroblasts infected with a retroviral vector that drives the expression of a mutant p 53 protein failed to downregulate CKsHs 1 expression, degraded cyclin B despite the absence of chromosomal segregation, and underwent DNA endoreduplication. In addition, ectopic expression of CKsHs 1 interfered with the control of cyclin B metabolism by the <b>mitotic</b> spindle <b>cell</b> <b>cycle</b> checkpoint and resulted in a higher tendency to undergo DNA endoreduplication.

Specific inhibition of Nek 2 B function does not interfere with the oscillation of Cdc 2 activity in either the meiotic or <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> cycles; however, it does cause abortive cleavage of early embryos, in which bipolar spindle formation is severely impaired due to fragmentation or dispersal of the centrosomes, to which endogenous Nek 2 B protein localizes. In contrast, inhibition of Nek 2 B function does not affect meiotic spindle formation in oocytes, in which functional centrosomes are absent. Thus, strikingly, Nek 2 B is specifically required for centrosome assembly and/or maintenance (and hence for normal bipolar spindle formation and cleavage) in early Xenopus embryos. Finally, (ectopic) Nek 2 A but not Nek 2 B is very labile in cleaving embryos, suggesting that Nek 2 A cannot replace the centrosomal function of Nek 2 B in early embryos...|$|R

Over methylation of a chromosome can cause certain genes that are necessary for normal cell function, to become inactivated.
