40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to outline {{the development of a}} novel rotationally moulded solar water heater. It will describe the underlying principles that make the system unique and conclude with the industrial development of a commercial version of the heater. The solar water heater is of the integral collector-storage type. The most unique feature of the water heater is that the collector glazing system also forms a transparent upper surface of the storage tank. The highly efficient top cover system provides the maximum possible use of available solar radiation, although some penalty is imposed through relatively large night time heat losses. The top cover system is a prime consideration in this thesis and the principles of solar transmission and thermal insulation are discussed in detail. Mains pressure hot water supply is achieved by passing the mains pressure cold water through a finned heat exchange tube that is submerged in the water storage chamber. The water exits the tube at a temperature close to that of the stored heat transfer medium in the collector/storage chamber. Careful consideration was given to design of the heat exchange circuit to optimise extraction of energy from the solar water heater. The collector is composed of three main components that have been developed to suit manufacturing from plastic using the rotational moulding process. The absorber/storage component houses the heat exchange tube, inner glazing and 150 litres of water which is heated by solar radiation. The top cover houses the upper transparent insulation, the outer glazing and provides additional side insulation. A <b>mounting</b> <b>tray</b> that facilitates permanent attachment of the collector assembly to the roof of a dwelling or suitable intermediate framework is the final component. The heater is now ready for production and is an Australian and New Zealand Standards, AS/NZS 2712 - 2002 approved system...|$|E

The exposure of identical thermal coatings on both the {{leading and trailing edges}} of the LDEF and the additional modified exposure of identical coatings under glass windows and metallic covers in each of the flight modules provided multiple combinations of space environmental exposure to the coatings and the contaminant collector mirrors.

Two identical flight units were fabricated for the LDEF mission, each of which included twenty-five thermal control coatings mounted in isolated compartments, each with an adjacent contaminant collector mirror mounted on the wall. The covers of the flight units included apertures for each compartment, exposing the thermal coatings directly to the space environment. Six of these compartments were sealed with ultraviolet-grade transmitting quartz windows and four other compartments were sealed with aluminum covers.

40|$|One of the {{benefits}} of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) was the opportunity to study the before and after effects of low earth orbit space environment on the spacecraft thermal control coatings. Since the LDEF's thermal control was totally passive by design, the selection of the external surface absorptivity to emissivity ratio (alpha/epsilon) and the ability for the coating to retain the alpha/epsilon over time was an important consideration in the thermal design of the LDEF. The primary surface coating chosen for the LDEF structure was clear chromic anodized aluminum with an average design alpha/epsilon of 0. 32 / 0. 16. External surface absorptivity (alpha) and emissivity (epsilon) were measured on all intercostals, longerons, <b>tray</b> <b>mounting</b> flanges, thermal control panels, and a limited number of experiment surface coatings after the experiment trays were removed from the LDEF structure. All surface alpha/epsilon measurements were made using portable hand held infrared and solar spectrum reflectometers. The absorptivity measurements were taken with a Devices and Services SSR-ER version 5. 0 solar spectra reflectometer which has a stated uncertainty of +/- 0. 01, and all normal emissivity measurements were made using the Gier Dunkle DB- 100 infrared reflectometer also with a stated uncertainty of +/- 0. 01. Both instruments were calibrated in the laboratory by LaRC instrumentation personnel before being used in the field at KSC. A combined total of 733 measurements were taken on the anodized aluminum hardware which included the structure (intercostals, longerons, and center ring), earth and space end thermal control panels, and experiment <b>tray</b> <b>mounting</b> flanges. The facility thermal control coatings measured in this survey cover 33 percent of the total exposed LDEF surface area. To correlate low earth orbit environmental effects on the anodized coatings, measurements were taken in both exposed and unexposed surfaces and compared to quality assurance (QA) measurements taken on the new surfaces at the time of hardware fabrication in 1978. The results of investigation are presented...|$|R

Orthotropic stiffnesses for this panel were obtained from finely detailed statically loaded tray SPAR models in which stiffness coupling was accounted for along with partial relative sliding allowed by the tray clamping attachments. Joint boundary conditions were also significant in the structural dynamic modeling of LDEF, and static data proved valuable in assessing modeling of local end fittings...|$|R

40|$|For 346 {{days after}} the {{deployment}} of the LDEF satellite on April 7, 1984, the tape recorder belonging to the Interplanetary Dust Experiment (DE) stored information on over 15, 000 impacts made by submicron and larger-size particles on its metal oxide silicon (MOS) detectors. These detectors were <b>mounted</b> on <b>trays</b> facing in six orthogonal directions - LDEF ram and trailing edge, the poles of the LDEF orbit (north and south), and radially inward (towards the Earth) and outward (towards space). The 13. 1 second time resolution provided by the IDE electronics, combined with the high sensitivity of the MOS detectors and large collecting area (approximately 1 sq. m) of the experiment, conclusively showed that the small particle environment at the LDEF altitude of 480 km was highly time-variable, with particle fluxes spanning over four orders of magnitude. A large number of the 15, 000 impacts recorded by IDE occurred in groups, which were of two types - the spikes, single, isolated events of high intensity and the multiple orbit event sequences (MOES), which were series of events separated in time by integer multiples of the LDEF orbital period. Even though the spikes were generally more intense, the MOES could be quite long-lived, some lasting for many days. A previous paper by Cooke et al. attributed the MOES to impacts by man-made debris particles in orbits intersecting that of LDEF. The 20 day longevity {{of one of these}} events - termed the May Swarm - led to the suggestion that the debris particles must be con- stantly replenished by their source, as the orbits of micron sized particles will rapidly decay under the influence of radiation pressure and other non-gravitational forces, entering Earth's atmosphere after only a few revolutions. However, the date of onset of the May Swarm (May 22) and the long duration of this event may indicate a possible correlation with the annual Arietid meteor shower, which peaks around June 8. As this seemed to hold the promise of a less artificial explanation than a satellite or rocket body continuously dribbling debris, it was decided to take a fresh look at parts of the IDE data set in an attempt to detect meteor showers within the impact record...|$|R
5000|$|Many Midland Electric {{vehicles}} were classified by their payload, which {{was measured in}} hundredweights, and this usage has been retained in the article. A hundredweight is one twentieth of a long ton or 51kg, and is abbreviated to [...] "cwt". Midland Electric Vehicles was established in 1935 and was based in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. They supplied chassis to both the Birmingham and Wolverhampton divisions of the Midland Counties Dairy in 1936, and the first production vehicle probably went to the Wolverhampton division, whose ride-on fleet of milk floats consisted almost entirely of Midland vehicles, apart from some bought elsewhere {{during the war years}} and some pedestrian controlled vehicles. The chassis were supplied with a dashboard and glass for the windscreen, but the bodywork was built by the Wolverhampton bodyshop at Midland Counties Dairy, and their basic design remained unchanged until the demise of Midland Electric. The first design was a 10-15 cwt chassis, which was launched to the wider world in January 1937. It was designed by J Parker Garner, who at the time was a well-known designer, having been involved in the manufacturing of vehicles for a number of years. Its chassis was made from channel section steel, with cross bracing and a dropped section at the front, in order to give a low floor height for the cab. The doorways were behind the front wheels, and were not fitted with doors, although doors were available as an option. The height from the roadway to the cab floor was just 10 in, and such a low height was desirable {{because of the number of}} times a driver would have to enter and leave the cab while delivering bread or milk. The batteries were <b>mounted</b> in <b>trays</b> on either side of the vehicle, which could be slid out on rollers for maintenance, or to exchange the battery if it was required to do more than one round in a day. The batteries fed a 60-volt motor, and a series-parallel controller gave three forward and reverse speeds. Transmission was by a layrub shaft to an overhead worm driven rear axle. The bodywork was designed so that any panel could be easily removed and replaced if it became damaged.|$|R
