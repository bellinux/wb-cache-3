5|$|Before the Eighty Years' War began, people {{realized}} that the West Indies trade might bring great prosperity {{to the country and}} that more power might be developed against Spain. Rather than travel to the area singly on an armed ship or {{in the company of a}} few other vessels, traders could do business in the manner of the large and prosperous East India Company. A company for carrying on commerce in the West Indies and Africa could be organized, which <b>might,</b> <b>like</b> the sister company, act as the war-waging power in those parts and be supported by the treasury, ships, and troops of the United Netherlands.|$|E

Barlow was one of several prominent South African cricketers already booked to play. Sobers was initially noncommittal, but decided to go following assurances that Rhodesia did not practise apartheid and there would be no racial discrimination regarding team selection. Sobers' intended participation became public on 7 September when a London newspaper reported on it; widespread condemnation of the West Indian captain followed, but he still travelled, landing in Salisbury early on the day of the event.|$|E

5|$|James Nesbitt and {{his agent}} {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of Murphy's Law. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, she offered him a script for Jekyll, suggesting that he <b>might</b> <b>like</b> the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because it was such an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde {{to be able to walk}} around in public without attracting attention.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, one <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to have {{a direct}} {{definition}} of the cotangent space {{without reference to the}} tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of equivalence classes of smooth functions on M. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions f and g are equivalent at a point x if they have the same first-order behavior near x, analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions f and g have the same first order behaviour near x if and only if the derivative of the function f-g vanishes at x. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near x.|$|E
25|$|This Chinese massive voyages was {{not merely}} a naval exploration, {{but it was a}} show of power and a display of geopolitical reach. The Chinese Ming dynasty had {{recently}} overthrown the Mongols Yuan dynasty, and were eager to establish their hegemony in the world, which changed the geopolitical balance in Asia. Chinese intervened in the politics of the southern seas by supporting Thais against the declining Khmer Empire, support and installing allied factions in India, Sri Lanka and other places in Indian Ocean coasts. However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established Sultanate of Malacca, as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java. Previously, Majapahit has succeed to assert its influence in Malacca strait by contained the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical <b>might</b> <b>like</b> those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in the region that finally reduced only in Java sea and eastern Indonesian waters.|$|E

25|$|Edward Perry Warren {{first saw}} Lewes House in 1889 {{and with his}} partner John Marshall they were prodigious {{collectors}} of fine antique sculpture there. Eric Gill was introduced to Warren by Roger Fry and the stone carving Ecstasy purchased, which {{is now in the}} Tate Gallery collection. William Rothenstein suggested that Warren <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to acquire Rodin's new sculpture The Kiss and after several visits, in 1904 the Lewes Kiss arrived at Lewes House. In 1906 Rodin requested that Warren lend The Kiss to an important exhibition in Regent Street, London. This made it famous in Britain for the first time. The Kiss was returned to the stables at Lewes House, where it remained until 1914 until offered to Lewes Town Council. It was placed in the Town Hall, at the South End of the Assembly Room on 2 December 1914. Early in 1915, The Kiss was wrapped in canvas and marked off with a guard rail. The Town Council returned the statue, saying only that the room did 'not lend itself to such a noble piece of statuary.' On 26 February 1917, The Kiss was once more taken to the stable block where it was to remain until Warren's death in 1928. After a short period on loan to Cheltenham, The Kiss was purchased in 1953 by public subscription and {{is now one of the}} Tate's most popular attractions.|$|E

Phares concluded that the song was [...] "a subversive, influential classic" [...] and [...] "one of new wave's most distinctive and innovative moments. [...] " [...] The song has been covered by many artists, among them are Queens of the Stone Age and Amanda Blank. The song [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)", their highest-charting single, was reportedly written {{as a response to}} Michael Jackson's hit song [...] "Billie Jean", but can also be seen as a tribute to women who have experienced traumatizing events. Iyall also wrote songs that touched on themes like social alienation ("Undercover Kept") and generation gaps ("Chinatown").|$|E
500|$|In early 1949 McKenzie {{started writing}} to Albert Einstein. Her first letter to him wished him a speedy {{recovery}} from recent illness.

Some accounts claim that McKenzie corresponded regularly with Einstein for as long as 15 years before his death in 1955, but the documentary record suggests such reports exaggerate the extent of the correspondence. She also sent him several gifts over the years including shells (for his daughter) that airmen would collect across the Pacific on her request and a boomerang which had been brought to her from Central Australia by an airline pilot. She wrote that, [...] "Some of your mathematical friends <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to plot its flight!"

500|$|An {{architect}} friend {{suggested that}} she <b>might</b> <b>like</b> to try [...] "landscape gardening" [...] (the term used at the time for landscape architecture) a field in which Beatrix Jones Farrand had become a female pioneer during the 1890s. Coffin {{may also have been}} influenced by her uncle Benjamin Church, who had worked under Frederick Law Olmsted on the creation of Central Park in New York City. Women at the time were looking beyond the traditional female careers of school teacher, nurse and office clerk, but relatively few educational institutions admitted them to study in male-dominated fields such as architecture or horticulture. One of the exceptions was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which had begun admitting women in 1870, only nine years after its establishment. Coffin applied there but was initially refused entry, as she was not qualified to meet the admission requirements due to her lack of a formal education. However, several of the key faculty members were sympathetic and encouraged her to persevere. She undertook intensive tuition in mathematics and enrolled at MIT in 1901 as a special student, one of four women enrolled on the architecture course and one of two studying landscape architecture. The four women on the course were the only female members of a 500-strong student body.|$|E
