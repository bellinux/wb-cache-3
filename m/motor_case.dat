50|$|One of {{the areas}} was the {{attachment}} ring where the SRBs {{are connected to the}} external tank. Areas of distress were noted in some of the fasteners where the ring attaches to the SRB <b>motor</b> <b>case.</b> This situation was attributed to the high loads encountered during water impact. To correct the situation and ensure higher strength margins during ascent, the attach ring was redesigned to encircle the <b>motor</b> <b>case</b> completely (360 degrees). Previously, the attachment ring formed a 'C' shape and encircled the <b>motor</b> <b>case</b> just 270 degrees.Additionally, special structural tests were performed on the aft skirt. During this test program, an anomaly occurred in a critical weld between the hold-down post and skin of the skirt. A redesign was implemented to add reinforcement brackets and fittings in the aft ring of the skirt.|$|E

As the <b>motor</b> <b>cases</b> are normally filament wound, embedding high strength fibres in a resin matrix whose strength and percentage elongation at failure are very much lower than that of the fibres, cracking of resin matrix take place under stress, at a stress value 13; very much below the design stress.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{a study of the}} {{variation}} of three-phase induction machines' input impedance with frequency are proposed. A range of motors were analysed, both two-pole and four-pole, and the magnitude and phase of the input impedance were obtained over a wide frequency range of 20 Hz- 1 MHz. For test results that would be useful in the prediction of the performance of induction machines during typical use, a test procedure was developed to represent closely typical three-phase stator coil connections when the induction machine is driven by a three-phase inverter. In addition, tests were performed with the <b>motor's</b> <b>cases</b> both grounded and not grounded. The results of the study show that all induction machines of the type considered exhibit a multiresonant impedance profile, where the input impedance reaches at least one maximum as the input frequency is increased. Furthermore, the test results show that the grounding of the <b>motor's</b> <b>case</b> has a significant effect on the impedance profile.

In March 2004, IAI awarded a $78 million production contract to Boeing; the total contract value could exceed $225 million through second quarter 2008.

50|$|Two Thiokol solid-propellant motors powered the Pershing 1 missile. Since a solid-propellant motor {{cannot be}} turned off, the missile used thrust {{reversal}} and case venting for selective range. Splice bands and explosive bolts attached the rocket motors. The missile {{was controlled by}} an analog guidance computer using a ball-and-disk integrator and a control computer. As directed by the onboard computers, the bolts exploded and ejected the splice band. Another squib would open the thrust reversal ports in the forward end of the stage and ignite the propellant in the forward end, causing the motor to reverse direction. Testing found that the second stage would draft behind the warhead and cause it to drift off course, so explosive charges {{on the side of}} the motor opened the case and vented the propellant. The range could be graduated but the maximum was 740 km. Jet vanes in the motor nozzles and air vanes on the <b>motor</b> <b>case</b> steered the missile. The onboard analog guidance computer and the Eclipse-Pioneer ST-120 (Stable Table-120) inertial navigation system provided guidance. The warhead could be conventional explosive or a W50 nuclear weapon with three yield options— the Y1 with 60 kiloton yield, Y2 with 200 kiloton yield and Y3 with 400 kiloton yield; the conventional warhead was never deployed.|$|E
5000|$|The DC motor was the {{mainstay}} of electric traction drives on both electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. It consists of two parts, a rotating armature and fixed field windings surrounding the rotating armature mounted around a shaft. The fixed field windings consist of tightly wound coils of wire fitted inside the <b>motor</b> <b>case.</b> The armature is another set of coils wound round a central shaft and {{is connected to the}} field windings through [...] "brushes" [...] which are spring-loaded contacts pressing against an extension of the armature called the commutator. The commutator collects all the terminations of the armature coils and distributes them in a circular pattern to allow the correct sequence of current flow. When the armature and the field windings are connected in series, the whole motor is referred to as [...] "series-wound". A series-wound DC motor has a low resistance field and armature circuit. Because of this, when voltage is applied to it, the current is high due to Ohm's law. The advantage of high current is that the magnetic fields inside the motor are strong, producing high torque (turning force), so it is ideal for starting a train. The disadvantage is that the current flowing into the motor has to be limited, otherwise the supply could be overloaded or the motor and its cabling could be damaged. At best, the torque would exceed the adhesion and the driving wheels would slip. Traditionally, resistors were used to limit the initial current.|$|E

5000|$|Released in December 2010, the Traxxas Spartan {{is a new}} {{single drive}} Radio-controlled boat. The Spartan {{represents}} Traxxas' first all-new boat design in several years. Like the Villain series, it is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek [...] "deep V" [...] style hull. Unlike the Villain series, the Spartan is significantly longer (by 9.8 inches) and has a slightly wider beam (by 1.25 inches), which combine to give the Spartan a much sleeker overall profile. The Spartan also has an abundance of modern features which set it apart from earlier Traxxas boats. The most noticeable is Traxxas' new marine version of its Castle Powered Velineon brushless system, consisting of the new VXL-6s brushless ESC, and Velineon 540XL (1410 castle motor)brushless motor. Both the ESC and the motor are water-cooled, with the motor featuring a unique sealed composite water jacket that allows cooling water to directly contact the <b>motor</b> <b>case,</b> rather than the simple coiled metal tubing water jackets used on other Traxxas boats. The drive system is also {{a departure from the}} steerable outdrive system (the prop and rudder are one unit and are steered together) traditionally used on Traxxas boats. Instead, power on the Spartan is routed via direct drive (no reduction gears) to a single fixed surface piercing prop and steering is controlled by an aluminum rudder operated by a high torque waterproof servo. The Spartan is also uses Traxxas' 2.4GHz radio system (a first on Traxxas boats) with a 5-channel receiver located inside a watertight box. Other notable features include stainless steel trim tabs and turn fins (which help improve stability and turning performance), Traxxas high current battery connectors, 12 gauge power wire, and stainless steel hex hardware. The claimed top speed is 30 mi/h kn with the included dual 8.4 volt NiMH batteries. However, the top speed rises to 50 mi/h kn with optional double 3S LiPo battery packs, which Traxxas claims as the fastest top speed for any RTR (ready to race) radio controlled boat.|$|E
