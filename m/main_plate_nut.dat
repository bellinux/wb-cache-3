50|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>nut,</b> {{also known}} as a <b>nut</b> <b>plate,</b> anchor <b>nut</b> or anchor <b>plate,</b> is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is {{internally}} threaded and a plate with two clearance holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} concordance {{with the}} New American Plate guideline {{that no more}} than one-third of one's plate be covered with foods of animal origin in Guatemalan schoolchildren. Methods: Dietary intake data collected with a 24 -h pictorial diary in a convenience sample of 449 third- and fourth-grade schoolchildren were inspected. The weights of animal and vegetable items in each meal were calculated with respect to the food on the <b>main</b> <b>plate</b> and all elements of the meal. The percentage of animal contribution to the meal was tabulated by repast and by social group and gender and compared with the suggested limit of < 33 %. Results: Twenty-nine percent of the food depicted on <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> was of animal origin at lunch and 35 % at dinner, considering all subjects using plates; 24 % of all food consumed at the lunch meal was of animal origin, as was 28 % at dinner. Sixty-eight percent of children were concordant with the < 33 % limit on animal-origin foods served on <b>main</b> <b>plates</b> at lunch, as were 60 % with the dinner <b>main</b> <b>plates.</b> Expanding to the whole meal, concordance with the < 33 % criterion increased to 73 % at lunch and 67 % at dinner. Conclusions: In general, the habitual modes of consumption of these schoolchildren are compatible with a predominantly plant-based diet. The food consumed away from the <b>main</b> <b>plate</b> is principally of vegetal origin and needs to be accounted for in guidance for overall healthful eating. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this investigation a ferrocement roof truss {{has been designed}} which are of low in cost, light in weight and easy to maintain. The first step of design involves the calculation of dead load using IS 875 (part- 1) and wind load using IS 875 (part- 3) - 1987.

After designing all the sections, the truss is constructed. A 6 -mm diameter circular coil is used as reinforcing material for construction and angles of desired shape are made to hold the sections in position. Hexagonal wire mesh or chicken mess is cut into required sizes and are placed over the reinforced skeleton of the section. Conventional mortar of cement sand ratio of 1 : 2 is prepared.

The fatigue tests were performed in three point bending at the <b>main</b> <b>plate</b> under constant amplitude loading, with a stress ratio of R = 0. 05 and a frequency of 7 Hz. Fatigue results are presented in the form of nominal stress range versus fatigue life (S–N) curves obtained from the as welded joints and the TIG dressing joints at the welded toe. These results were compared with the ones obtained in repaired joints, where TIG and plasma dressing were applied at the welded toes, containing fatigue cracks with a depth of 3 – 5 mm in the <b>main</b> <b>plate</b> and through the plate thickness. A deficient repair was obtained by TIG dressing, caused by the excessive depth of the crack. A reasonable fatigue life benefits were obtained with plasma dressing. Good results were obtained with the TIG dressing technique for specimens with shallower initial defects (depth lesser than 2. 5 mm). The fatigue life benefits were presented in terms of a gain parameter assessed using both experimental data and life predictions based on the fatigue crack propagation law...|$|R

40|$|Nonlinear {{buckling}} behaviour of a thin-walled simply-supported stiffened {{panel that}} has uniformly spaced longitudinal stiffeners is studied. The structure {{is made from}} a linear elastic, isotropic and homogeneous material. The panel is subjected to pure compression applied at the centroid of whole cross-section. In such structures, the nonlinear interaction can occur between a global (Euler) buckling and local plate (i. e. the stiffener or the <b>main</b> <b>plate)</b> buckling modes. The interactive buckling behaviour is usually more unstable than when the modes are triggered individually. This {{can lead to a}} significant reduction of the load-carrying capacity. The current work focuses on the case where the stiffening is only {{on one side of the}} <b>main</b> <b>plate.</b> An analytical model of a perfect thin-walled stiffened plate is formulated based on variational principles by minimizing the total potential energy. The equations of equilibrium are then solved numerically using the continuation and bifurcation software Auto to determine the post-buckling behaviour. Cellular buckling (or snaking) is revealed analytically in such a component arising from nonlinear local global interactive buckling, perhaps for the first time. In addition, the effect of varying the rigidity at the <b>main</b> <b>plate</b> -stiffener junction is studied; a rapid erosion of the cellular buckling response is revealed by increasing the joint rigidity. The initial model is then developed by including more degrees of freedom within the stiffened panel and the introduction of global and local imperfections. The results from the analytical model are validated by the finite element (FE) method using the commercial software Abaqus as well as by comparing against some experimental results taken from the literature. To obtain a greater understanding of the drivers of the structural behaviour, parametric studies are conducted for a variety of different plate and stiffener geometries as well as an investigation into the heightened sensitivity to geometric imperfections. The worst forms of local imperfection are identified in terms of the initial amplitude, number of waves and the degree of localization. The imperfection sensitivity and the parametric studies are conducted for two limiting cases, where the main plate- stiffener joint is assumed to be fully pinned or fully rigid. A framework for establishing the zone where structural designers need to consider mode interaction carefully is presented. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|A new GPS-derived surface {{velocity}} {{field for the}} central Andean backarc permits an assessment of orogenic wedge deformation across the southern Subandes of Bolivia, where recent studies suggest that great earthquakes (>Mw 8) are possible. We find that the backarc is not isolated from the <b>main</b> <b>plate</b> boundary seismic cycle. Rather, signals from subduction zone earthquakes contaminate the velocity field at distances greater than 800 [*]km from the Chile trench. Two new wedge-crossing velocity profiles, corrected for seasonal and earthquake affects, reveal distinct regions that reflect (1) locking of the <b>main</b> <b>plate</b> boundary across the high Andes, (2) the location of and loading rate {{at the back of}} orogenic wedge, and (3) an east flank velocity gradient indicative of décollement locking beneath the Subandes. Modeling of the Subandean portions of the profiles indicates along-strike variations in the décollement locked width (WL) and wedge loading rate; the northern wedge décollement has a WL of ~ 100 [*]km while accumulating slip at a rate of ~ 14 [*]mm/yr, whereas the southern wedge has a WL of ~ 61 [*]km and a slip rate of ~ 7 [*]mm/yr. When compared to Quaternary estimates of geologic shortening and evidence for Holocene internal wedge deformation, the new GPS-derived wedge loading rates may indicate that the southern wedge is experiencing a phase of thickening via reactivation of preexisting internal structures. In contrast, we suspect that the northern wedge is undergoing an accretion or widening phase primarily via slip on relatively young thrust-front faults...|$|R
