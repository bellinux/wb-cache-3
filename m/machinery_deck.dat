2500|$|As {{the weight}} of the {{caissons}} and counterweights would now be borne by the lift superstructure instead of by the rams, the superstructure was strengthened and put on stronger foundations. The new superstructure was built around the original lift frame {{in order to avoid the}} need to dismantle the original lift, which would have taken it out of service for a long period. The new superstructure consisted of ten steel A-frames, five on each side, supporting a <b>machinery</b> <b>deck</b> 60ft (18 m) above the river level where the electric motors, drive shafts and cast-iron headgear pulleys were mounted. Wire ropes attached to both sides of each caisson passed over the pulleys to 36 cast iron counterweights weighing [...] each, 18 on each side to balance the [...] weight of each loaded caisson. The electric motor had to overcome friction between the pulleys and their bearings. A [...] motor was installed, but normal operation only required about half of this power.|$|E

50|$|The {{company also}} {{manufactured}} walking draglines, which were very large capacity machines, model 5W the most common, with the upper <b>machinery</b> <b>deck</b> (on all excavators {{known as the}} revolving frame) mounted upon a circular tub with motion provided by overhanging cams with paddle feet which, when rotated, lifted the entire machine and produced individual steps of forward motion, a waddling action somewhat like a duck {{as the end of}} the boom would raise and lower. Because of the size and weight, walking draglines were transported to site in sections and assembled in situ. These large machines were used for removal of overburden on, for example, opencast coal sites.|$|E

25|$|Her {{operation}} was revived three further times, in 1990, 1997, and 2001, after <b>machinery,</b> <b>decks,</b> and recreational facilities were renovated. During her 1990 refit, two further decks {{were added to}} the top of her structure that featured luxury suites with private verandas. This addition raised her overall tonnage to 76,049 (winning her back the title of largest passenger ship in the world, from the 73,000-ton MS Sovereign of the Seas), her passenger capacity to 2,565, and gave her a competitive edge against newer ships being built at that time which featured more and more private balcony suites for their passengers. But ship aficionados were incensed that these new decks, built with very rectilinear lines to accommodate the prefabricated cabin units within, ruined the original sweeping lines of the France, and made the Norway appear top-heavy.|$|R
