40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{the application of a}} multi-agent framework for collaborative scheduling to a disaster response coordination problem. The target problem is a <b>field</b> <b>exercise</b> mockup of a natural disaster, where a team of human agents must rely on their respective automated scheduling agents to coordinate and accomplish various infra-structure repair and casualty transport tasks. Following the ground rules of the program sponsoring the experiment, our starting point is a collaborative scheduling framework developed under the strong assumption that no single agent has a global view of the overall problem. This peer-to-peer approach to multi-agent scheduling and coordination gives rise to a complex distributed search problem, and effective performance in the <b>field</b> <b>exercise</b> is found to depend heavily on the ability to provide the multi-agent system with strong initial strategic guidance. We describe the mechanisms developed for steering the multi-agent scheduling system to address specific disaster response scenarios and report performance results that were obtained in the <b>field</b> <b>exercise</b> test cases...|$|R
50|$|Military service {{consists}} of lessons, practical training, various {{cleaning and maintenance}} duties and <b>field</b> <b>exercises.</b> The wake-up call is usually at 5.30 am and a day's typical duty lasts for twelve hours, including meals and some breaks. In the evening {{there are a few}} hours of free time. Roll call is at 9pm, and at 10pm silence is announced, after which no noise is to be made. On a majority of weekends conscripts can leave the barracks on Friday and are expected to return by midnight on Sunday evening. A small force of conscripts is kept in readiness on weekends to aid civil agencies in various types of emergency situations, to guard the premises and to maintain defence in case of a sudden military emergency. <b>Field</b> <b>exercises</b> can go on regardless of the time of day or day of week. An average conscript spends 40-60 nights outdoors during <b>field</b> <b>exercises,</b> depending on his unit.|$|R
