50|$|Scandinavian {{settlements}} at the Pomeranian coast include Wollin (on the isle of Wollin), Ralswiek (on the isle of Rügen), Altes Lager <b>Menzlin</b> (at {{the lower}} Peene river), and Bardy-Świelubie near modern Kołobrzeg. <b>Menzlin</b> {{was set up}} in the mid-8th century. In Wollin, seaside foritifications have been dated back to the beginning 10th century, yet remnants of older fortifications were also found, probably pointing to an earlier burgh with an adjacent open settlement. Wollin and Ralswiek began to prosper {{in the course of the}} 9th century.|$|E
50|$|Scandinavian emporia {{and major}} Slavic burghs {{were set up}} {{primarily}} at junctions of long-distance trade routes. Such trade routes ran along the Vistula river, reaching the coast at Truso and Gdańsk; along the western bank of the Oder, coming from the Danube area and Moravia and forking north of Schwedt with the eastern fork running through Szczecin and reaching the sea at Wollin, while the western fork ran through <b>Menzlin</b> and reached the sea at Wolgast and Usedom. Routes from Prague and the western parts of the Holy Roman Empire met at Magdeburg, which in turn was connected to Mecklenburg and Reric by a northern route, with Demmin and <b>Menzlin</b> by a northeastern route, and with the Oder route by an eastern route running through the Uckermark. Another trade route connected Mecklenburg and Reric with Usedom and Wollin, running through Werle, Lüchow, Dargun, Demmin and <b>Menzlin.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, {{there was an}} {{important}} Scandinavian and Wendish settlement in the area near the present town now known as Altes Lager <b>Menzlin.</b> Anklam proper began as an associated Wendish fortress.|$|E
50|$|Along the coast, Vikings and Slavs {{established}} trade posts like Reric, Ralswiek and <b>Menzlin.</b> In the 12th century, Mecklenburg and Vorpommern were conquered by Henry the Lion {{and incorporated}} into the Duchy of Saxony, joining the Holy Roman Empire in the 1180s. All of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was settled with Germans in the Ostsiedlung process, starting in the 12th century.|$|E
50|$|In this era, large mixed Slavic and Scandinavian {{settlements}} {{were built}} at the natural havens of the bay-rich coast, {{the most important of}} which were Ralswiek (Rügen), Altes Lager <b>Menzlin</b> at the Peene River and Wolin, which is assumed to be identical with Vineta and Jomsborg. Important pagan temple sites were Arkona and Rethra. Other local strongholds were Dimin (Demmin) in the Circipan and Stetin (Szczecin) in the Pomeranian area.|$|E
5000|$|Altes Lager (German for [...] "Old Camp") is a site 1.5 km {{south of}} the village of <b>Menzlin</b> near Anklam, Western Pomerania, Germany. The site, {{on the banks of}} the river Peene, was an {{important}} Viking trading-post during the Viking Age. At that time, Pomerania was inhabited by Slavic Wends, yet several Viking trading-posts were set up along the coast (the nearest were Ralswiek to the West and Jomsborg/Wollin to the east).|$|E
50|$|Early emporia like <b>Menzlin</b> and Dierkow (just {{west of the}} Pomeranian border, near Rostock) {{reached their}} peak already in the 9th century, no {{imported}} goods are found from the 10th century. Bardy-Świelubie was vacated in the late 9th century, when the Slavic settlement of Kołobrzeg became the new center of the region. Ralswiek {{made it into the}} new millennium, but at the time when written chronicles reported the site in the 12th century it had lost all its importance. Wollin was destroyed by the Danes in the 12th century.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were many}} such {{roads in the}} Holy Roman Empire, such as the King's road from <b>Menzlin</b> to Wismar in present-day Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, which was the [...] "most {{significant}} East-West road in the north" [...] of the medieval West Slavic Lutician settlement areas, and the best-known road, the one running from the Rhine river through Frankfurt am Main and Leipzig (where it intersected the Via Imperii) to Silesia, which is generally referred to as Via Regia. In 2005, it was awarded {{the title of a}} European Cultural Route by the Council of Europe.|$|E
50|$|Settled {{since the}} Stone Age, {{the area was}} {{probably}} inhabited by Germanic Rugians, before the Polabian Slavs moved in during the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries. Around the island, Wendish/Scandinavian trade centres such as Vineta/Jomsborg and <b>Menzlin</b> were established. In 1128 the Slavic Pomeranian Duke Wartislaw I was converted to Christianity {{through the efforts of}} Otto of Bamberg. In 1155 the Premonstratensians established a monastery in Grobe, generally known as Usedom Abbey, which in 1309 was moved to the village of Pudagla. In the meantime, a Cistercian nunnery was founded in Krummin and soon almost the whole island was in the possession of {{one or the other of}} the ecclesiastical orders. During the Reformation, ownership passed to the Slavic dukes of Pomerania, who took over the island.|$|E
50|$|Groswin {{took over}} the {{position}} of nearby Altes Lager <b>Menzlin</b> as a trade center after its decline in the 9th century. The tribal affiliation of the inhabitants, though associated with the greater tribe of the Veleti, is uncertain - while the Ukrani are reported to have dwelled south of the Zarow and the Rani north of the Ryck river, {{the name of the}} medieval inhabitants of the area between these rivers is not reported. The lands of Groswin became a castellany of the Duchy of Pomerania during the westward expansion of Wartislaw I in the 1120s, and became part of the Bishopric of Cammin in 1140. In 1153, Stolpe Abbey was founded in the Groswin castellany as the first Pomeranian monastery. A market at the Groswin burgh is documented in 1159. In 1185, a Danish expedition led by Canut VI destroyed the burgh and devastated the castellany. Though the name Groswin stayed in use to refer to the area, the position of the former burgh as the areas center was taken over by nearby Anklam.|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} archaeological material {{regarding the}} Viking-Age settlement of Wolin (Wollin) {{identified as the}} Jómsborg of the Icelandic sagas. The study shows that Wolin stands out among other Scandinavian settlements on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea such as Gross Strömkendorf, Rostock-Dierkow, <b>Menzlin,</b> and Ralswiek. Firstly, Wolin was founded later than other emporia in the region. Secondly, {{the character of the}} Scandinavian presence is different. Wolin is characterized by a distinct Slavic core and a short-lived presence of a Scandi­navian elite with a clear underrepresentation of Norse women. Other emporia bear evidence of a continuous Scandinavian presence and wholly Norse character, including families, with a very clear presence of Norse women, and graves with rich inventories. Thirdly, Wolin was fortified while none of the other afore­mentioned emporia was protected by a wall. Another striking element of the archaeology of Wolin includes plait-work of “the Pomeranian School of Insular-Scan­dinavian Art”...|$|E
