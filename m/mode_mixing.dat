5000|$|The {{effect of}} {{physically}} bending an optical fibre around a cylindrical form is to slightly modify the effective refractive index in the curved region, which locally reduces the {{effective mode volume}} of the fibre. This causes optical power in the highest order modes to become unguided, or so weakly guided as to be released into an unbound state, absorbed by the fiber coating or completely ejected from the fibre. The practical effect of mandrel wrapping is to attenuate optical power propagating in the highest order modes. Lower order modes are unaffected, experiencing neither increased loss nor conversion into other modes (<b>mode</b> <b>mixing).</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractA review will {{be given}} of the {{analysis}} of <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> delamination failure in composites and adhesive joints. There will be discussion {{of the issue of}} mode II failure and how it occurs only in laminates. In homogenous material <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> loading results in local mode I failure by the crack kinking. If the crack is constrained in its path, as in laminates, then an apparent mode II failure occurs consisting of a series of local mode I micro cracks. This has a rough surface and, in mode II (shear) does not open leading to an increased surface area and friction. This apparent mode II fracture, and its <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> variants, gives higher toughness values than in mode I. Measuring these <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> toughness values presents significant experimental problems but standard protocols have been developed to give reliable values and hence failure loci for <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> failure. It is a feature of such data that any mode II components gives significant scatter so there is inherent uncertainty present. The prediction of the <b>mode</b> <b>mix</b> in any configuration also presents significant problems. For elastic failures without damage there is a established solution arising from the stress singularities at the crack tip and effects of this are usually present when there is damage. However prediction of the <b>mode</b> <b>mix</b> depends on the form of the damage and is load level dependent. There are approximate ways of determining this <b>mode</b> <b>mix</b> which will be described but numerical calculations are often neededWith this background in mind the practical value, in terms of refining design methods, by using such analyses will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Delamination growth under fatigue loads in real {{composite}} components generally {{develops in}} a non-constant propagation mode. The {{aim of the}} investigation {{described in this article}} was to develop a model capable of predicting the fatigue delamination growth in a general case, under varying <b>mode</b> <b>mix</b> conditions. The crack growth development in essentially unidirectional laminates of carbon-fibre reinforced epoxy was analysed in terms of the Paris law for different constant propagation modes: mode I (double-cantilever beam test), mode II (end-notched flexure test) and different mixed-modes I/II (mixed-mode bending test). The dependence of the Paris law parameters on <b>mode</b> <b>mix</b> is compared with the existing models in the literature. It is shown that these models do not reproduce the non-monotonic dependence on <b>mode</b> <b>mix</b> which has been observed in experimental data. Therefore, an improved phenomenological model is introduced and compared with the experimental data obtained by other researchers. To check the ability of the model to predict variable mixed-mode fatigue delamination, the mixed-mode end-loaded split test was employed and the experimental results were compared to the predictions of the model.

50|$|Note that A {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} the Intrinsic mode functions of a noise corrupted signal can help in estimating {{the significance of that}} mode. It is usually assumed that the first IMF captures most of the noise and hence from this IMF we could estimate the Noise level and estimate the noise corrupted signal eliminating the effects of noise approximately. This method is known as Denoising and Detrending. Another advantage of using the MEEMD is that the <b>mode</b> <b>mixing</b> is reduced significantly due to the function of the EEMD.The Denoising and Detrending strategy can be used for image processing to enhance an image and similarly it could be applied to Audio Signals to remove corrupted data in speech.

30|$|Another {{important}} drawback of HHT is the <b>mode</b> <b>mixing</b> {{which is}} discovered by Huang firstly. The <b>mode</b> <b>mixing</b> refers to that an IMF contains quite different characteristic time scales, or different IMFs contain similar characteristic time scales. It appears when the waveform of an IMF mixes {{with those of}} its adjacent IMFs. Thus identification of the waveforms is difficult which causes Hilbert transform to lose physical meaning [14]. There are two reasons of the generation of <b>mode</b> <b>mixing.</b> Firstly, signals are mixed with abnormal events [6], that is, discontinuous component contained in signals [7], pulse interference and noise. EMD uses {{the upper and lower}} envelopes of the signal (which are obtained by the spline interpolation of the extreme points of the signal) to compute the average value, then to complete the screening process. Therefore the presence of abnormal events leads to locally abnormal distribution of the extreme points, which results in <b>mode</b> <b>mixing.</b> Secondly, the amplitude and frequency of each component of the signal may influence each other. Because the amplitude and frequency determine the distribution of the extreme points, the influence between each component finally causes <b>mode</b> <b>mixing.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Surveys {{of doctors}} are an {{important}} data collection method in health services research. Ways to improve response rates, minimise survey response bias and item non-response, within a given budget, have not previously been addressed in the same study. The aim {{of this paper is}} to compare the effects and costs of three different modes of survey administration in a national survey of doctors. Methods A stratified random sample of 4. 9 % (2, 702 / 54, 160) of doctors undertaking clinical practice was drawn from a national directory of all doctors in Australia. Stratification was by four doctor types: general practitioners, specialists, specialists-in-training, and hospital non-specialists, and by six rural/remote categories. A three-arm parallel trial design with equal randomisation across arms was used. Doctors were randomly allocated to: online questionnaire (902); simultaneous <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> (a paper questionnaire and login details sent together) (900); or, sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> (online followed by a paper questionnaire with the reminder) (900). Analysis was by intention to treat, as within each primary mode, doctors could choose either paper or online. Primary outcome measures were response rate, survey response bias, item non-response, and cost. Results The online mode had a response rate 12. 95 %, followed by the simultaneous <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> with 19. 7 %, and the sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> with 20. 7 %. After adjusting for observed differences between the groups, the online mode had a 7 percentage point lower response rate compared to the simultaneous <b>mixed</b> <b>mode,</b> and a 7. 7 percentage point lower response rate compared to sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode.</b> The difference in response rate between the sequential and simultaneous modes was not statistically significant. Both <b>mixed</b> <b>modes</b> showed evidence of response bias, whilst the characteristics of online respondents were similar to the population. However, the online mode had a higher rate of item non-response compared to both <b>mixed</b> <b>modes.</b> The total cost of the online survey was 38 % lower than simultaneous <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> and 22 % lower than sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode.</b> The cost of the sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> was 14 % lower than simultaneous <b>mixed</b> <b>mode.</b> Compared to the online <b>mode,</b> the sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> was the most cost-effective, although exhibiting some evidence of response bias. Conclusions Decisions on which survey mode to use depend on response rates, response bias, item non-response and costs. The sequential <b>mixed</b> <b>mode</b> appears to be the most cost-effective mode of survey administration for surveys of the population of doctors, if one is prepared to accept a degree of response bias.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of critical energy release rates of adhesive joints in laminated composite structures {{is a key}} issue when failure analyses have to be performed. Critical energy release rates, or fracture toughnesses, {{are known to be}} dependent on the <b>mode</b> <b>mixing</b> ratio, i. e. the portion of shear loading. It is thus useful to determine a criterion which gives the critical energy release rate {{as a function of the}} <b>mode</b> <b>mixing</b> ratio, which is the overall goal of this paper. For this purpose several experiments have been performed, for single mode I, single mode II, and mixed mode I/II loading conditions with pre-defined <b>mode</b> <b>mixing</b> ratios. Unfortunately, most of the experimental outcome cannot be used directly for least squares fitting of suitable fracture toughness criteria due to a couple of reasons, which will be discussed in detail. Hence, a numerical approach based on cohesive interface elements is employed to determine some of the critical energy release rates by fitting against experimental load–deformation curves. This combined numerical/experimental approach yields a useful database of discrete critical energy release rate values. These are utilized to fit suitable criteria which then allow the calculation of critical energy release rates for any given <b>mode</b> <b>mixing</b> ratio. The results are discussed in terms of convergence to the discrete values and physical plausibility, and a simple possibility to include mode III behavior is presented...|$|E
