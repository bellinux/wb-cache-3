Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are <b>more</b> <b>attuned</b> to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E

This development prompted the need for national standards for authority work.|$|E

But since gangsters were a main part of the story, he toned up the comical aspect of the characters and made the movie <b>more</b> <b>attuned</b> to his liking. Even though Shoot the Piano Player was much appreciated by critics, it performed poorly at the box office.

25|$|Ventriloquism {{has been}} used as the {{evidence}} for the modality appropriateness hypothesis. Ventriloquism describes the situation in which auditory location perception is shifted toward a visual cue. The original study describing this phenomenon was conducted by Howard and Templeton, (1966) after which several studies have replicated and built upon the conclusions they reached. In conditions in which the visual cue is unambiguous, visual capture reliably occurs. Thus to test the influence of sound on perceived location, the visual stimulus must be progressively degraded. Furthermore, given that auditory stimuli are <b>more</b> <b>attuned</b> to temporal changes, recent studies have tested the ability of temporal characteristics to influence the spatial location of visual stimuli. Some types of EVP – electronic voice phenomenon, mainly the ones using sound bubles are considered a kind of modern ventriloquism technique and is played by the use of sophisticated software, computers and sound equipment.|$|E

25|$|The 2000 tournament {{was held}} in Sri Lanka, and {{replicated}} the format from 1998. Participating nations included the nine Test-playing nations, as well as Bangladesh, Kenya, Ireland, Namibia, Holland, Nepal and a combined team from the Americas development region. To the disappointment of a large crowd at Colombo's SSC, Sri Lanka fell at the final hurdle in a final dominated by India. The winners remained unbeaten throughout, and destroyed Australia by 170 runs in the semi-final to underline their supremacy. In the other semi-final, Sri Lanka delighted a crowd of 5000 at Galle by beating Pakistan. The fact {{that three of the}} four semi-finalists were from Asia and so <b>more</b> <b>attuned</b> to the conditions was coincidental - they played the better cricket and, in Pakistan's case, had a very experienced squad. England, the defending champions, were most disappointing, and they won only one match against a Test-playing country, and that a last-ball victory over Zimbabwe. South Africa, one of the favourites, were desperately unlucky to be eliminated after three no-results gave them three points while Nepal, with four points courtesy of one win over Kenya, went through to the Super League instead. The format of the tournament was as in 1997-98, with four groups of four and then a Super League and final. Graeme Smith was the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 348 runs at an average of 87.00. Pakistan's Zahid Saeed was the leading wicket-taker, with 15 wickets at 7.60. India's Yuvraj Singh was named Man of the Series.

25|$|In {{the final}} of the 1976 Wimbledon Championships, Evert faced off against old rival Goolagong. The first two sets were won via a break of the other {{opponent}} and Evert took the first set 63, which then Goolagong took the next set 46 in order to force a pivotal third set. During the roller-coaster decisive set there was plenty break of serves for both opponents, which the set lasted 50 minutes. Goolagong quickly ran out to a quick 02 lead in the third set, which she broke Evert in the second game of the set. Evert would break in the third and fifth games in order to take a marginal advantage in the set of 3 games to 0. Goolagong would not let the break lead stand for Evert and quickly broke back in the sixth game on Evert's serve for a tie at 3 games all. At this juncture of the set, Evert's game was looking better and <b>more</b> <b>attuned</b> to hitting better shots at the baseline and at the net. In the next two games both would hold serve to level the set at 4 games all, but in the ninth game Evert broke Goolagong to take a 5 games to 4 lead, which allowed her to serve for the match. Evert failed to maintain her nerves on serve and Googlagong forced her into three straight unforced errors that narrowed the set to 5 games all. Goolagong would hold her serve in the next service game to take a 5 to 6 games advantage, which Goolagong did not give Evert a single point during this game, and now in the next game Evert was just serving to stay in the match. Evert would show the steely-eyed determination, which she became known for, and held serve in the game to stay in the match and level it at 6 games all, and in the subsequent game Evert would again break the serve of Goolagong in order to serve for the match. In the fourteenth game, Evert would finally put away Googlagong on the only match point for the American with a lob shot, which Goolagong failed to reach the shot, and this was the second Wimbledon Singles title for her career.|$|E
