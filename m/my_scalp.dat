At this Clement Attlee asked for Evans' resignation, dismissing him from office after only six weeks.

He participated in the Battle of Fort George in 1813, and in the Battle of Lundy's Lane in 1814. Following that battle a story is related that an Indian allied with the British (variously Chippewa or Mohawk) came to the Seneca saying he was deserting. Hhe was identified as a spy, and Farmer's Brother said to him [...] "here are my rifle, my tomahawk, and <b>my</b> <b>scalping</b> knife: take your choice by which you will die." [...] The spy chose the rifle and indicated he wanted to be shot through the heart (or head), so Farmer's Brother immediately pointed his rifle there and killed him.|$|R

"I {{understand}} what you mean," [...] she continued, hurriedly, [...] "and what you would say, but for the fear of hurting me--us, I mean; for Hetty loves her father quite as well as I do.

I fear nothing for <b>my</b> father's <b>scalp,</b> and little for his life. Could they steal on us in the night, we should all probably suffer in this way; but men taken in open strife are seldom injured; not, at least, until the time of torture comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Unhappily, my indomitable friend Plugson of Undershot has, {{in a great}} degree, {{forgotten}} them;--as, alas, all {{the world}} has; as, alas, our very Dukes and Soul-Overseers have, whose special trade it was to remember them!

These thousand men that span and toiled round him, they were a regiment whom he had enlisted, man by man; to make war on a very genuine enemy: Bareness of back, and disobedient Cotton-fibre, which will not, unless forced to it, consent to cover bare backs. Here is a most genuine enemy; over whom all creatures will wish him victory. He enlisted his thousand men; said to them, [...] "Come, brothers, let us have a dash at Cotton!" [...] They follow with cheerful shout; they gain such a victory over Cotton as the Earth has to admire and clap hands at: but, alas, it is yet only of the Bucanier or Chactaw sort,--as good as no victory!

"There {{will be two}} less, when I fasten to <b>my</b> pole the <b>scalps</b> {{of those}} {{on the other side of}} the river," [...] {{answered}} Peter, with another of his transient, but startling gleams of intense revenge.

When the time comes, the knife of Onoah is sure. The Pottawattamies shall have their canoes, arid can follow us up the river. They will find us in the Openings, and near the Prairie Round. They know the spot; for the red men love to hunt the deer in that region.

60|$|There was, perhaps, {{a reason}} for such fancies, though I {{did not know it}} at that time, for, as I found {{afterward}} by the deep score across the <b>scalp,</b> <b>my</b> head must have been driven against the stone with sufficient violence to destroy forever the balance of a less thickly covered brain. However, it could not have lasted more than a few moments before I knew that the funeral march was only the boom of the river, and if I would not have it as sole requiem for one who was dearer far than life to me I must summon all my powers of invention. The waters had risen several inches since I first flung myself down. Great events hang on very small ones, and we might well have left our bones in the cañon, but that when crawling over a boulder I slipped and fell heavily, and, when for a moment I lay with my head almost in the river, I could see from that level something in the eddy behind a rock on the further shore which had remained unnoticed before.|$|R
5000|$|While Captain Brady's {{exploits}} were many, {{what he did}} is well {{illustrated by}} this episode. In June 1779, soon after learning of his father's death, Indians attacked a family near Fort Pitt and killed a settler mother and her four children, taking a boy and his sister as captives. When Captain Brady learned of their captivity, he rushed out with an Indian guide to rescue them. The Indians were apparently both Seneca and Munsee, led by a Munsee chief. The Indian party eventually camped by a creek, unaware that a vengeful Captain Brady was on their trail. This area was close to Brady's Bend, Pennsylvania on the Allegheny River {{in what was then}} the Seneca territory. Captain Brady and his guide came upon their fire in the dark. His guide said, [...] "They will sleep by that fire tonight." [...] "Yes," [...] replied Captain Brady, [...] "and I will awake them in a voice of thunder in the morning." [...] In the morning, Captain Brady, [...] "saw an old chief rise and stir the fire. Instantly a shot rang out, and he fell into the flame, and in the encounter which followed eight warriors were relieved of their scalps. The children were rescued, and the boy asked for the Captain's tomahawk, which he used in cutting off the head of the chief who fell into the fire saying, 'It was he who <b>scalped</b> <b>my</b> mother.'" ...|$|R

I wanted them to honour me, to love me. The money is here, earned with my best lifeblood: but the honour? I am encircled with squalor, with hunger, rage, and sooty desperation. Not honoured, hardly even envied; only fools and the flunky-species so much as envy me. I am conspicuous,--as a mark for curses and brickbats. What good is it? <b>My</b> five hundred <b>scalps</b> hang here in my wigwam: would to Heaven I had sought something else than the scalps; would to Heaven I had been a Christian Fighter, not a Chactaw one!
