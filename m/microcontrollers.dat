25|$|Little-endian {{representation}} simplifies hardware in processors {{that add}} multi-byte integral values a byte at a time, such as small-scale byte-addressable processors and <b>microcontrollers.</b> As carry propagation must {{start at the}} least significant bit (and thus byte), multi-byte addition can then be carried out with a monotonically-incrementing address sequence, a simple operation already present in hardware.

On the other hand, arithmetic division is done starting from the MSB, so it is more natural for big-endian processors.
