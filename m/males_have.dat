5|$|Adult <b>males</b> <b>have</b> large cheek flaps to {{show their}} {{dominance}} to other males. The cheek flaps are made mostly of fatty tissue and are supported by the musculature of the face. Mature males' throat pouches allow them to make loud calls.|$|E
5|$|M. c. elizabethae, {{endemic to}} King Island was {{described}} as a separate species elizabethae by Archibald James Campbell in 1901. <b>Males</b> <b>have</b> a deeper blue colour than Tasmanian birds. King Island birds also have longer tarsi (lower legs).|$|E
5|$|Only {{reproductive}} ants, queens, and <b>males,</b> <b>have</b> wings. Queens {{shed their}} wings after the nuptial flight, leaving visible stubs, a distinguishing feature of queens. In a few species, wingless queens (ergatoids) and males occur.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>male</b> <b>has</b> {{a yellow}} head and upper breast during the {{breeding}} season, with a pale grey belly {{and light and}} brown wings with white wing-tips. The <b>male</b> <b>has</b> distinctive red eye-rings and silver bill extending with a 'V' shape into the forehead. The non-breeding <b>male</b> <b>has</b> a dark brown head and pale grey breast, flanked with white.|$|R
50|$|An adult <b>male</b> <b>has</b> a body roughly 4 in long, with a leg span of 6 in, and a mass around 15 g. Both sexes {{are similar}} in appearance, with the <b>male</b> <b>having</b> a smaller body, but longer legs.

5|$|There are six {{recognised}} subspecies, {{although the}} differences are mainly clinal; birds become smaller and paler in {{the east of the}} range and the <b>males</b> <b>have</b> larger white wing spots. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the subspecies' ranges overlap.|$|E
5|$|A. c. rajputanae Zukowsky, 1927 : Known as {{the northwestern}} blackbuck.

5|$|After a duel, it {{is common}} for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such {{interactions}} between <b>males</b> <b>have</b> been found to be more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.|$|E
5|$|At the lek, <b>males</b> <b>have</b> been {{observed}} {{to break up}} into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the American white ibis gathers in huge colonies near water. Pairs are predominantly monogamous and both parents {{care for the}} young, although males tend to engage in extra-pair copulation with other females to increase their reproductive success. <b>Males</b> <b>have</b> also been found to pirate food from unmated females and juveniles during {{the breeding}} season.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds {{are large}} seabirds usually found over {{tropical}} oceans. They are large, black or black-and-white birds, with long wings and deeply forked tails.

5|$|In 1982, W.D. Hamilton {{proposed}} a specific but widely applicable handicap mechanism, parasite-mediated sexual selection. He {{argued that in}} the never-ending co-evolutionary race between hosts and their parasites, sexually selected signals indicate health. This idea was tested in 1994 in barn swallows, a species where <b>males</b> <b>have</b> long tail streamers. Møller found that the males with longer tails, and their offspring, did have fewer bloodsucking mites, whereas fostered young did not. The effect was therefore genetic, confirming Hamilton's theory.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adult females, {{but have}} broken narrow pale edges of underpart feathers, which give a slightly streaked rather than scalloped appearance, {{and the overall}} appearance is browner rather than uniformly blackish.

5|$|<b>Males</b> <b>have</b> {{relatively}} small testes {{compared to other}} lemurs, and their canine teeth are {{the same size as}} those seen in females. During the dry season, females can weigh more than males. Both patterns of sexual dimorphism are consistent with the theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. Females have two pairs of nipples.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters are polygynous: <b>males</b> <b>have</b> {{multiple}} female partners. However, temporary pair-bonding occurs for a {{few days}} between a female in estrus and her mate. Mating takes place in the water and can be rough, the male biting the female on the muzzle– which often leaves scars on the nose– and sometimes holding her head under water.|$|E
