5|$|A further {{complication}} is that {{a certain}} proportion of the Allied manpower was needed to <b>man</b> <b>the</b> fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men. Since the Battle of Mycale was fought at least near-simultaneously with the Battle of Plataea, then this was a pool of manpower which could not have contributed to Plataea, and further reduces the likelihood that 110,000 Greeks assembled before Plataea.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{anomalous}} units, as mentioned above, {{had not been}} transferred into the new system; these were the two Irish Yeomanry regiments and the Volunteers of Bermuda and the Isle of <b>Man.</b> <b>The</b> decision had been taken to have no Territorial Force units in Ireland and so the two yeomanry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted in the Special Reserve as the North Irish Horse and South Irish Horse. The Isle of Man Volunteers and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps remained organised as Volunteers; whilst the new legislation did extend to the Isle of <b>Man,</b> <b>the</b> force was not reorganised there {{partly due to the}} difficulty of changing to annual training. Bermuda, the Channel Islands and Malta were not encompassed by the scope of the legislation, and so the Militia there continued to operate under the old system.|$|E
5|$|According to John of Wallingford, King Edgar {{made this}} {{division}} during a council at York, {{in order to}} prevent the whole area becoming the inheritance of one <b>man.</b> <b>The</b> Historia Regum claims that such a division took place not in Oslac's time but Osulf's, and that the division line was the River Tyne rather than Tees; historian Dorothy Whitelock considered this to be apocryphal.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed at {{the popular}} appeal of Paine's Rights of <b>Man,</b> <b>the</b> king issued a {{proclamation}} against seditious writings in May 1792.
