25|$|<b>Miter</b> gauge: The table has {{one or two}} slots (grooves) {{running from}} front to back, also {{parallel}} to the cutting plane of the blade. These <b>miter</b> slots (or <b>miter</b> grooves) are used to position and guide either a <b>miter</b> gauge (also known as a crosscut fence) or crosscut sled. The <b>miter</b> gauge is usually set to be at 90 degrees to {{the plane of the}} blade's cut, to cause the cut made in the workpiece to be made at a right angle. The <b>miter</b> gauge can also be adjusted to cause the cut to be made at a precisely controlled angle (a so-called <b>miter</b> cut).|$|E

25|$|The Jerusalem Talmud and Midrash Leviticus Rabbah (x.) {{give the}} {{following}} interpretation: The coat symbolized atonement for murder {{or for the}} sin of wearing mixed garments, and the undergarment typified atonement for unchastity. The <b>miter</b> denoted atonement for pride, and the belt for theft or trickery. The breastplate represented atonement for any perversion of the Law, the ephod for idolatry, and the robe for slander.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the images, feathers were used to adorn priests' clothing such as chasubles, rain capes and <b>miters.</b> They also made feather decorations for church altars and convents. Feathered <b>miters</b> and other vestments were sent and gifted to European bishops, especially in southern Europe and were used while conducting Mass. Although there are no written records to indicate that this use of feathered vestments were a result of Mexican influence, they did not appear until after the mid 16th century. [...] European engravings were used {{as a model for}} feather images created for <b>miters</b> which today can be still found in Milan, Florence and New York. However, these and other Christian images were not exact copies of the prints as elements from several prints were combined and even pre Hispanic motifs appeared in some. These <b>miters</b> served as an innovation in the pictoral language of the church as the vestments themselves added a kind of power through their magnificence.|$|R

40|$|The stress {{capacity}} of joints made of modified wood members under loading {{can be affected}} by design of joints and type of adhesive. Hence, these factors were addressed in this study by assessment of {{stress capacity}} variations in corner joints under diagonal applied compressive load induced combined stresses. The joints with <b>mitered</b> and butted design were constructed by application of epoxy and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) adhesives from furfurylated wood samples with two weight percentage gains (WPGs), i. e., 20 % as low level and 60 % as high level. Results indicated that stress capacity in both corner joints was not significantly decreased with increasing polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA) in wood. Despite the high compression strength in <b>mitered</b> joint, the induced compression stresses were low in comparison with butted joint. The stress capacity in <b>mitered</b> joint bonded with epoxy adhesive enhanced with increasing the level of furfurylation. This was true for shear stress parallel to grain as well. Generally, it could be concluded that <b>mitered</b> joint made of furfurylated members and bonded with epoxy adhesive would be stronger than other corner joints...|$|R

25|$|Josephus' {{explanation}} is this: The coat was {{the symbol of}} the earth, the upper garment emblemized heaven, while the bells and pomegranates represented thunder and lightning. The ephod typified the four elements, and the interwoven gold denoted the glory of God. The breastplate was {{in the center of the}} ephod, as the earth formed the center of the universe; the girdle symbolized the ocean, the stones on the shoulders the sun and moon, and the jewels in the breastplate the twelve signs of the zodiac, while the <b>miter</b> was a token of heaven.|$|E
25|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} {{in the house and}} grounds of 4315 Charlotte Street, investigators uncovered a human skull inside a closet {{on the second floor of}} his property, and a partially decomposed human head in the backyard. The search also uncovered several human vertebrae scarred by both hacksaw and knife marks stowed in a hallway, and several human teeth stowed in two envelopes. Both a hacksaw and a <b>miter</b> saw were discovered in the basement of the property, and a chainsaw was also found to be soiled with bloodstains, flesh, and pubic hairs. Luminol tests revealed that the floor of Berdella's basement, and two plastic trash barrels, were extensively bloodstained.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{practical}} computation of <b>mitered</b> and beveled offset curves of planar straight-line graphs (PSLGs), i. e., of arbitrary collections of straight-line segments {{in the plane}} that do not intersect except possibly at common end points. The line segments can, but need not, form polygons. Similar to Voronoi-based offsetting, we propose to com-pute a straight skeleton of the input PSLG as a preprocessing step for <b>mitered</b> offsetting. For this purpose, we extend and adapt Aichholzer and Aurenhammer’s triangulation-based straight-skeleton algorithm to make it process real-world data on a conventional finite-precision arithmetic. We implemented this extended algorithm in C and use our implementation for ex-tensive experiments. All tests demonstrate the practical suitability of using straight skeletons for the offsetting of complex PSLGs. Our main practical contribution is strong experimental evidence that <b>mitered</b> offsets of PSLGs with 100 000 segments can be com-puted in about ten milliseconds on a standard PC once the straight skeleton is available and that our implementation clearly is the fastest code for <b>mitered</b> offsetting even if the computational costs of the straight-skeleton computation {{are included in the}} timings...|$|R

25|$|Gates are the {{watertight}} doors which seal off the chamber {{from the upper}} and lower pounds. Each end of the chamber is equipped with a gate, or pair of half-gates, made of oak or elm (or now sometimes steel). The most common arrangement, usually called <b>miter</b> gates, was invented by Leonardo da Vinci, sometime around the late 15th century. When closed, a pair meet at an angle like a chevron pointing upstream and only a very small difference in water-level is necessary to squeeze the closed gates securely together. This reduces any leaks from between them and prevents their being opened until water levels have equalised. If the chamber is not full, the top gate is secure; and if the chamber is not completely empty, the bottom gate is secure (in normal operation, therefore, the chamber cannot be open at both ends). A lower gate is taller than an upper gate, because the upper gate only has to be tall enough to close off the upper pound, while the lower gate {{has to be able to}} seal off a full chamber. The upper gate is as tall as the canal is deep, plus a little more for the balance beam, winding mechanism, etc.; the lower gate's height equals the upper gate plus the lock's rise.|$|E

Twelve such courses, the internal ribs, the marble capstone, and the aluminum apex comprise the pyramidion. Its height is [...] [...] Its weight is [...] The slope of the walls of the pyramidion is 17°24' from the vertical. [...] There are twelve ribs, three per wall, which spring from the [...] level, all being integrated into the walls up to the [...] level. All are free standing above 500 feet, relying on mortise and tenon joints to attach neighboring stones. The eight corner ribs terminate six courses above the shaft, each corner rib resting on its neighboring corner rib via a <b>miter</b> joint, forming four corner arches. Each such arch supports a pair of square corner stones, one above the other totaling one course in height. Each corner rib is linked to the nearest center rib at the sixth course via a marble tie beam. The four center ribs terminate eight courses above the shaft at a marble cruciform (cross shaped) keystone, forming two main arches that cross each other. Two stones, each one course high, are mounted on each of the four ribs, supporting two additional courses above the cruciform keystone, leaving two courses to support the capstone's weight by themselves.|$|E

2500|$|The vestments of {{the high}} priest were {{interpreted}} in three ways.

The ephod corresponded to heaven, and the stones on both shoulders to the two hemispheres, one above and the other below the earth. The six names on each of the stones were the six signs of the zodiac, which were denoted also by the twelve names on the breastplate. The <b>miter</b> was the sign of the crown, which exalted the high priest above all earthly kings.|$|E
