5000|$|Short term trading can be {{very risky}} and {{unpredictable}} due to the volatile nature {{of the stock market}} at times. Within the time frame of a day and a week many factors can have a major effect on a stock's price. Company news, reports, and consumer’s attitudes can all have a positive or negative effect on the stock going up or down. According to Zweig (2006), “In an article in a women’s magazine many years ago we advised the readers to buy their stocks as they bought their groceries, not as they bought their perfume” (p. 8). This means doing the research to spot the best opportunities and leaving the emotion and outside appeal out of the decision to buy or sell. Simply watching the news or reading financial statements will not prepare one to have success in the short term. By the time news comes out the markets have already responded and most of the potential gains for investors are gone. Buying or selling a stock that does not have much volume can move it up or down. Small investors have little effect but large mutual funds and hedge funds can determine the minute-to-minute pricing of stocks through supply and demand (Cramer, 2005, p. 96). [...] Watching whether a stock is trending up or down can be a sure sign as to sell or buy in the short run. This is called the moving average or the average price of a stock over a specific period of time. As a stock is trending upward throughout a day or two it could be an opportunity for gains and as a stock trends downward it could be a great opportunity to short the stock. Many analysts use chart patterns in an attempt to forecast the market. Formulas and <b>market</b> <b>theories</b> have been developed to conquer short term trading. According to Masteika and Rutkauskas (2012), when viewing a stock's chart pattern over a few days, the investor should buy shortly after the highest chart bar and then place a trailing stop order which lets profits run and cuts losses in response to market price changes (p. 917-918). [...] Historically, on average the stock markets lowest weekday is Mondays which offers a potential sale on any given stock (Lynch, 2000). [...] Along with that, since 1950 most of the stock market's gains have occurred from November to April. Investor’s can use these known trends and averages to their advantage when trading. [...] Because short term trading {{can be very}} risky for small investors it has been advised by many professionals to limit short term trading and lean more towards value investing or buying and holding a position for the long term. According to Israelov and Katz (2011, p. 34), “Our suggestion (for long term investors) is to use short-term information for trade modification.” This strategy has the value investor reviewing his stocks balance sheets, market signals, and charts every couple months in order to buy more or sell. Trading in the short run is viewed as one of two things: gambling or the possibility of strategic investing.|$|E

40|$|Financial {{markets in}} less {{developed}} countries suffer from financial dualism, {{a situation in which}} a large informal sector coexists alongside a formal one. Contemporary financial <b>market</b> <b>theories</b> are not able to incorporate an understanding of the informal sector and are, therefore, only applicable to the formal system which is unsatisfying. With over 80 percent of the worlds population relying on informal financial arrangement (World Bank 2001), financial informality is not just a small exception. The intention of this dissertation is to show that financial <b>market</b> <b>theories</b> can never be applicable without considering OIE mechanisms. The reasoning is not only limited to informal/formal institutions in {{less developed countries}}, but also to developed countries. While politicians often argue that financial market fragmentation in less developed countries is caused by inefficient formal institutions, fragmentation in developed countries is caused by too efficient formal institutions. In this sense, the relevance of a financial market theory solely focusing on efficiency becomes questionable. The intention is to show that NIEOIE is not only a theoretical experiment, rather it builds the theoretical foundation for future financial <b>market</b> <b>theories...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{much of the}} {{research}} on human mate preference assumes that mate preference and partner choice will be related to some extent, evidence for correlations between mate preference and mate choice is mixed. Inspired by biological <b>market</b> <b>theories</b> of mate choice, which propose that individuals with greater market value will be better placed to translate their preference into choice, we investigated whether participants' own attractiveness modulated the relationship between their preference and choice. Multilevel modeling showed that experimentally assessed preferences for healthy-looking other-sex faces predicted third-party ratings of partner's facial health better among women whose faces were rated as more attractive by third parties. This pattern of results was not seen for men. These results suggest that the relationship between mate preference and mate choice may be more complex than was assumed in previous research, at least among women. Our results also highlight the utility of biological <b>market</b> <b>theories</b> for understanding the links between mate preference and partner choice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Following Peter and Olson’s seminal {{contribution}} to the marketing of ideas literature, this article explores the <b>marketing</b> of <b>theory.</b> It is argued that marketing discourse {{should be viewed as}} an ordering attempt, not as an order. From this perspective it becomes important that we explore how <b>marketing</b> <b>theory</b> comes to be ordered in the way it presently is, {{and the manner in which}} certain ideas develop or face extinction, in order to better understand what can or cannot be said in market-ing theory. In response, this article argues that a much needed turn in the paradigm debate should be toward the exploration of the institutionalization of <b>marketing</b> <b>theory.</b> It examines the social, economic and institutional logic underpinning <b>theory</b> production in <b>marketing</b> and demonstrates the influence of McCarthyism and the Cold War climate on <b>marketing</b> <b>theory.</b> Key Words • cold war • marketing history • <b>marketing</b> <b>theory</b> • paradigm politics • philanthropy [...] . the things which seem most self evident to us are formed in the confluence of encounters and chances, during the course of a precarious and fragile history.

40|$|The study investigates {{whether the}} main capital <b>market</b> <b>theories</b> and pricing models provide a {{reasonably}} accurate {{description of the}} working and efficiency of capital markets, of the pricing of shares and options and the effect the risk/return relationship has on investor behaviour. The capital <b>market</b> <b>theories</b> and pricing models {{included in the study}} are Portfolio Theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), Options Theory and the BlackScholes (8 -S) Option Pricing Model. The main conclusion of the study is that the main capital <b>market</b> <b>theories</b> and pricing models, as reviewed in the study, do provide a reasonably accurate description of reality, but a number of anomalies and controversial issues still need to be resolved. The main recommendation of the study is that research into these theories and models should continue unabated, while the specific recommendations in a South African context are the following: (1) the benefits of global diversification for South African investors should continue to be investigated; (2) the level and degree of efficiency of the JSE Securities Exchange SA (JSE) should continue to be monitored, and it should be established whether alternative theories to the EMH provide complementary or better descriptions of the efficiency of the South African market; (3) both the CAPM and the APT should continue to be tested, both individually and jointly, in order to better understand the pricing mechanism of, and risk/return relationship on the JSE; (4) much South African research still needs to be conducted on the efficiency of the relatively new options market and the application of the B-S Option Pricing Model under South African conditions.

40|$|This study {{employs the}} cointegrating VAR {{approach}} to characterise {{the relationships between}} the five exchange rates comprising the TWI and the share market in New Zealand.

In the long run, the empirical results for the relationship between the NZ-US dollar exchange rate and the overall share market index support both the portfolio balance and goods <b>market</b> <b>theories.</b> In the short run, the portfolio balance theory is further supported by all the exchange rates but the goods market theory is supported significantly only by the NZ-Australian dollar exchange rate.
