For instance, in the single-linkage clustering method, {{the distance between}} two clusters is defined to be the <b>minimum</b> <b>distance</b> between any two points from each cluster. Given this distance between clusters, a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters.|$|E

40|$|Error control codes {{have been}} widely used in data {{communications}} and storage systems. One central problem in coding theory is to optimize the parameters of a linear code and construct codes with best possible parameters. There are tables of best-known linear codes over finite fields of sizes up to 9. Recently, there has been a growing interest in codes over F_ 13 and other fields of size greater than 9. The main purpose of this work is to present a database of best-known linear codes over the field F_ 13 together with upper bounds on the <b>minimum</b> <b>distances.</b> To find good linear codes to establish lower bounds on <b>minimum</b> <b>distances,</b> an iterative heuristic computer search algorithm is employed to construct quasi-twisted (QT) codes over the field F_ 13 with high <b>minimum</b> <b>distances.</b> A large number of new linear codes have been found, improving previously best-known results. Tables of [pm, m] QT codes over F_ 13 with best-known <b>minimum</b> <b>distances</b> as well as a table of lower and upper bounds on the <b>minimum</b> <b>distances</b> for linear codes of length up to 150 and dimension up to 6 are presented...|$|R

5|$|The {{most stable}} and dense form of {{selenium}} is gray {{and has a}} hexagonal crystal lattice consisting of helical polymeric chains, where the Se-Se distance is 237.3pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 130.1°. The <b>minimum</b> <b>distance</b> between chains is 343.6pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten Se, or by condensing Se vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are insulators, gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable photoconductivity. Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS2. It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing acids. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.|$|E

Most European countries and some US states require front and rear lights at night, while others allow reflectors only at the rear. Some jurisdictions impose requirements on light output and the size of lamp and reflector lenses; some require compliance with standards defined by third parties; some simply stipulate a <b>minimum</b> <b>distance</b> from which any lighting device should be visible. In some jurisdictions such as Germany and the Netherlands, flashing red tail lights are illegal, in others they are allowed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} book, Hipparchus starts from the {{opposite}} extreme assumption: he assigns a (<b>minimum)</b> <b>distance</b> to the Sun of 490 Earth radii. This would correspond to a parallax of 7', which is apparently the greatest parallax that Hipparchus thought would not be noticed (for comparison: the typical resolution of the human eye is about 2'; Tycho Brahe made naked eye observation with an accuracy down to 1'). In this case, {{the shadow of the}} Earth is a cone rather than a cylinder as under the first assumption. Hipparchus observed (at lunar eclipses) that at the mean distance of the Moon, the diameter of the shadow cone is 2+½ lunar diameters. That apparent diameter is, as he had observed, 360/650 degrees. With these values and simple geometry, Hipparchus could determine the mean distance; because it was computed for a <b>minimum</b> <b>distance</b> of the Sun, it is the maximum mean distance possible for the Moon. With his value for the eccentricity of the orbit, he could compute the least and greatest distances of the Moon too. According to Pappus, he found a least distance of 62, a mean of 67+1/3, and consequently a greatest distance of 72+2/3 Earth radii. With this method, as the parallax of the Sun decreases (i.e., its distance increases), the minimum limit for the mean distance is 59 Earth radii – exactly the mean distance that Ptolemy later derived.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to having a diffusive effect on ion transport, water molecules also form hydration shells around individual ions due to their polar nature. The hydration shell not only shields the charge on ions from other ions but also modulates the ion radial distribution function causing the formation of peaks and troughs. The average <b>minimum</b> <b>distance</b> between two ions is increased as there is always at least one layer of water molecules present between them, acting as a physical deterrent preventing two ions from getting too close to each other, {{in a manner that}} is similar to the short-range repulsive component of the Lennard-Jones potential.|$|E

40|$|Symbol-pair read channels, {{in which}} the outputs of the read process are pairs of {{consecutive}} symbols, were recently studied by Cassuto and Blaum. This new paradigm is motivated by {{the limitations of the}} reading process in high density data storage systems. They studied error correction in this new paradigm, specifically, the relationship between the <b>minimum</b> Hamming <b>distance</b> of an error correcting code and the <b>minimum</b> pair <b>distance,</b> which is the <b>minimum</b> Hamming <b>distance</b> between symbol-pair vectors derived from codewords of the code. It was proved that for a linear cyclic code with <b>minimum</b> Hamming <b>distance</b> d_H, the corresponding <b>minimum</b> pair <b>distance</b> is at least d_H + 3. In this paper, we show that, for a given linear cyclic code with a <b>minimum</b> Hamming <b>distance</b> d_H, the <b>minimum</b> pair <b>distance</b> is at least d_H + (d_H/ 2). We then describe a decoding algorithm, based upon a bounded distance decoder for the cyclic code, whose symbol-pair error correcting capabilities reflect the larger <b>minimum</b> pair <b>distance.</b> Finally, we consider the case where the read channel output is a larger number, b ≥ 3, of consecutive symbols, and we provide extensions of several concepts, results, and code constructions to this setting...|$|R
25|$|As no {{evidence}} indicates passerines were flightless {{when they arrived}} on New Zealand (that apomorphy is extremely rare and unevenly distributed in Passeriformes), they are not required by present theories to have been distinct in the Mesozoic. As unequivocal Passeriformes are known from Australia some 55 Mya, the acanthisittids' ancestors likely arrived in the Late Paleocene from Australia or the then-temperate Antarctic coasts. Plate tectonics indicate that the shortest distance between New Zealand and those two continents was roughly 1,500km (1,000 miles) at that time. New Zealand's <b>minimum</b> <b>distance</b> from Australia {{is a bit more}} today – some 1,700km/1,100 miles - whereas it is now at least 2,500km (1,550 miles) from Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reproduction}} occurs {{after one}} year. Spawning is {{triggered by the}} first rains and occurs in the warm and rainy season. As a callichthyine, it builds a bubble nest; among callichthyines, this species {{is reported to have}} the most complex nest structure. This dome-shaped nest is rich with oxygen; in the hypoxic water conditions of tropical swamps, the main function of the bubble nest appears to be to provide oxygen to the developing eggs by lifting the eggs above the water surface while protecting them from desiccation. It may also serve to protect the brood against predators, regulate temperature, identify the center of the male's territory, and to synchronize reproductive activities. Nest-building activities usually lasted from 1,000 to 1,500 hours, but only on clear and warm days, particularly during the hottest hours. These activities are also reported to occur at night. Most nests are built in newly flooded swamps, especially in open water in the peripheral area of the swamp. A <b>minimum</b> <b>distance</b> of 10metres between nests is observed. The nest is the centre of a territory that is vigorously defended by the male, using its enlarged pectoral spines. The diameter and height of the nest average 30 and 6cm (12 and 2.36in), respectively.|$|E
