5|$|Two years later, four {{units of}} vacuum {{fluorescent}} displays (VFD) were {{mounted on the}} ceiling. Eight units of dynamic route maps were mounted above every door in each car in trainset 053/054 for a two-month trial. This new SMRT Active Route <b>Map</b> <b>Information</b> System (STARiS) was then progressively introduced to all C151 trainsets, and subsequently to C651 and C751B trains for a cost of S$12 million—S$20,000 per car. It became standard equipment on all new rolling stocks subsequently introduced on the East-West Line and North-South Line.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Range Rover was given a minor facelift, consisting mainly of redesigned and repositioned switchgear (which saw many of the originally BMW era designed items updated or replaced), along with new options never before available for Range Rover. The 2010 Range Rover also gained new visual display units as also seen in the new for 2010 Jaguar XJ (X351). This change consisted of a 12-inch TFT LCD virtual instrument panel, which replaces the conventional cluster design — instead 'virtual' gauges are displayed where physical analog gauges were previously. This allows various sets of information to be displayed as required — for example navigation and <b>map</b> <b>information</b> can be displayed instead of engine readouts, whilst {{when one of the}} off-road driving modes is selected on the Terrain Response system the 'gauges' are reorganised to provide space to display the schematic of the vehicle's suspension, steering and transmission systems. The other display unit is fitted to the centre console and uses a bi-directional screen to show different images depending on viewing angle (may not be available in the US). This allows navigational information to be displayed to the driver, whilst someone in the front passenger seat can use the same screen to use the onboard DVD player at the same time, for example. This system also contains a state-of-the-art multi-camera system from Valeo Vision Systems in Ireland, which allows the driver to see around the vehicle during manoeuvres and which contains multiple overlays and views.|$|E
