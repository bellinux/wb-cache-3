There is a growing and unfulfilled need for predictive animal models that can improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention. Integration of MRI and NMR could extend the application of experimental data into the clinical setting. This study investigated the ability of MRI and <b>metabolic</b> <b>NMR</b> to detect and quantify inflammation-mediated lung injury. Pulmonary inflammation was induced in male B 6 C 3 F 1 mice by intratracheal administration of IL- 1 β and TNF-α under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice underwent MRI at 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after dosing. At 6 and 24 h lungs were harvested for <b>metabolic</b> <b>NMR</b> analysis. Data acquired from IL- 1 β+TNF-α-treated animals were compared with saline-treated control mice. The hyperintense-to-total lung volume (HTLV) ratio derived from MRI was higher in IL- 1 β+TNF-α-treated mice compared with control at 2, 4, and 6 h but returned to control levels by 24 h. The ability of MRI to detect pulmonary inflammation was confirmed by the association between HTLV ratio and histological and pathological end points. Principal component analysis of NMR-detectable metabolites also showed a temporal pattern for which energy metabolism-based biomarkers were identified. These data demonstrate that both MRI and <b>metabolic</b> <b>NMR</b> have utility in the detection and quantification of inflammation-mediated lung injury.

Among the available methods, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a technique that can provide insights into the integration and regulation of plant metabolism through a combination of in vivo and in vitro measurements. Thus NMR can be used to identify, quantify, and localize metabolites, to define the intracellular environment, and to explore pathways and their operation. We review these applications and their significance from a metabolic perspective. Topics of current interest include applications of NMR to metabolic flux analysis, metabolite profiling, and metabolite imaging.

The ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and <b>metabolic</b> <b>NMR</b> were investigated to detect and quantify inflammation-mediated lung injury [69]. Recently, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 [*]H-NMR) based quantitative metabolomics with subsequent computational analysis was applied to investigate the plasma metabolic changes associated with sepsis-induced ALI. Several metabolites including glutathione, adenosine, phosphatidylserine, and sphingomyelin were found different between patients with ALI and healthy subjects. Additionally, computational network analysis was carried out to investigate a distinct metabolic pathway for each metabolite [24]. Moreover, there is another case-control study conducted on plasma samples from six albumin-treated and six saline-treated patients to measure the metabolic changes after albumin treatment. This study showed that blood albumin levels normalized and oxygenation improved with albumin treatment compared to saline treatment. In this study, 1 [*]H-NMR spectroscopy was introduced to characterize systemic metabolic responses and identify patients’ unique response to pharmacologic therapy and appealed to play a potential role in the guiding treatment and reducing healthcare cost [68].|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Probing {{the complex}} fusion of genetic and {{environmental}} interactions, metabolic profiling (or metabolomics/metabonomics), {{the study of}} small molecules involved in metabolic reactions, is a rapidly expanding 'omics' field. A major technique for capturing metabolite data is 1 H-NMR spectroscopy and this yields highly complex profiles that require sophisticated statistical analysis methods. However, experimental data is difficult to control and expensive to obtain. Thus data simulation is a productive route to aid algorithm development. Results MetAssimulo is a MATLAB-based package that has been developed to simulate 1 H-NMR spectra of complex mixtures such as metabolic profiles. Drawing data from a metabolite standard spectral database in conjunction with concentration information input by the user or constructed automatically from the Human Metabolome Database, MetAssimulo is able to create realistic metabolic profiles containing large numbers of metabolites {{with a range of}} user-defined properties. Current features include the simulation of two groups ('case' and 'control') specified by {{means and standard deviations of}} concentrations for each metabolite. The software enables addition of spectral noise with a realistic autocorrelation structure at user controllable levels. A crucial feature of the algorithm is its ability to simulate both intra- and inter-metabolite correlations, the analysis of which is fundamental to many techniques in the field.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{developed}} an automated variable-sized bucketing procedure based on statistical relationships between neighboring variables, obtained by traditional 0. 001 ppm wide bucketing, to recouple into a cluster the points belonging to <b>metabolic</b> <b>NMR</b> signals. This Statistical Recoupling of Variables (SRV) procedure acts as an efficient noise-removing filter and identifies new variables, which have physical, chemical or biological meaning. This allows a large reduction {{of the number of}} variables and thus counters the "curse of dimensionality" observed in the "-omics" sciences. SRV can be used in combination with multiple hypothesis testing corrections to evaluate the statistical significance of variations observed on the metabolic phenotypes discriminating the populations under study. It is thus possible after SRV to extract candidate biomarkers whose single variations are sufficient to sustain the discrimination. In a more comprehensive approach, SRV can be associated with Statistical Total Correlation Spectroscopy (STOCSY) to yield a recoupled form (R-STOCSY) and obtain a clear 2 D pseudo-spectrum displaying spin and metabolic correlations. These correlations can then be identified as metabolic connectivities. By considering the shortest path length between the metabolites involved in these correlations, it is possible to visualize the perturbed metabolic network associated with a given pathophysiological condition, and to assess the robustness of the overall analysis. These approaches together provide a powerful way to secure the interpretation of metabonomics data. In the case of perturbation of minor intensity, we added an orthogonal filter to focus on the effect under scrutiny, which would otherwise be diluted in the complexity of the data set. We illustrate this ability in whole organism NMR based studies.

Objective: To use a new systems approach to provide an overview of host metabolism and the developing immune system in response to nutritional intervention around the weaning period. Design: Piglets (n¼ 14) were weaned onto either an eggbased or soya-based diet at 3 weeks until 7 weeks, when all piglets were switched onto a fish-based diet. Half the animals on each weaning diet received Bifidobacterium lactis NCC 2818 supplementation from weaning onwards. Immunoglobulin production from immunologically relevant intestinal sites was quantified and the urinary 1 H <b>NMR</b> <b>metabolic</b> profile was obtained from each animal at post mortem (11 weeks). Results: Different weaning diets induced divergent and sustained shifts in the metabolic phenotype, which resulted in the alteration of urinary gut microbial co-metabolites, even after 4 weeks of dietary standardisation. B lactis NCC 2818 supplementation affected the systemic metabolism of the different weaning diet groups over and above the effects of diet. Additionally, production of gut mucosa-associated IgA and IgM was found to depend upon the weaning diet and on B lactis NCC 2818 supplementation. Conclusion: The correlation of urinary 1 H <b>NMR</b> <b>metabolic</b> profile with mucosal immunoglobulin production was demonstrated, thus confirming the value of this multiplatform approach in uncovering non-invasive biomarkers of immunity.

Both analytical methods enabled the establishment of reproducible <b>metabolic</b> profiles. <b>NMR</b> analysis identified a total of 32 metabolites while GC-MS identified 51. The results demonstrate {{that not only is}} pyrene toxic to L. rubellus, but that alterations in its normal metabolic profile could be observed even when individuals were exposed to concentrations of 40 mg kg- 1 : a pollution level that is both below the concentration previously found to significantly reduce reproduction and within the range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found on some contaminated sites. Pyrene was found to cause a dose dependant decrease in lactate and the concentrations of the saturated fatty acids tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic and octadecanoic acid and an increase in production of the amino acids alanine, leucine, valine, isoleucine, lysine, tyrosine and methionine. It is proposed that this indicates impaired glucose metabolism, with an associated increase in fatty acid metabolism and changes in TCA cycle intermediates. This study demonstrates the versatility of metabolomics as a tool to monitor toxicity in the environment as opposed to utilising model species studied in a laboratory setting.

With its ability to discover new <b>metabolic</b> markers, <b>NMR</b> <b>metabolic</b> profiling (metabonomics), coupled with pattern recognition methods, represents a highly effective approach for disease development and characterization. The purpose of the present thesis is to explore the recent NMR improvements by applying and developing new metabolomic strategies for biomarkers discovery, including NMR data handling, peaks quantification and fast data acquisition. We applied NMR spectroscopy and regression techniques to different patient classes to discriminate a) the progressive liver alterations during tumorigenesis and b) the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with airway diseases. In the first application a) Principal component analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (O 2 PLS-DA) showed that the disease evolution clearly followed the increase of the lactate together with the remarkable decrease of the glucose signal, thus suggesting that such a signal pattern may act as a potential marker for assessing pathological hepatic lesions. In particular, we identified a statistical model {{that could be used to}} distinguish hepatic metastasis and human hepatocarcinoma from a "normal" (healthy) hepatic tissue. In the second application b) we investigated the role of pre-analytical variables (saliva and disinfectant contamination), potentially influencing EBC, to evaluate the stability and reproducibility of samples and to discriminate healthy subjects from patients with airway disease. Our results show that saliva does not hamper EBC discrimination of different samples, while the disinfectant could act as a strong contaminant. However, by selecting specific non-contaminated regions of spectra, Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was able to discriminate EBC of healthy subjects, laryngectomized and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As a further enhanced tool for high thoughput NMR analysis, we developed and tested a new integration method for 2 D NMR spectra quantification, called CAKE, based upon NMR axial symmetry and Monte Carlo Hit-or-Miss technique. Integration tests on simulated and experimental peaks with different degree of overlap, showed the CAKE efficacy in estimating umbiased peak volume, even for strongly overlapping peaks. Moreover, it is substantially independent on digital resolution and SNR. Finally, we successfully investigated the possibility of exploiting enhanced NMR pulse sequences for fast spectra acquisition.

To accommodate limited sample volume and {{to take into account the}} compositional differences between adult and infant biofluids, we developed and optimized sample handling and analytical procedures for studying urine from newborns. A robust pipeline for <b>metabolic</b> profiling using <b>NMR</b> spectroscopy was established, encompassing sample collection, preparation, spectroscopic measurement and computational analysis. Longitudinal samples were collected from five infants from birth until 14 months of age. Methods of extraction, effects of freezing and sample dilution were assessed and urinary contaminants from breakdown of polymers in a range of diapers and cotton wool balls were identified and compared, including propylene glycol, acrylic acid and tert-butanol. Finally, assessment of urinary profiles obtained over the first few weeks of life revealed a dramatic change in composition, with concentrations of phenols, amino acids and betaine altering systematically over the first few months of life. Therefore, neonatal samples require more stringent standardization of experimental design, sample handling and analysis compared to adult samples in order to accommodate the variability and limited sample volume...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Melanins are enigmatic {{pigments}} {{found in}} all biological kingdoms {{that are associated with}} a variety of functions, including microbial virulence. Despite being ubiquitous in nature, melanin pigments have long resisted atomic-level structural examination because of their insolubility and amorphous organization. Cryptococcus neoformans is a human pathogenic fungus that melanizes only when provided with exogenous substrate, thus offering a unique system for exploring questions related to melanin structure at the molecular level. We have exploited the requirement for exogenous substrate in melanin synthesis as well as the capabilities of high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to establish the predominantly aliphatic composition of L-dopa melanin and to introduce 13 C labels that permit the identification of proximal carbons in the developing biopolymer. By swelling solid melanin samples in organic solvents and using two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR in conjunction with magic-angle spinning, we have identified chemical bonding patterns typical of alkane, alkene, alcohol, ketone, ester, and indole functional groups. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of a novel approach to determining the structure of melanin using <b>metabolic</b> labeling and <b>NMR</b> spectroscopy. Melanins make up a heterogeneous class of natural pigments that have a myriad of biological functions, includ...|$|R
40|$|Brain tumours are {{the most}} common solid tumours in {{children}} and a major cause of childhood mortality. The most common paediatric brain tumours include ependymomas, cerebellar astrocytomas and medulloblastomas. These brain tumours are highly heterogeneous regarding their histology, prognosis and therapeutic response. Subtle biochemical changes can be detected in intact tissues by High-Resolution Proton Magnetic Angle Spinning Spectroscopy (HR-MAS) revealing the status of tumour microheterogeneity and metabolic alterations before they are morphologically detectable. In this study, we present metabolic profiles by HR-MAS of 20 intact tissue samples from paediatric brain tumours. Tumour types include ependymoma, medulloblastoma and pilocytic astrocytoma. The metabolic characterization of paediatric brain tumour tissue by HR-MAS spectroscopy provided differential patterns for these tumours. The metabolic composition of the tumour tissue was highly consistent with previous in vivo and ex vivo studies. Some resonances detected in this work and not previously observed by in vivo spectroscopy also show potential in determining tumour type and grade (fatty acids, phenylalanine, glutamate). Overall, this work suggests that the additional information obtained by <b>NMR</b> <b>metabolic</b> profiling applied to tissue from paediatric brain tumours may be useful for assessing tumour grade and determining optimum treatment strategies...|$|R
40|$|Fibrotic {{remodeling}} is {{a process}} common to chronic lung diseases such as {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and asthma. Based on preclinical studies phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) inhibitors may exhibit beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-remodeling properties for the treatment of these respiratory disorders. Effects of PDE 4 inhibitors on changes in the lung metabolome in models of pulmonary fibrotic remodeling have not yet been explored. This work studies the effects of the PDE 4 inhibitor roflumilast on changes in the lung metabolome in the common murine model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis by nuclear magnetic resonance (<b>NMR)</b> <b>metabolic</b> profiling of intact lung tissue. Metabolic profiling reveals strong differences between fibrotic and non-fibrotic tissue. These differences include increases in proline, glycine, lactate, taurine, phosphocholine and total glutathione and decreases in global fatty acids. In parallel, there was a loss in plasma BH 4. This profile suggests that bleomycin produces alterations in the oxidative equilibrium, a strong inflammatory response and activation of the collagen synthesis among others. Roflumilast prevented most of these metabolic effects associated to pulmonary fibrosis suggesting a favorable anti-fibrotic profile...|$|R

[50] {{investigated}} the La Rioja wine terroir using 1 H NMR metabolomics of must and wine samples obtained from different wineries located {{in this area}} of central Spain, reporting that the aliphatic alcohols isopentanol and isobutanol were key biomarkers for differentiating wineries located very close geographically. 1 H NMR metabolomics has also been used to characterize the terroir effect on the quality of Aglianico red wines from the Campania region of Italy [14]. Multivariate analysis of the NMR metabolite data demonstrated that the differentiation observed among wines produced from three different vineyards was related to microclimate and the carbonate, clay, and organic matter content of soils. In a study of wines produced in the Bordeaux region in France, Pereira et al. [51] showed that the <b>NMR</b> <b>metabolic</b> profile of wines was affected within a given wine cultivar by soil type (gravely, sandy, or clay), but vintage and cultivar effects were more dominant. Da Silva Neto et al. [52] used 1 H NMR metabolomics to characterize the metabolic profile of “tropical” wines produced in the region of São Francisco River Valley in northeast Brazil, aiming to compare tropical wines to those produced in more temperate wine-producing zones in Brazil.|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} NMR based {{approach}} {{to determine the}} metabolic reprogramming of Chinese hamster ovary cells upon a temperature shift during culture by investigating the extracellular cell culture media and intracellular metabolome of CHOK 1 and CHO-S cells during culture {{and in response to}} cold-shock and subsequent recovery from hypothermic culturing. A total of 24 components were identified for CHOK 1 and 29 components identified for CHO-S cell systems including the observation that CHO-S media contains 5. 6 times the level of glucose of CHOK 1 media at time zero. We confirm that an <b>NMR</b> <b>metabolic</b> approach provides quantitative analysis of components such as glucose and alanine with both cell lines responding in a similar manner and comparable to previously reported data. However, analysis of lactate confirms a differentiation between CHOK 1 and CHO-S and that reprogramming of metabolism in response to temperature was cell line specific. The significance of our results is presented using principal component analysis (PCA) that confirms changes in metabolite profile in response to temperature and recovery. Ultimately, our approach demonstrates the capability of NMR providing real-time analysis to detect reprogramming of metabolism upon cellular perception of cold-shock/sub-physiological temperatures. This has the potential to allow manipulation of metabolites in culture supernatant to improve growth or productivity...|$|R
40|$|RCC usually {{develops}} and progresses asymptomatically and, when detected, it {{is frequently}} at advanced stages and metastatic, entailing a dismal prognosis. Therefore, {{there is an}} obvious demand for new strategies enabling an earlier diagnosis. The importance of metabolic rearrangements for carcinogenesis unlocked a new approach for cancer research, catalyzing {{the increased use of}} metabolomics. The present study aimed the <b>NMR</b> <b>metabolic</b> profiling of RCC in urine samples from a cohort of RCC patients (n = 42) and controls (n = 49). The methodology entailed variable selection of the spectra in tandem with multivariate analysis and validation procedures. The retrieval of a disease signature was preceded by a systematic evaluation of the impacts of subject age, gender, BMI, and smoking habits. The impact of confounders on the urine metabolomics profile of this population is residual compared to that of RCC. A 32 -metabolite/resonance signature descriptive of RCC was unveiled, successfully distinguishing RCC patients from controls in principal component analysis. This work demonstrates the value of a systematic metabolomics workflow for the identification of robust urinary metabolic biomarkers of RCC. Future studies should entail the validation of the 32 -metabolite/resonance signature found for RCC in independent cohorts, as well as biological validation of the putative hypotheses advanced...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Large {{differences}} {{in the composition of}} diet between early development and adulthood can have detrimental effects on obesity risk. We examined the effects of an intermittent high fat/sucrose diet (HFS) on satiety hormone and serum metabolite response in disparate diets. Wistar rat pups were fed control (C), high prebiotic fiber (HF) or high protein (HP) diets (weaning to 16 weeks), HFS diet challenged (6 weeks), and finally reverted to their respective C, HF, or HP diet (4 weeks). At conclusion, measurement of body composition and satiety hormones was accompanied by 1 H <b>NMR</b> <b>metabolic</b> profiles in fasted and postprandial states. Metabolomic profiling predicted dietary source with> 90 % accuracy. The HF group was characterized by lowest body weight and body fat (P < 0. 05) and increased satiety hormone levels (glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide-YY). Regularized modeling confirmed that the HF diet is associated with higher gut hormone secretion that could reflect the known effects of prebiotics on gut microbiota and their fementative end products, the short chain fatty acids. Rats reared on a HF diet appear to experience fewer adverse effects from an intermittent high fat diet in adulthood when rematched to their postnatal diet. Metabolite profiles associated with the diets provide a distinct biochemical signature of their effects...|$|R
