40|$|The {{relationship}} between sport and hegemonic masculinity {{has been well}} documented by research {{since the beginning of the}} 1980 s. Both as an institution as well as a performative phenomenon, sport has a long tradi-tion of being seen as a place where parents could send their sons and then close their eyes, the best environment to create “real men, ” creating and showcasing not only the physical prowess associated with great men, but also displaying “true ” masculine virtues. Among these values, normative heterosexuality is featured as one of the most important virtues to evaluate and measure athlete men. However, to be considered at the top of the “masculine ” rank, athletes are not sup-posed to be merely heterosexual, but, as David Coad argues in his book, they need to “provide constant visible proof of heterosexuality ” (p. 14). By the end of the twentieth century, though, things have started to change. <b>Metrosexual</b> <b>men</b> showing an interest in fashionable clothes and acces-sories, as well as high-profile athletes coming out and declaring their homosexuality, some during their careers and some after retirement, and similar events have started to make some cracks in the solid masculine world of sports. These cracks are now explored in two books: David Coad’s book focusing on the metrosexual phenomenon in sports, its para-doxes and its challenge to sport gender structures, and Eric Anderson’s book focusing on—and offering extremely refined data about—men who “maintain a sexual orientation, identity, and behaviors that are consistent with their notion of gay ” (p. 6). Despite some interconnections—both deal with new masculinities in the sports world and how these have not only been affected by but are also transforming this world in terms of gender perspective and sexuality—the two books have clearly different approaches, use distinctly different languages, and focus on different masculinities...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade of the twentieth century both ’manhood’ and gender studies seems to have {{undergone}} changes. With the field of masculinity and the critical studies of men, added as ’subsections’ of broader gender studies, new knowledge has been produced to better grasp the production of gender and power relations of patriarchy. During the same decade as the ’metrosexual’ first appeared of the urban stage, acts of homophobia and attitudes towards ’manhood’ seems to have changed. The ’macho’ ideal from the eighties apparently gave way for a more inclusive and gentle masculinity and this ’softening’ of men resulted in ’the new man’ or ’new masculinity’. Brittish journalist and author Mark Simpson, who published the first ’obersvation’ of metrosexuality back in the nineties, now proposes that a new generation of <b>metrosexual</b> <b>men</b> have entered the international stage of masculinity. He calls them ’spornosexuals’. According to Simpson they are the heirs of the metrosexuals widened or feminized masculinity but instead of ’new man’ attitudes, fashion and grooming they focus their attention towards their own well chiseled, lean muscular and defined male bodies. This paper reviews academic texts on men, masculinity and the male body in an attempt to create a sociological understanding of the spornosexual expression and practice. Under slutet av förra seklet verkade både ”manlighet” och genusvetenskap ha förändrats.

Samma årtionde som den ”metrosexuella” mannen dök upp, verkade homofobi ha minskat och attityder kring manlighet förändrats. ”Macho-idealet” från åttiotalet hade till synes givit vika för en mera öppen och mildare maskulinitet, och denna mjukare manlighet resulterade i föreställningar om ”den nya mannen”.
