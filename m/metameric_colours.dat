40|$|Image {{spectroscopy}} {{may allow}} identifying the materials present on a painting surface in a non-invasive way. The proposed method aims at optimizing, and thus reducing, {{the number of}} filters employed, while still providing a robust method, that achieves similar performances as traditional ones, which in turn employ {{a large number of}} filters. Moreover, we targeted the identification of the pigments present on the outer layer of a painting independently from their thickness, the underlying background or support, the binder employed, their aging and acquisition set-up. In order to achieve this objective, a relevant number of swatches have been prepared, on different supports and with different thicknesses and binding mediums. Spectral reflectance curves of such chemically known pictorial layers have been recorded by means of a spectrometer and a spectrophotometer. A novel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based approach has been devised to select the most relevant wavebands, i. e. those that allow the most effective discrimination among (quasi) <b>metameric</b> <b>colours,</b> which are thus not to be distinguished with the naked eye or with an RGB camera. Comparisons of results using the 13 filters available on the filter wheel and of a selection of only 3 and 4 filters, support the idea of the simplified version investigated in this paper being a viable alternativ...|$|E
40|$|Colour is {{the high}} level result of {{biological}} processing within the eye and brain and as such presents problems to standard computer vision theory. To {{be able to make}} sensible use of colour {{it is important to understand}} some of the early processing stages within the eye and how these can help to explain the perception we have of colour. This paper discusses our perception of colour and outlines these early biological processing stages. A discussion then follows explaining the various methods, standards and colour spaces, with particular reference to the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage standard, that can be used to make use of colour information within a computer system.
