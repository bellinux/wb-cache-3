25|$|Shasta Hall, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>say,</b> is haunted. Students {{have talked}} {{for years about}} a ghost in the building's theatre who {{disrupts}} play openings. Some think is a state building inspector who fell to his death in the building before it was completed. Now a popular coffee spot, the Roundhouse was controversial when {{it was built in}} 1969. Its design put off many people, and President Robert Johns apparently arranged for its construction without the approval of the CSU Board of Trustees. Sequoia Hall was originally constructed to have an attractive white cement finish, but the funding ran short. Today the building stands with plain concrete.|$|E

DeCandido said that the addition of Goldberg as Guinan was [...] "delightful", but that Diana Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski [...] "didn't entirely work as a character". In his view, the episodes during season two were varied in quality. He gave [...] "Q Who" [...] ten out of ten, while he gave [...] "Shades of Grey" [...] a zero. It {{was the first time he}} awarded the top score to an episode; none of the first season had qualified. He gave the season an overall mark of seven out of ten and said that [...] "Far too <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> that TNG didn't come into its own until the third season, and frankly, I think that that estimation comes a year too late." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2007 Beat the Blizzard webzine's article, {{the writer}} Jan Lindsø states that [...] "any metal fans {{are of the}} opinion that Christians should 'not be allowed' to use the black metal {{aesthetics}} musically since they do not inherit this evil and perhaps misantropic [...] trait that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> is necessary in order to be convincing as black metal musicians". Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. I mean, {{if you want to be}} a Christian, be it with all you've got, and if you want to be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing at all to do in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E

[...] "It was {{certainly}} never brilliant, {{but she would not}} allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face." [...] He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had heard <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> the same--but yet he must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was.|$|E

The road, hard-beaten, is wide and dusty, the necks of the camels sway, the drivers shout, there is the smell of sweat, of leather, of oil. The {{alkaline}} dust blinds and blisters. Physical weariness and suffering shut out all else. This {{is no place to}} look for heavenly visitors. You would be a fool to expect a demonstration there. But at night when the beasts are at rest, when the cool, starry sky bends close, when the tent-flaps are closed, then the old men sit about and commune with their dead--as all primitive, natural peoples do.|$|E
