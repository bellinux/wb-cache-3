40|$|Purpose: The {{primary goal}} {{of this article was}} to conceptualize a {{systematic}} <b>marketing</b> <b>intelligence</b> process for industrial manufacturers because, up until now, such concepts have only been focused on consumer goods settings. Hence, this article investigates how <b>marketing</b> <b>intelligence</b> activities are developed and managed effectively in industrial markets. Methodology/approach: The authors conducted a case study of Maschinenfabrik Reinhausen, a German based manufacturer of regulation technology for power transformers. Findings: We found that a systematic <b>marketing</b> <b>intelligence</b> process should be based on the resource- and market-based view of strategy {{as well as on the}} market orientation construct. When implementing <b>marketing</b> <b>intelligence,</b> the integration of the sales force within the whole process is the crucial lever for an industrial company. The formalization of the process is necessary to ensure its continuity and acceptance; however, the varying intensity allows the necessary flexibility of the process. Research implications: The constraints of the decisive process steps of <b>marketing</b> <b>intelligence</b> have to be further enhanced for industrial markets. It is important to find out how the integration of the sales force can best be designed to incorporate reward systems and motivation structures, and how to establish a corporate marketing-minded culture throughout the organization. Practical implications: The important steps for a well implemented <b>marketing</b> <b>intelligence</b> process are a preparation phase, followed by the gathering, analysis, and dissemination of information. This article highlights the success factors for each process step. Above all, managerial and organizational commitment is necessary for the implementation of the whole process.

Businesses are able to tap and analyze the customer voices and feedback generated in social media for marketing purposes; in this sense the social media is a relatively inexpensive source of <b>market</b> <b>intelligence</b> which can be used by marketers and managers to track and respond to consumer-identified problems and detect market opportunities. For example, the Internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 [...] "bend test" [...] which showed that the coveted phone could be bent by hand pressure.

However, Apple promptly issued a statement saying that the problem was extremely rare and that the company had taken several steps to make the mobile device's case stronger and robust.
