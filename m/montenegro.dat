After being forced out of Serbia by the Germans, Mihailović arrived in <b>Montenegro</b> as the Italians and Chetniks were fighting the Partisans. Mihailović was accompanied by his staff and a British Special Operations Executive (SOE) liaison officer. He eventually established his base {{in the village of}} Gornje Lipovo, a few miles from Đurišić's headquarters at Kolašin. Mihailović and his staff had few troops and relied on Đurišić for protection. Soon after Mihailović arrived in <b>Montenegro,</b> Đurišić told Mihailović's SOE liaison officer that he was available to act independently and in defiance of Mihailović.

5|$|The {{creation}} of an Axis puppet-state known as the Kingdom of <b>Montenegro</b> was proclaimed on 12 July 1941. The state was to be headed by an Italian regent and led by Drljević and his supporters.

Having assumed power the previous day, Drljević established the Provisional Administrative Committee of <b>Montenegro,</b> a collaborationist entity which was a territorial component of the Italian Empire. He also organized his followers to fight against Montenegrin Chetniks and the Yugoslav Partisans. In September, he was dismissed from office by the Italians.|$|E

5|$|In December 1942, Chetniks from <b>Montenegro</b> and Sandžak met at {{a conference}} in the village of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje. The conference was {{dominated}} by Montenegrin Serb Chetnik commander Major Pavle Đurišić and its resolutions expressed extremism and intolerance, as well as an agenda which focused on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by his chief of staff, Major Zaharije Ostojić, who had previously been encouraged by Mihailović to wage a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of <b>Montenegro</b> and the Sandžak.|$|E

Because of the weakness of their own forces, the Germans contributed by commanding and supplying the troops involved, and providing smaller mobile armoured units with heavy weapons. The Chetnik leaders provided most of the troops. In February and March, the Germans and numerous Chetnik units undertook a series of operations codenamed Bora, Baumblüte and Vorfrühling around Podgorica.|$|E
