40|$|As {{reliance}} on excessively short-term wholesale funding {{has been one}} of the major causes for the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis, recent advances in global liquidity regulation try to curb the excessive {{reliance on}} short-term wholesale funding without being clear on how such an approach will affect the overall equilibrium on <b>money</b> <b>markets.</b> In particular, liquidity regulation may interfere with the central bank's influence on short-term <b>money</b> <b>market</b> rates.

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{attempted}} to determine why <b>money</b> <b>market</b> interest rates are positively correlated with unanticipated increases in the money stock by examining the response of the foreign exchange and stock <b>markets</b> to <b>money</b> announcements. They report a significant positive relationship between the trade-weighted exchange rate and unanticipated increases in the money stock and a significant negative relationship between unanticipated increases in the money stock and stock prices. These results are taken as evidence in favor of the "unanticipated-liquidity-effect" explanation of the <b>money</b> <b>market's</b> response. This <b>paper</b> analyzes the response of these markets and investigates the consistency of the response to unanticipated changes in the <b>money</b> stock across <b>markets.</b> We find that the results for the foreign exchange and stock markets are sensitive to a few "outliers" so that these markets do not respond strongly to unanticipated changes in the money stock.

40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on how recent {{financial}} tensions in the euro area were ultimately reflected in bank interest rate setting. We make two new contributions. First, we develop a theoretical model capturing banks financing and the rate setting choices. Banks in the model can finance themselves through deposits, on the <b>money</b> <b>market</b> and/or by issuing bonds. Second, we assemble a novel database and put our model to test. Our model extends that of Gambacorta (2004), as we formalise banks' decision to issue debt endogenously. Gambacorta's analysis was conducted for Italian banks and {{did not include the}} recent financial crisis. Instead, we focus our analysis on the Great Recession period (July 2007 to October 2014) and euro area banks. From a monetary policy perspective, both our theoretical model and the empirical results provide useful information on the impact of some of the measures introduced by the ECB during the financial crisis. First, the ECB introduced specific measures to alleviate tensions in <b>money</b> <b>markets.</b> To the extent that these measures fostered stability in <b>money</b> <b>markets,</b> and reduced the volatility of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> rates, this <b>paper</b> shows that they were also channelled to bank rates.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} modern {{readers to}} the basic understanding of the banking system that was held by academics and practitioners {{in the early years}} of the 20 th century – that is, to traditional banking theory. This theory is completely inconsistent with the theoretic framework that views banks as financial intermediaries that receive deposits and invest those deposits in assets. Thus, this paper first sets forth in detail the basic elements of traditional banking theory and then relates those elements to the modern network effects literature. From this a bank-centered view of the <b>money</b> <b>market</b> is derived: all demand and short-term bank liabilities, including contingent liabilities, are potential money and nearmoney assets, and any non-bank liabilities that have monetary properties will derive them from their relationship with the banking system. This framework is then used to evaluate modern <b>money</b> <b>markets,</b> and this <b>paper</b> finds that indeed the so-called market-based <b>money</b> <b>market</b> in fact functions as a means of reallocating the bank liabilities held (indirectly) by the public from deposits to wholesale and contingent bank liabilities. This paper proposes that bank liability-based measures of the money supply be developed, and that regulators recognize that contingent bank liabilities often function as a substitute for deposits and should be regulated similarly...|$|R
40|$|The {{manipulation}} of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was not a localized event. Unscrupulous traders and managers {{in some of the}} largest banks around the world deliberately and systematically manipulated borrowing rates. It was not the work of isolated "rogue traders" but part of business-as-usual in the international <b>money</b> <b>markets.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes the LIBOR scandal and argues that it is an example of systemic operational risk, in particular people risk. The paper first describes the LIBOR setting process. The explosive growth over the past twenty-five years in the use of interest rate swaps (IRSs) and the process of resetting rates on IRSs, which ultimately led to the unethical {{manipulation of}} the underlying LIBOR rates, is then described. The paper then looks at official inquiries into manipulation of LIBOR at three banks, Barclays, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland, to identify examples of operational risk. The transcripts of conversations unearthed by these investigations show rampant illicit activities that were apparently a normal part of doing business, as traders, LIBOR submitters and brokers colluded to manipulate LIBOR for their own interests. Finally, the paper makes some suggestions as to how the management of systemic operational risks may be addressed by banks and regulators. 41 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} money depends {{positively}} on the price level and real income, and negatively on nominal interest rates and wealth. In addition, since the amount of wealth in an economy is fixed, an individual's or firm's wealth is typically tied up between money and bonds. When one of these markets is in equilibrium, so is the other and resultantly money supply is equal to money demand at a particular interest rate. The interest rate affects {{the movement of the}} money supply, and Federal Reserve Bank policy influences the short-term interest rate. Monetary policy also affects the price level, while real income in turn affects the movement of money demand. The interaction of money supply and demand leads to a series of equilibriums in the <b>money</b> <b>market.</b> This <b>paper</b> is concerned with the forecasting of money demand changes relative to levels and using price level/inflation, real income, wealth, and interest rate as independent variables. Money demand is approximated by the quantity of M 2 money stock, and the price level and interest rate are represented by the consumer price index and 3 -month Treasury bills respectively. The forecasting tools used are neural networks and robust multiple linear regression. The efficacy and relative accuracy of the forecasts are determined by performance metrics correlation, root mean square error, and visual analysis. As expected, neural networks yielded a better overall forecast of the changes in money demand...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the art of}} central banking as practised by the European Central Bank (ECB) {{through the prism of}} Goodfriend?s [2009] determination of the three policies that fall within the remit of a central bank : monetary policy, which consists in varying the size of the balance sheet, credit policy, which consists in modifying the credit structure, and interest rate policy, which consists in adjusting the interest rates of the marginal lending and deposit facilities. The theoretical literature emphasises the existence of a principle of separation between the first policy, which seeks to ensure monetary stability and the other two policies, which are intended to ensure financial stability through the smooth functioning of the interbank <b>money</b> <b>market.</b> This <b>paper</b> shows in particular that a central bank not only has the capacity but indeed must strive to separate the conduct of its monetary policy, which must seek to ensure medium and long-term price stability, from that of its credit policy, which is driven by short-term imperatives and consists in supplying the banking system with liquidity in the event of temporary money demand shocks. During {{the first part of the}} crisis, the ECB acted in accordance with the principle of separation. However, it became increasingly difficult to apply as interest rates approached the zero-lower-bound. In effect, the unconventional measures adopted by the ECB created interference between its monetary policy, its credit policy and its interest rate policy. ...|$|R
