40|$|Diesel engine {{cylinder}} pressure measurements {{are widely used}} in field and lab applications to support among other control, monitoring and diagnostic applications. There are two methods to <b>measure</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure, {{the use of a}} crank angle encoder, which guarantees pressure samples at fixed crank angles, and the use of constant time sampling rate. The last is frequently used due to its simplicity or because of practical restrictions. However, in order to perform thermodynamic calculations it is necessary to attribute a crank angle value to each measured pressure value. But if the in-cycle rotational speed fluctuates and this is neglected, an error will result in the values derived from the processing of the <b>measured</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure. For this reason in the present work an experimental investigation is conducted on a single cylinder diesel test engine to identify the aforementioned problem. During the tests cylinder pressure and instantaneous speed were recorded using an accurate crank angle reference. These where then used to simulate the measurement of cylinder pressure digitized using a fixed time step. The comparison of the two cylinder pressure traces and the thermodynamic parameters derived from them, reveals the introduction of an error which depends on engine load and speed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a semiempirical, zero-dimensional {{multizone}} model, {{developed by the}} authors, is implemented on two automotive diesel engines, a heavy-duty truck engine and a light-duty passenger car engine with pilot fuel injection, for various operating conditions including variation of power/speed, EGR rate, fuel injection timing, fuel injection pressure, and boost pressure, to verify its capability for Nitric Oxide (NO) emission prediction. The model utilizes cylinder’s basic geometry and engine operating data and <b>measured</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure to estimate the apparent combustion rate which is then discretized into burning zones according to the calculation step used. The requisite unburnt charge for the combustion in the zones is calculated using the zone equivalence ratio provided from a new empirical formula involving parameters derived from the processing of the <b>measured</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure and typical engine operating parameters. For the calculation of NO formation, the extended Zeldovich mechanism is used. From this approach, the model is able to provide the evolution of NO formation inside each burned zone and, cumulatively, the cylinder’s NO formation history. As proven from the investigation conducted herein, the proposed model adequately predicts NO emissions and NO trends when the engine settings vary, with low computational cost. These encourage its use for engine control optimization regarding NOx abatement and real-time/model-based NOx control applications...|$|R

Researchers seeking to develop such systems require a method of measuring the generated hydrogen. Herein, we describe a simple, low-cost, and robust method to measure the hydrogen generated from the reaction of solids with aqueous solutions. The reactions are conducted in a conventional one-necked round-bottomed flask placed in a temperature controlled water bath. The hydrogen generated from the reaction in the flask is channeled through tubing into a water-filled inverted <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The water displaced from the <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinder</b> by the incoming gas is diverted into a beaker on a balance. The balance is connected to a computer, and the change in the mass reading of the balance over time is recorded using data collection and spreadsheet software programs. The data can then be approximately corrected for water vapor using the method described herein, and parameters such as the total hydrogen yield, the hydrogen generation rate, and the induction period can also be deduced. The size of the <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the resolution of the balance can be changed to adapt the setup to different hydrogen volumes and flow rates...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to anodic dissolution there are secondary reactions during electrochemical machining (ECM) of metal materials. Among others the secondary reactions include {{the generation of}} hydrogen and oxygen. These gases {{are present in the}} working gap in form of bubbles and influence the local conductivity of the electrolyte, and thus also the local current density. During machining the working gap is flushed with fresh electrolyte and so a distribution of gas bubbles in flush direction has to be expected. The described influence of the gas generation is one significant challenge in ECM process design. [1, 2] In this study the generation of gas during pulsed electrochemical machining (PECM) will be examined. Therefore a device is created to analyse the amount of generated gas in a PECM process. The device realises a quantitative ascertainment of the generated gas volume and was implemented into a commercial PECM setup. The generated gas is directed into a <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This enables the analysis of the gas amount through the displacement principle [3]. The gas collector is implemented at the electrolyte outlet of the flushing chamber. In this connection the diameter from the electrolyte outlet to the <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinder</b> becomes bigger and the electrolyte-gas-mixture slows down. Thereby the gas bubbles up in the <b>measuring</b> <b>cylinder</b> and is gathered in the upper part. For correct measuring during a machining process the gas level is measured before and after the machining process.

Plotting the positions of drops of known solutions of sodium chloride as ordinates against the corresponding specific gravities as abscissae, a nearly straight line is obtained in a coordinate system, from which it is possible, knowing the position of the drop of the unknown solution, to read the specific gravity of the solution with considerable accuracy.

In benzene-chloroform mixtures the drops fall more sapid, and come to rest much faster, so that the infusion of the mixtures into the drops will be minimized. At the constant temperature it is not advisable to use of kerosene-bromobenzene mixtures for more than about 1 hour at one experiment, and to use of benzene-chloroform mixtures for more than about 2 hours.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. As recognized by various researchers the most important source of information for a reciprocating internal combustion engine is the cylinder pressure diagram. Its validity for direct injection (DI) diesel engines is extremely important since the engineer can estimate and understand the effect of various operating or design parameters on the combustion mechanism. But, since the <b>measured</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure diagram {{is the result of}} various thermo-physical processes taking place inside the combustion chamber it cannot provide direct information concerning the combustion rate of fuel. For this reason techniques have been developed to estimate the rate at which energy is released inside the combustion chamber by processing the cylinder pressure diagram. These techniques are referred to as "Heat Release Rate Analysis" and are used to estimate the combustion rate of fuel inside the combustion chamber. During its estimation various errors may arise due to either the cylinder pressure measurement or inadequate description of the various mechanisms, i. e. heat transfer etc. In the present investigation the heat release rate estimation procedure is analyzed at the fundamental level using a detailed simulation model and available experimental data. A source of error is indicated that is higher compared to any of the conventional ones. From the anal is, it is shown that {{it is not possible to}} estimate the actual rate of heat release inside the combustion chamber of DI diesel engines from the <b>measured</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure trace using existing heat release rate analysis techniques even if all mechanisms are described accurately. From the employment of the simulation technique the actual source of this error is revealed. ksb 201...|$|R
