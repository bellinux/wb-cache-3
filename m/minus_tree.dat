The progenies {{were obtained from}} crosses between the various tree types in a stand, between trees of different provenances, and after wind pollination and selfing. The characteristics analysed were total height, yearly height growth, branch length and branch angle, number of branches per whorl, length of apical bud, and length and number of lateral buds. The variation among the progenies seemed to be genetically controlled {{to a large extent}} but the varying environmental factors exerted a strong influence {{on the development of the}} young trees as well. No regular trend in the range among the plus and <b>minus</b> <b>tree</b> progenies in height growth was established when all progenies in each individual experiment were compared. Plus tree progenies were superior in height growth when compared to <b>minus</b> <b>tree</b> progenies of the same provenance. In two cases, plus tree progenies were inferior in growth rate. This was explained by an incorrect classification of the parent trees. In two out of three reciprocal crosses, significant differences in height between the reciprocal pairs were reported. Different combining ability or maternal influence are discussed as possible reasons for the differences. Four progenies obtained from the same mother tree after crosses with two plus trees, one <b>minus</b> <b>tree,</b> and after open pollination differed significantly in height. A great part of the variation between progenies is ascribed to the diversity of the male plus trees, in addition to the differences between plus and minus trees. One provenance cross between two plus trees of widely differing origin was superior in height growth to the open-pollinated progenies of the female as well as of the male parent tree. Four other provenance hybrids obtained from crosses between various minus trees did not exceed the open-pollinated progenies from the northernmost female parents in height. It is shown that the growth capacity of the parent trees used in provenance crosses is of great importance. A combination of two plus trees should result in better growing offspring than a cross between two minus trees. There was a strong correlation between the length of the terminal shoot in 1960 and the increase in height in 1961 - 1964. This indicates the possibility of selecting the best growing progeny at an early age. Significallt differences between progenies were established in most of the branch and bud characteristics analysed, indicating genetical control of these properties. The differences increased with increasing age of the progenies. There was a tendency for the plus tree progenies to have more slender crowns and fewer branches per whorl in the lower whorls as compared with <b>minus</b> <b>tree</b> progenies. The effect of inbreeding was manifested in slow height growth and poor vitality of the plants. No grouping by provenances was reported in the range of the progenies as regards branch and bud characteristics except in one experiment, where <b>minus</b> <b>tree</b> progenies of northern origin had narrower crowns than <b>minus</b> <b>tree</b> progenies from the southern provenance. On the whole, the phenotypes of the 20 selected plus and minus trees used as parents appeared to be closely related to the performance of their offspring as regards height grorth ability. The relationship between parent trees and offspring with respect to branching characteristics seemed to be less well defined. Correlations between parents and offspring in these characteristics cannot be estimated with the methods available at present...|$|E
40|$|Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) {{is one of}} themost {{important}} {{species in}} Croatia, both ecologically and economically. In the 1950 ’s natural oak stands in Croatia were evaluated in terms of wood productivity and quality. The results and additional ecological studies delineated three seed zones and seven seed regions (NN 107 / 08). Over the past decades, the periodicity of seed crops has not been regular, which has limited natural regeneration and artificial planting in partial naturally regenerated stands. In order to increase genetic quality and reduce seed periodicity, {{it was decided to}} establish clonal seed orchards (Vidaković 1996). Plus trees have been selected in three seed regions, based on ten evaluated traits, and three clonal seed orchards have been established in the areas of Forest Municipality Vinkovci, Našice and Čazma. Potential for genetic gain by selected plus trees can be evaluated by progeny trials in common environmental conditions and because of long lifespan of forest trees, it is crucial to evaluate it as early as possible. Considering biological and ecological characteristics of pedunculate oak, evolutionary factors shaping the genetic structure of its populations and existing research on its genetic variability in Croatia (Perić et al. 2000, Bogdan et al. 2004, 2008, Kajba et al. 2006, Katičić et al. 2010), it can be assumed that most of its genetic variability lies on the intrapopulation, namely individual level. Such a pattern of variability points to considerable possibilities of genetic improvement by individual selection. The aim of this research is to estimate the trends of genetic parameters, heritability and genetic gains for height and diameter growth of pedunculate oak in some Croatian provenance regions. Research area, material and measurements Three open pollinated progeny trials of pedunculate oak plus trees have been established, representing three seed regions:• _ Progeny trial Vukojevački Šikar (TP 1), age 2 + 18 years, established with 21 OP families of selected plus trees from the seed region »srednja Podravina«, control plants from three local populations and one <b>minus</b> <b>tree</b> family. • _ Progeny trial Čazma (TP 2), age 2 + 7 years, established with 25 OP families of plus trees from the seed region »Donja Posavina« and control plants from local populations. • _ Progeny trial Kunjevci (TP 3), age 2 + 7 years, established with 24 OP families of plus trees from the seed region»Gornja Posavina i Pokuplje« and control plants from local populations. The experimental design in TP 1 is completely randomized, with five repetitions and in TP 2 and TP 3 randomized complete block design is applied, with five blocks. In all the trials, families are planted in groups of six, with 2 × 2 spacing. In TP 1 height was measured at the age of 2 + 3, 2 + 5, 2 + 7, 2 + 8, 2 + 9, 2 + 11, 2 + 15 and 2 + 18 (H 5, H 7, H 9, H 10, H 11, H 13, H 17 and H 20). Diameter at breast height was measured at the age of 2 + 9, 2 + 11, and circumference at breast height at the age of 2 + 15 and 2 + 18 (D 11, D 13, C 17 and C 20). In other two trials heights were measured at the age of 2 + 3, 2 + 4 and 2 + 7 (H 5, H 6 i H 9). Mean values of selected families and control heights for all three trials and for circumference in TP 1 were calculated for each year of measurements, as well as standard deviations, standard errors and coefficients of variation. Variance analysis was done by GLMprocedure using linear models (1) for TP 1 and (2) for TP 2 and TP 3. Additive and environmental variance components and additive coefficient of variation were calculated using REML method of MIXED procedure in SAS for Windows 8. 0, using Equation (3), (4), (5) and (6). Narrow-sense heritabilities were calculated on the basis of individual tree values (hi 2) and family means (hF 2) using equation (7), (8) for TP 1 and (9), (10) for TP 2 and TP 3. The realized gain from the test and expected genetic gains by two possible methods of height selection were calculated by three methods, including the following:• _ Realized gain (R) was calculated as the difference between means of selected plus tree progenies and means of unselected control plants, (Equation 11) • _ Expected genetic gain by individual within provenance mass selection of first generation plus trees at the same age as those represented in the studied trial, (Equation 12) • _ Expected genetic gain by backward selection among first generation plus trees. (Equation 13) ResultsAt the age of 2 + 18, the average survival in TP 1 was 82 %. In TP 2 and TP 3 at the age of 2 + 9, survival rates were 80 % and 94 %, respectively. Survival rates per individual families are shown in Fig. 1 (TP 1), 4 (TP 2) and 6 (TP 3). Mean height of selected OP families in TP 1 was 8. 52 m, and average of control plants was 8. 45 m (Fig. 2, Table 2). In TP 2, OP families had the average height of 306. 8 cm, while control plants reached higher average – 310. 4 m (Fig. 5, Table 2). In TP 3, control plants with the average height of 122. 0 m were significantly lower than the selected OP families, whose mean height was 187. 6 cm. (Fig. 7, Table 2). Variance analysis results are shown in Table 1. Variance component caused by family effect for height was statistically significant in trials TP 1 and TP 3, and non significant in TP 2. Variance component from family × block interactionwas significant in both trialswith RCB design and had the highest values in TP 2. Fixed block effect was only significant in TP 3. Additive variance component had high values throughout most of the researched period in TP 1 and TP 3, while in TP 2 they were low. The opposite stands for environmental variance component. Variance analysis for the trait of circumference in TP 1 also showed high values for environmental variance component. Mean height, diameter and circumference values for selected OP families and control plants, as well as estimated genetic parameters for those traits are shown in Table 2 Discussion In TP 1 and TP 3, the family effect for height was statistically significant for the entire period, showing decreasing trend in TP 1 and rising in TP 3 (Table 1). The family effect was never significant in TP 2, pointing to narrowed individual variability of plus trees in that seed region. The results suggest significant individual genetic variability in two out of three seed regions. Some authors report correlation between flushing phenology and height growth (Baliuckas and Pliura 2003, Perić et al. 2000). Based on that assumption it could be speculated that high additive variability for heights in TP 1 and TP 2 results from significant individual variabilities for flushing traits in selected plus trees and ecotypical differentiation of their original populations. However, similar research in TP 1 showed no correlation between flushing phenology and height growth (Bogdan et al. 2009). Presumably, late frosts in this trial did not cause better competitiveness of the later-flushing plants and trial management in the early years removed competition from weeds, which would put the early-flushers forward. If we keep the assumption of height-flushing phenology correlation, then the results in TP 2 point to greater uniformity in flushing of selected plus trees from the corresponding seed region and lack of ecotypic differentiation of its populations. However, high values of environmental variance components and family × block interactions suggest strong environmental influences in that particular trial, which could have led to underestimation of additive variance. High values of additive coefficients of variation in TP 1 and TP 3 suggest wide genetic variability of selected plus trees and good adaptability of their progeny to changing environmental conditions. Heritabilities High estimated heritabilities in TP 1, until the age of 13, result from high component of family effect (Table 1 and 2). Average survival was, in the first years, slightly lower than in TP 1, suggesting stronger competition with weeds and negative effect of rodents. Low estimated heritability values for height in TP 2 reflect the low family effect variance component, probably caused by negative environmental influences. Genetic gains from selection In all the trials the estimated expected genetic gains by backward selection among first generation plus trees after open-pollinated progeny testing (G 2) showed the highest values (Table 2). Realized gains were not very high during the entire period in TP 1, showing the decreasing trend in recent years. In TP 3 realized gain is improving, due to higher heritabilities and greater differences between selected and control families. Opposite to that, low heritabilities, non significant family variance component and small differences between selected and control families resulted in little, even negative realized gains in TP 2...|$|E

Analizirana je varijanca i izračunati su genetski parametri i dobit od selekcije pomoću triju metoda: ostvarena dobit, očekivana dobit od individualne selekcije za prvu generaciju plus stabala unutar provenijencije kod iste dobi kao u testu, očekivana genetska dobit od povratne selekcije unutar prve generacije plus stabala. Nasljednosti za visinski rast u istraživanom razdoblju varirale su između testova od najni- žih 0, 02 do visokih 0, 98. Najniže procjene nasljednosti zbog veze s prosječnim preživljavanjem biljaka u pojedinom testu dobivene su u testu s najnižim preživljavanjem. Aditivni koeficijenti varijabilnosti (u rasponu od 12, 7 do 44, 1 %) u dvama testovima upućuju na dobar potencijal prilagodbe lužnjaka na promjene okoliša. Pokazalo se da se najveća procijenjena dobit očekuje metodom povratne selekcije u plantaži nakon testiranja selekcioniranih familija (17, 2 do 26, 3 %). U jednom su testu dobiveni niski aditivni koeficijenti varijabilnosti (6, 6 do 15, 3 %), niske procjene nasljednosti i genetske dobiti (- 0, 2 do 5, 3 %), što upućuje na smanjenu adaptabilnost istraživanih plus stabala iz pripadajuće regije. Rezultati su različiti s obzirom na sjemenske regije iz kojih potječu plus stabla. Rezultati dvaju testova pokazuju da je rast uglavnom pod snažnim genetskim utjecajem, da postoji značajna aditivna genetska varijabilnost te visok potencijal za genetsku dobit i sposobnost prilagodbe promjenama okoliša, dok rezultati u jednom testu upućuju na nisku adaptivnu varijabilnost plus stabala iz pripadajuće regije te manje mogućnosti oplemenjivanja na rast.

Within 6 d after treatment (DAT), all leaves on the lead tree plants dropped. Analysis of nonlabeled glyphosate in both xylem and phloem every 15 d showed that glyphosate residues accumulated mainly in phloem, similar to the findings in established lead tree. In this experiment, glyphosate concentration in the phloem of three parts of the trunk, i. e., upper (15 cm above the upper injection hole), middle (between the two injection holes), and lower (15 cm below the lower injection hole) parts, increased rapidly within 45 DAT, and decreased thereafter. Obviously, significant glyphosate metabolism occurred during the latter period.

Testers found toxic lead and phthalates and large amounts of PVC in toys, lunchboxes, baby bibs, jewelry, garden hoses, <b>mini</b> blinds, Christmas <b>trees,</b> and electronics. Several {{studies have shown that}} chemicals in vinyl chloride can cause serious health problems for children and adults. The University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago states that people who use products containing PVC can become exposed with harmful toxic phthalates and lead, which eventually can become a big contributor with dioxins. Lois Gibbs, executive director of the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice, stated, [...] "Target is doing the right thing by moving away from PVC and switching to safer alternatives." [...] Other companies reducing the PVC on their shelves include Walmart, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Nike, and Apple. Target stores have been taking environmental measures by reusing materials within their stores and recycling products such as broken hangers, cardboard, and rechargeable batteries. Target is beginning to reduce energy use with energy-efficient storefronts and reducing waste with recycling programs. All Target stores in the United States use plastic carts with metal frames. In mid-2006, Target took it a step further when it began introducing a newer cart design made entirely of plastic. It also uses the same design in its hand-use baskets.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} growing public concern {{regarding}} the threat to people and environment from industrial activities, thus more rigorous regulations. The investigation of almost all the major accidents shows {{that we could have}} avoided those tragedies with effective risk analysis and safety management programs. High-quality risk analysis is absolutely necessary for sustainable development. As a powerful and systematic tool, fault tree analysis (FTA) has been adapted to the particular need of chemical process quantitative risk analysis (CPQRA) and found great applications. However, the application of FTA in the chemical process industry (CPI) is limited. One major barrier is the manual synthesis of fault trees. It requires a thorough understanding of the process and is vulnerable to individual subjectivity. The quality of FTA can be highly subjective and variable. The availability of a computer-based FTA methodology will greatly benefit the CPI. The primary objective of this research is to develop a computer-aided fault tree synthesis methodology for CPQRA. The central idea is to capture the cause-and-effect logic around each item of equipment directly into <b>mini</b> fault <b>trees.</b> Special fault tree models have been developed to manage special features. Fault trees created by this method are expected to be concise. A prototype computer program is provided to illustrate the methodology. Ideally, FTA can be standardized through a computer package that reads information contained in process block diagrams and provides automatic aids to assist engineers in generating and analyzing fault trees. Another important issue with regard to QRA is the large uncertainty associated with available failure rate data. In the CPI, the ranges of failure rates observed could be quite wide. Traditional reliability studies using point values of failure rates may result in misleading conclusions. This dissertation discusses the uncertainty with failure rate data and proposes a procedure to deal with data uncertainty in determining safety integrity level (SIL) for a safety instrumented system (SIS). Efforts must be carried out to obtain more accurate values of those data that might actually impact the estimation of SIL. This procedure guides process hazard analysts toward a more accurate SIL estimation and avoids misleading results due to data uncertainty...|$|R
