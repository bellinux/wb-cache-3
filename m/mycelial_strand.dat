500|$|The American {{botanist}} Edward Angus Burt {{published a}} detailed description of the development of C.columnatus in 1896. He found that the egg consists of cortical and [...] systems continued upward from the <b>mycelial</b> <b>strand</b> in the earliest stage. The cortical layer gives rise to the outer layer of the volva, the cortical plates and the pseudoparenchyma (thin-walled, usually angular, randomly arranged cells that are tightly packed) of the receptaculum. The medullary portion gives rise to the gelatinous masses of the gelatinous layer of the volva, to the gleba, and to the gelatinous tissue of the chambers of the receptaculum. The elongation of the receptacle begins at the base and after its elongation, the gleba hangs suspended from the arch of the receptaculum by medullary tissue constituting the chamber masses of the receptacle.|$|E
50|$|P. {{omnivore}} {{will form}} several differentiated hyphae. Initially, germ tubes emerge from soil residing sclerotia that overwinter. The sclerotia structure {{acts as the}} primary inoculum in affected fields. The pathogen hyphae will either infect the host root or form mycelium with a differentiated rind. Upon contact with host roots, P. omnivore forms a mycelial mantle on the root’s surface. This leads to necrosis of epidermis and underlying cortical tissue, leading to root lesions. As the disease progresses, the roots are covered by the characteristic cinnamon-colored mycelial strands covered with acircular sterile hyphae, a diagnostic sign of Texas Root Rot. The roots at later stages of infection show extensive vascular discoloration due to root necroses. The <b>mycelial</b> <b>strand</b> and symptom development in field-infected roots are even more conspicuous on cotton. During the late summer and fall, mycelial strands formed on the root surfaces or in the soil form sclerotia to survive the winter, thus completing the life cycle.|$|E
500|$|The spores {{are roughly}} spherical, thick-walled, 3–6µm in {{diameter}} (although some specimens {{collected in the}} US range from 7.2 to 9.5µm), and are covered with minute spines or warts.

40|$|Relationships {{between the}} hyphae of Agaricus bisporus (Lang) Sing and {{bacteria}} from the mushroom bed casing layer were examined with a scanning electron microscope. Hyphae {{growing in the}} casing layer differed morphologically from compost-grown hyphae. Whereas the compost contained thin single hyphae surrounded by calcium oxalate crystals, the casing layer contained mainly wide hyphae or <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> without crystals. The bacterial population in the hyphal environment consisted of several types, some attached to the hyphae with filamentlike structures. This attachment may be important in stimulation of pinhead initiation...|$|R
40|$|Initially non-mycorrhizal {{seedlings}} {{of birch}} (Betula pendula Roth.) were grown {{for a season}} around two 11 -year-old birch trees on an experimental site south of Edinburgh. Some seedlings (non-isolated) were planted in undisturbed positions, others (trenched) in volumes of soil isolated from the mature tree by trenches, and yet others (cored) in cores of soil (8 x 10 cm diameter) that had been removed and replaced immediately Mycorrhizas of Lactarius pubescens (Fr. ex Krombh.) Fr., Lactarius glyciosmus (Fr. ex Fr.) Fr., and Leccinum scabrum (Bull. ex Fr.) S. F. Gray and Leccinum roseofracta Watl. developed abundantly on the non-isolated seedlings but usually very poorly on the trenched and cored seedlings. That some development of Leccinum mycorrhizas occurred in trenched areas is attributed to incomplete severance of roots. In contrast, mycorrhizas of other fungi, for example Hebeloma spp. and Inocybe spp., developed most abundantly on trenched and cored seedlings rather than on non-isolated seedlings. The results demonstrate an important difference between types of ectomycorrhizal fungus. Lactarius and Leccinum spp. seem to depend on a continuing supply of photosynthate from a mature tree in order to colonize seedling roots, whereas several other mycorrhizal fungi show no such dependence. The results also indicate an important role for <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> in establishment of mycorrhizas by some fungi (Lactarius pubescens and Leccinum spp.) and thus parallel previous reports {{on the importance of}} <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> in colonization of substrata by saprophytic and pathogenic fungi. ...|$|R
500|$|Escobar grew {{cultures}} of the fungus by placing fresh fruit bodies on agar containing growth medium with an extract of horse dung. The tips of the hyphae were used to obtain axenic cultures; the fungus can grow {{on a variety of}} media commonly used to grow fungi in the laboratory. Depending on the composition of the growth media, fruit bodies were formed as early as eight days after initiating, when grown at [...] and under dim light. When minute agar blocks containing mycelium were submerged in distilled water, <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> grew towards the water surface and eventually gave rise to floating fruit bodies connected to the parent agar block by strands of hyphae.|$|R
5000|$|Like all stinkhorns, {{the fruit}} body of C. pusillus begins as an egg-like structure. The eggs of C. pusillus are {{typically}} off-white, with a red/purple tinge and a faint latticed {{pattern on the}} surface. They are anchored to the substrate {{by one or more}} root-like rhizomorphs: thickened <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands.</b> The membrane of the [...] "egg" [...] soon ruptures, releasing the rapidly expanding mature receptacle, which can reach a height of around 15cm. The interior of the cage is covered by an unevenly distributed glebal slime, which contains the fungal spores. This slime is olive-green in colour and has a foul smell, which attracts insects that distribute the fungus' spores to a suitable location.|$|R
40|$|Plants of Pinus sylvestris L. {{were grown}} in {{mycorrhizal}} association with Suillus bovinus (Fr.) O. Kuntze in observation chambers until an interconnecting mycelial network had developed between the seedlings. The shoot {{of an individual}} seedling was then sealed in a perspex cuvette and exposed to 14 CO 2. After incubation for 48 h, the 'donor' shoot was removed and components of the mycelial network and mycorrhizal roots of connected and unconnected 'receiver' seedlings were harvested, fixed, embedded and sectioned prior to being autoradiographed and examined by transmission electron microscopy. The patterns of distribution of 14 C-labelled material within the <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands,</b> the sheath and root tissues was examined. The results are discussed in relation to carbon metabolism of the fungus and of the interconnected host plant...|$|R
40|$|Non-mycorrhizal {{seedlings}} ofBetula pendula {{were planted}} around an 11 -year old tree ofB. pubescens in an experimental plot at Bush Estate, south of Edinburgh. Half (23) of the seedlings were in untreated planting positions and half (24) in positions {{that had been}} cored to sever connections of the roots with the parent tree. After 17 weeks, seedlings in the non-cored positions bore mycorrhizas mainly ofLactarius pubescens whereas mycorrhizas of this species were uncommon on seedlings in cored positions. Much smaller and usually non-significant differences were found with respect to other mycorrhizal types in cored and non-cored positions. It is concluded thatL. pubescens infected seedling roots by means of <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> which must remain attached to the parent tree (food base) in order to infect. The significance of {{the results for the}} concept of early-stage and late-stage mycorrhizal fungi is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus uptake and {{translocation}} through intact mycelial {{systems of}} Paxillus involutus and Suillus variegatus infecting Pinus contorta seedlings was monitored non-destructively using a beta-scanner. Mycorrhizal plants were grown in flat perspex chambers (20 x 6 cm(2)) and root growth {{was restricted to}} the upper portion of each chamber enabling mycelial translocation to be studied over distances of up to 15 cm. P- 32 was supplied, either directly to distal parts of the extending mycelium, or to single, cut <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> in feeding dishes. Two-dimensional patterns of activity were accumulated as scans with a lateral resolution of 5 mm and a longitudinal resolution of 3 - 4 mm. No distinct translocation front could be detected but patterns of accumulation of label in the mycorrhizal roots were not consistent with movement by simple diffusion. Activity in translocating hyphae became visible only after the activity in mycorrhizal root lips had been visible for a few days. In all cases there was a lag period of 20 - 50 hours before P- 32 could be detected in mycorrhizal root tips. Pre-feeding with unlabelled phosphate {{had no effect on}} this lag period. This implies continuous translocation of phosphate at low concentrations and a lag period due to the time needed for detectable levels of phosphate to accumulate in mycorrhizal roots. Thus the minimum velocity of phosphate movement in the hyphae would be 7. 5 mm/h, if the first molecules of P- 32 arriving at the roots could be detected and the transport distance is 15 cm. Accumulation of phosphate to the roots was fairly constant, but not linear. The phosphorus uptake rate by intact mycelial margins was nearly four orders of magnitude higher than the uptake rate of cut mycorrhizal strands. The results indicate that the fine, foraging hyphae are better suited for nutrient uptake than <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> and that phosphorus translocation in the hyphae occurs by active translocation of small amounts rather than by mass flow...|$|R
5000|$|The {{roots of}} {{seedling}} attacked by R. undulata are matted {{together with a}} white mycelium that penetrates {{all parts of the}} cortical and bast tissues. Hartig grew the fungus in culture, and was able to follow the growth of the mycelium using light microscopy. He wrote: [...] mycelium grows between the cells of the parenchymatous tissues, while in the soft bast its progress is partly intercullular and partly intracellular, the sieve-tubes being frequently packed full of a dense filamentous mycelium. In the process of time the mycelium kills the tissues of the cortex and soft bast, whose elements become brown and completely dismembered ... The development is so luxuriant that it forms, in certain places, a pseudo-parenchymatous fungus-tissue, consisting of vesicular swollen cells. This however is speedily destroyed as soon as the tissues between the wood and periderm become almost completely destroyed. [...] The <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> surrounding the diseased roots are continuous with the rhizoid strands that originate from the fruit body underside and attach it to the substrate.|$|R
40|$|Coprinoid {{mushrooms}} {{grown on}} wood of broad-leaf species were collected {{for the first}} time in Armenia and dikaryotic mycelial cultures were established. ITS (internal transcribed spacer) sequences identified one species as Coprinopsis strossmayeri and the other as a species closely related to Coprinellus radians. Mycelial growth and morphological features on different media are described. The pearl-white-silky colonies of C.  strossmayeri are characterized by <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> and by a light-yellow agar colorization. The species forms chlamydospores intercalary in its hyphae. Some hyphal ends form hyphal loops. Colonies of C. aff.  radians have a characteristic yellow pigmentation and stain the agar yellowish. Hyphae are mostly clampless but at some septa, pseudoclamps are seen from which side-branches develop growing along the parental hyphae. In the mycelium of C. aff.  radians, hyphal loops, hyphal swellings, cystidia and typical allocysts were observed. Both new species from Armenia show growth optima at temperatures of 25 to 30 °C and pHs of 6. 0 to 7. 0. Both grow in alkaline conditions up to pH  12. 0 but not at pHs 3. 0 and 4. 0, classifying them with other coprinoid mushrooms as “ammonia fungi”. Both species grew on a variety of lignocellulosic substrates and both show polyphenol oxidase activities...|$|R
50|$|The aphids {{accumulate}} {{in late summer}} and autumn, forming large colonies. Spores of Scorias spongiosa are borne by wind and rain and fall on the honeydew secretions found below the aphids. The first hyphal growth is straw coloured and unpigmented. The hyphae adhere {{to each other for}} short distances, diverging and re-adhering to form a loose stranded structure. Pigmentation begins to occur on the surfaces of outer strands and the stroma begins to darken. The hyphae coalesce and form <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> which radiate outward and upward from the supporting structure. Flask-shaped, spore-bearing pycnidia appear on the mycelia, which have a waxlike appearance: the matrix turns from brittle to soft as it absorbs moisture. As further quantities of honeydew accumulate, the fungus grows larger until it resembles a gelatinous sponge resting on the branches or leaves of the beech tree. Fully pigmented strands in the mature stoma produce bowl-shaped pseudothecia and these outermost hyphae cease to grow. The inner strands continue growth and force their way to the exterior. Asexual conidia are extruded in a slimy matrix in liquid droplets from the pycnidia. As time passes the stroma becomes a spongy black mass and produces sexual spores called ascospores in the pseudothecia, which remain embedded in the stroma.|$|R
40|$|White {{root rot}} caused by Rosellinia necatrix {{is one of}} the most {{destructive}} diseases of many woody plants in the temperate regions of the world, particularly in Europe and Asia. Recent outbreaks of R. necatrix around the globe have increased the interest in this pathogen. Although the ecology of the disease has been poorly studied, recent genetic and molecular advances have opened the way for future detailed studies of this fungus. Taxonomy: Rosellinia necatrix Prilleux. Kingdom Fungi; subdivision Ascomycotina; class Euascomycetes; subclass Pyrenomycetes; order Sphaeriales, syn. Xylariales; family Xylariaceae; genus Rosellinia. Identification: Fungal mycelium is present on root surfaces and under the bark, forming mycelium fans, strands or cords. A typical presence of pear-shaped or pyriform swellings can be found above the hyphal septum (with diameters of up to 13 μm). Sclerotia are black, hard and spherical nodules, several millimetres in diameter. Black sclerotia crusts may also form on roots. On synthetic media, it forms microsclerotia: irregular rough bodies composed of a compact mass of melanized, interwoven hyphae with no differentiated cells. Chlamydospores are almost spherical (15 μm in diameter). Synnemata, also named coremia (0. 5 - 1. 5 mm in length), can be formed from sclerotia or from mycelial masses. Conidia (3 - 5 μm in length and 2. 5 - 3 μm in width) are very difficult to germinate invitro. Ascospores are monostichous, situated inside a cylindrical, long-stalked ascus. They are ellipsoidal and cymbiform (36 - 46 μm in length and 5. 5 - 6. 3 μm in width). Host range: This fungus can attack above 170 different plant hosts from 63 genera and 30 different families, including vascular plants and algae. Some are of significant economic importance, such as Coffea spp., Malus spp., Olea europaea L., Persea americana Mill., Prunus spp. and Vitis vinifera L. Disease symptoms: Rosellinia necatrix causes white (or Dematophora) root rot, which, by aerial symptoms, shows a progressive weakening of the plant, accompanied by a decline in vigour. The leaves wilt and dry, and the tree can eventually die. White cottony mycelium and <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> can be observed in the crown and on the root surface. On woody plant roots, the fungus can be located between the bark and the wood, developing typical mycelium fans, invading the whole root and causing general rotting. Disease control: Some approaches have been attempted involving the use of tolerant plants and physical control (solarization). Chemical control in the field and biological control methods are still under development. © 2011 The Authors. Molecular Plant Pathology © 2011 BSPP and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is {{the most}} {{important}} fiber-yielding crop grown in India and worldwide. In India, during 2012 - 2013, 1. 16 million ha were under cotton cultivation, with an average production of 480 kg/ha. As production of cotton has increased in areas, so has the occurrence of various pests and diseases. During a field survey conducted in the cotton-growing areas of Devalapura Village of the Mysore District during August and September 2013, a boll rot disease was observed with distinctive symptoms and signs of a fungal pathogen observed in 27 % of fields. Incidence of the boll rot within fields ranged from 8 to 12 %, while 3 to 5 % stem rot was observed on boll rot-affected plants in about 15 to 18 ha of total cotton fields surveyed. White <b>mycelial</b> <b>strands</b> with spherical, dark-brown sclerotial bodies were found on the surface of infected bolls near the ground and the affected bolls were completely decayed. The disease-affected bolls were disinfested with 2 % sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 min, and 5 -mm samples were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and incubated at 28 ± 2 °C. The fungal colonies that grew from infected tissues were whitish with cottony aerial mycelium and abundant globoid sclerotia observed after 10 to 12 days of incubation. Sclerotial bodies were initially pale whitish, becoming dark brown over time. Based on morphological and cultural characteristics, the associated fungal pathogen was identified as Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. The identity of the pathogen was further confirmed through PCR amplification of internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region using ITS 1 /ITS 4 universal primer. The amplified PCR product (550 to 570 bp) was sequenced and BLASTn search comparison revealed 100 % homology with Sclerotium rolfsii (Accession Nos. JF 966208 and JX 914480). A representative sequence of S. rolfsii was deposited in GenBank (KP 412471. 1 and KP 412472. 1). Further, pathogenicity tests were conducted on 30 healthy cotton bolls in vivo by inoculating the bolls with sclerotia obtained from 12 -day-old cultures; noninoculated bolls served as controls. Characteristic boll rot symptoms were observed on 60 % of total inoculated cotton bolls 7 days after inoculation and S. rolfsii was reisolated from the infected bolls and the identity of the pathogen was confirmed. S. rolfsii is a serious soil-borne fungal pathogen with a wide host range (Mullen 2001) and prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, where high temperature and moisture are sufficient to permit growth and survival of the fungal pathogen (Punja 1985). The association of S. rolfsii with boll rot of cotton has been reported from Bangladesh (Shamsi et al. 2008). In India, major diseases of cotton include wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. vasinfectum), anthracnose (Colletotrichum capsici), and areolate mildew (Ramularia areola) (Rangaswamy and Mahadevan 2002). S. rolfsii infect bolls on branches near ground level, causing boll decay. Numerous sclerotia produced on the affected bolls are the source of secondary inoculum and are dispersed by rain splash during the late monsoon, thus resulting in new infections on the basal stem and leaves of the cotton plant. The disease has resulted in reduced yield and market value of the crop. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the occurrence of S. rolfsii causing boll rot of cotton in India...|$|R
