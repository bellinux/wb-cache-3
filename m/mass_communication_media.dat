5000|$|Building on the {{recommendations}} of the University of Padua, by applying the technique of so-called diphones (the union of a consonant and a vowel, 150 in total for the Italian) the group created the first speech synthesizer with high intelligibility in 1975 [...] it was called MUSA (MUltichannel Speaking Automaton), which demonstrated what was possible with the technology of the time. The results achieved in those years were condensed into an audio disc at 45 rpm, with thousands of copies produced and spread through the <b>mass</b> <b>communication</b> <b>media.</b> It was mainly the Italian version of the song Frère Jacques carried out in polyphony with more singing voices (MUSA could manage up to 8 synthesis channels in parallel).

5000|$|The {{third part}} of the book is {{dedicated}} to the evolution of democracy since 1945. In Keane's view, after World War II, democracy has entered a new phase, which he calls monitory democracy. He explains that {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, the representative model faced its deepest crisis. Parliaments proved to be not strong enough to defend democracy from economic collapse and the rise of various forms of dictatorial and totalitarian rule. The system of representative democracy based purely on representation showed its limits and fragility; the use of <b>mass</b> <b>communication</b> <b>media</b> (the press, the radio, and cinema) helped populist leaders like Mussolini and Hitler to gain consensus and almost destroy democracy has it had been hitherto known. The crisis in fact culminated in total war (1939-1945) and 'near-destruction worldwide of democratic institutions and ways of life by the storms of mechanised war, dictatorship and totalitarian rule'. After World War II, alongside parliamentary politics (typical of the representative model), [...] "many different kinds of extra-parliamentary, power-scrutinising mechanisms" [...] emerged. Keane calls these mechanisms [...] "monitory bodies"; they function both from within the state and cross-borders. The emergence of monitory bodies have transformative effects on the core institutions of representative democracy: nation states are still important, but power-holders (representatives) are subject increasingly to unprecedented scrutiny from within and across borders, and outside the conventional mechanism of periodic elections and parliamentary representation.|$|E
40|$|The media, an inseparable part {{of daily}} life, {{influences}} the thoughts, behaviour {{and attitudes of}} millions of people through the transmission of cultural images such as music, themes and visuals, has succeeded in reaching the masses with an attractive form of presentation and in a sense, has incorporates - almost immediately in the world of today - universal truths and developments into the lives of individuals with pictures and sounds, reporting on events and people, allowing individuals to internalise the images presented and has become a point of reference in social life. Together with the development of modern technology, media of mass communication and in extension, media channels, have transcended national and cultural boundaries to reach the masses. Developing {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century, the television, as one of the most effective <b>mass</b> <b>communication</b> <b>media</b> of the modern age, has combined sound and images to create a technical medium where culture is produced, transmitted, circulated and consumed and subsequently recycled to reach the target audiences, while in terms of the transmission of messages, the television has become the flagship of the media economy in comparison with other <b>mass</b> <b>communication</b> <b>media</b> and channels. As the influences of globalisation have been felt upon the creative processes of film and serial instruments and in the adoption and dissemination of strategic objectives, global cultural transmission is more varied, wider in scope and with more intense content than ever before. Furthermore, as a result of the constant development, regeneration and transformation of communication technology, we can postulate that television serial and film scenarios are a new form of marketing communication, as they are deeply intertwined with daily life and culture in the modern world. However, <b>mass</b> <b>communication</b> <b>media</b> gather groups of people with a common language and interest, causing groups to become communities. The role of <b>mass</b> <b>communication</b> <b>media</b> in forming communities with common characteristics and interests has developed in parallel with the development of <b>mass</b> <b>communication</b> <b>media.</b> These communication media have negated geographical boundaries, forming common ground for social relationships, while the importance of communication media has increased as the media reaches more isolated communities, constantly increasing the size of the masses. The experience of the world as cultural cosmopolitanism and the globalisation of the media through the simulation of metaphorical images in relation to the globalisation of communication has led to the internalisation of feelings of globalisation by individuals under the influence of the media, forming the basis for a social and industrial discourse...|$|E
