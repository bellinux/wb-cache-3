25|$|The use of heparin {{following}} {{surgery is}} common {{if there are}} no issues with bleeding. Generally, a risk-benefit analysis is required, as all anticoagulants lead to an increased risk of bleeding. In people admitted to hospital, thrombosis is a major cause for complications and occasionally death. In the UK, for instance, the Parliamentary Health Select Committee heard in 2005 that the annual rate of death due to thrombosis was 25,000, with at least 50% of these being hospital-acquired. Hence thromboprophylaxis (prevention of thrombosis) is increasingly emphasized. In patients admitted for surgery, graded compression stockings are widely used, and in severe illness, prolonged immobility and in all orthopedic surgery, professional guidelines recommend low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administration, <b>mechanical</b> <b>calf</b> compression or (if all else is contraindicated and the patient has recently suffered deep vein thrombosis) the insertion of a vena cava filter. In patients with medical rather than surgical illness, LMWH too is known to prevent thrombosis, and in the United Kingdom the Chief Medical Officer has issued guidance to the effect that preventative measures should be used in medical patients, in anticipation of formal guidelines.|$|R
50|$|The UK once {{produced}} roughly as much beef as it ate, {{but this}} changed in 1996 because of {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE). The BSE crisis led to regulations preventing animals more than 30 months old from entering the food chain, which meant cull cows {{could no longer be}} sold for beef. Just under 6 million cattle over this age were destroyed. A <b>Calf</b> Purchase <b>Aid</b> Scheme, under which a further nearly 2 million calves were slaughtered, ended in 1999. In 2002, the UK produced 72% of the beef it ate. Important beef cattle breeds include the Hereford, which is the most popular British beef breed, and the Aberdeen Angus. The once-widespread Beef Shorthorn is now a relatively uncommon sight.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Robots {{can improve}} the {{accuracy}} of image-guided needle placement over traditional free-hand techniques. While many research groups have demonstrated this, widespread clinical adoption of needle placement robots has not immediately followed, because 1) Robots are generally expensive and 2) they are difficult to calibrate and register to the patient in a manner fast and user-friendly enough to be practical in the operating room. Our solution to these considerations is a novel, clinically applicable, low-cost system consisting of a robot (manipulating the needle through a surgeon specified trajectory), guided by tracked freehand 3 Dimensional Ultrasound (3 DUS). We address cost by algorithmically enabling the robot to be unencoded, uncalibrated, and mechanically simple. We address ease of use by eliminating preoperative registration, and nearly eliminating calibration. The surgical tool is tracked and thereby registered imager intra-operatively. A structured 3 DUS volume, created using a tracked conventional 2 DUS probe, provides the basis for accurate and reliable volumetric visualization, simulation, and planning. The system components are integrated using a 3 D Slicer-based software package. Experiments have been conducted on both <b>mechanical</b> and <b>calf</b> liver phantoms (with embedded olives simulating tumors) with an overall accuracy of 2. 54 mm and a targeting success rate of 100 %...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The authors {{study the}} <b>mechanical</b> {{behavior}} of <b>calf</b> pericardium {{employed in the}} construction of cardiac valve leaflets when subjected to telescoping suture, followed by tensile stress until rupture. One hundred twenty pericardial tissue samples were employed, 60 cut from root-to-apex and another 60 cut in transverse direction. Each of these two groups consisted of 12 control samples that were left unsutured and four sets of 12 samples each that were rejoined by telescoping suture using silk, Prolene, nylon or Gore-Tex., and subjected to tensile stress. At the rupture of the sutured tissues, the tensile stress of the suture materials ranged between 57. 54 MPa for the series sewn lengthwise with Gore-tex and 114. 08 MPa for the series sewn crosswise with silk. At these levels of stress, the deformation of the sutur...|$|R

Reid's AWR machine was designed to be easy to clean. He founded the AWR Milking Machine Company Limited to produce and market the machine. He also had it patented. The first AWR machines came on the market in about 1907 and were sold as far away as Australia.

40|$|Intra- and {{intercellular}} Ca(2 +) -signaling during <b>mechanical</b> stimulation in <b>calf</b> {{pulmonary artery}} endothelial cells (CPAE) was investigated with digital fluorescence microscopy. Mechanical stimulation of a CPAE cell in a Ca(2 +) -containing solution revealed {{a rise of}} the free intracellular Ca(2 +) -concentration ([Ca(2 +) ](i)) in the mechanically stimulated cell (MS) proceeding to the neighboring (NB) cells as an intercellular Ca(2 +) -wave. Experiments in Ca(2 +) -free solution, containing 2 mM EGTA, demonstrated that a detectable [Ca(2 +) ](i) -transient in the MS cell {{is not always a}} requisite for intercellular communication (IC). The Ca(2 +) -wave propagation was not affected by changes in membrane potential and was not mediated by voltage-dependent Ca(2 +) -channels. Ca(2 +) -influx through the Ni(2 +) -sensitive Ca(2 +) -pathway occurred in the MS as could be assessed by Mn(2 +) -quenching experiments. The intra- and intercellular Ca(2 +) -wave was triggered by the release of thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca(2 +) -stores. Phospholipase C (PLC) inhibition by U 73122 reduced the Ca(2 +) -amplitude of the MS cell and almost completely inhibited the IC, indicating that the Ca(2 +) -release in the MS and NB cells is PLC/inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP(3)) mediated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years the {{incidence}} of perinatal mortality of calves in calvings of primiparous cows has increased. Dystocia is the main cause {{for the death of}} the perinatal calf. The most important factor influencing calving performance is the birth weight of the calf. This study was designed to examine the influence of the duration of the close up period on the growth of the primiparous heifer, its hormonal birth preparation and calving performance. Additionally, this study was to show the influence of the varied duration of the close up period on the calf birth weight, its body measurements, its perinatal viability, clinical parameters and blood serum metabolites. This study was conducted between November 2003 and October 2003 on a Brandenburg dairy in Germany. 433 primiparous, artificially inseminated Holstein heifers were randomly allotted to three groups. A close up ration was fed to group 1 for one week (0 - 11 days), to group 2 for two weeks (12 - 16 days) and to group 3 for three weeks (> 17 days). The ration included 6. 1 - 6. 6 MJ NEL/kg, 12. 1 - 15. 0 % crude protein, 18. 6 - 23. 0 % crude fibre and 16. 5 - 22. 7 starch and other carbohydrates on a dry matter basis. The examination included the measurement of back-fat thickness by ultrasound and collection of a blood sample. The peripartum blood samples were analyzed for estradiol- 17 ß and progesterone concentrations. A final blood sample was taken immediately after the calving and additionally examined for its concentration of various serum metabolites. Calving difficulty was classified by three numerical scores: 0 = no difficulty; 1 = light calving assistance and 2 = extreme difficulty requiring the use of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>calf</b> puller. Prior to the first feeding of colostrum, the calf was weighed; its sex determined; the crown-rump-length, heart-girth, head width, body temperature, heart-rate and breathing frequency were measured and a blood sample was obtained. The concentration of lactate was measured in the whole blood and the concentration of various metabolites was measured in the blood serum. Within the first 24 hours the blood lactate was measured for a second time. At the ages of seven and fourteen days, the calf was weighed and its body measurements were re-taken. Disease and death cases until the fourteenth day were noted. The duration of the close up period did not influence the body measurements, the viability, the serological or clinical parameters nor the incidence of the perinatal mortality of the calf in this study. The blood lactate concentration of the neonatal calf was higher than the reference values of the adult cattle and was independent of the duration of the close up period. The growth, the back-fat thickness and the height at the withers of the heifers were identical in all three groups after calving. Higher birth weights of the calves lead to more calving difficulties. Although the calf birth weight did not differ between the groups, the longer the close up period, the more birth difficulties were observed. Calving difficulty score 2 was primarily caused by abnormal presentation and reduced relaxation of the maternal soft birth canal and not due to an exceptionally high birth weight. Its incidence was equal in all three groups of the study and therefore it was not influenced by the duration of the close up feeding. Higher calving difficulty scores led to more stillbirths in calves. Although the calving difficulty score 2 accounted for only 7 % of the calvings, it led to almost one third of the stillbirths. The other perinatal calf deaths were found in equal parts at the calving scores 0 and 1. The estradiol- 17 ß concentration in heifers with stillborn calves was significantly lower in the pre and peripartal period. This and the incidence of stillborn calves after a physiological delivery lead to the assumption that there is a prenatal lethal abnormity of the calf or a dysfunction of the placenta. Further investigations and studies of the placenta and the stillborn calf are necessary to evaluate this relationship. The supervision of the parturitions and the calves took place hourly. Based on this there was a very low incidence of stillbirth and postnatal morbidity and mortality of the calves. The duration of the prepartum transition feeding did not lead to any consequences regarding the postnatal development of the calves. In summary, perinatal mortality in calves is caused by a diversity of factors. In this study there were two major causes. On the one hand, heifers with stillborn calves showed a significantly lower prepartal estradiol- 17 ß concentration and the perinatal calf mortality also existed under easy deliveries. This indicates the existence of a calf which was already prenatal lethally damaged or lethal dysfunction of the placenta. On the other hand, difficult births lead to {{a large proportion of the}} perinatal mortalities. It is not possible to completely eradicate the possibility of stillbirths, though it can be significantly reduced by a shorter close up period. In combination with early identification and correction of dystocia, a large number of perinatal calf deaths could be avoided...|$|R
40|$|Intercellular Ca(2 +) -signaling, after <b>mechanical</b> {{stimulation}} of <b>calf</b> pulmonary artery endothelial cells (CPAE), was investigated with fluorescence video imaging. Mechanical stimulation evoked an intracellular Ca(2 +) -response in the mechanically stimulated (MS) cell, proceeding to the neighboring (NB) cells as a Ca(2 +) -wave. The intercellular propagation of the Ca(2 +) -wave was {{unaffected by the}} gap junction blockers halothane or heptanol. Therefore the intercellular communication (IC) pathway of the Ca(2 +) -wave in CPAE cells {{does not depend on}} gap junctional communication but is most likely mediated by release of an extracellular mediator. Continuous unilateral flow experiments confirmed the presence of a diffusible mediator: the Ca(2 +) -rise in upstream NB cells is significantly lower than in control experiments. After desensitization of purinergic receptors by pretreatment of CPAE cells with ATP (100 mM), UTP (100 microM), 2 MeSATP (100 microM) or ADPbS (100 microM), the propagation of the intercellular Ca(2 +) -wave upon mechanical stimulation was significantly inhibited. Also suramin (200 and 400 microM), a non-specific purinergic receptor blocker, reduced the IC. Application of the nucleotidase apyrase VI (10 U/ml), which has a high ATPase/ADPase ratio, enhanced Ca(2 +) -signaling and IC. In contrast, apyrase VII (10 U/ml), which has a high ADPase/ATPase ratio, significantly depressed the propagation of the intercellular Ca(2 +) -wave upon mechanical stimulation. Our experiments therefore demonstrate that the IC, evoked by a mechanical stimulus of CPAE cells, is mediated via release of nucleotides in the extracellular space. The data indicate that the diffusible messenger, responsible for the propagation of a Ca(2 +) -wave, is mainly ADP or a combination of ADP/ATP. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Perinatal {{mortality}} still {{represents an}} important problem in cattle breeding and dairy farms. Especially primiparous heifers {{are affected by}} stillbirths cause of their higher disposition for dystocia, which is more accompanied with a higher frequency of stillbirth. The appearance of dystocia and stillbirths is probably affected by the maternal periparturient condition {{as well as by}} birth weight of the calves. The aim of the current study is to investigate in which manner an increased density of energy and / or protein in excess of the recommended requirements during the close-up period could affect the maternal condition at calving and the calving performance. Furthermore, the study was to prove the influence of increasing nutrient density on birth weight and body measurements of the newborn calf as well as the perinatal viability and clinical and blood serum metabolite parameters. The data assessment for the current study was conducted from June, 2004 to February, 2005 on a dairy farm in northern Brandenburg, Germany. For this purpose, 339 late pregnant Holstein heifers were distributed randomly to eight experiment groups and eight control groups. Additionally to the usual nutritional ration, the 8 experiment groups received an additional nutrient treatment with 2 kg of corn groats (1), 2 kg triticale groats (2), 2 kg soybean groats (3), 100 g urea (4), 1 kg triticale groats and 1 kg soybean groats (5), 1 kg corn groats and 1 kg soybean groats (6), 1 kg triticale groats and 100 g urea (7), 1 kg corn groats and 100 g urea (8). The principal ration in the dairy contained 6, 82 MJ / kgTS as concentration of energy. This ration was given to the control groups only. For the nutritional supplemented groups, the close-up period started three weeks before expected date of calving, the heifers of the control groups were closed-up two weeks before expected calving date. The measurements of maternal conditional parameters started six weeks before expected calving date and were repeated at defined points of time. The measurements included the back fat thickness using ultrasound, the withers high and the body weight of the heifers. The last measurements were done immediately after parturition, combined with the taking of a blood sample for various serum metabolites. The calving difficulties were classified by using four degrees: 1) no difficulty, 2) mild assistance, 3) severe dystocia with requiring the <b>mechanical</b> <b>calf</b> puller, 4) caeseran section. After birth, the calves were examinated clinically by determing the heart rate, respiration rate and rectal temperature and the viability was determined by using the Apgar Scoring System. Additionally, the calf was weighed and measurements of crown-rump-length, heart-girth and head wide were done. After that, a blood sample was taken for determination of lactate in the whole blood and various serum metabolites. After 24 hours, the blood lactate and the metabolites were measured a second time an a second clinical examination occurred. The different intensities of energy and protein nutrition did affect the condition of the heifers by a significant gain of back fat during the close-up period. Nevertheless, the maternal condition showed no influence concerning the calving performance and the frequency of stillbirth. The different nutritional close-up management did not affect the birth weight or body measurements of the calves. The frequencies for occurring stillbirths amount 11, 1 % were higher in the experiment groups, especially in the high energy receiving heifers. A longer duration of close-up days affected directly the rate of stillbirths. A longer duration of pregnancy as well as the longer close-up period affected the birth weight of calves by representing an increase. A higher degree of obstetrics is associated with an increased risk for stillbirths. The still-born calves did not show higher weights or body measurements than the calves born alive. The nutritional treatment of the heifers did not affect the clinical parameters of the calves. Concerning the blood metabolites, the calves from control groups showed higher concentrations of serum protein after birth. The calves from the experiment groups occurred with a significant increase of blood urea, especially from the groups with high densities of protein and urea. The blood lactate from calves was higher after dystocia; male calves also showed high values for blood lactate cause of an augmented association with dystocia. Calves developed with calving difficulties showed higher activities for the enzymes CK and AST. Calves from unassisted births occurs with greater levels of GGT after 24 hours as a sign for a better colostral adsorption. The maternal blood metabolites from the nutrional supplemented heifers showed considerably higher urea levels, especially the groups with greater protein or urea density in the close-up rations. The higher levels of magnesium in serum of experiment heifers is considerable, cause of the usually expected decreasing absorption of magnesium when protein density in the diet is high. Other parameters were not affected by the nutritional treatments. For all heifers, control or experiment groups, the rates for GLDH after parturition shows slight increased levels and slight decreased levels for cholesterin. Heifers after severe calving difficulties are accompanied with higher activities for CK and AST. Heifers with no occurring difficulty while parturition represents higher rates of calcium in serum. Heifers undergoing stillbirths represents higher activities for GLDH an higher levels for serum urea, as well significantly lower levels for β- hydroxybutyrate...|$|R
40|$|Cartilage, {{particularly}} its collagen network, {{has been}} suggested {{by many to be}} fatigue prone, but the mechanism via which fatigue damage occurs is not yet well-understood. This work seeks to provide a simple framework to further our understanding of the degeneration of this tissue a result of fatigue damage via experimentation and analytical modeling. It was as observed that subjecting initially intact bovine tibial plateau cartilage to repeated long-term applications of an indentation loading protocol, which does not induce any observable damage over a single short-term application, can result in surface damage. The damage can be associated with an increase in the GAG release and decrease in the tissue nominal equilibrium modulus. The ability of the tissue to regain its original configuration also deteriorated with increasing number of loading cycles, but the change was generally gradual. Changes in the optimized parameters obtained from fitting a 1 -D rheological model to both the relaxation and cyclic loading responses of cartilage in the undamaged and damaged states suggested that both GAG and collagen have been weakened as a result of damage. A portfolio of data describing the 3 -D <b>mechanical</b> behavior of <b>calf</b> tibial plateau cartilage was obtained in this work. It was found that both the axial and lateral responses of cartilage were nonlinear during stress relaxation. Also, the resistance of the tissue to shear and volumetric deformation is dissipative, with the same time constants. (cont.) Finally, differences in the extra- and sub-meniscal tissue were noted. A structurally-based constitutive model that was originally formulated for cervical stroma was employed in this work in attempt to capture the mechanical response of cartilage. It was found able to capture the axial and lateral responses of cartilage in unconfined compression at 20 % nominal strain. Changes in the material parameters obtained from fitting the constitutive model to the indentation responses of cartilage in the native and damaged states suggested that damage has induced alterations in both GAG and collagen, echoing our earlier findings. by Bruce Y.

Programs that offer leadership training like the California Agricultural Leadership Foundation (CALF) work diligently to keep leadership alive in rural agricultural communities. Groups like CALF need to obtain more information from its students in order to evaluate {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} its program. The purpose of this study was to better understand the experiences of students who attend adult based leadership programs. This was done using a mixed methods survey with a large focus on qualitative data. The participants of the survey were students from CALF???s class 39 leadership program. Themes were developed from the qualitative data and support was offered by using basic descriptive statistics from the quantitative findings. The survey was administered at the end of the program anonymously over the Internet. There was a lack of demographic information and only one post-test survey, which makes this research more exploratory. The findings from the research can <b>aid</b> <b>CALF</b> or any other researcher by offering a jumping off point for further studies. The findings were limited to one year???s worth of students from CALF. While this research may be more beneficial to CALF, the participants??? descriptions of their experiences could be valuable to any leadership scholar. Like many qualitative studies, the findings may lead the reader to more questions than answers, but will surely offer insights to the understanding of leadership development programs. This study found that the experiential education portions of the program were most successful. Students also mentioned growth in understanding themselves and others. There seemed to be a desire to work with local communities as servant leaders. The overall understanding of leadership was improved and the understanding of the various forms of leadership was instilled. The shortcomings described by students were directly related to problems that the CALF staff was trying to overcome. The lack of conflict resolution training was due to the loss of its speaker, the issues with online communications was related to the change from Yahoo to Blackboard, and the problems internationally were from the lack of direct control and being lost in translation. CALF has reviewed this research and initiatives have been taken to change the program accordingly. The findings have brought insight about the feelings of the students and the overall impact of the program. Future research plans include a progressive survey that is administered a few times over the two-year program and a post-test survey given years after graduation.
