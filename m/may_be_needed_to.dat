5|$|The Joint Commission was tasked {{to report}} on the {{implementation}} of the Coinage Act of 1965, and make recommendations {{from time to time to}} the president, the Treasury Secretary, and Congress. The matters within its remit were to include technological advances, the need of the economy for coins, whether the U.S. should continue to maintain the price of silver, and whether the silver dollar should again be minted. Section 304 appropriated such money as <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> carry out the Coinage Act.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{lozenges}} {{have been}} used to treat symptoms, with some studies suggesting that they may reduce the duration of the common cold. Due to wide differences between the studies, further research <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> determine how and when zinc may be effective. Zinc lozenges may produce side effects, and there is only a weak rationale for physicians to recommend them as a treatment of the common cold. Some zinc remedies directly applied {{to the inside of the}} nose have led to the loss of the sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia {{may also be}} associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It {{may be necessary to}} rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear {{to be better than}} conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E
5|$|Nutria were {{introduced}} into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana {{has had a}} bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large American alligators, however, feed heavily on nutria, so American alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large American alligators that {{are the most important}} in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|E

Pecision measurements of elementary cross sections and couplings so far beautifully confirmed the Standard Model, which is however known to be incomplete.

American educators should consider the potential barrier of language, and cultural differences as well as struggles arising from adjustment to fathering expectations when interacting with Korean fathers. It is important that teachers and school administrators in the U.S. understand immigrant families’ cultural background with respect for diversity. Additional education, training, resources to educators and Korean fathers <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> better facilitate Korean fathers’ involvement in children’s learning and schooling.|$|R
