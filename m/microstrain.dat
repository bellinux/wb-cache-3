50|$|For the {{measurement}} of very large strains, 5% (50 000 <b>microstrain)</b> or above, annealed constantan (P alloy) is the grid material normally selected. Constantan in this form is very ductile; and, in gauge lengths of 0.125 in (3 mm) and longer, can be strained to >20%. It should be borne in mind, however, that under high cyclic strains the P alloy will exhibit some permanent resistivity change with each cycle, and cause a corresponding zero shift in the strain gauge. Because of this characteristic, and the tendency for premature grid failure with repeated straining, P alloy is not ordinarily recommended for cyclic strain applications. P alloy is available with S-T-C numbers of 08 and 40 for use on metals and plastics, respectively.|$|E

30|$|Figure  2 b {{shows the}} {{variation}} of integral breadths for the (111) and (200) peaks. It {{can be seen}} that the integral breadths of the two diffraction peaks of the interface M/M are significantly higher than that of the interface M/R during the whole pack-rolling deformation process. Particularly, it is noteworthy that there has been no large change in the integral breadth of the interface M/M, when comparing the final deformed state with the as-annealed state. In light of this, the evolutions of grain size and root-mean-square (r.m.s.) <b>microstrain</b> are carefully studied from the XRD line profile analysis. As can be seen in Fig.  2 c, two interfaces of the deformed samples show a tendency of grain coarsening, but with different coarsening rates. The average size of grains located at the interface M/R increases more rapidly, which is proved by the following TEM observation. On the other hand, <b>microstrain</b> analysis indicates that there is a small increase in r.m.s. <b>microstrain</b> for both interfaces during the early stage of rolling deformation, as illustrated in Fig.  2 d. With the continue of the deformation, the r.m.s. <b>microstrain</b> inside the interface M/R starts to steadily decline and reaches stability at a level of ~[*] 0.19 %, while the r.m.s. <b>microstrain</b> inside the interface M/M tends towards stability at a level of ~[*] 0.26 %. Such reduction in the r.m.s. <b>microstrain</b> is consistent with previous reports on the cold-rolled electrodeposited NC Ni-Fe alloy after large deformation. In combination with grain size evolution, the main reason for the decrease of r.m.s. <b>microstrain</b> would be associated to the grain coalescence and coarsening [27 – 29].|$|E

40|$|Aims and Objective: To {{find out}} and compare peri implant strain {{developed}} in four {{different types of}} implant supported prostheses i. e., cement retained splinted, cement retained non splinted, screw retained splinted, screw retained non splinted. Methodology: Four implant analogues were placed in a polyurethane mandibular model at the position of left and right first and second molar. Abutments were fixed to the implant at a torque of 25 Ncm. Two such models were made. Four different prostheses were placed on abutment of each model i. e screw retained splinted, screw retained nonsplinted, cement retained splinted, cement retained non splinted. Four strain gauges were attached on the model, two on the buccal and two on the lingual aspect of each implant. Static load of 400 N was applied on the prosthesis using universal testing machine. Load application was done ten times for each model and peri implant strain was measured. Results: The mean peri implant strain (±SD) generated {{was found to be}} highest in non-splinted screw retained (1397. 70 ± 44. 47 <b>microstrains</b> and 1265. 90 ± 42. 76 <b>microstrains)</b> and least in splinted cement retained (630. 70 ± 31. 98 <b>microstrains</b> and 519. 60 ± 32. 48 <b>microstrains)</b> in both 1 st and 2 nd molars respectively. Conclusions: Splinted crowns produce less peri implant strain when compared to non splinted crowns.
