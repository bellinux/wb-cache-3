NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E

But <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ivana Baquero as Ofelia / Princess Moanna, a {{child who}} comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the underworld. Del Toro said he was nervous about casting the lead role, and that finding the 10-year-old Spanish actress was purely accidental. (The film was shot from June–October 2005, when she was 11.) [...] "The {{character}} I wrote was initially younger, about 8 or 9, and Ivana came in {{and she was a}} little older than the character, with this curly hair which I never imagined the girl having. But I loved her first reading, <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>was</b> crying and the camera woman was crying after her reading and I knew hands down Ivana was the best actress that had shown up, yet I knew that I needed to change the screenplay to accommodate her age." [...] Baquero says that Del Toro sent her lots of comics and fairy tales to help her [...] "get more into the atmosphere of Ofelia and more into what she felt". She says she thought the film was [...] "marvelous", and that [...] "at the same time it can bring you pain, and sadness, and scariness, and happiness".|$|E
