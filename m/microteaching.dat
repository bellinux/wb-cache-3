5000|$|Years ago, Allen {{simplified}} {{the process}} of <b>microteaching</b> by incorporating the 2+2 performance appraisal system. The new <b>microteaching</b> model doesn't require video-taping the presentation. Participants are divided into small groups. When one group member does the presentation, other group members act as his/her students. After the presentation, these [...] "students" [...] provide feedback (oral or written) for the [...] "teacher" [...] on the lesson which includes 2 compliments and 2 suggestions (2+2). Based on his/her own reflections and peers' feedback, the presenter would re-teach the same micro lesson.|$|E

He held a month-long {{workshop}} on education reform in Taiyuan, {{which was the first}} of his 44 visits to China. He came to Taiyuan again in 1992, introducing <b>microteaching</b> to Shanxi educators. After that, he revisited Shanxi a few more times to follow up with <b>microteaching</b> progress. In 2008 and 2009, invited by Taiyuan Education Bureau, Jincheng Education Bureau, and Jincheng Technical & Vocational College, Allen came to Taiyuan and Jincheng to help with a teacher appraisal system focusing on 2+2, an assessment system developed by Allen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microteaching</b> was {{developed}} in the early and mid 1960s by Allen {{and his colleagues at the}} Stanford Teacher Education Program. It was designed to enhance teaching via open collegial discussion about teaching performance. The original Stanford model took a “teach → review & reflect → re-teach approach”, using actual school students as an authentic audience. The model has been adapted to college and university teacher training programs where it has been used most often to elicit a concentrated, focused form of peer feedback. The rationale of <b>Microteaching</b> is to apply collegial constructive criticisms to improve one's own teaching/learning strategies and, through assuming the student role, to sharpen one's insight into students' teaching/learning needs and expectations.|$|E
50|$|Since his Stanford {{days as a}} {{graduate}} student and later as a faculty member, Allen was committed to integrating technology into teaching and learning and to extensive education reform. In Stanford, he developed the first computer based school scheduling system and <b>microteaching,</b> which is a teacher training practicum that has been used worldwide ever since then.|$|E

50|$|The core of <b>microteaching</b> is the {{presentation}} of two 10-minute micro lessons by each participant. When one participant presents a lesson as an instructor, the other participants become students for that lesson. A timer is used to keep to the STRICTLY ENFORCED 10-minute time limit so that everyone can participate fully. Because of the strict time limit, it is impossible and unnecessary to cram an entire body of knowledge into 10 minutes; the 10-minute lesson can be excerpted from the beginning, middle or end of one lesson. This {{is designed to provide}} a snapshot of the teaching method or style of a participant {{in order to get a}} fresh perspectives on it from peers. Originally, a micro lesson was video-taped so that the presenter could review it and reflect on it after {{the presentation}}. Other participants also would review the tape and provide their feedback on the presentation. Based on his/her own reflections and peers' feedback on the micro lesson, the presenter would re-teach the same 10-minute lesson.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Social {{learning}} theory is {{the theory that}} is applied through <b>microteaching.</b> The two critical sets of social learning variables mediated through <b>microteaching</b> are those associated with modeling and feedback. <b>Microteaching</b> is also away of bringing specific teaching responses under experimental and behavioral control. Thus in ' each <b>microteaching</b> session, the learner emits teaching responses which are reinforced through videotape feedback or are elicited by viewing teaching behavior which is modeled in videotape presentation. The purpose of research using <b>microteaching</b> which mediate these variables {{is to determine the}} optimum combination of modeling and feedback which strengthens specific categories of teaching responses. The reseatcti-invesiigates the parameters of these variables which are most effective for eliciting desired teaching responses. Some interactions between type of response to be 'learned and type of treatment, modeling or feedback, have been found. Modeling has been found more effective than feedback when the modeling cues are highly discriminative.

40|$|<b>Microteaching,</b> {{a teacher}} {{training}} technique currently practiced worldwide, provides teachers {{an opportunity to}} perk up their teaching skills by improving the various simple tasks called teaching skills. With the proven success among the novice and seniors, <b>microteaching</b> helps to promote real-time teaching experiences. The core skills of <b>microteaching</b> such as presentation and reinforcement skills help the novice teachers to learn the art of teaching at ease and to the maximum extent.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2014. Major: Education, Curriculum and Instruction. Advisor: Aaron H. Doering. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 281 pagesMicroteaching {{has been widely}} accepted {{as one of the}} most important methods for providing on-campus clinical experiences to pre-service teachers (Amobi, 2005), while reflective practice is one of the important processes in pre-service teachers' <b>microteaching.</b> The communication among pre-service teachers, their supervisor and peers are the core of the process (Dewey, 1933; Schön, 1987; Shulman, 1987). On the one hand, the previous studies (e. g., Wepner, 1997) indicated that the traditional online communication tools, such as e-mails and e-journals, helped pre-service teachers conduct better reflective practice in <b>microteaching</b> compared with paper-based communication tools. However, these previous studies only focused on pre-service teachers' reflection-on-action (reflection after practice) and, sometimes, reflection-for-action (reflection before practice), while ignoring their reflection-in-action (reflection during practice) in <b>microteaching.</b> On the other hand, the recent research literature indicated that microblog, as a comparatively new online communication tool, had significantly positive impacts on education, including pre-service teachers' general reflective practice (Wright, 2010). However, none of the existing studies examined whether and how microblog has impacts on pre-service teachers' three types of reflective practice in <b>microteaching,</b> especially in a specific sociocultural context. Therefore, in order to fill the above research gap, this study uses a case study approach to explore Chinese K- 12 pre-service teachers' experiences of using microblog to integrate the three types of reflective practice in <b>microteaching.</b> The contributions of this study are two-folded. On the one hand, from the theoretical perspective, after reviewing the research literature regarding pre-service teachers' technology-enhanced reflective practice in <b>microteaching,</b> this study calls the attention of reforming the existing pre-service teachers' reflective practice to integrate the three types of reflective practice. This recommendation provides a new direction for future studies related to pre-service teachers' technology-enhanced reflective practice in <b>microteaching.</b> On the other hand, from the practical perspective, this study examines how Chinese K- 12 pre-service teachers used microblog to integrate the three types of reflective practice in <b>microteaching.</b> The findings from this case study present the empirical evidences regarding whether and how pre-service teachers use technologies to integrate the three types of reflective practices in <b>microteaching</b> in a specific sociocultural context.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) - University of Natal, 1985. This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with {{a study of the}} use of <b>microteaching</b> in the one year postgraduate teacher training course. It consists of two national surveys using two types of questionnaire, an Organisation and an Attitude Questionnaire. Education tutors and Subject Method tutors in United Kingdom universities, polytechnics and colleges offering one year postgraduate courses were requested to complete questionnaires about their use of <b>microteaching</b> and about their attitudes towards it. Visits were arranged to meet the staff involved and to see the type of facilities available. A similar survey was conducted in Departments of Education in South African universities. A comparative study of the use of <b>microteaching</b> in one year postgraduate teacher training courses was carried out on the data that was accumulated from the two surveys. Some interesting points of comparison can be made both on the types of <b>microteaching</b> organisation that have evolved in the two very different education systems and on the different attitudes of staff towards the use of <b>microteaching.</b> Based on the United Kingdom data, an in-depth study of the factors affecting the use of <b>microteaching,</b> was carried out. This study was related to the changes in teacher training in the United Kingdom during the seventies, following the publication of the James report, leading to a more professional approach to teacher training and the evolution of school-based training courses. Significant differences in the responses to the Organisation and Attitude Questionnaires from the different types of institution were examined using Chi-square. The Attitude data was examined for various groups of teacher training staff, who differed in their approaches to the organisation of <b>microteaching</b> because of, for instance, the different facilities available, the length of time available, the size of the student group or the logistics of the <b>microteaching</b> programme, by the use of Chi-square and significant differences in the responses of the different groups were reported. The results from the surveys were analysed and related to the research findings as published in the literature to see how the practitioners of teacher education differ in their views and approaches to <b>microteaching</b> from those responsible for the research into <b>microteaching.</b> Factor analysis of the responses to the Attitude Questionnaire from the different types of training institution, i. e.

40|$|In {{this report}} I {{have pointed out}} the {{problems}} of college students behaviour in the roles of teacher and pupil in <b>microteaching.</b> Ten students took part in this research and {{played the role of}} teacher and pupil ten tims respectively. 1. It was particularly noticeable that they got very nervous and shy when they played the role of teacher. They could not ask suitable questions, nor did they get any real responses of pupils, which resulted in a self-conceited lesson. 2. When the students played the role of pupil they could not become 'pupils' since they were ignorant of what pupils were like. They had little interest in learning because they were being taught what they already knew well. Therefore it is very natural that they almost desired to use real pupils in <b>microteaching</b> and to get real responses from pupils. <b>Microteaching</b> has to use real pupils {{if it is to be}} based on the theory of giving prominence to the learners' behaviour changes in lesson. In this case the organization of <b>microteaching</b> class is desiable to be in a similar situation to a normal class.

And in that case <b>microteaching</b> class need to be so organized as to simplify the complexities of normal classroom teaching. Close contact with cooperative schools is especially necessary in order to use real pupils in <b>microteaching.</b> The possibilities in our study are in that the student teams keep a class pupil while one lesson or they use a few pupils who are requested to stay after school.

My literature review on <b>microteaching,</b> which until recently had been a neglected field for two decades, includes higher education development needs as ‘adults-teaching-adults,’ <b>microteaching</b> as a response to novice teaching issues, and a contextual analysis of the model in different settings. I analyze and interpret the findings using a conceptual framework that synthesizes adult learning, self-efficacy, and reflective practices. This research finds that the opportunities to practice their teaching skills, with an intentional reflective feedback mechanism, allowed the novice faculty to prepare themselves in a safe and collaborative environment during MT-FPDP. However, <b>microteaching</b> content, activities, and supplementary material were neither closely relevant to varied teaching contexts of Pakistan nor appropriate in its application at the higher education level. Moreover, the lack of supervisors’ expertise to facilitate the <b>microteaching</b> processes, and mentor the novices discouraged the participation. Despite these hindrances, the novices reported behavior modification, self-efficacy, and use of reflective practices in their classrooms. However, discouraging organizational culture/policies, lack of collegial, administrative, and technical support, and geopolitical factors are the primary barriers to the implementation of the knowledge and skills. The Heads of Department (HoDs) /Deans confirmed the carryover from MT-FPDP to classroom teaching, and acknowledged these institutional supports and barriers. This research argues that the <b>microteaching</b> content and model must be adapted to the context of Pakistan, and the <b>microteaching</b> skills should be prioritized based on the higher education faculty needs. The Learning Innovation Division (LID) of the Pakistan Higher Education Commission (HEC) needs to appoint expert, unbiased, and culturally sensitive supervisors who can provide novices more self-directed, transformative, and reflective learning opportunities during MT-FPDP. LID/HEC should provide avenues for collaboration and coordination by establishing the informal “communities of practice” to foster collegial support within an institution and within a province...|$|E

In addition, our system enables evaluation comments to be displayed using a video while <b>microteaching.</b> As a result, an evaluator is able to input a comment while watching the teaching practice and the student is able to check the comments while watching the video...|$|E

Participants engage on the programme {{for a range of}} reasons: to broaden expertise and knowledge beyond the disciplinary boundaries within which they primarily operate; to build on and develop their scholarly profiles; and to reflect on their teaching experience to date. Participation in <b>microteaching</b> has provided a sense of validation for much of what these lecturers do and how they do it, which has resulted in ongoing critical reflection and peer discussion. Although initially giving rise to anxiety among some participants, <b>microteaching</b> has led to greater self-awareness and increased confidence in participants‟ own ability and expertise, and a reaffirmation of their teaching style and practice. There is a role for academic developers to support lecturers to be reflective and reflexive in order that they can create their own professional knowledge. The <b>microteaching</b> sessions provided an opportunity for the lecturers to gain insights into their 2 teaching role, engage in dialogue and become more reflective about their practice...|$|E
