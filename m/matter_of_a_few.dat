5000|$|National Poetry Month {{has also}} sparked some debate among writers, {{most notably in}} 1999 from poet and {{academic}} Charles Bernstein.

Almost overnight, Jeffress had established his reputation as an expert in mine hunting, a reputation that was to grow steadily {{over the next two}} decades.|$|E
25|$|While winning many converts, Christian missionaries made {{significant}} contributions towards the modernization of the country. Concepts of equality, human rights and freedom, and the participation of {{both men and women}} in religious activities were all new to Joseon. The Queen Consort was ecstatic at the prospect of integrating these values within the government. She had wanted the literacy rate to rise, and with the aid of Christian educational programs, it did so significantly within a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years.|$|E
25|$|A {{characteristic}} of the Merlot grape is the propensity to quickly overripen once it hits its initial ripeness level, sometimes in a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. There are two schools of thought on {{the right time to}} harvest Merlot. The wine makers of Château Pétrus favor early picking to best maintain the wine's acidity and finesse as well as its potential for aging. Others, such as Rolland, favor late picking and the added fruit body that comes {{with a little bit of}} over-ripeness.|$|E

[...] He argues that political engagement becomes <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> clicking <b>a</b> <b>few</b> links and neglects the vital, immeasurable inner-events and personal epiphanies that great social ruptures are actually made of. It reduces activism to a mere mouse click. Micah M. White goes on to argue that [...] "... clicktivism reinforces the fear of standing out from the crowd and taking a strong position. It discourages calling for drastic action. And as such, clicktivism will never breed social revolution. To {{think that it will}} is a fallacy. One that is dawning on us".|$|R
25|$|The city of Davis is {{a college}} town, with {{the ratio of}} {{students}} to long term residents estimated at 1:4. Also contributing to the college-town environment is the close proximity of downtown Davis to the campus' main quad—a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> blocks, and 5- to 10-minute walk or bike ride. Davis' 15 minute distance from Sacramento provides it with both the isolation critical to fostering a college-town environment while also providing a lively and large metropolitan area nearby. Though the campus itself is vast, the entire community of Davis is relatively small and is easily traversable on bike utilizing Davis' extensive bicycle trails.|$|E

Contrary to the belief, the supplies of cedar in western Washington are comparatively limited, and the greatest reserves of this timber are {{along the line of}} the Lake Shore.

The main twist {{this season}} saw the HouseGuests competing as couples; they competed as couples, were nominated as couples, and were evicted as couples. This twist went {{on until the}} third week, when the couples were told they could officially play as individuals. Another twist this season saw a previously evicted HouseGuest returning to the game on Day 35, with the returning HouseGuest decided partly by the HouseGuests themselves. This season also introduced the Power Couple twist, in which the winners of this title were required to evict one couple from the house in a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days.|$|E

As the Assyrians were segregated into large tents according to tribe, the Nochiya Assyrians had a separate dwelling area.|$|R

25|$|Extrusion is {{the process}} of {{kneading}} and shaping {{at the same time and}} in the <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes. This process takes place in an extruder which is a grooved extrusion cylinder equipped with an extrusion worm which is a shaft with deep thread around its core. The extrusion worm kneads and moves the dough forward and presses it through the dies in the head of the extruder. The longitudinal grooves in the cylinder reduce the friction and improves the movement of the dough. Both the worm and the cylinder are made of stainless steel, but the worm has a Teflon coating to decrease friction.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Nada moved to Europe, setting in Austria, {{and began working}} with a cheese factory in Graz. In 1961, {{a close friend of}} Nada's invited him to Libya where a {{construction}} boom was developing. Nada seized on the occasion and started to spend his time between Libya and Austria. In a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years he became the largest supplier of cement to the North African country. The activity led him to partner with Cementir, the Italian cement maker, to develop in 1965 the world's first floating cement silos, two barges named GI-1 and GD-2 able to store bulk cement and loaded with bagging facilities. Cement soon became his main business along with smaller operations in other commodities ranging from steel to agricultural materials. Nada had tremendous business success in his ventures with Saudi Arabia, Libya and eventually, the Nigerian government.|$|E
25|$|The {{plot of the}} manga and anime {{series is}} mainly about Hikari and her dream {{to become one of}} the world's best gymnasts. As both the anime and manga {{continued}} to develop, the story revolves around Hikari, Ooishi and Shiina and the incidents, mishaps, and life learning adventures they experience as they work hard for their dreams to reach Olympic stardom. In the anime series Mao, a young musician is introduced quickly and goes from a secondary character to a primary character within a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> episodes (he appears later as a part of the manga cast in volume 4). The television show would occasionally give more attention to the lives of the antagonists (Mao's manager), minor characters (Hikari's family) or average-everyday people as a way of setting up a plot, or clarifying a point (a common method among anime series of the 1980s and today). Flashbacks were also used occasionally in the show for similar reasons. Some other minor characters were a bit underdeveloped or received very little character development because some of them were only used as part of visual quality of the anime and manga series in general or due to the anime being concluded after only nineteen episodes. The producers had to limit the appearances and character development of some characters in order to focus on the main characters in order to give the anime series a decent ending in the little amount of episodes the anime series had left to conclude the story as well as possible.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that LEP probes the Big Bang in two {{significant}} ways: (1) nucleosynthesis, and (2) dark matter constraints. In the first case, LEP verifies the cosmological standard model prediction {{on the number}} of neutrino types, thus strengthening the conclusion that the cosmological baryon density is approximately 6 percent of the critical value. In the second case, LEP shows that the remaining non-baryonic cosmological matter must be somewhat more massive and/or more weakly interacting than the favorite non-baryonic dark <b>matter</b> candidates <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years ago...|$|R

Nos. 46227, 46231 and 46232 were therefore summarily withdrawn.|$|E
