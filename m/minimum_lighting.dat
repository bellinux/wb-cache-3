40|$|New R-band {{observations}} of 21 local field RR Lyrae variable stars {{are used to}} explore the reliability of <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> (V-R) colors {{as a tool for}} measuring interstellar reddening. For each star, R-band intensity mean magnitudes and light amplitudes are presented. Corresponding V-band light curves from the literature are supplemented with the new photometry, and (V-R) colors at <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> are determined for a subset of these stars as well as for other stars in the literature. Two different definitions of <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> color are examined, one which uses a Fourier decomposition to the V and R light curves to find (V-R) at <b>minimum</b> V-band <b>light,</b> (V-R) _min^F, and the other which uses the average color between the phase interval 0. 5 - 0. 8, (V-R) _min^ϕ(0. 5 - 0. 8). From 31 stars {{with a wide range of}} metallicities and pulsation periods, the mean dereddened RR Lyrae color at <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> is (V-R) _min, 0 ^F = 0. 28 pm 0. 02 mag and (V-R) _min, 0 ^ϕ(0. 5 - 0. 8) = 0. 27 pm 0. 02 mag. As was found by Guldenschuh et al. (2005) using (V-I) colors, any dependence of the star's <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> color on metallicity or pulsation amplitude is too weak to be formally detected.

40|$|We analyze Galactic, Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud Cepheids and RR Lyrae {{variables}} {{in terms of}} period-color (PC) and amplitude-color (AC) diagrams at the phases of maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>light.</b> We compiled Galactic Cepheids $V$- and $I$-band data from the literature. We make use of optical bands light curve data from OGLE-III survey for Cepheids and RR Lyrae {{variables in}} the Magellanic Clouds. We apply the $F$-statistical test to check the significance of any variation in the slope of PC and AC relations for Cepheid variables. The PC relation at maximum light for Galactic Cepheids with periods longer than about 7 days is shallow and the corresponding AC relation is flat for the entire period range. For the fundamental mode Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, we find significant breaks in the PC and AC relations at both maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> for periods around 10 days. The PC relation at maximum light for the Magellanic Clouds is flat for Cepheids with periods greater than 10 days.

The dispersion of the color at <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> was found to be small, supporting the use of this parameter as a means to obtain accurate interstellar extinctions along the line of sight up to the distance of the RR Lyrae star.

40|$|Investigation of period-color (PC) and amplitude-color (AC) {{relations}} at the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> {{can be used to}} probe the interaction of the hydrogen ionization front (HIF) with photosphere and the radiation hydrodynamics of the outer envelopes of Cepheids and RR Lyraes. For example, theoretical calculations indicated that such interactions would occur at <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> for RR Lyrae and result in a flatter PC relation. In the past, the PC and AC relations have been investigated by using either the $(V-R) _{MACHO}$ or $(V-I) $ colors. In this work, we extend previous work to other bands by analyzing the RR Lyraes in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 Region. Multi-epoch data is available for RR Lyraes located within the footprint of the Stripe 82 Region in five ($ugriz$) bands. We present the PC and AC {{relations at}} maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> in four colors: $(u-g) _ 0 $, $(g-r) _ 0 $, $(r-i) _ 0 $ and $(i-z) _ 0 $, after they are corrected for extinction. We found that the PC and AC relations for this sample of RR Lyraes show a complex nature in the form of flat, linear or quadratic relations. Furthermore, the PC relations at <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> for fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars are separated according to the Oosterhoff type, especially in the $(g-r) _ 0 $ and $(r-i) _ 0 $ colors.

A film that Shamroy was quite proud of was Wilson (1944), a pacifist film made during World War II. It was never shown to the troops, for obvious reasons.

It took a hundred men moving arcs around the ballroom. Darryl F. Zanuck was so surprised by the first shots that he kissed Shamroy to the cheers of the staff. With 5,000 people in the blaze of light and hundreds of flags flapping, the re-creation of the Baltimore Democratic Convention of 1912 was a most startling shot on the screen. In Forever Amber (1947), Shamroy shot many of the exteriors in rain.

The high-spatial resolution polarimetric images have allowed us to detect clear time variations in the clumpy dust clouds as close as 34 [...] 50 ~mas (1. 4 [...] 2. 0 Rstar) to the star. We detected {{the formation of a}} new dust cloud and the disappearance of one of the dust clouds detected at the first epoch. The Halpha and TiO emission extends to ~ 150 mas (~ 6 Rstar), and the Halpha images reveal time variations. The degree of linear polarization is higher at <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> (13 [...] 18 %) than that at pre-maximum light. The power-law-type limb-darkened disk fit to the AMBER data in the continuum results in a limb-darkened disk diameter of 49. 1 +/- 1. 5 mas and a limb-darkening parameter of 1. 16 +/- 0. 49, indicating that the atmosphere is more extended with weaker limb-darkening compared to pre-maximum light.

40|$|Background: Vision {{and hearing}} {{impairments}} {{in the elderly}} (aged over 80 years) and poor indoor lighting conditions in a home-care setting are risk factors for functional decline, reduced social participation, withdrawal, and accidents. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the changes in vision, hearing, and lighting conditions {{in the homes of}} participants aged over 80 years after implementation of a clinical intervention. Methods: We undertook an exploratory randomized, controlled experimental study of sensory impairments and lighting conditions in the homes of elderly aged over 80 years who received home care. The intervention group (IG) received advice and encouragement to improve their vision, hearing, and indoor lighting conditions in the home, with a 10 -week follow-up period. The control group (CG) received their usual care and underwent the same vision and hearing tests but were provided no intervention. Results: Vision and hearing (self-assessed) and tested by Wilcoxon rank-sum test were significantly better (P= 0. 025 and P= 0. 008, respectively) in the IG after the intervention and follow-up. The test between the groups showed a significance of P= 0. 026 for visual acuity and P= 0. 098 for pure-tone average. The maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>lighting</b> levels were significantly improved in the IG after the intervention (P= 0. 002 and P= 0. 039, respectively) but were unchanged in the CG. Conclusion: Several of the IG participants did not follow all of the advice; however, among those who did, vision, hearing, and lighting conditions were all significantly improved. It appears that modest interventions have great potential for improving vision and hearing. Older patients in the home-care setting cannot be expected to take the necessary action to improve their sensory impairments by themselves.

However very different behavior is found at <b>minimum</b> <b>light.</b> The long period (P> 10 days) LMC models imply that the photosphere is disengaged from the HIF at <b>minimum</b> <b>light,</b> similar to the Galactic models, {{but there are some}} indications that the photosphere is located near the HIF for the short period (P < 10 days) LMC models.

We apply the idea of the HIF-photosphere interaction to explain recent suggestions that the LMC period-luminosity (PL) and PC {{relations are}} non-linear with a break at a period close to 10 days. Our empirical LMC PC and PL relations are also found to be non-linear with the F-test.

The subspace of F 2 E(Γ) that is generated by the rows of the adjacency matrix of L(Γ) is dubbed σ 1 (Γ). We view σ 1 (Γ) as a linear code in F 2 E(Γ) and let ρ(σ 1 (Γ)) be the covering radius of σ 1 (Γ). For any S⊆V(Γ), the edge-boundary of S is the set EB(S) of edges with exactly one endpoint lying inside S. The edge isoperimetric number of Γ, denoted b(Γ), is defined to be maxkmin#S=k#EB(S). The main result of this note is that the <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> number of L(Γ) is equal to max{ρ(σ 1 (Γ)),b(Γ) }. We also determine the sizes of all orbits of the lit-only sigma game on L(Γ).

The original Audit Report for the site, completed in 1991, recommended a lighting retrofit that included delamping, relamping with high efficiency lamps, the installation of high efficiency electronic ballasts, and the installation of specular reflectors. However, if the retrofit could be implemented without the use of specular reflectors, then a considerable amount of investment capital would be saved...|$|E

Objective: We aimed to evaluate the changes in vision, hearing, and lighting conditions {{in the homes of}} participants aged over 80 years after implementation of a clinical intervention. Methods: We undertook an exploratory randomized, controlled experimental study of sensory impairments and lighting conditions in the homes of elderly aged over 80 years who received home care. The intervention group (IG) received advice and encouragement to improve their vision, hearing, and indoor lighting conditions in the home, with a 10 -week follow-up period. The control group (CG) received their usual care and underwent the same vision and hearing tests but were provided no intervention. Results: Vision and hearing (self-assessed) and tested by Wilcoxon rank-sum test were significantly better (P= 0. 025 and P= 0. 008, respectively) in the IG after the intervention and follow-up. The test between the groups showed a significance of P= 0. 026 for visual acuity and P= 0. 098 for pure-tone average. The maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>lighting</b> levels were significantly improved in the IG after the intervention (P= 0. 002 and P= 0. 039, respectively) but were unchanged in the CG. Conclusion: Several of the IG participants did not follow all of the advice; however, among those who did, vision, hearing, and lighting conditions were all significantly improved. It appears that modest interventions have great potential for improving vision and hearing. Older patients in the home-care setting cannot be expected to take the necessary action to improve their sensory impairments by themselves. They require close monitoring, help from a specialist, and help to improve the indoor lighting conditions in their homes.

40|$|Background Hearing {{and vision}} {{impairments}} and poor indoor lighting {{conditions in the}} homes of older persons are risk factors for functional decline, reduced social participation, and accidents. A literature search revealed that few studies have focused on hearing and vision abilities in home-care patients older than 80 years, and on the indoor lighting in their homes. Aims The main aims of this study were to obtain knowledge about the characteristics of hearing and vision impairments in elderly recipients of home care, and to determine whether there is consistency between self-assessments and standardized tests of hearing and vision in the elderly. Furthermore, the aim was to measure the effects of an intervention designed to improve their functional hearing and vision and the lighting conditions in their homes. Design and method The study consists of two substudies. Substudy 1 (Papers I and II) had a cross-sectional design in which 93 elderly recipients of home care {{with a mean age of}} 89 years were screened for hearing and vision impairments. Paper I was a baseline description of the data on hearing and vision impairments, and Paper II was a Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve analysis used to compare self-assessments of hearing and vision abilities with a gold standard test. Substudy 2 (Paper III) was an exploratory, randomized, controlled trial involving an intervention group (n = 46) and a control group (n = 47) that tested whether improved indoor lighting, removal of earwax, and referrals to specialists can improve the functional hearing and vision in the elderly (Paper III). Results Substudy 1 found that 41 % of the 93 recipients of home care had slight and 47 % had moderate hearing impairments according to the World Health Organization (WHO) measurement scale (1). The mean pure-tone average (PTAV) was 40. 4 dB for the better ear in each subject. According to the WHO, the PTAV is 0. 8 for normal vision in the elderly. When the patients were asked to self-assess their hearing and vision function with a single global question (“Do you consider your hearing/vision to be good, not so good, poor or very poor/deaf/blind?”), the results were only weakly correlated with the PTAV and VA measurements. When they were asked about their communication and reading abilities more in detail, however, 72 % admitted it was difficult to understand speech. Nearly 30 % found it tiring to read and 41 % could not read very small print (Paper I). Seventeen percent reported having difficulties in performing activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living because of hearing and vision impairments. To explore consistency between standardized tests and global self-assessments, we used the cutoff points on the global self-assessment scale of hearing and vision with the corresponding results on the goldstandard tests, which were PTAV 0. 7. Comparison of findings yielded 18 false negatives for hearing, and 40 false negatives for vision. This indicated that a significant proportion of the older people in this study reported their functional hearing and vision as good on the global question when standardized tests indicated that they were not (Paper II). Substudy 2 revealed that the elderly in this study lived in poorly lit environments with lux values far below what is recommended for older people (3). However, the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>lighting</b> values were significantly improved in the intervention group after the intervention (P = 0. 02 and P = 0. 039, respectively). All participants in the intervention group who were asked to remove their earwax had seen their general practioner and had their earwax removed during the intervention (Paper III). Conclusion Many elderly recipients of home care live with hearing and vision impairments which have not been sufficiently attended to. Asking elderly people aged 80 + years about their functional hearing and vision with a single global question will not provide accurate information about their hearing and vision problems. It is necessary to use standardized tests in addition. When asking more detailed questions about their communication and reading abilities, the elderly reported having difficulties. Indoor lighting levels in their homes showed that the lighting levels were far below recommended values, but were significantly improved in the intervention group after the intervention. Many elderly could not be expected to do all the self-care activities necessary to improve their functional sensory impairments and/or the indoor lighting conditions in their homes.

40|$|We use {{published}} OGLE LMC/SMC data {{to present}} comprehensive Period-Color (PC) and Amplitude-Color (AC) relations for both fundamental and overtone stars. For fundamental mode stars, we confirm earlier work that the <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> extinction corrected PC relation in V-I has a shallow slope but with considerable scatter (LMC: [0. 093 ± 0. 019] {{with a standard}} deviation about this line of 0. 116, SMC: [0. 055 ± 0. 058] {{with a standard deviation}} about this line of 0. 099). We note the high scatter about this line for both the LMC and SMC: either there is some source of uncertainty in extinction or some other physical parameter is responsible for this dispersion. We compare with previous results and discuss some possible causes for this scatter. In contrast, RRc overtone stars do not obey a flat PC relation at <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> (LMC: [0. 604 ± 0. 041] with a standard deviation about this line of 0. 109, SMC: [0. 472 ± 0. 265] with a standard deviation about this line of 0. 091). The fact that fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars obey a flat relation at <b>minimum</b> <b>light</b> and overtone RR Lyrae stars do not is consistent with the interaction of the stellar photosphere and hydrogen ionization front. We compare these results with PC relations for fundamental and first overtone Cepheids. The fact that the PC relations change significantly as a function of phase indicates strongly that Cepheid and RR Lyrae relations can only be understood at mean light when their properties as a function of phase are determined.
