50|$|In {{the cell}} as {{developed}} for cardiac pacemaker application, the anode is lithium and the cathode a proprietary composition of iodine and poly-2-vinyl pyridine, {{neither of which}} is electrically conductive. However, after processing by mixing and heating to ~ 150 °C for 72 hours the components react {{with each other to}} form an electrically conductive viscous liquid which, while still molten, is poured into the cell where it cools to form a solid. When the liquid contacts the lithium anode it creates a <b>monomolecular</b> <b>layer</b> of semiconducting crystalline lithium iodide. As the cell is discharged by the current load of the pacemaker, the reaction between the lithium anode and iodine cathode forms a growing barrier of lithium iodide, which being resistive causes the terminal voltage of the cell to decrease approximately as an inverse function of the volume of the barrier. Pacemaker designers use this characteristic to permit detection of incipient 'end of life' of the pacemaker's lithium cell.|$|E

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ultrasound absorption and <b>monomolecular</b> <b>layer</b> technique were applied to study the effect of AmB on organisation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) membranes.

The enthalpy of the phase transition decreases with the increase in molar fraction of AmB incorporated to membranes. The exceptionally sharp decrease in the enthalpy of the transition was observed in the membranes containing 5 – 7 mol% AmB.
