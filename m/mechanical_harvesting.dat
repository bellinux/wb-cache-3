40|$|Harvest {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agronomical techniques of oregano cultivation. Traditionally, oregano is manually harvested but the times of this operation are very long. On the contrary, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvest</b> could decrease the harvest times and, therefore, the production costs.

25|$|The age of vine {{can also}} {{contribute}} to how much grassy character the resultant wine may have {{as well as how}} early the grapes are harvested.

25|$|At harvest time, AOC {{regulations}} stipulate grapes for Grand Cru vineyard must {{be picked}} {{with a potential}} alcohol level of at least 11 percent, at least 10.5 percent for Premiers Crus and 9.5 percent for AOC Chablis vineyards.

The vine does face significant viticultural hazards with significant sensitivity to several viticultural hazards including rot, powdery mildew, downy mildew, and grape worms. Carignan is a late budding and ripening grape which requires a warm climate in order to achieve full physiological ripeness.

The area has a very hot Mediterranean climate that allows the grape to ripen fully and produce wines with very high alcohol levels of up to 18% and wines must have at least 13% to qualify for certification in the region.

25|$|The steep river bank slopes {{that are}} {{scattered}} around the Mosel region are considered {{some of the most}} labor-intensive vineyards in the world. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>harvesting</b> is impractical and nearly seven times more man hours are needed in the Mosel than in flatter terrain such as the Médoc. Grapevines are individually staked to the ground without connecting wires so that vineyard workers can tend the plants going horizontally across the vineyard rather than vertically, which would be more treacherous and tiring. Safety is a priority for many Mosel vineyard owners with the area having a documented history of fatalities among workers while tending the vines. A benefit of the steep Mosel vineyards is that the incline allows for more direct sunlight to have contact with the vines. During the winter, rain often causes some soil erosion, especially of the vital slate chips that are needed for their heat retaining properties. Many vineyards will gather these eroded sediments and carry them back up the hillside.|$|E
25|$|Outside Piedmont, Barbera {{is found}} {{throughout}} Italy, {{often as a}} component in mass vino da tavola blends. In the Lombardy region, {{it is seen as}} a varietal in Oltrepò Pavese with wines that range from slightly spritzy to semi-sparkling frizzante. Elsewhere in Lombardy it is blended with Croatina and {{as part of a larger}} blend component in the red wines of Franciacorta. Southeast of Piedmont, Barbera is found in Emilia-Romagna in the hills between Piacenza, Bologna and Parma. As in Lombardy, Barbera is often softened by blending with the lighter Croatina as it is in the Val Tidone region for the DOC wine of Gutturnio. In Sardinia, the grape is used around Cagliari in the wine known as Barbera Sarda and in Sicily, the grape is used in various blends under the names Perricone or Pignatello made near Agrigento. Barbera was an important grape in re-establishing the wine industry of the Apulia and Campania regions following World War II due to its high yields and easy adaption to <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Today it is a permitted variety to be blended with Aglianico in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Taurasi though it is rarely used.|$|E
30|$|Retention harvest, group selection, {{and other}} {{mechanical}} methods are alternative management treatments for improving regeneration in giant sequoia groves and have several {{advantages and disadvantages}} {{compared to the use}} of wildland fire. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>harvest</b> is often a more precise method for creating canopy gaps to increase light penetration, remove competitors, and produce conditions suitable for growth of giant sequoia seedlings and saplings (Benson 1986, Piirto and Rogers 2002). It is not limited by fire safety or smoke generation concerns and may provide revenue to offset the cost of forest restoration treatments (Stephenson 1996). Coupled with planting of giant sequoia seedlings (Stephens et al. 1999), <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvest</b> can be effective at enhancing giant sequoia regeneration by providing increased light availability in closed canopy forests (York et al. 2004).

25|$|The viticultural and {{winemaking}} {{practices of}} making sparkling wine have many similarities {{to the production}} of still wine with some noted divergence. At the vineyard, grapes are harvested early when there is still high acid levels. In areas like Australia, winemakers aim to harvest the grapes at 17 to 20° brix. Unlike still wine production, high sugar levels are not ideal and grapes destined for sparkling wine production may be harvested at higher yields. Care is taken to avoid tannins and other phenolic compounds with many premium producers still choosing to harvest by hand rather than risk <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvesting</b> which may split the berries and encourage maceration between the skins and juice. The press house is often close by the vineyard to where the grapes can be quickly pressed and separated from their skins. Red wine grapes like Pinot noir can be used in the production of white sparkling wines because their juice is initially clear and is only later tinted red through exposure to the color pigments in grape skins. While some skin exposure may be desirable in the production of rosé sparkling wines and some blanc de noirs (white of blacks), most sparkling wine producers take extended precautions to limit the amount of skin contact.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Madeira has an oceanic climate with some {{tropical}} influences. With high rainfall and average mean temperature of 66°F (19°C), {{the threats of}} fungal grape diseases and botrytis rot are constant viticultural hazards. To combat these threats, Madeira vineyards are often planted low trellises, known as latada, that raise the canopy of the vine off the ground similar to a style used in the Vinho Verde region of Portugal. The terrain of the mountainous volcanic island is difficult to cultivate, so vineyards are planted on man-made terraces of red and basaltic bedrock. These terraces, known as poios, {{are very similar to}} the terraces of the Douro that make Port wine production possible. The use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>harvesting</b> and vineyard equipment is near impossible, making wine grape growing a costly endeavor on the island. Many vineyards have in the past been ripped up for commercial tourist developments or replanted with such products as bananas for commercial concerns. Some replanting is taking place on the island; however, the tourist trade is generally seen as a more lucrative business than wine-making.
