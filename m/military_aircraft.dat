5|$|An FAA {{study in}} 1968 {{had found that}} {{a quarter of the}} 2,230 {{near-miss}} aircraft encounters reported that year had involved a <b>military</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Following the in-flight collision of Flight 706, the FAA and the US Military agreed to cut down on VFR flights and operate instead under IFR. This transition would require <b>military</b> <b>aircraft</b> to file flight plans and obey civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Military</b> {{transport}} <b>aircraft</b> or <b>military</b> cargo <b>aircraft</b> {{are typically}} fixed wing and rotary wing cargo aircraft {{which are used}} to airlift troops, weapons and other military equipment {{by a variety of}} methods to any area of military operations around the surface of the planet, usually outside the commercial flight routes in uncontrolled airspace. Originally derived from bombers, <b>military</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> were used for delivering airborne forces during the Second World War and towing military gliders. Some <b>military</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> are tasked to perform multi-role duties such as aerial refueling and, rescue missions, tactical, operational and strategic airlifts onto unprepared runways, or those constructed by engineers.|$|R

5|$|Flight 706 had {{departed}} Los Angeles just after 6pm, on route to Seattle, with scheduled stopovers in Salt Lake City, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Lewiston, Idaho; Pasco, Washington and Yakima, Washington. The F-4 Phantom was arriving at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro near Irvine from Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada. The F-4 pilot and all 49 {{passengers and crew}} aboard the civilian airliner died in the collision over the San Gabriel Mountains, near Duarte. Only the Radar Intercept Officer of the F-4 survived. The crash of RW 706 prompted the US Armed Forces to agree to both {{reduce the number of}} <b>military</b> <b>aircraft</b> operating under visual flight rules in civilian air corridors, and to require <b>military</b> <b>aircraft</b> to contact civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
5|$|For the {{majority}} of its operational lifetime, Loring was a heavy bomber, aerial refueling, and interception facility for <b>military</b> <b>aircraft,</b> equipment, and supplies first as part of Strategic Air Command (SAC) (1947–1992), then as part of the succeeding Air Combat Command (ACC) (1992–1994).|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these recommendations, the NTSB also recommended that the Department of Defense restrict high-speed, low-altitude aircraft operation in civilian air corridors, consider collision avoidance technologies on <b>military</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and make military pilots aware of the FAA's radar advisory service.|$|E

He also flew many <b>military</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the co-pilot's seat, including a B-29 Superfortress and a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. In addition, he survived a crash during World War II as a passenger in a Miles Master.|$|E

5|$|At the International <b>Military</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Competition at Zürich, Switzerland in 1937, the Dornier Do 17M V1 {{proved a}} leader in its class and was faster than the fastest foreign fighter, the French Dewoitine D.510.

5|$|During {{the first}} months of the war, airmen and {{anti-aircraft}} soldiers saw only sporadic combat; it was on 10May 1940, when Germany commenced the drive into the west, that the Swiss army as a whole was mobilized a second time.

5|$|In early December, the US {{military}} personnel occupying the base, {{along with all}} military equipment, were shifted to the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan via US <b>military</b> <b>aircraft.</b> On 10 December, Pakistani troops from the Frontier Corps took full control of the airfield as scheduled, and by 11 December all remaining American staff were evacuated.
