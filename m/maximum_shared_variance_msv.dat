The present study aimed to determine {{the reliability and validity}} of the Persian Version of Death Depression Scale (DDS) in Iranian patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Methods: The face validity, content validity and construct validity (i. e. factorial, convergent, and discriminant validity) of the DDS were assessed using a sample of 407 AMI patients. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using the ratio chi-square by degrees of freedom (χ 2 /df), the Goodness-of-fit index (GFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Incremental Fit Index (IFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed using average <b>variance</b> extracted (AVE), <b>maximum</b> <b>shared</b> squared <b>variance</b> (<b>MSV),</b> and average <b>shared</b> square <b>variance</b> (ASV). Internal consistency, test–retest, and construct reliability (CR) were used to assess reliability of the Persian Version of DDS. Results: Based on principle component analysis and consideration of conceptual meaning, a four-factor solution was selected, explaining 75. 89 % of the total variance. Goodness-of-fit indices (c 2 (98) = 583. 646, p <. 05, c 2 / df = 5. 956, GFI =. 856, CFI =. 902, NFI =. 885, IFI =. 902, RMSEA (90 % C. I.) =. 110 (. 102 -. 119) in the final DDS structure demonstrated the adequacy of the four-domain structure of the DDS. Convergent and discriminant validity was used to assess the construct validity of the DDS. The reliability was greater than. 70. Conclusion: The DDS was found to be a valid and reliable assessment tool for death depression in Iranian patients with AMI. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the organization of}} the postural control system in human upright stance. To this aim the <b>shared</b> <b>variance</b> between joint and 3 D total body center of mass (COM) motions was analyzed using multivariate canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The CCA was performed as a function of established models of postural control that varied in their joint degrees of freedom (DOF), namely, an inverted pendulum ankle model (2 DOF), ankle-hip model (4 DOF), ankle-knee-hip model (5 DOF), and ankle-knee-hip-neck model (7 DOF). Healthy young adults performed various postural tasks (two-leg and one-leg quiet stances, voluntary AP and ML sway) on a foam and rigid surface of support. Based on CCA model selection procedures, the amount of <b>shared</b> <b>variance</b> between joint and 3 D COM motions and the cross-loading patterns we provide direct evidence of the contribution of multi-DOF postural control mechanisms to human balance. The direct model fitting of CCA showed that incrementing the DOFs in the model through to 7 DOF was associated with progressively enhanced <b>shared</b> <b>variance</b> with COM motion. In the 7 DOF model, the first canonical function revealed more active involvement of all joints during more challenging one leg stances and dynamic posture tasks. Furthermore, the <b>shared</b> <b>variance</b> was enhanced during the dynamic posture conditions, consistent with a reduction of dimension. This set of outcomes shows directly the degeneracy of multivariate joint regulation in postural control that is influenced by stance and surface of support conditions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose This study {{examined}} bivariate, unique, and multivariate associations between psychopathy facets and other Personality Disorders (PDs). Method 76 incarcerated males were assessed with clinical interviews measuring psychopathy and DSM- 5 PDs. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) {{was used to}} examine multivariate associations between dimensional scores of psychopathy facets and other PDs. Results Preliminary analyses of bivariate and partial associations revealed that much of the covariation between psychopathy and PD traits reflected <b>shared</b> <b>variance</b> among psychopathy facets and among PD traits. After controlling for the <b>shared</b> <b>variance,</b> unique relationships were limited to positive relationships between Narcissistic PD and interpersonal facet and between Paranoid PD and antisocial facet ratings. Canonical Correlation Analysis yielded two pairs of functions that explained the <b>shared</b> <b>variance</b> between psychopathy and PDs. In the first pair of functions, elevations on the interpersonal and antisocial facets were associated with symptoms of Paranoid, Narcissistic, Histrionic, and Antisocial PDs. In the second pair of functions, high levels of the antisocial facet and low levels of the interpersonal facet were related to Borderline PD. Conclusion Results suggest that associations between psychopathy and DSM- 5 PDs go beyond established links with Antisocial and Narcissistic PDs to include associations with Histrionic, Borderline, and Paranoid PDs.

40|$|Abstract One of the {{fundamental}} problems in speech engineering is phoneme segmentation. Approaches to phoneme segmentation {{can be divided into}} two categories: supervised and unsupervised segmentation. The ap-proach of this paper belongs to the 2 nd category, which tries to perform phonetic segmentation without using any prior knowledge on linguistic contents and acoustic models. In an earlier work, we formulated the segmentation problem into an optimization problem through statistics and information analysis. An objective function, summa-tion of squared error (SSE), is developed by using Euclidean distance of cepstral features. However, it is not known whether or not Euclidean distance yields the best distance metric to estimate the goodness of segmentations. A popular generalization of Euclidean distance is Mahalanobis distance (MD). In this paper, we study whether and how MD can be used to improve the performance of segmentation. The essential problem here is how to deter-mine the parameters (covariance matrix) for MD calculation. We deal with this problem in a learning framework and propose two criteria for determining the optimal parameters: Minimum of Summation <b>Variance</b> (<b>MSV)</b> and Maximum of Discrimination <b>Variance</b> (MDV). <b>MSV</b> minimizes the summation of variance within phonemes, while MDV maximizes the variance between phonemes and minimizes the variance within phonemes at the same time. Both of them can lead to close form solutions by using matrix calculation. We also propose an algorithm to learn the parameters without using labeled data. We carried out experiments on the TIMIT database to eveluate the proposed methods. The results indicate that the use of learning MD can increase the correct recall rates. We also found the use of power can further improve the results...|$|R
