40|$|<b>Multiskilling</b> in {{a journalism}} context {{is not a}} case of “de-skilling” of the profession. There are {{problems}} related to the quality in newsrooms adapting <b>multiskilling</b> strategies, but in general <b>multiskilling</b> is more correctly defined as a re-skilling or an up-skilling. This is the conclusion from results of a survey of 1, 500 journalists in Poland, Russia and Sweden, along with interviews with 60 journalists in these three countries. <b>Multiskilling</b> in journalism gives more room for creativity and more power to the individual journalist, according to those with experience of working as multi-reporters. It allows them more freedom {{to make their own decisions}} in their daily tasks, e. g., choosing subjects and stories. At the same time, from the perspective of the media company, <b>multiskilling</b> is a strategy to increase production in the newsrooms. But <b>multiskilling</b> has no direct correlation with downsized newsrooms: it is rather an industry norm for how to organize work in newsrooms of today.   <b>Multiskilling</b> is also changing the journalistic culture, putting more focus on production and adapting content for different channels.

40|$|Using Displaced Worker Surveys {{merged with}} {{occupational}} information on <b>multiskilling</b> from other sources, {{we examine the}} relationship between <b>multiskilling,</b> earnings, and displacement-induced earnings losses. Overall, we find that workers in multiskilled jobs earn more, both in the multiskilled job and in the job they locate after displacement. Since the latter differential outweighs the former by a small but statistically significant amount, <b>multiskilling</b> mitigates displacement-induced earnings losses. Controlling for the total training time required for the job, however, <b>multiskilling</b> is associated with lower earnings in both the predisplacement- and postdisplacement jobs. Since the latter effect is smaller than the former, a small prophylactic effect against displacement-induced wage losses exists in this sense as well...|$|E
40|$|<b>Multiskilling</b> in {{the context}} of a number of {{countries}} has been identified as significantly improving service quality, retention, job satisfaction, remuneration and promotion. The Taiwanese hotel industry suffers a labour skills deficiency and <b>multiskilling</b> the existing workforce is one way to address this, however, there is little research that explores this issue in the Taiwanese context. This exploratory research, a survey of a sample of five star hotels, finds that <b>multiskilling</b> training for frontline managers has been adopted by the majority of these hotels and three beneficial factors are positively correlated with <b>multiskilling,</b> with service quality as the most important. The other significant factors are retention and job satisfaction. Remuneration and promotion are found to have a non significant relationship with <b>multiskilling.</b> The findings suggest that <b>multiskilling</b> within a positive employment relationship, where remuneration and promotion are taken into account, especially in relation to the largely female workforce, could help hotels reduce high turnover rates of staff thus, establishing a stable and multiskilled workforce in the hotel industry in Taiwan.

40|$|Recent {{studies show}} the {{construction}} industry in the USA is facing a long term labour shortage. <b>Multiskilling</b> has been suggested as a strategy {{to address this issue}} by utilizing existing workers more efficiently. <b>Multiskilling</b> decreases the number of workers hired for a project and can improve productivity. Additional benefits include higher income and increased employability of the workforce. To take full advantage of these benefits, the workforce strategy and the planning and scheduling processes of a construction project must be adapted to use <b>multiskilling</b> effectively and efficiently. The multiskilled workforce should be scheduled and organized to maximize the duration of employment for workers, reduce the overall labour requirements and cover the skills combinations required by the project. This research synthesizes and formalizes the methods that successful construction companies are currently applying to implement a multiskilled workforce.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2006. There are {{a number}} of {{challenges}} that are facing the South African manufacturing industry today. Companies within this sector are trying all they can to ensure the optimal utilisation of physical and human resources and the maximisation of profit, all this at a very minimal possible cost. Each company within the industry is struggling for a competitive edge and bigger market share compared to other companies manufacturing the same product. Haas et al. (2005 : 1) suggest that the manufacturing companies need more flexible labour strategies, like <b>multiskilling,</b> as a way of dealing with these challenges. Hulett Aluminium (Pty) Ltd, South Africa's largest aluminium producer and based in Pietermaritzburg, was used by the researcher as a case study. The company was founded in 1946 as a subsidiary of the international Alcan Aluminium Group. It is South Africa's largest manufacturer of semi-fabricated and finished aluminium products. The company introduced <b>multiskilling</b> in 2000, the main objective being to equip the employees with a variety of skills for the benefit of both the company and the employees themselves. This research study was undertaken to establish the extent to which Hulett Aluminium (Pty) Ltd has taken advantage of the theoretical benefits associated with <b>multiskilling.</b> To achieve this the following issues were investigated: preparation of a suitable environment for the application of <b>multiskilling,</b> effects of new, advanced technology on <b>multiskilling,</b> effects of absenteeism due to workshops, training programmes and personal matters, productivity levels, labour turnover, labour costs, trend towards selfmanaged groups, job satisfaction, employee motivation and industrial conflicts. This study first discussed the theoretical perspectives on <b>multiskilling.</b> This is followed by the description of Hulett Aluminium (Pty) Ltd, with specific description of the company's profile, the organisational structure, the aluminium supply chain and the company's core business. The description of the company is followed by the methodology used for the collection of data as well as the outline of the interpretation procedures followed. Research findings and discussion are also given. The key findings of this study are that both managers and shop floor employees at Hulett Aluminium agree that <b>multiskilling</b> contributes to increased organisational labour productivity, reduced organisational overall costs, and reduced industrial conflicts. Other areas of agreement include the fact that multiskilled employees need appropriate resources for the application of their skills; training is an essential tool for <b>multiskilling</b> and that rewards for a multiskilled workforce are a motivating factor for in the workplace. The final conclusion drawn is that much as Hulett Aluminium (Pty) Ltd has embraced <b>multiskilling,</b> there is still a lot the company needs to do or improve on, so that it could enjoy the benefits of the programme. Based on the findings of this study, some of the recommendations made for Hulett Aluminium are: • A detailed planning process for proper implementation ofmuItiskilling • All the relevant stakeholders within the company should be {{part and parcel of the}} implementation of the programme • Benchmarking with other manufacturing companies which have implemented <b>multiskilling</b> • Training of new recruits so that they could be at equal par with the old employees and also contribute positively to increased organisational productivity. 1...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{significance}} of the construction and building services sector internationally cannot be overemphasised. In the UK, the industry currently accounts for 10 % gross domestic product (GDP) and employs 2 million people, {{which is more than}} 1 in 14 of the total workforce. However, regardless of its output (approximately £ 65 billion annually) there has been a steady {{decline in the number of}} trade entrants into the construction and building services sector. Consequently, the available ‘pool of labour’ is inadequately resourced; productivity is low; the existing labour force is overstressed; there is an increase in site deaths; and a long-term labour shortage is envisaged. Today, the evidence seems to suggest that <b>multiskilling</b> is a tentative redress for ameliorating the skills crisis in the construction and building sectors. A 43 -year time-series of data on 23 manpower attributes was evaluated as part of this investigation. The developed linear regression models show that the concept of <b>multiskilling</b> obeys the ‘law of diminishing returns'.

40|$|The {{organisation}} of work groups now {{occupies a}} central place {{in the study of}} employment relations. Godard and Delaney (2000) suggest this preoccupation reflects the decline of institutional bargaining systems in western economies, and the resurgence of interest in the importance of management choice in determining working arrangements. The present paper enters this discussion with a review of the importance of organisational factors in shaping work organisation. In particular it is focussed on the importance of technological arrangements on the form and nature of those arrangements. The work of the Dutch Socio Technical Systems (STS) School is used to illustrate the importance and potential of technology to shape such work arrangements. The debate about the changes which have occurred in work organisation in the last 20 years has taken a number of paths. A dominant preoccupation in the literature is whether the changes which have taken place are part of a broader shift from Fordist work organisation to an emerging paradigm based on teamwork, <b>multiskilling,</b> standardisation and greater worker autonomy (Belanger, Giles & Murray 2002). More perceptive proponents of the concept of an emerging model, including Belanger, Giles and Murray, recognise that a stable pattern has not yet occurred and that there are tensions within the model. In particular, the extent to which employees have increased decision-making power is seen to vary between countries, workplaces and industries (Appelbaum & Batt 1994; Muller, Proctor & Buchanan 2000; Edwards, Geary & Sisson 2002) ...|$|E
40|$|Cedefop Reference seriesIn {{a global}} economy, where {{competition}} for innovation dominates and customers no longer accept standardised mass {{products or services}} but ask for individual solutions, markets become unstable, insecure and complex. Companies have to develop organisational structures and channels of information flow that can cope with uncertainty. There is widespread agreement that production {{can no longer be}} organised according to Tayloristic and Fordist principles and most studies talk about a 'new organisation logic'. More flexible organisation forms are needed which allow for extensive information and knowledge exchange to improve and speed up innovation processes. Key elements of the new organisation logic are outsourcing of non-core activities, transition to a process-oriented structure, introduction of teamwork, empowerment, participation in decision-making, etc. The central argument is that global competitiveness can only be achieved through changes in labour deployment policy and human resource orientation. Labour can no longer be considered a risk factor or something to be kept in line by means of a maximum division of labour. On the contrary, division of labour has to be reduced and human capital fully exploited. Until now, empirical research has not shown a widespread implementation of new organisation concepts. Globalisation and changes in the division of labour require new skills, competences and work attitudes from employees. This imposes major challenges on vocational and educational training: work-process knowledge, on-the-job training, <b>multiskilling,</b> creativity, lifelong learning, employability, etc. have become keywords.

Change commenced in the 1980 s recession when benchmarking activities suggested that more successful steel companies invested in both capital and people. Since then, the company has invested in people through numerous programmes including continuous training, vocational education qualifications, job flexibility and mobility, delayering, standard and target setting, appraisal, performance pay to recognise individual behaviour and contribution, and management training to improve leadership and the company's ability to manage change. By 1988, the company had adopted an HRM approach. In 1992, the senior management introduced a 'harder' form of HRM by establishing a fully single status company and derecognizing the four trade unions. The company has become an exemplar of HRM. This case study adds to the HRM debate by demonstrating through a wide range of measures that HRM has given the company scope for high performance...|$|E
40|$|Learners {{experiencing}} {{barriers to}} learning often require intervention {{and support from}} multiple professionals with different areas of expertise. Collaboration between professionals is important in avoiding fragmented and incoherent service delivery. Transdisciplinary service delivery allows for maximum integration among the various role players. Disciplinary boundaries are transcended {{through a process of}} skills transference and sharing of roles and provide child-centred, coordinated and collaborative support. This study investigates professionals in the Western Cape’s perceptions of a transdisciplinary service delivery approach for supporting learners experiencing barriers to learning. A sequential mixed method approach was utilized to gain an in depth understanding of professionals’ perceptions. Data were collected in two phases. During the first phase, a quantitative questionnaire was sent to various professional categories in the Western Cape who are expected to provide services to learners experiencing barriers to learning. The aim of the quantitative study was to provide background information for the second phase in which professionals’ perceptions of a transdisciplinary approach for supporting learners experiencing barriers to learning were obtained through eight focus group discussions. Four focus groups consisted of professionals who had not previously been exposed to a transdisciplinary approach. These professionals attended a two hour informative workshop on a transdisciplinary service delivery approach prior to the focus group. The remaining four focus groups consisted of professionals who had previously been exposed to transdisciplinary service delivery. Data were systematically analysed through a hybrid process of inductive and deductive analysis. Findings indicate that professionals providing services to learners experiencing barriers to learning perceive a transdisciplinary approach as useful and much needed for services provided both in schools and in private practice. Certain aspects of the transdisciplinary approach are perceived as more or less valuable, depending on the context and specific category of learning barrier. Although professionals acknowledge all aspects of the approach as valuable, <b>multiskilling</b> and role release are viewed as most needed. The transference of skills among therapists, teachers, parents and caregivers is perceived to contribute to effective and feasible service delivery. Psychology of EducationD. Ed.

30|$|Taiichi Ohno (1988) – who {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the grandfather of the Toyota Way –was the first to stress the system character of lean production. Ohno emphasizes that what makes Toyota stand out is not any of the individual elements, but having all the elements together as a system and practice them every day in a very consistent manner, not in spurts. In fact, most of the “lean” literature and many of the studies of the Toyota production and management system have adopted (explicitly or implicitly) a configurational approach. Womack et al. (1990) were the first to conceive lean production as a configuration and have summarized it as a universally applicable system. Since then, the original conceptualization has evolved as a result of theory refinements and empirical studies. Lean production is a system that ought to be distinguished from the lean characterizing elements and manifestations that Sugimori et al. (1977) originally described. Some of the literature emphasizes the philosophy of lean and its underlying principles (Womack and Jones 1996; Spear and Bowen 1999); some other underline the practical and observable aspects of the related practices, tools, processes (Shah and Ward 2003). Empirical evidence for a configuration approach to lean production was first given by MacDuffie (1995) who demonstrated that the superior performance of lean production systems can be linked back both to the interrelatedness of several HR practices in an “internally consistent HR bundle” as well as the integration of that bundle with lean manufacturing policies. Shah and Ward (2007) study offers a definition of lean production as an integrated socio-technical system whose main objective is to eliminate waste by concurrently reducing or minimizing supplier, customer and internal variability. More recently, De Menezes et al. (2010) study demonstrates how the integrated application of lean practices supports the achievement of multiple goals and results in superior performance. These studies largely converge on the organizational attributes that distinguish the “lean configuration” which usually includes just-in-time production, supermarkets and kanban, quality systems, work teams, workers’ <b>multiskilling,</b> people internal development and careers, collaborative supplier management, set-based product engineering, and organization-wide continuous improvement. We use the construct of configuration in a formative sense (Fiss 2009), referring to the “actual” configuration or activity system of Toyota, observing the empirical manifestations of the construct and highlighting the deviations of it from the idealtype. More specifically, our case study focuses on the dynamics of such deviation.|$|E
