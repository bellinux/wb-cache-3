5|$|By 1850, {{most of the}} surface-lying gum {{had been}} picked up, and people began digging for it. The hillsides yielded shallow-buried gum (about 1m), but in the swamps and beaches, it was buried <b>much</b> <b>further</b> down (4m or below).|$|E

5|$|Around 980, in the west, Lubusz Land {{also came}} under Mieszko's control and another {{important}} gord {{was built in}} Włocławek <b>much</b> <b>further</b> east. Masovia was still more loosely associated with the Piast state, while the Sandomierz region was for a while their southern outpost.|$|E
50|$|Count Alexander Borisovich Buturlin (Russian, in full: граф Александр Борисович Бутурлин; 1694-1767) was a Russian {{general and}} courtier whose career was <b>much</b> <b>furthered</b> by his {{good looks and}} {{personal}} affection of Empress Elizabeth.|$|R
60|$|The {{development}} was <b>much</b> <b>furthered</b> by a delight in his guest which proved greater even {{than he had}} anticipated. For it seemed that Will was not only at home in all those artistic and literary subjects which Mr. Brooke had gone into at one time, {{but that he was}} strikingly ready at seizing the points of the political situation, and dealing with them in that large spirit which, aided by adequate memory, lends itself to quotation and general effectiveness of treatment.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach <b>much</b> <b>further</b> away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} stimulated <b>much</b> <b>further</b> work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres—and beyond have been studied. The {{configuration}} of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention. René Descartes gave a formula relating the radii {{of the solution}} circles and the given circles, now known as Descartes' theorem. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket, {{which is one of}} the earliest fractals to be described in print, and is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy–Littlewood circle method.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Milnrow {{during the}} Middle Ages was a hamlet located within the {{township}} of Butterworth and parish of Rochdale. It was named by the Anglo-Saxons, but the Norman conquest of England resulted in its ownership by minor Norman families, such as the Schofields and Cleggs. In the 15th century, the descendants of these families successfully agitated for a chapel of ease to be constructed in Milnrow by {{the banks of the}} River Beal, triggering its development as the main settlement in Butterworth. Despite this distinction, Milnrow did not increase <b>much</b> <b>further</b> in size or population until the dawn of the woollen trade in the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} {{of sexual orientation}} is a far from complete subject. While neuroscience has made advancements shedding light on the mechanisms and relationships between the human brain and sexual orientation, <b>much</b> more <b>further</b> research should be conducted.|$|R
30|$|The {{significantly}} {{negative impact}} of the establishments’ further training activities on their demand for unskilled labour agrees with other empirical findings, as unskilled workers exhibit <b>much</b> lower <b>further</b> training participation (for the German case, confer Leber and Moeller, [2008]).|$|R
50|$|VSIDS {{is quite}} {{effective}} because {{the scores of}} variable phases is independent of the current variable assignment, so backtracking is <b>much</b> easier. <b>Further,</b> VSIDS guarantees that each variable assignment satisfies {{the greatest number of}} recently searched segments of the Boolean expression.|$|R
5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process <b>much</b> <b>further,</b> making almost all {{guarantees}} of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention <b>much</b> <b>further</b> than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E
5|$|Kelly {{attracted}} {{the most attention}} as part of Miles Davis' band from 1959, including an appearance on the trumpeter's Kind of Blue, often mentioned as the best-selling jazz album ever. After leaving Davis in 1963, Kelly played with his own trio, which recorded for several labels and toured the United States and internationally. His career did not develop <b>much</b> <b>further,</b> and he had difficulty finding enough work late in his career. Kelly, who was prone to epilepsy, died {{in a hotel room}} in Canada following a seizure, aged 39.|$|E

50|$|A {{series of}} albums of Petrykivka {{painting}} reproductions edited by the noted art historians Natalia Hlukhen’ka and Borys Butnyk-Sivers'kyi {{were published in}} the 1960s and ‘70s. With their large circulation, they did <b>much</b> to <b>further</b> popularize the Petrykivka painting style in Soviet Ukraine.|$|R
5000|$|Unsure {{about their}} fate on a {{national}} label, yet unable to affirmatively do <b>much</b> to <b>further</b> their career on that front, The Badlees decided to produce a short new EP of [...] "unplugged" [...] songs that were recorded in Bret Alexander's home basement studio.|$|R
5|$|Manstein's plan, {{developed}} with the informal cooperation of Heinz Guderian, {{suggested that the}} Panzer divisions attack through the wooded hills of the Ardennes where no one would expect them, then establish bridgeheads on the River Meuse and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Wehrmacht would thus cut off the French and Allied armies in Belgium and Flanders. This {{part of the plan}} later became known as the Sichelschnitt ("sickle cut"). Manstein's proposal also included a second thrust outflanking the Maginot Line, which would allow the Wehrmacht to force any future defensive line <b>much</b> <b>further</b> south.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human occupation. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans {{returned}} as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was <b>much</b> <b>further</b> north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000–5,000BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several days, Bilis moved {{generally}} northwestward toward Taiwan, slowly strengthening over open waters. Bilis was designated a severe tropical storm by the JMA on July 11, but the storm did not strengthen <b>much</b> <b>further</b> {{over the next few}} days due to a marginal upper-air environment and dry air entrainment. PAGASA upgraded the system to typhoon status on July 12, but the JMA never officially recognized the system as such in its advisories. Bilis reached its official peak intensity of 60knots (110km/h, 70mph) later that day.|$|E
40|$|Funding cuts {{announced}} to Queensland Aboriginal communities last month will of course affect the budgets of Aboriginal Shire Councils. But their {{impact will be}} felt <b>much</b> more <b>further</b> afield than just within council offices. Put simply, these cuts will reduce the autonomy of Aboriginal communities across the state...|$|R

5|$|Rousay, Egilsay and Gairsay lie {{north of}} the west Mainland across the Eynhallow Sound. Rousay {{is well known for}} its ancient monuments, {{including}} the Quoyness chambered cairn and Egilsay has the ruins of the only round-towered church in Orkney. Wyre to the south-east contains the site of Cubbie Roo's castle. Stronsay and Papa Stronsay lie <b>much</b> <b>further</b> to the east across the Stronsay Firth. Auskerry is south of Stronsay and has a population of only five. Shapinsay and its Balfour Castle are a short distance north of Kirkwall.|$|E
5|$|Shapley's {{measurements}} {{also indicated}} that the Sun is relatively far {{from the center of}} the galaxy, also contrary to what had previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and those stars that lie in the direction of the galactic centre and beyond are thus obscured by gas and dust, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at <b>much</b> <b>further</b> distances.|$|E
5|$|Silk {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of a protein {{very similar to that}} used in insect silk. It is initially a liquid, and hardens not by exposure to air but as a result of being drawn out, which changes the internal structure of the protein. It is similar in tensile strength to nylon and biological materials such as chitin, collagen and cellulose, but is much more elastic. In other words, it can stretch <b>much</b> <b>further</b> before breaking or losing shape.|$|E

5|$|The Venus Express probe {{has shown}} through stellar {{occultation}} that the atmospheric haze extends <b>much</b> <b>further</b> {{up on the}} night side than the day side. On the day side the cloud deck has a thickness of 20km and extends up to about 65km, whereas on the night side the cloud deck {{in the form of}} a thick haze reaches up to 90km in altitude—well into mesosphere, continuing even further to 105km as a more transparent haze. In 2011, the spacecraft discovered that Venus has a thin ozone layer at an altitude of 100km.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge over}} Swinefleet Warping Drain {{was the subject}} of an unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked {{permission}} for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it to reach their place of work. To access it, they would need to walk through the goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk <b>much</b> <b>further</b> each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E
5|$|The first {{region on}} either side of the bilayer is the {{hydrophilic}} headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend <b>much</b> <b>further,</b> for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the lipopolysaccharide coat on a bacterial outer membrane, which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration.|$|E
60|$|During this period, {{the most}} {{unfavourable}} to literature which had occurred {{for at least}} two centuries, Dryden, the subject of this memoir, was gradually and silently imbibing those stores of learning, and cultivating that fancy which was to do so <b>much</b> to <b>further</b> the reformation of taste and poetry. It is now time to state his descent and parentage.|$|R
30|$|As a consequence, {{given the}} result of this analysis, we remain skeptical on the idea {{supported}} by international agencies that retention of skilled workers can be achieved via aid.
