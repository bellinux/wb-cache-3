40|$|In my diploma work I {{designed}} <b>multilevel</b> <b>junction</b> between expressway in 3. development axis and motorway A 2 near Trebnje. There {{is also a}} junction between regional road R 2 - 448 and expressway in {{the same}} place. So both junctions are treat as one. A posibility of traffic connections from economic zone Trebnje to expressway in 3. development axis is shown also. In {{the first part of}} my diploma work I present the project of 3. development axis and its basic geographic, economical, traffic and environmental characteristics. Then I present basic systems of multilevel junctions and its elements wich are used in practice. Also I describe the course of motorway A 2 near Trebnje. On the base of this informations and informations about the use of land in the area near Trebnje I prepare 4 variants of <b>multilevel</b> <b>junction.</b> I made the situation of each junction and longitudinal profile of each joining ramp. For every variant I needed to make a deviation of regional road R 2 - 448 because the space between both junctions is needed. I also present the net of local roads with connections of economic zone Trebnje and expressway. In the final part of my diploma work I describe each variant and I chosse the most appropriate solution of <b>multilevel</b> <b>junction</b> regarding to basic designing estimation.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} analyze seismic {{response}} of the curved ramp bridge, this paper selected a single curved ramp bridge in a <b>multilevel</b> <b>junction</b> system as its research object. Considering the piers, beams, bearings and expansion joints simulation, it respectively built the calculating models for a curved ramp bridge and a corresponding linear one. Using nonlinear time history analysis, the paper contrasts seismic {{response of the}} curved ramp bridge {{with that of the}} linear one in several different seismic inputs. Finally the seismic response characteristic of a curved ramp bridge is put forward...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} some {{results of the}} author’s dissertation research dedicated to formation of an architectural typology of high urbanized multifunctional units of urban structure of the largest cities (further HUMUUS) as centers of social activity, which include buildings, constructions, transportation equipment and open spaces, where human flows transpose, start and end {{with the purpose of}} bringing into this space a concentrated maximum of goods, services and information with minimum time expenditures. This article draws attention to the development analysis of the structure-forming functions of HUMUUS and their town planning and environmental impact on the surrounding area. The study of planning structures of the largest Russian cities (Samara, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod) made it possible to identify a number of main objects, in which structure-forming functions of HUMUUS are materialized: railroad complex (historically formed, developed, dominated, system-wide road junction), transport interchange hub (providing intraurban messages), public office and business centers, leisure and entertainment centers, shopping centers. Basing on researches of Russian and foreign experience, it is possible to predict with full confidence the following trends and streams of environmental and urban development of HUMUUS in the near-term perspective: Strengthening of the environmental and urban frame by network evolution of HUMUUS; Inclusion of green areas of HUMUUS in the system of citywide green areas; Increment of the interest of the investors to the public road junction for the purpose of reorganization of them to full HUMUUS with all characteristics of high-urbanized and environmental and urban reorganization (separation of traffic and pedestrian flows, maximum capacity, multiple-level system, multifunctional, increase in landscaped green space, reconstruction of engineering systems and communications, the use of modern ecological building designs and finishing materials); Preferential development of the intracity HUMUUS with all the characteristics of intensification of using space (reduction in area of transporting communication with the help of <b>multilevel</b> <b>junction,</b> increment of a number of stories in a building, the use of the levels of the underground space, mechanization of horizontal communication, release of the territory for planting, use of intelligent eco-stabilizing systems of control and management of functioning HUMUUS); Development of the territorial growth trends of HUMUUS with reconstruction of the functional processes and environmental settings in joint junction area; Emphasis of landscape and recreational areas development; Strengthening the role of creation of living environment and planting in the existing urban planning and functional HUMUUS...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project has brought fresh {{knowledge of the}} efficiency and traffic quality of slip roads at <b>multilevel</b> <b>junctions.</b> The results were obtained from observations of the traffic flow at slip roads to urban expressways (Class B). Various types were studied: single-lane slip roads to two-lane and three-lane main roads (type E 1 /E 2) and two-lane slip roads to two-lane main roads (type E 4 /E 5). Speeds were always restricted to 80 km/h or 100 km/h at the measuring points observed.

500|$|Basingstoke is at Junction 6 and Junction 7 of the M3 motorway, which skirts the town's southeastern edge, {{linking the}} town to London and to Southampton and the south-west. The central area of the town is encircled by a ring road {{constructed}} in the 1960s named The Ringway and bisected {{from east to west}} either by the A3010 or Churchill Way. The A33 runs north east to Reading and the M4 Motorway and south west to Winchester. [...] The A30 runs east to Hook and west to Salisbury. The A303 begins a few miles south west of Basingstoke to head west towards Wiltshire and the West Country, sharing the first few miles with the A30. The A339 runs south east to Alton and north west to Newbury. Basingstoke has a reputation for having a large density of roundabouts, and with some larger roundabouts dealing with traffic from six directions, this only adds to the illusion, as does the fact some <b>multilevel</b> <b>junctions</b> on the Ringway were never built or completed.|$|R
40|$|We study inelastic {{effects on}} the {{electronic}} current noise in molecular junctions, due to the coupling between transport electrons and vibrational degrees of freedom. Using a full counting statistics approach based on the generalized Keldysh Green's function technique, we calculate in an unified manner both the mean current and the zero-frequency current noise. For <b>multilevel</b> <b>junctions</b> with weak electron-phonon coupling, we give analytical formulas for the lowest order inelastic corrections to the noise in terms of universal temperature- and voltage-dependent functions and junction-dependent prefactors, which can be evaluated microscopically, e. g. with ab-initio methodologies. We identify distinct terms corresponding to the mean-field contribution to noise and to the vertex corrections, and we show that the latter contribute substantially to the inelastic noise. Finally, we illustrate our results by a simple model of two electronic levels which are mutually coupled by the electron-phonon interaction and show that the inelastic noise spectroscopy is a sensitive diagnostic tool. Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures. The paper is supplemented by a Mathematica notebook with the full expressions for the lowest order corrections to the current and noise due to electron-phonon coupling.

50|$|The Sinsen Interchange (Sinsenkrysset) is {{a heavily}} trafficked, <b>multilevel</b> road <b>junction</b> in Oslo, Norway. It connects the {{highways}} Norwegian National Road 150 and Norwegian National Road 4 (Trondheimsveien). The junction has existed since the 19th century, and has grown considerably in size since then. It was enhanced with a roundabout in 1957, and was connected with National road 150 in 1962. The increase in traffic {{was greater than}} {{the capacity of the}} junction, and thus a bridge was constructed that redirected Trondheimsveien above the roundabout. Further restructuring was done in 1992, when a local tramway line was redirected outside of the interchange, and in 1994, when Riksvei 150 was directed below the roundabout. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration plans to connect the Løren Tunnel, a planned tunnel over National road 150, with the Sinsen interchange in late 2008.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the graduation's thesis is to {{demonstrate}} the use of Plateia software for design of roads and road intersections. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical parts. The theoretical part briefly describes the history and the main influences {{on the development of}} road transport. Further is made a general description of the technical and geometrical elements of roads with the description of level road intersections, roundabouts, <b>multilevel</b> road <b>junctions</b> and bus bays. The next chapter presents a brief history of computer-aided design and CAD software, with descriptions of AutoCAD software, AutoCAD Civil 3 D software and, in details, PLATEIA software. In the practical part I have chosen three different locations in the Šentjernej county, to demonstrate the use and functionalities of Plateia software. I designed a concept of segment deviation of regional road, roundabout and cross section with a left-turn only lane, including bus bays. Used software commands and functionalities are described in detail, from the insertion of geodetic data in the drawing up to the design of road axis elements in horizontal alignment, longitudinal sections and cross sections...|$|R
