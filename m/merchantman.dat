5|$|After the {{beginning}} of World War I in August, the ship captured a German <b>merchantman</b> the following month. Essex {{spent most of the}} first half of the war in the Atlantic Ocean, escorting convoys and searching for German commerce raiders. The ship captured another German <b>merchantman</b> in mid-1916 and was reduced to second-line roles such as depot ship and accommodation ship a few months later. She was paid off in 1919 and sold for scrap two years later.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August, Clarisse {{departed}} Isle de France {{for another}} cruise; she sailed to La Réunion carrying despatches of Malartic to the governor. She then cruised to Java to procure water, where she arrived on 27 September. On 1 October, Surcouf captured a Danish <b>merchantman,</b> which he sent away under Lieutenant Fonroc; on 4 November, the Portuguese <b>merchantman</b> Nostra Signora de la Conception carrying 116 000 piastres; on 6, a British ship laden with a salt cargo; and on 11 November, the 20-gun Auspicious, with a cargo worth 1,032,580 francs.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{six months}} brought no new {{encounters}} with U-boats. She scouted areas where submarines {{had been reported}} but neither sighted nor engaged the enemy. On one occasion, she collided with a <b>merchantman,</b> , and had to enter the drydock at Spencer Jetty that same day, 24 November 1917, for repairs.|$|E
60|$|The {{attack was}} {{completely}} successful. Two of the fire-ships grappled with the men-of-war and burnt them, while three great <b>merchantmen</b> {{were destroyed by}} the others. Then the boats dashed into the fleet, and, {{with the exception of}} four or five <b>merchantmen</b> and four privateers, who took refuge in a creek, defended by a battery, the whole of the hundred and seventy <b>merchantmen,</b> the smallest of which was not less than 200 tons burden, and all heavily laden, were burned.|$|R
50|$|Many under direct navy {{control as}} armed <b>merchantmen.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The U-boat {{took part}} in five patrols, which {{included}} attacks on shipping in which she sank twenty <b>merchantmen,</b> damaged another three <b>merchantmen,</b> and damaged the American destroyer [...] An attack on the oil refinery {{on the island of}} Aruba was also attempted, but abandoned when her naval gun exploded.|$|R
5|$|The {{first officer}} of Confiance, Joachim Drieux, was sent on Kent with a 60-man prize crew, while her {{passengers}} were released on a <b>merchantman</b> that Surcouf stopped {{a few days}} later. Confiance and Kent arrived at the Rade des Pavillons in Port-Louis in November. The capture of Kent became a sensation, and the British Admiralty promised a reward for the capture of Surcouf.|$|E
5|$|U-47 {{left the}} port of Wilhelmshaven and began her fourth patrol on 11 March 1940. For 19 days, she roamed the North Sea in search of any Allied convoys. However, she only managed to torpedo the Danish steam <b>merchantman</b> Britta north of Scotland on 25 March. Following the sinking of Britta, U-47 {{returned}} to Wilhelmshaven on 29 March.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to Ile de France, Confiance was armed as a <b>merchantman</b> en aventurier with an 89-man crew and loaded with colonial goods for {{her return to}} France. On the journey, Surcouf still managed to capture a number of ships, notably the Portuguese Ebre, with {{eighteen}} 12-pounder carronades and a 60-man crew; he released her against a ransom of 10,000 piastres and after exchanging her greatmast with that of Confiance.|$|E
50|$|German <b>merchantmen</b> were {{encouraged}} to settle in Polish territories.|$|R

5|$|George VI was now too ill for travel, and the Royal Tour was indefinitely {{postponed}} {{later that}} month. Vanguard became the flagship of Admiral Sir Arthur Power, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, on 1 March 1949, {{and the ship}} made port visits to Algeria, France, Italy, Cyprus, Libya, Lebanon, Greece and Egypt before she arrived back at Devonport on 21 July. The newly promoted Rear Admiral Parham was relieved by Captain G. V. Gladstone a week later. The ship then became the flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron under Rear Admiral Edward Evans-Lombe on 12 November. While returning from a brief training sortie to Gibraltar, Vanguard went {{to the aid of}} a small French <b>merchantman</b> whose cargo had shifted in a severe storm on 13 February 1950. The <b>merchantman,</b> , was taken under tow and the cargo was redistributed. Once the storm had abated, Boffa was able to resume her voyage under her own power. Vanguard reached Weymouth Bay the following day. Later, in March, she fired the salute to Vincent Auriol, the President of France, during his state visit to Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|HMS Vigilant was a <b>merchantman</b> {{converted}} into a warship during the American Revolution. After serving as a transport in North American waters from 1775, she was purchased by the Royal Navy (RN) and modified for shore bombardment duties in 1777. She {{was instrumental in the}} eventual British success during the siege of Fort Mifflin that same year and supported British operations in Georgia and South Carolina in 1779–80. Her heavy armament proved to be more than Vigilant was designed to handle and she was condemned and disposed of in 1780.|$|E
5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney {{was so close to}} an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, the idea that he was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or {{that he was trying to}} clearly identify the <b>merchantman.</b>|$|E
2500|$|St. Croix sank the [...] on 24 July 1942, which, {{with other}} U-boats, had {{attacked}} her convoy (ON 113) on 23 July, sinking two <b>merchantmen</b> and damaging a third. On the return voyage, Convoy ON 127 {{was attacked by}} 13 U-boats. Between 10 September and 14 September eleven <b>merchantmen</b> and one destroyer were lost.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Pulo Aura is {{featured}} in Patrick O'Brian's novel HMS Surprise, with French Admiral Linois {{in pursuit of}} a large fleet of East Indiamen. In the novel, HMS Surprise under Captain Aubrey organizes the <b>merchantmen</b> to defeat Linois and his squadron. In history, all the ships that defeated the French squadron were <b>merchantmen.</b>|$|R

5|$|President James Monroe and Congress invited Lafayette {{to visit}} the United States in 1824, in part to {{celebrate}} the nation's upcoming 50thanniversary. Monroe intended to have Lafayette travel on an American warship, but the general felt having such a vessel as transport was undemocratic, and booked passage on a <b>merchantman.</b> LouisXVIII did not approve of the trip, and his officers had troops disperse the crowd that gathered at Le Havre to see Lafayette off.|$|E
5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a <b>merchantman</b> docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E
5|$|Adams joined Franklin and Arthur Lee in 1778 as a {{commissioner}} to France, replacing Silas Deane. He sailed for France {{with his}} 10-year-old son John Quincy aboard the frigate Boston early that year. The stormy trip was treacherous, with lightning injuring 19 sailors and killing one. Adams' ship was later pursued by several British frigates in the mid-Atlantic, but evaded them. Near {{the coast of}} Spain, Adams himself took up arms to help capture a heavily armed British <b>merchantman</b> ship, the Martha. Later, a cannon malfunction killed one and injured five more of the crew before the ship arrived in France.|$|E

50|$|Warren sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 February 1827 to stop Greek-flag pirates from victimizing American <b>merchantmen.</b> Unsettled {{conditions}} in the Near East and the Greek fight for independence had resulted in some excesses against third parties, notably American flag <b>merchantmen.</b> The piracy caused the American Mediterranean Squadron to establish a regular convoy system from Malta to Smyrna.|$|R

[...] Then he called out across the water, [...] "I'll come aboard with my schooner as soon as I can push her off here." ...|$|R
5|$|Gallant {{was laid}} down by Alexander Stephen and Sons in Glasgow, Scotland on 15 September 1934, {{launched}} on 26 September 1935 and completed on 25 February 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £252,920. She {{was assigned to the}} 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. Gallant patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee. She pulled off a Spanish <b>merchantman</b> that had grounded between Almeria and Málaga on 20 December 1936. The ship was attacked by a Spanish Nationalist aircraft off Cape San Antonio on 6 April 1937, but was not damaged. The next month she returned to Great Britain for an overhaul at Sheerness between 31 May and 21 July 1937.|$|E
5|$|In the {{engagement}} on 4 August 1800 neither side {{had a single}} man killed or wounded; the action still inflicted a severe naval defeat on a powerful French frigate force, ending its successful raiding career. Although Captain Jurien in Franchise spent another three weeks off the Brazilian coast before returning to France. On 9 August he encountered the <b>merchantman</b> Wellesley, which {{was on her way}} to the Cape, but after an engagement of about an hour, the British ship succeeded in driving off her attacker. Jurien followed Wellesley for two days but then gave up the chase; he then did not see another sail until he left the area.|$|E
5|$|Mediterranean {{trade was}} busy, and Levant {{took part in}} halting and {{examining}} vessels with crews of various nationalities including Dutch, Genoese, Spanish, and the British Caribbean. Neutral shipping was permitted to continue on its way. However Levant detained a South Carolina <b>merchantman</b> named Dolphin in October 1776, on suspicion of being a supply vessel for the rebels, and sent her into Gibraltar along with her cargo of rice. In November 1776 Levant secured a substantial prize with the capture of another South Carolina vessel, Argo, carrying rice and indigo worth £37,200. Argo was to have exchanged her cargo in Bordeaux for clothing and medicine to supply the American rebellion.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1800, Clarisse {{captured}} a large rice-laden <b>merchantman,</b> the British James. On 3 January, she detected two American 16-carronade ships forming {{a line of}} battle; although Clarisse lacked the eight guns sacrificed to escape Sybille and 60 of her men detached on her various prizes, Surcouf engaged. Clarisse raked the rear-most ship, the Louisa, and boarded her, while simultaneously firing a broadside on the other ship, Mercury, which attempted to rescue her mate. Nicolas Surcouf led a 30-man boarding party to seize Louisa, while Mercury escaped. Clarisse could not give chase, her bowsprit having been destroyed in the collision with Louisa. Nicolas Surcouf took a prize crew and sailed Louisa back to Port Louis.|$|E
5|$|Surcouf {{started his}} career as a sailor and officer on the slave ships Aurore, Courrier d'Afrique and Navigateur. Having risen to captain, and in spite of the {{prohibition}} of slave trading by the National Convention in 1793, he engaged in the business himself as a captain on Créole. He then captained the <b>merchantman</b> Émilie, on which he engaged in commerce raiding despite lacking a letter of marque. He preyed on British shipping, capturing the East Indiaman Triton, before returning to Île de France in the Indian Ocean, where his prizes were confiscated. He then returned to France, where he obtained prize money from the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{eighth and}} last war patrol that U-30 was to {{undertake}} began on 5 August 1940, {{when she left}} Lorient for the North Atlantic. In 26 days, she travelled north of the British Isles, into the North Sea and entered the German port city of Kiel on 30 August 1940. During that time, she sank the Swedish vessel Canton on 9 August and the British steam <b>merchantman</b> Clan Macphee on 16 August 1940. Both of these attacks took place off {{the west coast of}} neutral Ireland. After these successes, however, U-30 once again experienced engine trouble and was forced to end her patrol early, returning to Germany. Before she arrived, Lemp received word that he had been awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for the boat's previous war patrols.|$|E
