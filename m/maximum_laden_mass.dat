40|$|Statistics {{confirm that}} there is a need to study the safety of vans with a {{permissible}} <b>maximum</b> <b>laden</b> <b>mass</b> between 2000 and 3500 kg. as well as develop strategies for improvement. The number of fatalities in accidents involving vans has been constant during the last 10 years, not following the diminishing tendency shown by the general accidents. Not only efficient, but also safer road freight transport is required. This report analyses the security of the light commercial vehicles across the study of the influence from load distribution and the effectiveness of ESC (Electronic Stability Control). Through the medium of simulations made with Pc-Crash software, it has been analysed if the implementation of ESC in vans can at some extent compensate the influence of inaccurate load distributions. Furthermore, due to van’s relatively high centre of gravity and its load, vans may have less avoidance properties than a passenger car. Also (in addition) the differences of braking and dynamic properties between passenger cars and light commercial vehicles have been studied. Neither through literature review nor through own tests, the widespread opinion that van...|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the focus}} of the European Commission has rather been on lorries than on private cars, as lorries are {{concerned}} directly by the internal market. But {{it was only in the}} end of the last century, that the legal basis for road tolling was established in Directive 1999/62/EC ("Eurovignette") on European Community level. This Directive had the focus on the tolling of motorways, bridges, tunnels and mountain passes, but only for lorries over 12 tonnes <b>maximum</b> <b>laden</b> weight, and the charging was only possible for infrastructure costs. Eight years later in 2006, the Directive was amended by Directive 2006/38/EC, which has a new focus on road tolling of the trans-European road network, but leaves the EU Member States the right to apply tolls as well on roads not included in the trans-European road network. The amended Directive gives the EU Member States the possibility of varying tolls according to a number of factors such as distance travelled, place, infrastructure type and speed, vehicle characteristics, time of day and congestion level. In addition, the EU Member States are obliged to include all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes <b>maximum</b> <b>laden</b> weight after 2012, and after 2010, the tolls must be differentiated according to the environmental performance of the vehicle.Recently, the European Commission proposed a new, second amendment to the Directive 1999/62/EC, enableling EU Member States to integrate the cost of air and noise pollution caused by traffic in tolls levied on heavy goods vehicles and allowing tolls to be calculated on the basis of the cost of congestion imposed upon other vehicles during peak periods.Map: charging of heavy goods vehicles in the EU ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} aerosol filtration in turbofan engines. The current problem of very fine aerosol admission is the impossibility for mechanical filtration; {{another aspect of the}} problem is the high mass flow of air to be filtered. Non-attended, the aerosol admission can -and usually does- lead to clogging of turbine cooling passages and can damage the engine completely. The approach is theoretical and relies on the principles of electrostatic dust collectors known in other industries. An estimative equation is deduced in order to quantify the electrical charge required to obtain the desired filtration. Although the device still needs more theoretical and experimental work, it could one day be used as a means of increasing the safety of airplanes passing trough an aerosol <b>laden</b> <b>mass</b> of air...|$|R
5000|$|The Denby Eco-Link, {{dubbed the}} super lorry by the {{mainstream}} media, is a commercial vehicle designed and built by Denby Transport of the United Kingdom. The Eco-Link is a 60 tonne fully laden, 25.25m long, 8 axle B-Train (or B-Double) type of semi-trailer truck, in which a tractor unit pulls two semi-trailers, using fifth wheel couplings on both trailers. As one prototype of the UK Longer Heavier Vehicle (LHV) vehicle definition, which are longer and heavier than normal Large Goods Vehicles (LGVs, British English: lorries), it is not currently permitted {{to be used in}} the UK.

50|$|CLEVER {{features}} a two-seat tandem layout, a single front wheel, tilting cabin, and a two-wheeled rear engine module. The total vehicle mass is approximately 332 kg (excluding driver and bodywork); with a 75 kg driver the static weight distribution is 39% front and 61% rear. The rear module does not tilt and accounts for approximately 40% of the <b>laden</b> vehicle <b>mass</b> meaning only 60% can be tilted {{to balance the}} vehicle whilst cornering. CLEVER’s wheelbase is 2.4m, as long as many conventional city cars, {{but there are no}} overhangs so total length is under 3m. The track width is just 0.84m giving a total vehicle width of 1.00m.|$|R
5000|$|Theological {{books in}} the eighteenth century were heavy, expensive, and dull, and preachers {{remained}} in one parish and did not travel.

[...] Wesley supported himself through his publishing empire and bade his U.S. followers to use his press as well. Itinerant Methodists such as Rogers' husband would have carried books with them to sell, supplementing their meagre stipends. [...] Since every minister was also a subscription agent, the fact that Minister George Whitfield was listed as the book’s agent was customary of Wesley’s system.|$|R
50|$|Also the Road Traffic Act 1930 had happened. As well as causing {{consolidation}} between operators, for {{the first}} time <b>maximum</b> dimensions and <b>laden</b> weight were standard for buses and commercial vehicles across Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Maximum width was now 7 feet 6 inches, and for a two-axle double deck the UK maximum length was 26 ft, with a gross vehicle weight of 10 tons, the new length was about a foot more than the Titan was originally designed for. As a result, the engine was increased in bore, the rear-axle was revised to the fully floating pattern and the brakes revised to a triple-servo system. larger tyres were also fitted.|$|R

Globalization and the {{advances}} of technology and infonnation have also brought a huge influence in {{almost every aspect of}} human life, including socio-cultural dimension and socio-political. Thus, the roles of mass media as the main agent in the transaction of infonnation become significant. The mass media are expected to represent themselves as a major of public sphere, then also helped to detennine the dynamics of social, political and culture at the local and global stage. Among the plurality of Indonesian society, the treat of SARA (Suku: tribe/ethnic; Agama: religionlfaith; Ras: racelblood; Antargo/ ongan: inter-group) conflict is crucial and important to be noticed. Since conflict is the most interesting news value, the news coverage of mass media then holds an absolute power in shaping public opinion. Not only loved by the media alone, the audience was considered to be very enthusiastic readers for news of conflict as well. Conflicts using violence in all its fonns are always interesting. Especially when conflict is associated with politically <b>laden</b> of <b>mass</b> media industry that has lots of interests and problems in it.

In a news text of conflict, the problem of completeness and accuracy, relevance of a fact are to be of great importance for the quality of news. The role of mass media in conflict situations such as this becomes very important. Of the three roles of mass media in reposting the case of conflict, only two roles are taken. First, as the issue intensifier/sharpen conflicts (Republika's case in SARA conflict in Ambon) and as the conflict diminisherlhider conflicts (Kompas and Suara Republika's case in SARA conflict in Ambon).

40|$|High-resolution in situ CO_ 2 {{measurements}} were conducted aboard the NASA DC- 8 aircraft during the ARCTAS/POLARCAT field campaign, {{a component of}} the wider 2007 – 2008 International Polar Year activities. Data were recorded during large-scale surveys spanning the North American sub‐Arctic to the North Pole from 0. 04 to 12 km altitude in spring and summer of 2008. Influences on the observed CO_ 2 concentrations were investigated using coincident CO, black carbon, CH_ 3 CN, HCN, O_ 3, C_ 2 Cl_ 4, and Δ^(14) CO_ 2 data, and the FLEXPART model. In spring, the CO_ 2 spatial distribution from 55 °N to 90 °N was largely determined by the long-range transport of air <b>masses</b> <b>laden</b> with Asian anthropogenic pollution intermingled with Eurasian fire emissions evidenced by the greater variability in the mid-to-upper troposphere. At the receptor site, the enhancement ratios of CO_ 2 to CO in pollution plumes ranged from 27 to 80 ppmv ppmv^(− 1) with the highest anthropogenic content registered in plumes sampled poleward of 80 °N. In summer, the CO_ 2 signal largely reflected emissions from lightning-ignited wildfires within the boreal forests of northern Saskatchewan juxtaposed with uptake by the terrestrial biosphere. Measurements within fresh fire plumes yielded CO_ 2 to CO emission ratios of 4 to 16 ppmv ppmv^(− 1) and a mean CO_ 2 emission factor of 1698 ± 280 g kg^(− 1) dry matter. From the ^(14) C in CO_ 2 content of 48 whole air samples, mean spring (46. 6 ± 4. 4 ‰) and summer (51. 5 ± 5 ‰) Δ^(14) CO_ 2 values indicate a 5 ‰ seasonal difference.

40|$|International audienceWe analyze MOZAIC ozone {{observations}} recorded over Equatorial Africa, from April 1997 to March 2003 to {{give the}} first ozone climatology of this region. The monthly mean vertical profiles have been systematically analyzed with monthly mean ECMWF data using a Lagrangian-model (LAGRANTO). We assess the roles played by the dynamical features of Equatorial Africa and the intense biomass burning sources within the region in defining the ozone distribution. The lower troposphere exhibits layers of enhanced ozone during the biomass burning season in each hemisphere (boreal winter in the northern tropics and boreal summer in the southern tropics). The monthly mean vertical profiles of ozone are clearly influenced by the local dynamical situation. Over the Gulf of Guinea during boreal winter, the ozone profile is characterized by systematically high ozone below 650 hPa. This {{is due to the}} high stability caused by the Harmattan winds in the lower troposphere and the blocking Saharan anticyclone in the middle troposphere that prevents any efficient vertical mixing. In contrast, Central African enhancements are not only found in the lower troposphere but throughout the troposphere. The boreal summer ozone maximum in the lower troposphere of Central Africa continues up to November in the middle troposphere due to the influx of air <b>masses</b> <b>laden</b> with biomass burning products from Brazil and Southern Africa. Despite its southern latitude, Central Africa during the boreal winter is also {{under the influence of the}} northern tropical fires. This phenomenon is known as the "ozone paradox". However, the tropospheric ozone columns calculated from the MOZAIC data give evidence that the Tropical Tropospheric Ozone Column (TTOC) maximum over Africa swings from West Africa in DJF to Central Africa in JJA. This contrasts with studies based on TOMS satellite data. A rough assessment of the regional ozone budget shows that the northern tropics fires in boreal winter might contribute up to 20 % of the global photochemical ozone production. This study gives the first detailed picture of the ozone distribution over Equatorial Africa that should be used to validate both global models over this region and future satellite products...|$|R
