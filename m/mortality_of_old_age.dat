Since the mortality of modern developed population is largely the <b>mortality</b> <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>age,</b> the Gompertz model provides a good approximation of life tables in these populations and can be used to estimate and forecast many parameters of the life table and the stationary population, such as expectation of life, modal age, age dependency ratios, and indices of the rectangularization of life tables.

40|$|First, {{this paper}} investigates the {{properties}} of the Gompertz distribution and the relationships of their constants. Then the use of Gompertz´s law to describe mortality is discussed with male and female period life table data of the United States between 1900 and 2000. For this purpose a model incorporating time trends has been formulated with age, time and the product of age and time as independent variables and the force of mortality as the dependent variable. The parameters of the model are estimated using the least squares method. Since the mortality of modern developed population is largely the <b>mortality</b> <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> this generalized Gompertz model provides a good approximation of life tables in these populations, and can be used to estimate and forecast many parameters of the life table and the stationary population like expectation of life, modal age, Keyfitz´entropy or old age dependency ratios. These and other parameters are forecast up to the year 2100 and compared with recent mortality forecasts of the Social Security Administration. While similar results for the male population can be observed, a greater difference between male and female mortality are forecast. Although the time dependent Gompertz model reveals systematic underestimation of mortality at young ages and overestimation at the oldest ages it is a very useful, an easy, and a quick tool for obtaining forecasts of important parameters of life tables with low mortality...|$|E

Occupational mobility was commonplace among the veterans in the postbellum period, with 54 % of them changing occupations {{from the time of}} enlistment to 1900. Among veterans who were farmers at enlistment, 46 % of them changed to a non-farming occupation by the time of 1900.

Recent research suggests that past reductions in early life exposure to infectious diseases have been a major contributor to the historical decline in old-age mortality. Drawing on French-Canadian data from cohorts born in the 17 th and 18 th centuries, we test whether a progressive deterioration in early life conditions (as revealed by an increasing infant mortality rate) translates into a decrease in survival prospects in late life. We use traditional demographic measures such as the age-specific probability of death, and a series of proportional hazard models to control for familial and environmental conditions.

40|$|In {{the most}} {{advanced}} countries, child mortality and adult mortality under age 65 years have fallen so low that further improvement in life expectancy relies almost completely on the decline <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> at <b>older</b> <b>ages.</b> This phenomenon is particularly pronounced among women, who are far ahead of men in survival rates.

40|$|This note has {{two related}} themes. One is the {{estimation}} from grouped data <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> at <b>older</b> <b>ages</b> {{and the second}} is the possible decelaration <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> due to heterogeneity. The first is treated by what is called the half logit transform, previously introduced by other authors but without that name. Under fairly general conditions asymptotic normality is established. Throughout it is assumed that data are available in the form published by official statistical agencies, that is, grouped data in discrete time. It is found that the cumulative hazard function is more convenient for the study of decelaration. A statement {{of the problem is that}} if in a heterogeneous population each individual follows a Gompertz law <b>of</b> <b>mortality,</b> nonetheless population mortality may show deceleration, and one seeks conditions for this to occur. The problem remains open but in the case of three groups we arrive at the surprising result that heterogeneity may be such that it is possible for a population to show decelerating mortality and then return to a Gompertz-like increase at a later age. This implies that under certain conditions there is at least one age interval in which the hazard function decreases before increasing again...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we first studied {{the start of}} the {{epidemiologic}} transition in rural Ghana and describe the changes in mortality. This is followed by studies on the compression <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> and morbidity during the transition in Japan and the Netherlands. Finally, we examined the plasticity <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> at <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Studying old-age mortality during the epidemiologic transition is of great importance now that an increasing number of people reach old-age. The main findings from this thesis are that overall, when countries shift from a pre- to a post-transitional stage, mortality decreases and an increasing number of people live up to <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> In addition, mortality is compressed to a narrower age interval in which most of the annual deaths occur. This compression <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> reaches a limit as soon as countries enter the post-transitional era. Furthermore, during the last stage of the epidemiologic transition we have observed that life expectancy without disability is increasing parallel to the increase in life expectancy, indicating a compression of disability.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—To {{quantify}} {{the contribution of}} different causes of death and age groups for trends in life expectancy for two major social classes.  DESIGN AND SETTING—Prospective study <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> in Finland among all over 35  year old men and women. Baseline social class (manual/non-manual) was from the 1970,  1975,  1980,  1985  and 1990  census records, and follow up was by computerised record linkage to death certificates for 1971 - 1995.  MAIN RESULTS—From the early 1970 s to the early 1990 s life expectancy at age 35  increased by about five and four years among Finnish men and women respectively, with largest gains among 55 - 74 year old men and 65 - 84 year old women. Life expectancy increase was 5. 1  years among non-manual and 3. 8  years among manual men; corresponding figures for women were 3. 6  and 3. 0  years. In the 1980 s, when differences in life expectancy increased most rapidly, decline in cardiovascular disease mortality was more rapid in the non-manual than the manual class. Furthermore, increasing mortality for alcohol associated causes, "other diseases", and accidents and violence were most prominent in the manual class.  CONCLUSIONS—Explanations of increasing social inequalities in mortality {{that are based on}} one underlying factor are difficult to reconcile with the variability in the cause specific trends in social inequalities in <b>mortality.</b> The contribution <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>ages</b> to social inequalities in mortality should be more widely recognised.    Keywords: life expectancy; social clas...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the <b>mortality</b> rate, causes <b>of</b> death, and standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and to identify the significant predictive factors <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> in diabetic patients at a medical center in Taiwan. Clinical data were obtained from 1792 diabetic inpatients discharged from the metabolism department of a medical center during the years 1996 - 2002. Underlying causes of death were determined from death certificates. Predictors <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> were assessed by uni- and multivariate Cox survival analyses. Of 1792 patients studied, 410 (22. 9 %) patients died. The crude mortality rate was 93. 2 / 1000 person-years, and the overall SMR was 2. 98 (2. 71 - 3. 28). The percentages of causes of death ascribed to diabetes, cancer, cardiopulmonary disease, infection, stroke, digestive diseases, nephropathy, accidents, suicide, and disease of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries were 38. 0, 13. 2, 9. 5, 7. 8, 7. 6, 6. 8, 5. 1, 2. 0, 0. 5, and 0. 2 %, respectively. The independent predictors <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> were age greater than 65, duration of hypertension more than 5 years, 24 h proteinuria greater than 0. 3 g, and estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min.

When stratified by age, the number and duration of hospitalizations were distributed in J-shape distribution, with the nadir located in the range of 8 – 18 years of age. The severity of asthma was found to increase with age (p <  0. 001) and was more severe in men compared with women (p <  0. 001). The severity of in-hospital patients was significantly greater in subjects with underlying respiratory disease compared to patients with other comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and infectious disease. The <b>mortality</b> rates <b>of</b> all hospitalized asthma patients and pediatric hospitalized asthma patients were 0. 77 % and 0. 02 %, respectively.

Objective : This study aims to gather direct estimates <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> at <b>older</b> <b>ages</b> in two Latin American countries (Mexico and Costa Rica) using recent longitudinal surveys and to determine the socioeconomic status (SES) gradients for LE 60. Methods : Data were collected from independent panels of approximately 7, 000 older adults followed over {{more than a decade}} ‒ the MHAS and CRELES surveys. The age-specific death rates were modeled with Gompertz regression, and thousands of life tables were simulated to estimate LE 60 and its confidence interval. Results : LE 60 estimates obtained from MHAS and CRELES are similar to those obtained from traditional statistics, confirming the exceptionally high LE 60 of men in the two countries. The expected gradients of higher LE 60 with higher SES are not present, especially among males, who even show reverse gradients (some exaggerated by data issues). Conclusions : Vital statistics correctly estimate elderly mortality in Mexico and Costa Rica. The higher-than-expected LE 60 among Latin American males in general, and particularly among low-SES individuals, seems to be real; their determinants should be thoroughly investigated.

40|$|Temporal {{discounting}} is {{an important}} determinant of many health and financial outcomes, {{but we are not}} aware of studies that have examined the association of temporal discounting with mortality. Participants were 406 older persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal cohort study of aging. Temporal discounting was measured using standard preference elicitation questions. Individual discount rates were estimated using a well-established hyperbolic function and used to predict the risk <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> during up to 5 years of follow-up. The mean estimate of discounting was 0. 45 (SD =  0. 33, range: 0. 08 - 0. 90), with higher scores indicating a greater propensity to prefer smaller immediate rewards over larger but delayed ones. During up to 5 years of follow-up (mean =  3. 6 years), 62 (15 % of 406) persons died. In a proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and education, temporal discounting was associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> (HR =  1. 103, 95 % CI 1. 024, 1. 190, p =  0. 010). Thus, a person with the highest discount rate (score =  0. 90) was about twice more likely to die over the study period compared to a person with the lowest discount rate (score =  0. 08).

40|$|Abstract Background Mortality {{rates for}} older persons in Botswana have been {{unavailable}} and {{little is known}} <b>of</b> predictors <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> in <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> This study {{may serve as a}} precursor for more detailed assessments. The objective was to assess diminished function and lack of social support as indicators of short term risk of death. Methods A national population based prospective survey was undertaken in Botswana; twelve rural areas and three urban centers were included. 372 community-dwelling persons aged sixty years and over, were included; 265 were followed-up. Sixteen subjects were deceased at follow-up. Subjects were interviewed and clinically assessed at home. Measures of cognitive function, depression and physical function and sociodemographic information were collected. Subjects were followed-up at average 6. 8 months after baseline. Results Overall mortality rate was 10. 9 per 100 person years. Age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) for death during follow-up were; 4. 2 (CI 1. 4 – 12. 5) and 3. 6 (CI 1. 0 – 12. 7) for those with diminished physical- and cognitive function, respectively. Indicators of limited social support; household with only 1 or 2 persons and eating alone, yielded age adjusted ORs of 4. 3 (CI 1. 5 – 12. 5) and 6. 7 (CI 2. 2 – 20), respectively, for death during follow-up. Conclusion Older community dwelling persons with diminished cognitive- or physical function, solitary daily meals and living in a small household have a significantly increased risk of rapid deterioration and death. Health policy should include measures to strengthen informal support and expand formal service provisions to older persons with poor function and limited social networks in order to prevent premature deaths. </p...|$|R

Aim {{of our study}} was to evaluate the contemporary epidemiological trends, over a 17 -year period in a definite region of Tuscany, Italy, to analyze the clinical outcomes and associated prognostic factors. Methods: From 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2014, all patients with a definite diagnosis of IE were prospectively entered in a data-base. The Health-Care system data-base was interrogated to capture patients {{who could have been}} missed. The final dataset derived by the merging of the two data-bases. Results: Incidence rate of IE was 4. 6 / 100, 000 /y with a significant linear incidence increase. In hospitalized patients the incidence was 1. 27 / 1, 000 admissions. Over age 65 incidence rate was 11. 7 / 100, 000 /y. Male/female ratio was 1. 54 : 1. A temporal trend towards an increase in the mean population age was found (P= 0. 033). There was an increase in the incidence of Health-care associated IE, P= 0. 016. The most common microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus (25 %) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (22 %). In-hospital mortality was 24 %. A trend towards an increase in mortality rate was found (P= 0. 055). Independent predictors <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> were <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> S. aureus infection, heart failure, septic shock and persistent bacteremia. Conclusions: Our study confirms an increasing mortality trend in IE, although with a borderline significance.

Ageing population, increase in healthcare-associated and staphylococcal infections, may explain the rise of IE incidence and <b>of</b> the <b>mortality</b> trend...|$|R
40|$|Traditional Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is {{a common}} dietary pattern characterizing a {{lifestyle}} and culture proven to contribute to better health {{and quality of life}} in Mediterranean countries. By analyzing the diet of centenarians from the Sicani Mountains and eating habits of inhabitants of Palermo, it is reported that a close adherence to MedDiet is observed in the countryside, whereas in big towns this adherence is not so close. This has an effect on the rates <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> at <b>old</b> <b>age</b> (and reciprocally longevity) that are lower in the countryside than in big towns. Concerning the health effects of the diet, the low content of animal protein and the low glycaemic index of the Sicilian MedDiet might directly modulate the insulin/IGF- 1 and the mTOR pathways, known to be involved in ageing and longevity. In particular, the reduction of animal protein intake may significantly reduce serum IGF- 1 concentrations and inhibit mTOR activity with a down-regulation of the signal that leads to the activation of FOXO 3 A and, consequently, to the transcription of homeostatic genes that favour longevity. The down-regulation of both IGF- 1 and mTORC 1 also induces an anti-inflammatory effect. In addition to the effects on sensing pathways, many single components of MedDiet are known to have positive effects on health, reducing inflammation, optimizing cholesterol and other important risk factors of age-related diseases. However, a key role is played by polyphenols represented in high amount in the Sicilian MedDiet (in particular in extra virgin olive oil) that can work as hormetins that provide an environmental chemical signature regulating stress resistance pathways such as nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2...|$|R
40|$|The three essays which {{comprise}} this dissertation examine particular features <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> {{patterns in}} the United States since 1960, with special reference to differences by race and sex. The first essay investigates <b>mortality</b> by region <b>of</b> birth and migration status {{using data from the}} National Longitudinal Mortality Study. Contrary to previous studies based on vital statistics data, this research does not find excess mortality among southern-born blacks relative to blacks born elsewhere, but does find higher mortality among southern-born whites. Differences in sociodemographic characteristics between migrants and non-migrants are examined. Educational attainment appears {{to be the most important}} factor affecting mortality differentials between U. S. -born migrants and non-migrants. In contrast, foreign-born migrants maintain a substantial mortality advantage over natives despite having less education. ^ The second essay investigates the impact of the Medicare program on mortality at <b>older</b> <b>ages.</b> When Medicare was introduced on July 1, 1966 health care coverage among older adults increased from around 50 percent to over 95 percent. Many experts suggest that access to high-quality medical care through Medicare has helped older Americans live longer, healthier, and more independent lives. This study uses a relational model <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> at <b>older</b> <b>ages</b> to simulate conditions that might have prevailed if Medicare had not been introduced. The results suggest that for females, but not for males, a substantial portion of the increase in longevity at <b>older</b> <b>ages</b> since 1966 may be associated with enrollment in Medicare. ^ The third study uses counterfactual population projections to examine the demographic consequences <b>of</b> cause-specific <b>mortality</b> change since 1960 by race and sex. Deaths between 1960 and 2000 are assigned to 28 exhaustive, mutually exclusive cause groups. Cumulative population gains or losses resulting from changes in mortality are derived by way of difference between race-sex-specific populations projected under observed mortality conditions and populations projected while holding mortality constant for each cause. The absolute and proportionate impact <b>of</b> cause-specific <b>mortality</b> change on the 2000 population is compared for whites and blacks by sex. ...|$|R

Thus, I develop a strategy consisting of two steps: (1) to identify an age above which data become inconsistent, and (2) to estimate adjusted age-specific mortality rates based on the crude death rate above that age, age-specific growth rates and a new relational model life table system. ^ Although I present evidence that inaccurate or incomplete data produce widespread underestimation <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> at <b>older</b> <b>ages,</b> the effect <b>of</b> these errors on life expectancy tends to be modest. Simulations of different measurement errors and/or assumptions show that our results are most sensitive to the crude death rate for the open-ended age interval, while the level of growth and the age pattern <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> play a minor role in determining the overall mortality level. ^ Latin American countries exhibit a distinct age pattern <b>of</b> adult <b>mortality</b> with very low values for the slope of the age-specific death rates when compared to those of more developed countries. Furthermore, such a pattern is determined at the young adult ages, casting serious doubts on the idea that it is simply an artifact of bad data. ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{about the}} half of Swiss women die after their 84 th birthday. This {{unprecedented}} {{proportion of the population}} reaching an <b>old</b> <b>age,</b> or even a very <b>old</b> <b>age</b> (25 % <b>of</b> women die after 89 years, and 5 % after 95 years) is a novel aspect of human demographics, and represents the very last stage of the epidemiological transition, a term coined to describe the transformation of the prevailing health burden in the population, shifting from infectious and communicable pathologies to chronic and degenerative diseases. In developed countries, this epidemiological transition has been well documented during the last century; worldwide, a similar transition is taking place, with some countries still at mid or early stages of transition. A striking aspect of the current transition is its speed. In India, the mean duration of life since 1947 has increased from 32 to 62 years. As a result, India, like many other developing countries, is facing a double burden of disease, i. e., an upsurge of degenerative diseases while the burden from the old agenda (i. e., malaria, tuberculosis) still reaches devastating proportions in the population. This double burden is certainly a crucial problem in developing countries, and probably is the most important health challenge for the coming century. A similar accelerated pace of change is observed with the decline <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> at <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Worldwide, the current estimate of centenarians is 100000, i. e., ten time more centenarians than the number estimated in 1960. The downward trend in mortality, which is steeper with increasing age, is now the leading factor to Increase the life expectancy in developed countries. In the United Kingdom, life expectancy increased by 2. 5 years between 1971 and 1991; this is equivalent to the increase observed between 1851 and 1961. This accelerated increase will influence public health in two different ways. The first will be the absolute increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>older</b> persons, with a corresponding increase in degenerative diseases. A second consequence will be the need for a substantial and rapid adaptation of the health care system. Three selected aspects are addressed below: 1) the increase of resources, 2) the improvement of performance, and 3) the reduction of demand through preventive strategies...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the study. To {{verify the}} impact of the {{etiology}} of mitral valve regurgitation on a 5 -year outcome after repair and concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods. One hundred and eleven consecutive patients (mean age of 69 +/- 8 years) who underwent mitral valve repair, 65 for ischemic and 46 for degenerative mitral regurgitation, and concomitant CABG, were retrospectively analyzed. The mean follow-up was 40 +/- 28 (9 - 104) months. Five-year survival (including operative mortality), and survival free from events (postoperative low output syndrome, progression of mitral regurgitation, onset or worsening of congestive heart failure, recurrence of myocardial infarction, and the need for mitral valve replacement) were analyzed. Results. Compared with degenerative, ischemic mitral regurgitation was associated with a higher incidence of previous myocardial infarction (P< 0. 0001), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 0. 45 (P< 0. 0001), and more diseased coronary vessels per patient (P< 0. 0001). Five-year all-cause mortality was 18 % (20 / 111). Independent predictors <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> were <b>older</b> <b>age</b> at operation (P= 0. 0008), LVEF< 0. 45 (P= 0. 04), and the ischemic etiology of mitral regurgitation (P= 0. 03). At five years, survival was 69 %+/- 7. 6 % for ischemic versus 87 %+/- 6. 5 % for degenerative etiology (P= 0. 03); event-free survival was 58 %+/- 8. 4 % versus 75 %+/- 8 % (P= 0. 02), and freedom from late cardiac death was 85 %+/- 6. 6 % versus 100 % (P= 0. 02). Freedom from mitral valve reoperation was 97 +/- 2. 4 %. Conclusions. Ischemic mitral regurgitation and ldquo;per se and rdquo; predicted limited survival and event-free survival. Left ventricular dysfunction is frequently associated with the ischemic etiology. An early surgical indication to prevent left ventricular dysfunction could be important to improve the mid-term outcome. [Arch Clin Exp Surg 2012; 1 (3. 000) : 129 - 137...|$|R
40|$|IMPORTANCE: Gait and {{cognition}} {{have been}} related to mortality in population-based studies. This association is possibly mediated by cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), which {{has been associated with}} mortality as well. It is unknown which factors can predict mortality in individuals with SVD. Identification of high-risk patients may provide insight into factors that reflect their vital health status. OBJECTIVES: To assess mortality in patients with cerebral SVD and identify potential clinical and/or imaging factors associated with mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective, single-center cohort study was conducted. The present investigation is embedded in the Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion Tensor and Magnetic Resonance Cohort (RUN DMC) study. Between January 17, 2006, and February 27, 2007, all participants underwent a cognitive and motor assessment and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including a diffusion tensor imaging sequence to assess microstructural integrity of the white matter. Participants were followed up until their death or November 24, 2014. Participants included 503 older adults with SVD noted on brain imaging. Data analysis was performed from November 26, 2014, to February 2, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Eight-year all-cause <b>mortality.</b> RESULTS: <b>Of</b> 503 participants (mean [SD] age, 65. 7 [8. 8] years; range, 50 - 85 years; 284 [56. 5 %] were male), 80 individuals (15. 9 %) died during a mean (SD) follow-up of 7. 8 (1. 5) years. In the final analysis, 494 (98. 2 %) were included, of whom 78 (15. 8 %) died. Gait speed, cognitive index, conventional MRI markers of SVD (white matter hyperintensity volume, brain volume, and lacunes), and diffusion measures of the white matter were associated with an 8 -year risk <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> independent <b>of</b> age, sex, and vascular risk factors. The prediction <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> was determined using Cox proportional hazards models with backward stepwise selection and including age, sex, vascular risk factors, gait speed, cognitive index, MRI, and diffusion measures. Results are reported as hazard ratios (HRs) (95 % CI). Older age (1. 05 per 1 -year increase [1. 01 - 1. 08]), lower gait speed (1. 15 per 0. 1 -m/s slower gait [1. 06 - 1. 24]), lower gray matter volume (0. 72 per 1 -SD increase [0. 55 - 0. 95]), and greater global mean diffusivity of the white matter (1. 51 per 1 -SD increase [1. 19 - 1. 92]) were identified as the main factors associated with mortality. Cognitive index and other conventional SVD markers were not retained in the prediction model. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Gait, cognition, and imaging markers of SVD are associated with 8 -year risk <b>of</b> <b>mortality.</b> In the prediction <b>of</b> <b>mortality,</b> an <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> lower gait speed, lower gray matter volume, and greater global mean diffusivity of white matter at baseline best predicted mortality in our population. Further research is needed to investigate the reproducibility of this prediction model and to elucidate the association between the factors identified and mortality...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 71 - 74). This study {{estimates the}} <b>mortality</b> <b>of</b> the South African <b>oldest</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> population (in five year age groups from age 75 {{up to the}} open age interval 100 and above) {{and in the process}} re-estimates the numbers of people in the population at these ages {{at the time of the}} 1996 and 2001 censuses, and the 2007 Community Survey. In countries where the data on the <b>old</b> <b>age</b> population have been verified, it has been observed that the data are marred by errors in the form of age exaggeration, age digit preference, relative under/over count of the population and under-registration of deaths. These errors have been observed to have the net effect <b>of</b> underestimating <b>mortality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oldest</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> groups. The current research applies the method of extinct generations to estimate indirectly the population numbers at the <b>oldest</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> groups (75 up to 100 and above) using data on reported deaths alone. Age heaping and year of birth preference in the reported deaths are assessed using ratios of the probability of death estimated from the data. Age exaggeration in the data on reported deaths is assessed using ratios of deaths compared with same ratios from a standard population. Age heaping and year of birth preference in the census/survey population is assessed using the modified Whipple's Index of age accuracy. The Generalized Growth Balance (GGB) and Synthetic Extinct Generations (SEG+delta) methods are applied to adjust for under reporting of deaths and to assess patterns of age exaggeration in the census/survey population. The difference between the estimates of the completeness of reporting of deaths from the two methods is small (less than 1 per cent) and has been observed to have little impact on the mortality estimates. Final estimates of the completeness of reporting of deaths used are those derived using the SEG+delta method. After re-estimating the population numbers and adjusting for completeness of reporting <b>of</b> deaths, <b>mortality</b> rates were then estimated. Results obtained from the method of extinct generations suggest that there is no systematic difference between the census/ survey population and the population numbers estimated from deaths except at ages 95 and above. Measures of age accuracy show that there are patterns of preferring 1910, 1914, 1918, 1920 and 1930 as the years of birth in the census/survey population and these patterns are also found in the registered deaths. The impact of these errors was investigated and the results show that preference of certain years of birth cause fluctuations in the mortality rates. Patterns observed after applying the SEG+delta method suggest that the completeness of reporting of deaths falls with age at the advanced ages (from age 90 and above) and as a result, the estimated mortality rates above this age are lower than those estimated from the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) and US Census Bureau (USCB) population projections, and Dorrington, Moultrie and Timaeus (2004). Conclusions reached are that the mortality rates for the age groups 75 to 89 derived after re-estimating the population numbers and after allowing for the fall in the completeness of reporting of deaths are lower but not significantly different from those inferred from the UNPD and USCB population projections, and estimates derived by Dorrington, Moultrie and Timaeus (2004). The research recommends mortality estimates from the UNPD since they are the closest to the estimates derived using the published census population numbers for the whole period between the nights of 9 - 10 October 1996 and 9 - 10 October 2001. However, the research produced better estimates <b>of</b> the <b>oldest</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> population numbers relative to the census/survey numbers...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the level and}} structure <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>age</b> population <b>mortality</b> in Yugoslavia with an aim to determine the intensity of realized changes and to provide an answer to how much they are significant and to approach the positive trends noted in developed countries in the latest period. Although it was insufficiently represented in the demographic analysis, the analysis <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> in <b>old</b> people is gaining importance in the world. Apart from the reasons which result from {{the increase in the}} number <b>of</b> <b>old</b> people and thus their greater participation in the total number of deceased, enviable results have been achieved in decreasing <b>old</b> <b>age</b> mortality, which are more and more in focus of interest. While earlier research reported on the dominant influence of the decrease <b>of</b> younger age <b>mortality</b> to the increase of the expectation of life at birth, recent analysis precisely confirm the importance <b>of</b> decreasing <b>mortality</b> in <b>old</b> people. In mortality conditions from 1997 / 98, an additional 13. 4 years of life in average is expected for men in Yugoslavia, and 15. 2 for women. During more than five decades, the anticipated life expectancy for people over the age of 65 increased for only 1. 2 years for men and 1. 9 years for women. Out of that, the greatest increase was realized in the period 1950 / 51 - 1960 / 61 in both sexes. A small decrease in the average life expectancy was marked with men in the period 1960 / 61 - 1970 / 71, and with women in the latest period. Otherwise, all up to the eighties, the annual rate of increase was considerably lower than the rate of increase for zero year. It was only in the period 1980 / 81 - 1990 / 91 that faster growth had an anticipated life expectancy for the 65 years old. However, during the nineties unfavorable changes continued with the older, especially, female population. When comparing the values of the average life expectancy for people over 65 in Yugoslavia with corresponding values in developed countries, the lagging in average amounted to about 3 years for the male and about 5 years for the female population. In Japan in 1998 it amounted to 17. 1 years, namely 22. 0 years respectively. However, it is interesting that all up to the seventies these indexes were almost at the same level in our country and Japan, and only after this period the differences appeared as a consequence of putting an end to the positive tendencies in differential mortality by age, even in the increase rate with the older population in Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the anticipated life expectancy for the age of 65 (for both sexes) was increased by 40 %, in Japan from 1970 to 1998, in contrast to an increase of 9 % for 0 age. In the same period in Yugoslavia, although there was a considerably lower increase percentage, it was still more significant with newborns (above 6 % for both sexes), than with population older than 65 (under 5 %). Hence, such an inclination and intensity of changes resulted, in relation to Japan, in a relatively greater lagging with people aged 65 than with 0 age. The anticipated life expectancy for people aged 85 and over, in the whole observed period, increased only by 8 % with the male population and 10 % with the female population of Yugoslavia. Its present level is the result of small changes in the <b>mortality</b> rates <b>of</b> the <b>oldest</b> population. In average, people aged 85 + will live another 4. 2, namely 4. 4 years respectively under the assumed mortality from 1997 / 98. At the same time the Japanese men are expected to live another 5. 4, and Japanese women another 7. 2 years. Therefore, middle <b>aged</b> and <b>old</b> population in Yugoslavia has had unfavorable mortality tendencies in relation to the young population, more distinct beginning from the seventies, and especially with men. The nineties were again unfavorable for the old population, this time especially for the female population, where a slight decrease of this rate was marked. Having in mind the changes and achieved level of anticipated life expectancy in developed countries, it can be said that the deviations in relation to the rates in our country are significant, relatively greater with the older population. For this reason, <b>mortality</b> reduction <b>of</b> the <b>old</b> <b>age</b> population is a chance for an increase in the life span, although all possibilities in our country, for the decrease <b>of</b> <b>mortality</b> with the young as well, especially newborns, have not been exploited. In that sense, it seems that the greatest importance would be control of cardiovascular illnesses and risk factors regarding individual behavior...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{makes an}} attempt at introducing paleodemography {{on a large scale}} in the Caribbean. Firstly the history of the discipline will be outlined, focusing on the development from historical demography to demography where physical anthropology is central to the analyses made. Attention will be paid to major advancements, pitfalls and solutions which have been developed through the years. Lastly the development of paleodemography in the Caribbean will be described, giving special attention to the work of the author and others. Secondly the methods and techniques associated with this study will be explained. The methodology uses the Bradford ageing categories which by the usage of categories rather than precise ages allows for a lower number of misclassifications. Using this system also facilitates for data from other investigations to be easily incorporated in this research. The usage of the life table will also be explained, where the different categories and calculations necessary to determine those categories will be introduced. Following this it will be determined which different populations have different population profiles. These different profiles, amongst others, are migratory, standard and catastrophic. The implications these profiles have for the interpretation of the sites will also be determined. The 15 sites which are central to this investigation are {{selected on the basis of}} their representation of the Pre-Columbian Ceramic period, the size of their cemeteries (since small population can cause statistical fluctuations) and/or their specific function. Lastly a new standard population for comparative purposes will be introduced which is based on ethnographic data from the Warao who nowadays inhibit the Orinoco Delta in South America. The next chapter introduces the 15 sites based on their geographic location, time period and the characteristics of their graveyards. Where possible the proportions within the graveyard assemblage between males and females, and Adults and Non-Adults will be reviewed. It will also be indicated how well preserved and complete the skeletons are, all of which can have influence on the conclusions which will be drawn later on. After the introduction of these sites the results are presented, indicating that three sites have a catastrophic demographic profile (El Chorro de Maita, Juan Dolio en Anse à la Gourde), three have a normal demographic profile (Maisabel, Kelbey’s Ridge en Pointe de Caille), one is a failed colonization attempt (Punta Candalero) and the other sites are characterized by incomplete analyses. The sites which have been incompletely analyzed appear to have a common pattern in which the <b>mortality</b> rates <b>of</b> the <b>older</b> <b>age</b> categories is higher than expected. An explanation for this pattern can however not be found. Form the 90 analyses it is apparent that the demography of the pre-Columbian Caribbean can be characterized as being very divers, without a general regional image. Furthermore it becomes clear that the standard population derived from the Warao is an alternative to the standard European models which works well in this context. The methodology worked and it is therefore possible to use this methodology in future researchers to allow for these researches to be placed in a broader context of demographic research...|$|R
