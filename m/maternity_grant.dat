Programs of the first category, income security guarantees, take some 80 percent of the funds expended for social welfare.|$|R

5000|$|A Green Paper {{published}} in June 1985 [...] proposed a new Social Fund {{to be administered}} by the Department for Health and Social Services (DHSS) on a discretionary basis to give more flexible help to those in need. The new policy was also prompted {{by the fact that}} in recent years there had been spiralling expenditure incurred by claims for single payments. The original policy in the Green Paper was to provide a budget-limited Fund to help in four areas of need: community care needs; budgeting expenses; maternity and funeral expenses; and expenses arising from financial crises. A White Paper followed in December 1985. The White Paper proposed a set Social Fund grant to meet maternity needs (replacing the pre-existing £25 <b>maternity</b> <b>grant</b> along with single payments provision for maternity needs). Similarly, there would be a set Social Fund grant to meet funeral needs (replacing the £30 death grant, and these payments would be contingent on three new 'income-related' benefits, i.e. Income Support, Family Credit or Housing Benefit. Social Fund grants for maternity and funeral needs would be based on clear, objective, criteria and payments would not be constrained by the budget; they would be paid automatically on satisfying the qualifying conditions. In addition, it proposed Social Fund loans to meet 'intermittent expenses'. These would be determined on a discretionary basis of what was reasonable in all the circumstances and the likelihood of recovery of the loan. It also proposed a loans scheme to cover financial crises, for example, where money/benefits had been lost or stolen, or where there was an urgent need for funds following flood or fire. As regards this form of loan the White Paper confirmed these would not be restricted to those receiving Income Support.|$|E
50|$|Women {{workers had}} a full {{complement}} of maternity and childcare benefits. Maternity leave (at 90% of full pay) was twenty-six weeks in the 1980s; an additional nine weeks were available for single mothers or for mothers having multiple births. Employers could not deny a woman's request for an additional year of unpaid leave for child rearing (without loss of job seniority). A system of child allowances and <b>maternity</b> <b>grants</b> also assisted women who took unpaid leave. Women were allowed three days of annual leave in case of illness within the family. There were substantial family allowances, in addition to direct grants, to single parents or families with handicapped children. An unmarried mother, widow, or divorced mother could not be fired if she had a child under three years of age; if she had children between three and fifteen years of age, her employer had to find her another job before dismissing her.|$|R

50|$|Cypriot {{women have}} long {{participated in the}} work force, {{traditionally}} in agriculture. From 1960 to 1985, the women's share of the urban work force rose from 22 percent to 41 percent, while {{their share of the}} rural work force fell from 51 percent to 44.4 percent. Cypriot women had the same rights to social welfare as men in such matters as social security payments, unemployment compensation, vacation time and other common social provisions. Special protective legislation in 1985 provided women with marriage <b>grants</b> and with <b>maternity</b> <b>grants</b> that paid them 75 percent of their insurable earnings. But occupational gender segregation persisted in Cyprus {{at the beginning of the}} 1990s. The participation of women in clerical jobs had more than doubled since the late 1970s, yet only one woman in 15 was in an administrative or managerial position in 1985. Women's share of professional jobs increased to 39 percent by the mid-1980s, compared with 36 percent ten years earlier, but these jobs were concentrated in medicine and teaching, where women had traditionally found employment. In fields where men were dominant, Cypriot women's share of professional positions was 11 percent, up from 8 percent in 1976. In the fields where women were dominant, men took just under half the professional positions.|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's {{thesis is}} about {{comparison}} of tested social benefits {{within the social}} support in the Czech Republic, Great Britain and Sweden.

The results indicate disagreement with the amount of all three benefits or their redundancy. Child benefit is in all age categories insufficient, the housing benefit should be eligible only for the economically active population or a completely different form of support should be used. Sure start <b>maternity</b> <b>grant</b> is not the motivation for giving birth to another child and there is a trend to its universal payment or complete cancellation.

40|$|Contemporary {{feminism}} has, {{from its}} inception, been ambivalent in its {{responses to the}} issue of women in management. On the one hand, feminists have recognised as a problem the limited numbers of women in management and the barriers that they encounter. They have promoted the development of programs such as affirmative action with, arguably, greater, or lesser success. At the same time, there has been a reluctance by some feminists to attach too much importance to the issue, given the manifestly more severe forms of discrimination encountered by other groups of women. According to this view, the problems of a privileged elite are a lesser priority, that is, marginal to more pressing feminist concerns. This paper is based on research into career success predictors. It draws on work on culture and models of change in higher education to show that while interventions such as legislation <b>granting</b> <b>maternity</b> leave are significant initiatives to be strongly supported, the impact of such policies is mediated by the social rules of the organisation. These rules are a corollary of enduring value structures which are embedded in organisational cultures. Research findings showed that the value systems, and especially the social rules which operate within organisations impact on men and women 2 ̆ 7 s career success differently. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms operating at several levels (at the organisational level {{as well as at the}} level of individual women) which tend to construct women as marginal in management. Seeking to understand the marginality experienced by women in management has benefits that extend well beyond improving the lot of individual women managers. This is because better conceptualisations of marginality and, concomitantly, power in organisations can provide leverage for more far reaching changes for women generally. <br /...|$|R
