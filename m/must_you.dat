500|$|When gliders {{containing}} paratroopers began landing {{around and}} {{to the west of}} the airfield on 20 May, Andrew became cut off from several of his platoons and companies with some being overrun by the German forces. Unable to gauge how the situation was unfolding, his communications with Hargest back at brigade headquarters also became disjointed. Andrew stressed the seriousness of the situation to Hargest and requested reinforcements from the other battalions, which were more than holding their own. Hargest incorrectly advised that there were no available troops. This left Andrew with his own small platoon-size reserve, which was used in a failed counter-attack. Eventually, Andrew sought permission to withdraw from Point 107; Hargest replied [...] "Well, if you <b>must,</b> <b>you</b> must." [...] Although well aware of the importance of Maleme Airfield to the defence of Crete, Hargest made no effort to dissuade Andrew or see the situation for himself. Despite the belated arrival of a reinforcing company of infantry sent by Hargest that evening, Andrew decided his position was not defensible in daylight and withdrew his units to join the other battalions of the brigade. The Germans took both the airfield and Point 107 early on the morning of 21 May. The capture of the airfield allowed German reinforcements to be landed directly on Crete and establish a strong foothold on their otherwise tenuous positions.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1999 book, Padre Pio: The Wonder Worker, {{a segment}} by Irish priest Malachy Gerard Carroll {{describes}} {{the story of}} Gemma de Giorgi, a Sicilian girl whose blindness was {{believed to have been}} cured during a visit to Padre Pio. Gemma, who was brought to San Giovanni Rotondo in 1947 by her grandmother, was born without pupils. During her trip to see Padre Pio, the little girl began to see objects, including a steamboat and the sea. Gemma's grandmother did not believe the child had been healed. After Gemma forgot to ask Padre Pio for grace during her confession, her grandmother implored the priest to ask God to restore her sight. Padre Pio told her, [...] "The child must not weep and neither <b>must</b> <b>you</b> for the child sees and you know she sees." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lü Yi's {{abuses of}} power {{finally came to}} an end in 238 when Sun Quan learnt the truth about him and {{understood}} the gravity of the situation. Lü Yi was removed from office and imprisoned under the watch of the Ministry of Justice. Sun Quan then put Gu Yong in charge of investigating Lü Yi's crimes. While interrogating Lü Yi, Gu Yong maintained his composure and performed his job professionally. Before Lü Yi was escorted out, Gu Yong asked him, [...] "Do you have anything else to say?" [...] Lü Yi kowtowed and remained silent. When another official Huai Xu (懷叙) started scolding Lü Yi, Gu Yong sternly rebuked him, [...] "As government officials, we should follow the laws. Why <b>must</b> <b>you</b> do this?" [...] Some officials proposed that Lü Yi be executed by burning or dismemberment – so as to highlight the severity of his crimes – instead of beheading. When Sun Quan sought Kan Ze's opinion on this, the latter replied that burning and dismemberment should be not be used as means of execution in a civilised age. Sun Quan heeded his advice and probably had Lü Yi executed by beheading.|$|E

2500|$|Assi {{became a}} disciple of R. Johanan, and so {{distinguished}} himself that R. Eleazar called him [...] "the prodigy of the age" [...] ("mofet ha-dor"; Hul. 103b), {{and as such}} legend pictures him. Concerning the futile longings of many {{to communicate with the}} departed spirit of R. Hiya the Great, legend relates that R. Jose fasted eighty days in order that a glimpse of R. Hiya might be granted him. Finally the spirit of the departed appeared, but the sight so affected R. Jose that his hands became palsied and his eyes dim. [...] "Nor <b>must</b> <b>you</b> infer from this," [...] the narrator continues, [...] "that R. Josah was an unimportant individual. Once a weaver came to R. Johanan and said, 'In a dream I have seen the skies fall, but one of thy disciples held them up.' When asked whether he knew that disciple, the weaver replied that {{he would be able to}} recognize him. R. Johanan thereupon had all his disciples pass before the weaver, who pointed to R. Josah as the miraculous agent" [...] (Yer. Kil. ix. 32b; Eccl. R. ix. 10). Another adventure, which, however, bears the impress of fact, is related of him, wherein he was once abducted in a riot and given up as lost, but R. Simon ben Lakish, the former gladiator, rescued him at the risk of his own life (Yer. Ter. viii. 46b).|$|E
