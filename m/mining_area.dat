5|$|In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency {{added the}} Basin <b>mining</b> <b>area</b> to the Superfund National Priorities List because of mining-waste {{problems}} in and near town. The <b>mining</b> <b>area</b> comprised the watersheds of Basin and Cataract Creek {{and part of}} the Boulder River. Contaminants included arsenic, copper, cadmium, lead and other metals. Cleanup of the mining wastes at the Buckeye-Enterprise, Crystal and Bullion mines in the Basin Creek and Cataract watersheds was completed in 2002, and the removal of mine waste from Basin was completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|John Donkin Dormand, Baron Dormand of Easington (27 August 1919 – 18 December 2003), {{known as}} Jack Dormand, was a British educationist and Labour Party {{politician}} from the coal <b>mining</b> <b>area</b> of Easington in County Durham, in the north-east of England. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for the Easington constituency from 1970 {{until his retirement}} in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Oil-shale {{extraction}} {{can damage}} the biological and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the <b>mining</b> <b>area.</b> Combustion and thermal processing generate waste material. In addition, the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale, as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before the valleys became a coal <b>mining</b> <b>area.</b> The earliest individuals {{to come to the}} fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found {{a way out of the}} Rhondda through sport; charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political and religious leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Pensford was an {{important}} coal <b>mining</b> <b>area</b> during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries when it formed part of the Somerset Coalfield, although there are no working coal mines today. The line of the now disused Bristol and North Somerset Railway runs south from Bristol crossing over the River Chew on the surviving distinctive Pensford Viaduct and on to Midsomer Norton. The area suffered serious flooding during the storm of 10 July 1968, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas in the lower parts of the valley, around Pensford and Keynsham.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores {{are mixed with}} other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and {{there are very few}} rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide <b>mining</b> <b>area</b> of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.|$|E

In Tudor times the town was an important <b>mining</b> <b>area,</b> and from the 18th century onwards it has increasingly been known as a holiday centre; tourism has been its principal industry for more than 150 years. Its features include the Moot Hall; a modern theatre, the Theatre by the Lake; one of Britain's oldest surviving cinemas, the Alhambra; and the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery in the town's largest open space, Fitz Park. Among the town's annual events is the Keswick Convention, an Evangelical gathering attracting visitors from many countries.|$|E

Here we present fatty acid profiles for testis and spermatozoa of deer from this <b>mined</b> <b>area</b> (n= 29) and a control area (n= 33). Despite elevated Pb in liver and bone of red deer from this area, concentrations in testis and sperm were not significantly higher than in control areas; however, Cu in testis was lower in <b>mined</b> <b>areas.</b> Testis from <b>mined</b> <b>areas</b> also contained higher percentages of linoleic acid (18 : 2 n- 6) and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (20 : 3 n- 6), but lower arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n- 6). The percentage of 20 : 4 n- 6 was also lower in spermatozoa of deer from the <b>mined</b> <b>area.</b> Copper levels in testis correlated positively with the percentage of 20 : 4 n- 6.
