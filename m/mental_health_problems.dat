5|$|Schizophrenia is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} characterized by abnormal social behavior {{and failure to}} understand what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time.|$|E
5|$|Hogg had {{previously}} suffered from <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> In late 1918, she fell ill, probably from severe depression. She consulted with Dr. Francis Xavier Dercum, {{a specialist in}} the treatment of nervous and mental diseases, who treated her for the next three years. She was hospitalized for more than a year, and spent a further three years convalescing, primarily in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the summer of 1923 Hogg was fully recovered, but she permanently discarded her dream of being a concert pianist, ostensibly because of weakness after her illness.|$|E
5|$|The British Psychological Society {{issued a}} {{statement}} offering to provide expert support in psychological testing and monitoring of pilots.

It said priority should be given to psychological help for relatives and friends of victims {{in the aftermath of a}} disaster.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> during first-half pregnancy. Study design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Material and Method: The 255 singleton pregnant women < 20 weeks of gestation were enrolled. They {{were asked to complete}} a self-administered questionnaire which included Thai GHQ- 30 (<b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> screening tool) and frequent psychosocial stressor forms. The prevalence and factors associated with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> were evaluated. Main outcome measurement: The prevalence of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> Results: The prevalence of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> was 17. 3 %.

5|$|Several justices {{have become}} widowers {{while on the}} bench. The 1792 death of Elizabeth Rutledge, wife of Justice John Rutledge, contributed to the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> {{that led to the}} {{rejection}} of his recess appointment.

5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> have also been suggested.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Stigma and {{discrimination}} present an important barrier to finding and keeping work {{for individuals with}} a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> This paper reviews evidence on: 1) employment-related disclosure beliefs and behaviours of people with a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problem; 2) factors associated with the disclosure of a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> in the employment setting; 3) whether employers {{are less likely to}} hire applicants who disclose a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problem; and 4) factors influencing employers' hiring beliefs and behaviours towards job applicants with a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> Methods A systematic review was conducted for the period 1990 - 2010, using eight bibliographic databases. Meta-ethnography was used to provide a thematic understanding of the disclosure beliefs and behaviours of individuals with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> Results The searches yielded 8, 971 items which was systematically reduced to 48 included studies. Sixteen qualitative, one mixed methods and seven quantitative studies were located containing evidence on the disclosure beliefs and behaviours of people with a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem,</b> and the factors associated with these beliefs and behaviours. In the meta-ethnography four super-ordinate themes were generated: 1) expectations and experiences of discrimination; 2) other reasons for non-disclosure; 3) reasons for disclosure; and 4) disclosure dimensions. Two qualitative, one mixed methods and 22 quantitative studies provided data to address the remaining two questions on the employers perspective. Conclusions By presenting evidence from the perspective of individuals {{on both sides of the}} employment interaction, this review provides integrated perspective on the impact of disclosure of a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> on employment outcomes. </p...|$|R

5|$|According {{to local}} newspapers, Barrett left {{approximately}} £1.7million to {{his two brothers}} and two sisters. This sum was apparently largely acquired from royalties from Pink Floyd compilations and live recordings featuring songs he had written while with the band. A tribute concert called Games for May {{was held at the}} Barbican Centre, London on 10 May 2007 with Robyn Hitchcock, Captain Sensible, Damon Albarn, Chrissie Hynde, Kevin Ayers and his Pink Floyd bandmates performing. A series of events called The City Wakes was held in Cambridge in October 2008 to celebrate Barrett's life, art and music. Barrett's sister, Rosemary Breen, supported this, the first-ever series of official events in memory of her brother. After the festival's success, arts charity Escape Artists announced plans to create a centre in Cambridge, using art to help people suffering from <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> A memorial bench has been placed in the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge and a more prominent tribute is planned in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of oil on her family's cotton plantation made Hogg very wealthy, {{and she used}} this income to benefit the people of Texas. In 1929, she founded the Houston Child Guidance Center, which provides counseling for children with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> or diagnoses and their families. Through her brother's will, she established the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin in 1940. Hogg successfully ran for {{a seat on the}} Houston School Board in 1943, where she worked to remove gender and race as criteria for determining pay and established art education programs for black students. Hogg never married, and died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in Texas.|$|E
5|$|After a time, Himmler {{found that}} the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and {{sometimes}} did not kill the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered physical and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems,</b> and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes {{an attempt was made}} to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of Einsatzgruppe D, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.|$|E

5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems.</b> Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E
5|$|Mark befriends Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), {{and they}} share a kiss, before {{deciding}} to remain friends. After a jealous Paige fights with Steph, Mark and Steph have sex and begin a relationship. Following an explosion at Lassiter's Hotel, Mark finds evidence Paul was responsible and arrests him. Released on bail, Paul convinces Steph of his innocence, causing trouble in her and Mark's relationship. Tyler is later questioned and Mark {{is removed from the}} case. Mark raises the subject of having children with Steph and she tells him she is open to {{the idea of having a}} child with him in the future. Mark starts to think Paul could be innocent, but is threatened with dismissal if he continues to investigate. He later discovers that Jacka Hills (Brad McMurray) caused the explosion on Julie Quill's (Gail Easdale) orders. Mark investigates the release of snakes in Ramsay Street and soon realises that Steph is being stalked. Hearing that someone has made a confession to Father Jack Callahan (Andrew Morley), Mark bugs the confessional, despite being ordered not to. Mark learns from Steph's former girlfriend Belinda Bell (Nikki Shiels) that one of her patients Ari Philcox (Dylan Watson) is behind the release of the snakes. Mark is suspended when the bug is discovered. Despite this, Mark goes after Ari when he threatens Belinda and Steph's son Charlie Hoyland (Alexander McGuire), but he is stabbed in the process. His injuries are not life-threatening. Steph and Mark are saddened when Charlie has to return home. Sonya offers to be their surrogate, as Steph is wary of her <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>problems</b> returning.
