50|$|After {{struggling}} with development {{for over two}} years, developers released an unfinished game set within a very large and open outdoor environment. This {{was caused by the}} game development starting before the 3dfx Voodoo 1 moved towards 3D hardware. As a result, some techniques, including bump mapping and image caching, were incompatible with graphics processing units. Near the end of development the programmers developed a renderer that drew bump <b>mapped</b> <b>objects</b> in software and the terrain in hardware, but most objects were bump mapped so the speed advantages of hardware acceleration were negated. Trespasser used many textures for its mip levels and image cache, more than the most highly lauded gaming card of the time, the Voodoo2, could handle, and the game used the lower resolution textures in hardware mode instead of the high resolution ones available in software mode. This resulted in the game running faster and looking better in software mode, while running in hardware mode meant the game ran slower and looked worse.|$|E

Many problems have to be solved in order to achieve this goal. This dissertation focuses on solving one of the main problems in real-time image synthesis: realistic shading of objects with complex optical material properties. To this end, we develop a set of new techniques and algorithms using graphics hardware. These algorithms achieve results in real-time, which are of comparable quality to offline rendering and were previously considered impossible to achieve in real-time. In particular, we propose new algorithms for bump mapping and shadowing in bump maps, several techniques for glossy reflections using environment maps, self-shadowing and interreflections for environment <b>mapped</b> <b>objects,</b> as well as displacement mapping...|$|E

This tool gives a visual depiction of users ’ interactions with a spatial interface, and highlights the <b>mapped</b> <b>objects</b> upon which those interactions focus. Our motivation for this analysis is to help system designers discover hidden information about users ’ intentions, and to use such information to improve map personalisation engines. ...|$|E
