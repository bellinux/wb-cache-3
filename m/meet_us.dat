25|$|The North American Regal {{weighs about}} 13 pounds {{more than an}} {{equivalent}} Opel Insignia due to increased structural support in the B-pillar necessary to <b>meet</b> <b>U.S.</b> rollover standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} was revised {{with a new}} center console, lower dash panels (to <b>meet</b> <b>U.S.</b> regulations) and a single monopod gauge cluster (with electronic gauges). For the North American market a model dubbed the Graduate was added in tribute to the car's famous appearance in the 1967 film, The Graduate, starring Dustin Hoffman.|$|E
25|$|Because the Ford Essex V6 engine had not {{yet been}} {{certified}} to <b>meet</b> <b>US</b> emissions standards, TVR engaged British Leyland in negotiations to supply either the Rover V8 engine or the Triumph 2.5L inline six. Extra production for the Rover V8 had already been allocated to Morgan, so the six cylinder Triumph unit was selected.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, a US {{specification}} {{model was}} produced by the factory, with styling changes to allow bumpers to <b>meet</b> <b>US</b> federal safety standards. Many owners, however, had those bumpers removed immediately, or never had them installed at all, as the bulky looking addition to the car was said to ruin the otherwise smooth lines of the body. The 1985 US model had a base price close to $100,000. Only two optional extras were available: a $5,500 aerodynamic spoiler and a $7,500 sound system.|$|E

25|$|Replacing the Defender with a {{new model}} {{has been in the}} {{planning}} stages for many years. The Defender did not <b>meet</b> <b>U.S.</b> safety requirements after 1997 and since then Land Rover offered U.S. buyers the more luxurious LR2 (Freelander) and LR4 (Discovery) and Range Rover instead. The need for total replacement has been brought about by 2015's new European regulations regarding crash safety for pedestrians that render the Defender's design obsolete (see more at Euro NCAP).|$|E
25|$|By 1935, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) had {{received}} two extension requests for U.S. Route 93 south {{of what was}} then its southern terminus in Glendale, Nevada. Arizona State Highway Engineer T.S. O'Connell requested US 93 extend southwest into California to <b>meet</b> <b>US</b> 99 in El Centro. At a later time, he reconsidered and sent a second request for US 93 multiplex with US 466 over the new Boulder Dam into Arizona and end at US 66 in Kingman. This created a conflict, leading to both proposals being accidentally denied. After a misunderstanding regarding the conflicting proposals from O'Connell, the second proposal was re-evaluated and approved. Thus, US 93 was extended into Arizona. In 1936, the Arizona Highway Department began exploring {{the possibility of a}} further extension of US 93. The first extension proposal called for US 93 to end in Phoenix, being extended from Kingman by way of US 66 through Ash Fork. A new US 193 was proposed from Phoenix through Sacaton and Casa Grande to Picacho. At the time, US 89 served the road between Ash Fork and Phoenix, while State Route 87, State Route 187 and State Route 84 ran between Sacaton and Picacho through Casa Grande (of which only SR 87 still traverses today).|$|E

The roadway then turns southward, and after intersecting Santa Maria River Road, it crosses the Santa Maria River and turns slightly southeastward. Through a hilly area, SR 96 turns eastward and passes {{through a series of}} hairpin turns. The highway ends at the west end of CR 15 at the intersection with Hillside Road. The road continues east as CR 15 (Bagdad Road) towards Prescott.|$|E

500|$|Having served {{just over}} three years as Commander-in-Chief, Walker was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the professional head of the British Army—on 17 April 2000, taking over from General Sir Roger Wheeler. He remained CGS for three years, after which {{he was promoted to}} Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of all the British Armed Forces—on 2 May 2003, succeeding Admiral Sir Michael Boyce (later Lord Boyce). As CDS, Walker criticised some of the media coverage of British deployments in Iraq. In particular, he claimed that attacks on the Black Watch were [...] "enhanced" [...] due to news reports on their location. He {{went on to say that}} [...] ", there could well have been a response by those who wished us ill to go and <b>meet</b> <b>us</b> with something like a bomb". His comments were rejected by a spokesman for the National Union of Journalists, who retaliated [...] "When generals turn around and start blaming reporters for their own mistakes, it is a sign they aren't doing their own jobs properly". Also in 2004, Walker, along with General Sir Mike Jackson, then Chief of the General Staff, attracted controversy over reforms of the armed forces, which included the amalgamation of several army regiments to form larger regiments, leading to the loss of historic names.|$|E
500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not <b>meet</b> <b>us</b> in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E
