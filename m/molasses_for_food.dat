50|$|The <b>molasses</b> usually used <b>for</b> <b>food</b> is {{obtained}} from sugar cane, because the flavor is generally preferred over beet sugar molasses, although in some areas, especially in Belgium and the Netherlands, {{sugar beet molasses}} is used. The white sugar used can be from either beet or cane, as the chemical composition, nutritional value, color, and taste of fully refined white sugar is for practical purposes the same, no matter from what plant it originates. Even with less-than-perfect refining, the small differences in color, odor, and taste of the white sugar will be masked by the molasses.|$|R

40|$|For {{the last}} two winters feeding {{experiments}} have been carried on by this Station to ascertain the value of beet pulp and beet <b>molasses</b> as <b>food</b> <b>for</b> sheep and steers. In a feeding test made with sheep two years ago, the results of which are reported in bulletin No. 78, sugar beet pulp and sugar beet molasses gave profitable returns. When lucern and pulp were fed, one pound of gain was made from 7. 95 pounds of lucern and 17. 86 pounds pulp. One hundred pounds of increase was made {{at a cost of}} $ 2. 48 and pulp had a value of $ 1. 86 per ton. When lucern, grain (one-half screenings and one-half bran) and pulp were fed, one pound of gain was made from 4. 23 pounds lucern, 1. 56 pounds grain and 10. 14 pounds pulp. One hundred pounds of increase was made at a cost of $ 2. 28 and pulp had a value of $ 3. 38 per ton. These results agree with the results obtained in the last feeding experiment, namely, that the greatest profit comes from feeding lucern and pulp to sheep when a small amount of grain is added to the ration. Pulp fed in limited quantities with lucern or lucern and grain did not give as good results as when similarly fed ad libitum. When lucern, bran and molasses were fed one pound of gain was made from 8. 1 pounds of lucern, 1. 5 pounds bran and 1. 43 pounds of molasses.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to establish Acinetobacter sp. IMB B- 7005 cultivation conditions, which provide the maximal synthesis of microbial exopolysaccharide ethapolan on a mixture of molasses and sunflower oil, and to explore the possibility of replacing refined oil in a mixture with <b>molasses</b> <b>for</b> waste one. On the basis of theoretical calculations of energy consumption for the synthesis of ethapolan and biomass, {{it was determined that}} the optimal molar ratio of the concentrations of energy-deficient (sucrose) and energy-excessive (sunflower oil) substrates in the mixture was 1. 0 : 0. 9. Experiments have shown that the highest values of exopolysaccharide synthesis were observed at a molar ratio of monosubstrates in mixture 1. 0 : 1. 1, which is {{as close as possible to}} the theoretically calculated one. It was shown that increasing concentration of molasses and refined oil in mixture from 1. 0 to 1. 5 % was accompanied by increase in amount of synthesized exopolysaccharide and its synthesizing capacity by 1. 2 and 1. 3 times, respectively. The possibility of replacing refined oil in a mixture with <b>molasses</b> <b>for</b> various types of waste (after frying potatoes, meat, vegetables and mixed) was established. The maximum parameters of exopolysaccharide synthesis (concentration 14 g/l, synthesizing capacity 3. 5 g exopolysaccharide/g biomass) were observed when using mixed waste oil for both inoculum obtaining and EPS biosynthesis. The obtained results testify to the possibility of development of universal technology for obtaining microbal exopolysaccharide ethapolan on a mixture of waste (molasses and waste oil) independent of the type and provider of waste oil...|$|R
