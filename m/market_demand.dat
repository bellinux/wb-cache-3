5|$|Decline in <b>market</b> <b>demand</b> {{combined}} with movement restrictions {{imposed by the}} Israeli military {{have led to a}} deterioration of the local economy, particularly in the trade and the stone-cutting industries. In 2007, unemployment reached 30%. Consequently, many unemployed persons began looking into agriculture to earn income. The most cultivated crops are grains, especially barley, followed by lentils and chick peas. A sizable segment of the population raise livestock and 10% breed their own domestic animals. In total, there are 144 cows, 7,000 goats, 14,000 sheep, and 500 beehives. Much of the town's agricultural products are sold in Hebron.|$|E

When the network failed to work, Blockbuster withdrew from the contract. Enron continued to recognize future profits, even though the deal resulted in a loss.|$|E

5|$|GM halted {{production}} for about one {{month at the}} Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant by mid June 2011 to complete some upgrades, including the installation of new tooling, equipment and overhead conveyor systems throughout the facility. These upgrades allowed GM to triple the rate of Volt production and prepared the plant for 2012 Volt and Ampera production. After the plant retooling, the production rate reached 150 units per day {{four days a week}} by August 2011. The Volt plant was also down during January 2012 in preparation for building the California lower-emission version. A four-week shutdown due to slow sales took place between March and April 2012. GM said it had around 3,600 Volts in inventory and needed to reduce dealer inventories as production is expected to meet <b>market</b> <b>demand.</b> GM also extended the traditional two-week summer vacation by an extra week at the Hamtramck plant. GM closed its Detroit-Hamtramck plant from September 17 until October 15, 2012, affecting roughly 1,500 workers on downtime while the plant was retooled to assemble the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala alongside the 2013 Volt. This was the second time in 2012 that GM has halted Volt production.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about limit pricing under {{complete}} information and endogenous <b>market</b> <b>demands.</b> If pre-entry and post-entry <b>market</b> <b>demands</b> are correlated, then limit pricing {{can be an}} equilibrium strategy under complete information without government intervention. Furthermore, with government intervention, limiting entry via government dominates self-limiting strategy for the incumbent monopolist. The entry regulation by the benevolent government to prevent excess entry is exploited by the incumbent {{as a way to}} protect monopoly position. As a result, the social welfare with entry regulation is lower than under pure market equilibrium. The idea of this paper is general enough to be applied to other dynamic models of sequential entry like a location model of product differentiation. limit pricing, endogenous <b>market</b> <b>demands,</b> excess entry, entry regulation...|$|R

However, many enterprises lack this ability, causing them to make risky purchasing decisions. This study combines a back propagation neural network and the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSOBPN) to construct a demand prediction model. Using a grey relational analysis, we selected factors that have a high correlation to <b>market</b> <b>demands.</b> These factors were employed to train the prediction model and were used as input factors to predict <b>market</b> <b>demands.</b> The results obtained from the prediction model were {{compared with those of}} the experiential estimation model used by health food companies. The comparison showed that the accuracy of PSOBPN predictions was superior to that of the experiential estimation method. Therefore, the prediction model proposed in this study provides reliable and highly efficient analysis data for decision-makers in enterprises...|$|R
