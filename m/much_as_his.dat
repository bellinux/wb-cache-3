5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Taft met Helen Herron (often called Nellie), {{but it was no}} later than 1880, when she {{mentioned}} in her diary receiving an invitation to a party from him. By 1884, they were meeting regularly, and in 1885, after an initial rejection, she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19, 1886. William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage. Nellie Taft pushed her husband <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> parents had, and she could be very frank with her criticisms. The couple had three children, of which the eldest, Robert, became a U.S. senator.|$|E
5|$|Major {{developments}} in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest's {{translation of the}} Mabinogion, {{one of the most}} important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology, into English. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century experienced an important shift away from the stilted and long-winded Victorian Welsh prose, with Thomas Gwynn Jones leading the way with his 1902 work Ymadawiad Arthur. The slaughter in the trenches of the First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style of prose championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> plays, poetry and criticism.|$|E
5|$|McNichol {{was born}} in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. His father, Danny, {{died when he was}} five, so McNichol and seven {{siblings}} were raised by their mother, Catherine. He attended St Joseph's School in Kilmarnock, and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper's shop when he left school. His shop work stopped him playing football on Saturdays, but he was able to play some midweek football for Junior club Hurlford United. When he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic, he became available on Saturdays as well. Hurlford paid him ten shillings a game, nearly as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the Fleet Air Arm as a mechanic, but was able to play friendly matches for Inverness-based club Clachnacuddin. Because of the number of professional players stationed around the country, such matches were played at a fairly high standard.|$|E

Powell's 2008 season started <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> 2007 season ended: with another injury. Powell {{was forced to}} pull out of the Sydney Grand Prix meeting, having suffered a gash to his left knee that required four stitches. The injury was a result of tripping on the steps of his home, hours before getting on the flight to Sydney on 12 February.|$|E

Vidal takes the baby from her arms and fatally shoots Ofelia; then, when he reaches the labyrinth's entrance, he is {{surrounded}} by the rebels who have taken over the outpost. Knowing {{that he will be}} killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, demanding that she tell his son the exact time of his father's death. Mercedes replies that the child will never know so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> name. Her brother Pedro kills Vidal.|$|E
25|$|During the {{overland}} journey, {{they stopped}} at Salt Lake City, where Ludlow found an industrious and sincere group of settlers. He brought to the city prejudice and misgiving about the Mormons, and a squeamishness about polygamy which embarrassed him almost as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> first view of a household of multiple wives. “I, a cosmopolitan, {{a man of the}} world, liberal to other people’s habits and opinions to a degree which had often subjected me to censure among strictarians in the Eastern States, blushed to my very temples,” he writes.|$|E
25|$|These interests, as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> {{aspirations}} to the titles and {{the lifestyle of}} the English landed gentry were influential {{in the formation of}} his personal art collection. This collection was mostly displayed in his London home and moved for safe-keeping to the north of England during the Second World War (1939–1945). On his death in 1940 the terms of his will placed his collection under the protection of a special trust established in his name and bequeathed it to the South African nation. Bailey was {{one of the very few}} South African Randlords to leave a bequest of this nature to South Africa.|$|E

25|$|Significantly, {{many of his}} {{earliest}} novels have Ireland as their setting—natural enough given his background, but unlikely to enjoy warm critical reception, given the contemporary English attitude towards Ireland. Critics {{have pointed out that}} Trollope's view of Ireland separates him from many of the other Victorian novelists. Some critics claim that Ireland did not influence Trollope as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> experience in England, and that the society in Ireland harmed him as a writer, especially since Ireland was experiencing the Great Famine during his time there. Such critics were dismissed as holding bigoted opinions against Ireland and failing to recognise Trollope's true attachment to the country.|$|E
25|$|The Gordons' {{charge at}} Dargai {{had caught the}} {{imagination}} of the British public, and the romantic description of the wounded piper encouraging his comrades on was perhaps the most famous element of it. Whilst recovering, Findlater received a large number of public donations, including sets of bagpipes, and by at least one account, a proposal of marriage. The public interest increased sharply after he was awarded the Victoria Cross, and to supplement his Army pension Findlater arranged to appear at the Military Tournament, where he drew large crowds; for just thirty performances, he was paid two-thirds as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> annual Army pension of £46. He then began to perform at music halls, first at the London Alhambra and then nationally, with his earnings climbing as high as £100 a week.|$|E
25|$|Commissioned by {{impresario}} Richard D'Oyly Carte in {{the late}} 1880s, it was designed by Thomas Edward Collcutt. Carte intended {{it to be the}} home of English grand opera, <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> Savoy Theatre had been built as a home for English light opera, beginning with the Gilbert and Sullivan series. The foundation stone, laid by his wife Helen in 1888, can still be seen on the façade of the theatre, almost at ground level {{to the right of the}} entrance. The theatre's design was considered to be novel. The upper levels are supported by heavy steel cantilevers built into the back walls, removing the need for supporting pillars that impede the view of the stage. The tiers, corridors, staircases, landings are all constructed of concrete to reduce the risk and damage that might be done by fire.|$|E

According to one story, in 1810 or later, Boone went with a group on a long hunt as far west as the Yellowstone River, a remarkable journey at his age, if true.

500|$|According to the American {{historian}} and Mormonism expert Richard Bushman, the [...] "signal feature" [...] of Smith's life was [...] "his {{sense of being}} guided by revelation". Instead of presenting ideas with logical arguments, Smith dictated authoritative revelations and let people decide whether to believe. [...] Smith's teachings came primarily through his revelations, which read like scripture: [...] and open to interpretation. Smith and his followers viewed his revelations as being above teachings or opinions, and Smith's actions seemed to indicate that he believed in his revelations as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> most loyal followers.|$|E
500|$|... is a 1967 Japanese yakuza film {{directed}} by Seijun Suzuki and starring Joe Shishido, Koji Nanbara and Annu Mari. It {{was a low}} budget, production line number for the Nikkatsu Company, originally released in a double bill with Shōgorō Nishimura's Burning Nature. The story follows Goro Hanada in {{his life as a}} contract killer. He {{falls in love with a}} woman named Misako, who recruits him for a seemingly impossible mission. When the mission fails, he becomes hunted by the phantom Number One Killer, whose methods threaten his sanity as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> life.|$|E

500|$|Norman {{started his}} working {{life as a}} butcher in Sussex before moving to London {{at the age of}} 14 where he sought a career on the music hall stage. There, he became {{interested}} in freak shows which he attended in his spare time. After viewing an exhibition called [...] "Electric Lady" [...] next door to his place of work, he went into business with the exhibition's manager and {{began his career as a}} showman of human oddities. He quickly became successful, for his patter as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> exhibits, and was called the 'Silver King' by the American showman P. T. Barnum.|$|E
500|$|... {{astonished}} me as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> intense industry. He painted {{directly on}} the white canvas, without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I {{was struck by the}} keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas. He seemed to proceed slowly, when in reality he executed very rapidly, placing one touch after the other in its place, rarely having to go over his work more than once. There was very little perceptible movement of his body or arms. His expression was perfectly calm...|$|E
500|$|Burges's {{furniture}} was, {{second to}} his buildings, his major {{contribution to the}} Victorian Gothic Revival; as Crook writes, [...] "More than anyone, it was Burges, with his eye for detail and his lust for colour, who created the furniture appropriate to High Victorian Gothic." [...] Enormous, elaborate and highly painted, Crook considers his [...] "art furniture medieval in a way no other designer ever approached." [...] The first detailed study of Burges's {{work in this area}} was by Charles Handley-Read in his article in The Burlington Magazine of November 1963, Notes on William Burges's Painted Furniture. Despised as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> buildings in the reaction against Victorian taste that occurred in the twentieth century, his furniture came back into fashion {{in the latter part of}} that century and now commands very high prices.|$|E
