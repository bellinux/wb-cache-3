This paper describes the design, construction, noise analysis, and measures that were taken in the conception of the emitters, in order to produce high-contrast shadows at such distant detectors. In this way it proved possible to obtain, simultaneously, a very high transfer sensitivity to Violin-Mode vibration of the fibres, and a very low level of detection noise—close to the fundamental shot noise limit—whilst remaining within the constraints of this simple design of emitter.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a system of}} four novel shadow detectors having, collectively, a displacement sensitivity of (69 ± 13) picometres (rms) / √Hz, at 500 Hz, over a <b>measuring</b> <b>span</b> of ± 0. 1 mm. The detectors were designed to monitor the vibrations of the 600 mm long, 400 µm diameter, silica suspension fibres of the mirrors for the Advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory) gravitational wave detectors, at the resonances of the so-called Violin Modes (VM). The VM detection system described here had a target sensitivity of 100 pm (rms) /√Hz at 500 Hz, together with, ultimately, a required detection span of ± 0. 1 mm about the mean position of each fibre—in order to compensate for potential slow drift over time of fibre position, due to mechanical relaxation. The full sensor system, comprising emitters (sources of illumination) and shadow detectors, therefore met these specifications. Using these sensors, VM resonances having amplitudes of 1. 2 nm (rms), were detected in the suspension fibres of an Advanced LIGO dummy test-mass. The VM bandwidth of the sensor, determined by its transimpedance amplifier, was 226 Hz– 8. 93 kHz at the — 3 dB points. This paper focuses mainly on the detector side of the shadow-sensors.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} performance of an extremely low-noise differential transimpedance amplifier, which takes its two inputs from separate photodiodes. The amplifier was planned {{to serve as the}} front-end electronics for a highly sensitive shadow-displacement sensing system, aimed at detecting very low-level “Violin-Mode” (VM) oscillations in 0. 4 mm diameter by 600 mm long fused-silica suspension fibres. Four such highly tensioned fibres support the 40 kg test-masses/mirrors of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory interferometers. This novel design of amplifier incorporates features which prevent “noise-gain peaking” arising from large area photodiode (and cable) capacitances, and which also usefully separate the DC and AC photocurrents coming from the photodiodes. In consequence, the differential amplifier was able to generate straightforwardly two DC outputs, one per photodiode, as well as a single high-gain output for monitoring the VM oscillations—this output being derived from the difference of the photodiodes’ two, naturally anti-phase, AC photocurrents. Following a displacement calibration, the amplifier’s final VM signal output was found to have an AC displacement responsivity at 500 Hz of (9. 43 ± 1. 20) MV(rms) m− 1 (rms), and, therefore, a shot-noise limited sensitivity to such AC shadow- (i. e., fibre-) displacements of (69 ± 13) picometres/√Hz at this frequency, over a <b>measuring</b> <b>span</b> of ± 0. 1 mm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design of, and results from, a calibration system for optical linear displacement- (shadow-) sensors. The shadow-sensors {{were designed to}} detect ‘Violin-Mode’ (VM) resonances in the 0. 4 mm diameter silica fibre suspensions of the test-masses / mirrors of advanced LIGO gravitational wave interferometers. Each sensor illuminated the fibre under test, so as to cast its narrow shadow onto a ‘synthesized split photodiode’ detector, the shadow falling over adjacent edges of the paired photodiodes. The apparatus described here translated a vertically orientated silica test fibre horizontally through a collimated Near InfraRed illuminating beam, whilst simultaneously capturing the separate DC ‘shadow notch’ outputs {{from each of the}} paired split photodiode detectors. As the ratio of AC to DC photocurrent sensitivities to displacement was known, a calibration of the DC response to quasi-static shadow displacement allowed the required AC sensitivity to vibrational displacement to be found. Special techniques are described for generating the required constant scan-rate for the test-fibre using a DC motor-driven stage, for removing ‘jitter’ at such low translation rates from a linear magnetic encoder, and so for capturing the two shadow-notch signals at each micrometre of the test-fibre’s travel. Calibration, across the four detectors of this work, gave a vibrational responsivity in voltage terms of (9. 45 ± 1. 20) MV (rms) / metre (rms), yielding a VM displacement sensitivity of (69 ± 13) picometres (rms) / √Hz, at 500 Hz, over the required <b>measuring</b> <b>span</b> of ± 0. 1 mm...|$|E

40|$|A {{steerable}} low-noise {{source of}} illumination is described for shadow-sensors having a displacement sensitivity of ∼ 100 pm (rms) /√Hz, at 500 Hz, over a <b>measuring</b> <b>span</b> {{of at least}} ± 0. 5 mm. These sensors were designed to detect lateral "Violin-Mode" resonances in the highly tensioned fused-silica suspension fibres of the test-masses/mirrors for the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory gravitational wave detectors. The shadow sensors—one intended {{for each of the}} four fibres in a suspension—comprised a source of Near InfraRed (NIR) radiation (emitter) and a differential shadow-displacement sensor (detector), these bracketing the fibre under test. The suspension fibres themselves were approximately 600 mm long by 0. 4 mm in diameter, and when illuminated from the side, they cast narrow, vertical, shadows onto their respective detectors—these being located at an effective distance of 50 fibre diameters behind the axes of the fibres themselves. The emitter described here was designed to compensate for a significant degree of mechanical drift or creep over time in the mean position of its suspension fibre. This was achieved by employing five adjacent columns of 8 × miniature NIR LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes, λ = 890 nm), with one column being activated at a time. When used in conjunction with a "reverse Galilean" telescope, the LED sources allowed the collimated beam from the emitter to be steered azimuthally in fine angular increments (0. 65 ◦), causing the fibre's shadow to move laterally, in a step-wise manner, across the plane of its facing detector. Each step in shadow position was approximately 0. 23 mm in size, and this allowed the fibre's shadow to be re-centred, so as to bridge once again both elements of its photodiode detector—even if the fibre was off-centred by as much as ± 0. 5 mm. Re-centring allowed Violin-Mode vibrations of the fibre to be sensed once again as differential AC photocurrents, these flowing in anti-phase in the two elements of the "split-photodiode" detector.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first results from `Violin-Mode' measurements {{made on the}} four suspension fibres of a fully suspended 40 kg test mass. These measurements were made at the LIGO lab, Gravitational Wave Observatory test facility, at MIT. Here, an aluminium-alloy (dummy) test mass, simulating an advanced LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) test mass/mirror, had been suspended in air from a test suspension by four fused-silica suspension fibres, each measuring 400 mu m in diameter x 600 mm long. Violin-Mode measurements were made on these highly tensioned fibres by retrofitting a prototype system of four novel shadow sensors to the test suspension, one per fibre, these sensors having, collectively, a displacement sensitivity of (6. 9 +/- 1. 3) x 10 (- 11) m (rms) Hz(- 1 / 2), at 500 Hz, over a <b>measuring</b> <b>span</b> of +/- 0. 1 mm. Violin-Mode fundamental resonances were detected in all four fibres: with frequencies similar to 485 Hz when the test mass was supported lightly from below, and at similar to 500 Hz when it was fully suspended. In the latter case the Violin-Mode detection took place whilst the test mass, together with its suspension fibres, was undergoing relatively large-amplitude `pendulum-mode' motion, at similar to 0. 6 Hz. This motion was measured to have a peak-peak amplitude {{at one of the}} suspension fibres of up to similar to 140 mu m (35 mu m, rms) -the shadow sensors each having subsidiary outputs for monitoring such low-frequency, large amplitude, motion. Under fully suspended conditions, a calibrated Violin-Mode `free-oscillation' amplitude of 430 +/- 20 picometres, rms, was measured at 500. 875 Hz, in the same suspension fibre which was found to be undergoing, simultaneously, the similar to 140 mu m peak-peak motion. Over the bandwidth monitored (dc to 3. 2 kHz), Violin-Mode harmonics up to the sixth were recorded in an evoked response. It was concluded that the prototype system had demonstrated amply its practical viability as a detector of Violin-Mode resonances in the test-mass suspension fibres of gravitational wave interferometers, such as those of advanced LIGO...|$|E
