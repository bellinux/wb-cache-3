It {{can be used to}} identify not only global spatial patterns in the country, but also characteristic locations at micro levels. In this research, we used spatial autocorrelation methodologies, including Global Moran’s I and Local Getis—Ord Gi statistics to identify the intensity of the spatial clustering of municipalities in Serbia by the level of average <b>monthly</b> <b>net</b> <b>earnings</b> from 2001 to 2010. We identified and mapped local clusters (hot and cold spots) by the level of average <b>monthly</b> <b>net</b> <b>earnings</b> for the same period. The results show that overall spatial segregation between municipalities with high and low average <b>monthly</b> <b>net</b> <b>earnings</b> was predominantly increasing during the investigated period. Local statistics illustrated that overall spatial segregation followed a broad north—south divide, with a concentration of municipalities with high net earnings in the north of Serbia, and low net earnings in the south. Closer inspection showed that {{at the beginning of the}} study period, there were three statistically significant hot spots in the north. As time passed, only one highly clustered hot spot remained — the Belgrade region. One cold spot retained a relatively stable position in the country’s southeast.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the correlation}} between social security budget and the main macroeconomic indicators (like GDP, monthly average gross earnings, unemployment) in Romania during the period 2000 – 2009. Romania faces a more severe economic recession than originally anticipated. Although the implementation of anti-crisis program was able to lead to normalization of financial conditions, the contraction of economic activity is higher than initial projections. Because of the great policy debate in Romania {{about the impact of}} the reduction of pensions and salaries and increases of taxations on the reduction of budget deficit, we have explained in our paper the basic sides of the balanced budget debate. There are three basic sides to the balanced budget debate. The traditionalists argue for a reduction of the budget deficit since it harms the economy. Another group holds the Ricardian view of government debt in believing that there is no real harm done to the economy by the national debt. A third group claims one way or another that the budget deficit is not an adequate measure of fiscal policy. We will argue which of these views is most reasonable, based on a study case. � � The study is based on official data published by the National Institute of Statistics, with the specification that they are transformed into real values in order to assure the data comparability. The methodology used is the correlation analysis, the factorial analysis and the regression analysis, in order to evaluate the impact of some macroeconomic policies on the budget deficit. Three hypotheses on macroeconomic policies are discussed in the paper and their influences on the budget deficit. The main problem in Romania was that the macroeconomic policies didn't give enough attention to budget deficit in order to keep it under control. This is the main cause of the actual unfavourable economical situation in Romania, with a huge budget deficit, with a decrease in economic activity, with increases of inflation and unemployment. � � Among the variables used in the study we mention: total incomes, total expenditure, budgetary deficit, unemployment rate, <b>monthly</b> average <b>net</b> <b>earnings,</b> average number of pensioners and social allowance recipients, monthly average pension of pensioners and social allowance recipients, economically active population, monthly average inflation rate. � � By analysing {{the correlation between}} all the studied variables we observe that there is a strong correlation between monthly average pension and <b>monthly</b> average <b>net</b> <b>earnings.</b> Increases in the level of earnings will determine the increase of budget deficit. At first view the macroeconomic policy adopted by the actual government in Romania (the cut with 25 % of salaries in the budgetary system, VAT increase) will have as a result the decrease of budget deficit. Since the <b>monthly</b> average <b>net</b> <b>earnings</b> is correlated with unemployment and inflation rate, the reduction of the general level of earnings will determine the increase of unemployment and inflation. Therefore this policy should be applied with caution, taking in parallel measures to compensate its adverse effects. The impact of some of the macroeconomic policies on budget deficit is studied using two regression functions. After an econometric analysis we shall conclude about the influence of the dependent variables of these functions on the Romanian budgetary deficit. social security budget; gross domestic product; correlation coefficient; regression analysis. ...|$|R

First of all, {{we show that}} business survival 19 months after start-up is relatively high and amounts to 75 – 84  %. Conditional on being self-employed and working full-time (corresponds to 67 – 91  % of survived businesses), female entrepreneurs earn on average 1, 670 and male 2, 500 Euro net per month. A comparison to the average <b>net</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>earnings</b> of comparable workers in dependent employment (1, 760 / 1, 994  Euro for women/men) shows that male entrepreneurs earn considerably more while self-employed females earn slightly less.

40|$|The {{literature}} on the certification role of venture capitalists in initial public offerings (IPOs) is mixed and quite often no significant effect is found.

30|$|To {{assess the}} effect of the work {{schedule}} on worker productivity, I estimate Mincerian-like hourly wage regressions. Although wages may deviate from the worker’s current productivity (e.g., see Manning 2010), the lack of a compensatory premium for working split shifts (Amuedo-Dorantes and de la Rica 2009) plus the rich set of controls (discussed in Sect.  2.2) included in the wage regressions, strongly suggest that the existence of wage differences across work schedules reflects, at least in part, differences in productivity. Following Bell and Hart (1999) and Anger (2008), I explore two different measures of the hourly wage to account for possible differences in unpaid work across work schedules. The first measure (WM 1) is calculated as average <b>net</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>earnings</b> divided by HM 1 times 4.3. 6 The second measure (WM 2) has as denominator HM 2 times 4.3. According to Bell and Hart (1999), WM 1 is a superior measure of productivity because actual wages are adjusted between high- and low-productivity workers by requiring the latter to undertake unpaid overtime. However, if unpaid overtime is used in fact by workers to signal a higher value to the firm (Anger 2008), WM 2 would be preferred.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the links between implementing ISA 540 and mitigating the practice of smoothing reported <b>net</b> <b>earnings</b> using write-offs of accounts receivable and inventory by reporting entities in Poland. The research question stems from the previous analysis carried out by the author in which evidence was provided that reporting entities in Poland in the period 2000 – 2010 effectively used write-offs of accounts receivable and inventory in order to mitigate fluctuations of reported <b>net</b> <b>earnings.</b> This paper provides evidence that before implementing ISA 540 reporting entities used write-offs of receivables and inventory for income smoothing in effective manner, however in the period after implementing the standard (2009 – 2014) no link was observed between the write-offs and reduced fluctuations of reported <b>net</b> <b>earnings.</b> The research has been carried out using Wilcoxon signed-rank test used to check equality of medians of mean deviations of <b>net</b> <b>earnings</b> before write-offs of receivables and inventory and mean deviations of <b>net</b> <b>earnings</b> after write-offs. For the period before implementing ISA 540 there are grounds to reject the hypothesis of equality of medians of mean deviations of <b>net</b> <b>earnings,</b> however in the post-adoption period there is no justification to reject the hypothesis of equality of medians.
