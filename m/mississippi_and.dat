5|$|As Earl tracked {{towards the}} northeastern Gulf of Mexico on September1, a {{hurricane}} warning was issued for coastal areas between Pascagoula, <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Cameron, Louisiana. Additionally, hurricane watches extended out to Destin, Florida and High Island, Texas from {{the edges of}} the warning respectively. Early the next day, a tropical storm warning was issued for areas between Pascagoula, <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Destin, Florida. In response to the eastward movement of the hurricane, the hurricane watch and warning was discontinued for areas west of Morgan City, Louisiana. Additionally, the hurricane warning was extended eastward to Destin, Florida, a tropical storm warning was issued east of Destin to Apalachicola, Florida, and a tropical storm watch was declared for areas between Morgan City and Cameron, Louisiana. Several hours later, the hurricane warning was again extended eastward to the mouth of the Suwannee River. All watches and warnings were discontinued for areas west of Pascagoula, <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> due to the asymmetrical structure of Hurricane Earl, a tropical storm warning was issued as far south as the Florida Keys. Continuing uncertainty in the track of Earl prompted the issuance of a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning for areas between Pascagoula, <b>Mississippi</b> <b>and</b> Grand Isle, Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. After Earl made landfall in Florida, all watches and warnings were discontinued in relation to the storm.|$|E
