5|$|As Carlson's {{battalion}} {{was ending}} its patrol, Shōji and his surviving troops were reaching friendly positions {{west of the}} Matanikau. In addition to the losses sustained from attacks by Carlson's raiders, a lack of food and tropical diseases felled <b>many</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Shōji's men. By the time Shōji's forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300men remained with the main body. When Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700-800 survivors were still with him. Survivors from Shōji's force later participated in the Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse in December 1942 and January 1943.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of Lynch's career, he has collaborated with several {{individuals}} on multiple occasions; his films frequently feature recurring cast members and principal production roles are often filled by a small pool of collaborators. The most prolific of Lynch's frequently used actors was Jack Nance, who first worked with Lynch on 1977's Eraserhead, and would appear in <b>many</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> Lynch's productions until Nance's death in 1996. Several individuals with whom Lynch would work on multiple occasions are fellow alumni of the AFI Conservatory, including sound designer Alan Splet, cinematographer Frederick Elmes and actor Catherine E.

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the LP record, Saint-Saëns's works were patchily {{represented}} on disc. The Record Guide (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of Danse Macabre, The Carnival of the Animals, the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works. In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, <b>many</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD. The 2008 Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets. Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs. A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns's mélodies was released in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Several old bronze statues {{that line}} the {{courtyard}} of the temple have a long history as war loot. They were originally Khmer statues, found at Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and were taken to Ayutthaya in 1431 by the Siamese. In 1564, the Burmese king Bayinnaung conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to Bago (Pegu). In 1599, King Razagri of Mrauk U invaded Bago and brought the statues to Mrauk U. Finally, Thado Minsaw took them to Amarapura in 1785. According to local belief, <b>many</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> these statues were brought from Arakan. However, King Thibaw melted many of them to cast cannons for fortification of his palace. Of the thirty statues Bayinnaung brought from Siam, only six remain today, and are displayed in the temple complex. They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities.|$|E

25|$|Sir Launfal {{returns to}} Caerleon. Soon a train of packhorses arrives, bearing {{all kinds of}} {{valuables}} for him. He uses this new wealth to perform many acts of charity. He also wins in a local tournament, thanks to the horse and banner given him by the lady. A knight of Lombardy, Sir Valentyne, challenges him (on the honour of his beloved lady) to come to Lombardy to fight with him. This section of Thomas Chestre's tale does not derive from Marie de France's Lanval or from the English Sir Landevale, but perhaps from another romance that is now lost. Launfal makes the voyage, and defeats Valentyne, thanks to his invisible servant Gyfre, who picks up his helmet and shield when Valentyne knocks them down. Launfal kills Valentyne and then has to kill <b>many</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the Lombard knights {{in order to get}} away.|$|E
25|$|KTM Komuter is an {{electrified}} {{commuter rail}} service first introduced in 1995, catering especially to commuters in Kuala Lumpur {{and the surrounding}} suburban areas. KTMB provides 248 commuter services daily, serving 45 stations along 175 route-kilometres. The network consists of two main sectors are Seremban Line and Port Klang Line running at 15 minutes frequency during peak hours and 20 minutes frequency during off-peak hours. The Tanjung Malim shuttle service & Rembau shuttle service running at Seremban Line both end stations operates at half-hour frequency. Komuter coaches are currently the most modern in the KTM fleet and are air-conditioned.

25|$|About 1469 Colon officiated as rabbi in Piove di Sacco, in Venetian {{territory}} {{and continued on}} to Mestre, near Venice. Subsequently he was rabbi at Bologna and Mantua and, {{according to a report}} in Gedaliah Ibn Yahya's Shalshelet ha-Qabbalah, became embroiled in a quarrel with Rabbi Judah Messer Leon, both being banished by the authorities. Thereupon he relocated to Pavia. At the same time Colon's decisions in civil as well as religious questions were sought from far and wide—from German cities, such as Ulm and Nuremberg, as well as from Constantinople. He wrote a commentary on the Pentateuch, and novellæ on the Talmud and on the legal codex of Moses of Coucy, the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol. His major legacy were, however, his responsa. These were collected after his death by his son-in-law Rabbi Gershon Treves, and by one of his pupils, Hiyya Meïr ben David and were published in Venice in 1519 by Daniel Bomberg. They were subsequently republished many times. In 1984, E. D. Pines published fifty new responsa from manuscript. <b>Many</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his responsa remain unpublished.|$|E
25|$|Based on Voyager observations, {{the total}} {{mass of the}} rings was {{estimated}} to be about 3×1019 kg. This is {{a small fraction of the}} total mass of Saturn (about 50ppb) and is just a little less than the moon Mimas. More recent observations and computer modeling based on Cassini observations show that this may be an underestimate due to clumping in the rings and the mass may be three times this figure. Although the largest gaps in the rings, such as the Cassini Division and Encke Gap, can be seen from Earth, both Voyager spacecraft discovered that the rings have an intricate structure of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets. This structure is thought to arise, in several different ways, from the gravitational pull of Saturn's many moons. Some gaps are cleared out by the passage of tiny moonlets such as Pan, <b>many</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> which may yet be discovered, and some ringlets seem to be maintained by the gravitational effects of small shepherd satellites (similar to Prometheus and Pandora's maintenance of the F ring). Other gaps arise from resonances between the orbital period of particles in the gap and that of a more massive moon further out; Mimas maintains the Cassini Division in this manner. Still more structure in the rings consists of spiral waves raised by the inner moons' periodic gravitational perturbations at less disruptive resonances.|$|E
25|$|In March 1787 Barkley {{anchored}} Imperial Eagle in Nootka Sound, a port {{commonly used}} by fur trading vessels. Frances Barkley {{became the first}} European woman, and Winée the first Hawaiian, or Kanaka, known to have visited the Pacific Northwest. Imperial Eagle was the largest ship to have ever entered Friendly Cove, the main anchorage in Nootka Sound. It {{was also the first}} fur trading vessel to arrive at Nootka Sound that year. As a result, Barkley was able to acquire all of the available furs. At Nootka, Dr. John Mackay was found living with the indigenous Nuu-chah-nulth. Mackey had been the surgeon of the fur trading brig Captain Cook, under Captain James Strange, who had left Mackay at Nootka in July 1786, with the intention that Mackay befriend the indigenous people, learn their customs, and collect sea otter pelts for trade when Strange returned. But Strange did not return. Mackay was overjoyed to join the crew of Imperial Eagle. Mackay taught Barkley much about the indigenous peoples and how to trade with them. He also provided valuable geographical information about the waters south of Nootka Sound, which gave Barkley an advantage over other traders such as James Colnett, who arrived shortly after Barkley. Barkley stayed at Nootka Sound for some time and acquired about 700 prime sea otter pelts and <b>many</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> inferior quality. Frances Barkley wrote about chief Maquinna. She was impressed with his management of the fur trade. Some time after Barkley's arrival, two more fur trading ships entered Nootka SoundPrince of Wales under James Colnett, and Princess Royal under Charles Duncan, both owned by the King George's Sound Company. To their chagrin they found that Barkley had already acquired all the furs available at Nootka Sound.|$|E
