25|$|As the Cumans {{ceased to}} have a state of their own, they were {{gradually}} absorbed into Eurasian populations (certain families in Hungary, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Turkey, Romania, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Tatars in Crimea). The Cumans in Dobruja were assimilated into Bulgarian and Romanian people. Traces of the Cumans can still be found in placenames stretching from China to Macedonia, such as the city of Kumanovo in the northeastern Republic of Macedonia; a Slavic village named Kumanichevo in the Kostur (Kastoria) district of Greece, which was changed to Lithia after Greece obtained this territory in the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest; Comăneşti in Romania; Kuman, a city in Xinjiang, China; Kuh-e Kumana, a mountain in Lorestān, Iran; the village of Koman in Iran; Kuman, {{a small town in}} Sistan Va Baluchestan, Iran; Polovtsy, a town in Smolenskaya Oblast', Russia; Polovtsy in Mahilyowskaya Volblasts', Belarus; the steppes north of the Caucasus Mountains, referred to as Kuban as well as the Kuban River; the village of Kumane in Serbia; the village of Kumanitsa, in the municipality of Ivanjica, Serbia; the municipality of Kuman in the Fier District, Fier County, southwestern Albania; Küman, a village and municipality in the Lerik Rayon of Azerbaijan; the town and district of Ulaş in the Sivas province of Turkey; Comana in Northern Dobruja (also Romania); the small village of Kumanite in Bulgaria; Kuman, a town in Qashqadaryo, Uzbekistan; Kuman-san, a mountain peak near Ch'unch'ŏn, Gangwon, South Korea; the town of Kumanlar in Ordu, Turkey; Debrecen in Hungary; the village of Bugac in Hungary, the counties of Bács-Kiskun and Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok as well as the cities Kiskunhalas and Kunszentmiklós in Hungary, the village of Kunmadaras in Greater Cumania, Hungary; and the town of Kumanov in Khmel'nyts'ka Oblast', Ukraine. The flower, Kumoniga (<b>melilot),</b> is also a relic of the Cumans. The Gagauz people are believed by some historians to be descendents of the Cumans; the name Qipcakli occurs as a modern Gagauz surname.

500|$|In {{conditions}} of high humidity, several species can form striking colored drops on the actively growing caps: red drops in H.peckii, H.diabolus, H.ferrugineum, and H.cruentum, yellow drops in H.caeruleum, and coffee-colored drops in H.mirabile. The common names of H.peckii reflect its appearance: [...] "strawberries and cream" [...] and [...] "bleeding tooth fungus". Some Hydnellum species have a mealy odor (e.g. H.mirabile and H.pineticola) similar to freshly ground flour.

Thus, {{he could not}} bear to hear the sound of his own steps, the grit of gravel; and therefore never willingly walked in the road, but in the grass, on mountains and in woods. His senses were acute, and he remarked that by night every dwelling-house gives out bad air, like a slaughter-house. He liked the pure fragrance of <b>melilot.</b> He honored certain plants with special regard, and, over all, the pond-lily,--then, the gentian, and the Mikania scandens, and [...] "life-everlasting," [...] and a bass-tree which he visited every year when it bloomed, in the middle of July. He thought the scent a more oracular inquisition than the sight,--more oracular and trustworthy. The scent, of course, reveals what is concealed from the other senses. By it he detected earthiness. He delighted in echoes, and said they were almost the only kind of kindred voices that he heard. He loved Nature so well, was so happy in her solitude, that he became very jealous of cities, and the sad work which their refinements and artifices made with man and his dwelling. The axe was always destroying his forest. [...] "Thank God," [...] he said, [...] "they cannot cut down the clouds!"

Two alternate recipes are attributed to Berytius. The first prescribes boiling 3 parts must and 1 part sea water down to two thirds. The other prescribes starting with 2 metretai white wine and mixing into it: 1 cup salt, 3 cups hepsetos, 1 cup vetch flour, 100 drachmai <b>melilot,</b> 16 drachmai apples, and 16 drachmai Celtic nard.|$|E
50|$|The main food {{plants are}} heathers, {{especially}} ling Calluna vulgaris and the females {{have been recorded}} travelling up to 1.5km from the nest to collect pollen to provision the cells.

Alternative pollen sources to Calluna vulgaris are mainly used once the pollen of that species starts to run low in late summer.|$|E
50|$|The {{scent of}} the roots of Meum has {{much in common with}} those of two other edible/medicinal umbellifers : Levisticum officinale and Angelica archangelica, while the {{aromatic}} flavour of Meum leaves is somewhat like <b>Melilot</b> (which owes its aroma of new-mown hay to coumarin) and is communicated to milk and butter when cows feed on the foliage in Spring. The curious name Baldmoney is said to be derived from the name of the god Baldr (Scandinavian mythology) - to whom the plant was dedicated. In German it is known as Bärwurz wort, feminine gender (die) for the plant and masculine gender (der) for a variety of Bavarian schnapps which is flavoured with its extract.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Preparation== Traditional {{recipes for}} Pelin wine use {{a mixture of}} dried absinthe flowers and absinthe stems (approximately 150-250g / hl). The exact {{proportions}} of dried flowers (which give the drink its signature flavour) and stems (which give the drink a more bitter taste) vary from producer to producer, meaning that different Pelin wines each have a unique taste. The wine and flower mixture must be fermented in a textile gauze bag for between five and seven days, with frequent tasting {{used to determine the}} exact amount of fermentation time. If the mixture is allowed to ferment for too long, it produces an unpleasant bitter taste. Various other ingredients can be added, including mint, yarrow, chamomile, <b>melilot,</b> sliced quince, apple (0.3-0.5 kg/hl), and crushed rosehips (20-100g/hl).|$|E

5000|$|In 1725, {{houndstooth}} {{was presented}} in the family dictionary, Dictionaire oeconomique, {{as part of a}} cure for madness. In that book, madness was viewed as [...] "a distemper, not only of the understanding, but also of the reason and memory, proceeding from a cold, which drys up everything it meets with that is humid in the brain." [...] To cure madness, Dictionaire oeconomique noted: [...] You must shave the head of the unhappy patient, and after that, apply to it a pidgeon, or a hen quite alive; or else bathe it with some brandy distilled with rosemary, elder, hounds tooth, and the roots of bugloss, or with the oyl of elder flowers: they rub their heads and wash their feet with a decoction of the flowers of camomile, <b>melilot,</b> balm gentle and laurel; they put into their noses the juice of comfrey, with either two or three spoonfuls of honey-water, broth, or white-wine, wherein wormwood and sage are infus'd or else they do for five and twenty days together, mix with their broth in the morning, halt a dram of the ashes of tortoise, and they put into the pot bugloss, borage, with a pinch of rosemary to season it.|$|E
5000|$|Much of the {{vegetation}} of Gugh is either wind-pruned, dry, waved maritime heath or dense gorse and bracken. The three dominant {{species on the}} heath are heather (Calluna vulgaris), bell heather (Erica cinerea) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). Immediately above the bar is a small area of dune grassland merging into maritime grassland around the coastal fringe. On the small dune system grows western clover (Trifolium occidentale), sea holly (Eryngium maritimum), sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias) and Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), wild thyme (Thymus polytrichus) and sea bindweed (Calystegia soldanella). The neck of the island between the two hills where the farm was located has an unusual flora. Amongst dense bracken is balm-leaved figwort (Scrophularia scorodonia), common here but not found elsewhere {{on the island and}} an unidentified yellow, cultivated rose. A second alien, Argentine dock (Rumex frutescens) grows {{on the edge of a}} sand pit which was originally intended to be a reservoir. The fields below the two houses were, before 1933, fertilised with [...] "shoddy" [...] - a high nitrate manure derived from the woollen industry. Within these fields can be found viper’s-bugloss (Echium vulgare), common <b>melilot</b> (Melilotus officinalis) and wild mignonette (Reseda lutea). All three are thought to be imported arable weeds. In the 1960s the [...] "neck" [...] was a closely cropped sward of grass but after myxomatosis the area became overgrown with bracken and bramble.|$|E
