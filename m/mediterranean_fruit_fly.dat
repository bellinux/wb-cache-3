500|$|In {{response}} to a <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> (also known as “Medfly”) outbreak, officials from the Florida Department of Agriculture sprayed pesticides (primarily malathion) and bait over five counties during {{the spring and summer}} of 1998. [...] Scientists from the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences stated that malathion was being sprayed in a manner that did not pose a significant risk to public health. [...] During the eradication effort, the Florida Department of Health investigated 230 cases of illness that were attributed to the pesticide. [...] Officials from the Florida Department of Health and the SENSOR-Pesticides program published an article in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) that described these case reports and recommended alternative methods for Medfly control, including exclusion activities at ports of entry to prevent importation, more rapid detection through increased sentinel trapping densities, and the release of sterile male flies to interrupt the reproductive cycle.

A key methodological concept is the time evolution of mean functions and eigenfunctions. This methodology is applied to the event history of calling behavior of male medflies.

Although a greater fraction of females maintained in all-female (virgin) cages survived to older ages, the life expectancy of the surviving virgins was less than the life expectancy of surviving non-virgins at older ages. This was due to a mortality crossover where virgin flies experience lower mor-tality than mated flies from eclosion to Day 20 but higher mortality thereafter.

40|$|Scientific note. A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of trimedlure (TML) bait field duration on recovery of sterile male <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>flies,</b> Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) under west central Florida conditions. Jackson traps baited with TML soft plugs were placed in residential (N = 80) and industrial (N = 40) settings, then monitored weekly. Traps were monitored to determine if TML bait at three- or six- week field duration had a greater attractiveness towards C. capitata. In all but one instance, traps with three-week field duration achieved higher C. capitata yield than traps baited in the field for six weeks. However, no significant difference (P > 0. 05) was found in trap yield as a result of bait age. Given these data, maintaining Jackson traps on six-week duration bait is more cost effective with no significant recovery loss due to attractiveness to sterile release C. capitata in a residential setting...|$|R

Antibiotics were used to suppress the gut bacterial community and mortality rates were compared between antibiotic-treated and non-treated flies when either nutritionally stressed (maintained on sugar) or provided with a full diet. These tests revealed that eliminating the gut bacterial population prolonged longevity, but only when flies were nutritionally stressed, indicating that the effect of bacteria on lifespan was diet dependent.

40|$|Female <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>flies</b> (Ceratitis capitata) oviposit in fruits, {{within which}} the larvae develop. This {{development}} is associated with rapid deterioration of the fruit, and frequently with invasion by secondary pests. Most research on the associations between medflies and microorganisms {{has focused on the}} bacteria inhabiting the digestive system of the adult fly, while the role of the fruit in mediating, amplifying or regulating the <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> microflora has been largely neglected. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that the host fruit plays a role in perpetuating the fly-associated bacterial community. Using direct and cultured-based approaches, we show that this community is composed in its very large majority of diazotrophic and pectinolytic Enterobacteriaceae. Our data suggest that this fly-associated enterobacterial community is vertically transmitted from the female parent to its offspring. During oviposition, bacteria are transferred to the fruit, establish and proliferate within it, causing its decay. These results show that the host fruit is indeed a central partner in the fruit fly–bacterial interaction as these transmitted bacteria are amplified by the fruit, and subsequently maintained throughout the fly’s life. This enterobacterial community may contribute to the fly’s nitrogen and carbon metabolism, affecting its development and ultimately, fitness...|$|R
