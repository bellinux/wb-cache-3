5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt <b>my</b> <b>health</b> would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E
25|$|There are {{instances}} where {{the use of}} a PHR would be beneficial to patients and may, therefore, override privacy concerns. Stage 1 of meaningful use of certified EHR systems requires that practices provide at least 50 percent of their patients with a copy of their health records upon request. While this can be accomplished through a patient portal, this function can also be part of a larger system such as Kaiser Permanente's <b>My</b> <b>Health</b> Manager—a PHR that is integrated into the health system's patient portal. By June 2012, 3.9 million Kaiser members were enrolled in this program. For the first half of 2012, members viewed 2.5 million lab results, sent 1 million e-mails to physicians, and scheduled 230,000 appointments monthly, demonstrating ease of use and convenience.|$|E
25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest <b>my</b> <b>health</b> should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

500|$|Turner {{stated that}} she was on a [...] "downhill slide" [...] for much of the 1970s, {{drinking}} heavily, not eating, missing performances, and weighing only 95 pounds. [...] "I was a sipper but I never got high or drunk," [...] Turner said in a 1982 interview. [...] "It was much more insidious. It was starting to affect my liver and <b>my</b> <b>health...</b> I was very sick." [...] She decided to stop drinking, and began eating all organic food; she would credit herbalism as helping her overcome her alcoholism. Turner claimed she was chaste for the remainder of her life, after her final divorce in 1969 and had no desire to marry again.|$|E

500|$|By 1958, Hand was {{suffering}} from intense pain in his back and faced difficulty in walking. [...] "I can just manage, with not infrequent pauses, to walk {{about a third of}} a mile," [...] he wrote to Felix Frankfurter. [...] "My feet get very numb and my back painful. The truth is that 86 is too long." [...] Soon, he was obliged to use crutches, but he remained mentally sharp and continued to hear cases. In 1960, he worked briefly on President Dwight Eisenhower's [...] "Commission on National Goals", but he resigned because [...] "it involved more work than in the present state of <b>my</b> <b>health</b> I care to add to the judicial work that I am still trying to do".|$|E
500|$|James Jesse Strang {{was born}} March 21, 1813, in Scipio, Cayuga County, New York. He {{was the second}} of three children, and his parents had a good {{reputation}} in their community. [...] James' mother was very tender with him {{as a consequence of}} delicate health, yet she required him to render an account of all his actions and words while absent from her. [...] In a brief autobiography he wrote in 1855, Strang reported that he had attended grade school until age twelve, but that [...] "the terms were usually short, the teachers inexperienced and ill qualified to teach, and <b>my</b> <b>health</b> such as to preclude attentive study or steady attendance." [...] He estimated that his time in a classroom during those years totaled six months.|$|E
500|$|Early {{during her}} student days in Troy, Stanton remembers being {{strongly}} influenced by Charles Grandison Finney, an evangelical preacher and central figure in the revivalist movement. His influence, combined with the Calvinistic Presbyterianism of her childhood, caused her great unease. After hearing Finney speak, Stanton became terrified {{at the possibility of}} her own damnation: [...] "Fear of judgment seized my soul. Visions of the lost haunted my dreams. Mental anguish prostrated <b>my</b> <b>health.</b> Dethronement of my reason was apprehended by my friends." [...] Stanton credits her father and brother-in-law, Edward Bayard, with convincing her to ignore Finney's warnings. She further credits their taking her on a rejuvenating trip to Niagara Falls with restoring her reason and sense of balance. She never returned to organized Christianity and, after this experience, always maintained that logic and a humane sense of ethics were the best guides to both thought and behavior.|$|E

500|$|During {{her final}} years, Dworkin {{suffered}} fragile health, and she revealed {{in her last}} column for the Guardian {{that she had been}} weakened and nearly crippled {{for the past several years}} by severe osteoarthritis in the knees. Shortly after returning from Paris in 1999, she had been hospitalized with a high fever and blood clots in her legs. A few months after being released from the hospital, she became increasingly unable to bend her knees, and underwent surgery to replace her knees with titanium and plastic prosthetics. She wrote, [...] "The doctor who knows me best says that osteoarthritis begins long before it cripples [...] in my case, possibly from homelessness, or sexual abuse, or beatings on my legs, or my weight. John, my partner, blames Scapegoat, a study of Jewish identity and women's liberation that took me nine years to write; it is, he says, the book that stole <b>my</b> <b>health.</b> I blame the drug-rape that I experienced in 1999 in Paris." ...|$|E
500|$|Hańska {{lived with}} Balzac's mother {{for a time}} after his death, in the house he had {{spent so much time}} and expense furnishing. The elder Mme. Balzac moved in with a friend after several months, and Hańska {{approached}} the remains of her late husband's writing. Several works had been left incomplete, and publishers inquired about releasing a final edition of his grand collection La Comédie humaine. Hańska sponsored new editions of his works and was involved in editing some of them, even adding occasional content. Balzac's debt, meanwhile, still exceeded 200,000 francs, which Hańska paid while also providing for his mother's living expenses. One of her letters at the time gives voice to her frustrations: [...] "In nursing my husband's incurable malady I ruined <b>my</b> <b>health,</b> just as I have ruined my private fortune in accepting the inheritance of debts and embarrassments which he left me." [...] Anna and Jerzy moved into a nearby house in Paris.|$|E
2500|$|July 26 – Fidel Castro {{was present}} at the 53rd anniversary {{celebrations}} of the assault on Moncada Barracks.
