5|$|During 1978 and 1979, for {{the album}}'s tenth anniversary, EMI reissued the album pressed on limited edition white vinyl in several countries. In 1981, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) issued a unique half-speed master {{variation}} of the album using the sound from the original <b>master</b> <b>recording.</b> The discs were pressed on high-quality virgin vinyl.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero Smash Hits (titled Guitar Hero: Greatest Hits in Europe and Australia) was {{released}} in June 2009. It features full-band versions of 48 songs from earlier Guitar Hero games that only used the guitar controller. Unlike the previous versions, each of the songs {{is based on a}} <b>master</b> <b>recording</b> that includes some live tracks. The game follows a similar model as Guitar Hero: Metallica, and was developed by Neversoft and Beenox Studios for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and Wii.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} the single's release, the Smiths {{recorded}} the song again during aborted sessions for their debut album with producer Troy Tate. This version was recorded a tone lower than the original in the key of F# minor, and features a shorter introduction. The Smiths recorded the song again with producer John Porter in October at Manchester's Pluto Studios. Morrissey rejected {{this version of the}} song. Due to impending deadlines, the version that ultimately appeared on the band's first album The Smiths was a remix of the original <b>master</b> <b>recording</b> from the Strawberry Studios session. For this version, Porter increased the separation between Marr's guitar tracks and Morrissey's vocals, emphasised drummer Mike Joyce's drum beat, pushed Rourke's bass back in the mix, and created a more dramatic opening and conclusion to the song.|$|E

500|$|One final {{session was}} held on August 4, again at Studio A. Most of the session was devoted to {{completing}} [...] "Desolation Row". Johnston has related that Nashville musician Charlie McCoy was visiting New York, and he invited McCoy to play guitar at the session. According to some sources, seven takes of [...] "Desolation Row" [...] were recorded, and takes six and seven were spliced together for the <b>master</b> <b>recording.</b>|$|E
500|$|The <b>master</b> <b>recording</b> of [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] was {{recorded}} on January 24 and 25, 1966, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, with record producer Allen Stanton guiding the band through the recording process. [...] John Einarson {{has noted that}} the influence of Coltrane's saxophone playing and, in particular, his song [...] "India" [...] from the Impressions album, can be clearly heard in [...] "Eight Miles High"—most noticeably in McGuinn's recurring twelve-string guitar solo. [...] In addition to this striking guitar motif, the song is also highlighted by Chris Hillman's driving and hypnotic bass line, Crosby's chunky rhythm guitar playing and the band's ethereal harmonies.|$|E
500|$|Ecstasys {{recording}} {{was plagued}} by technical and financial errors, which impacted the eventual release of the album. The mastering process was affected by the album's engineer Steve Nunn, who mislaid the source material of the final mix prior to its transfer to the <b>master</b> <b>recording.</b> Shields subsequently [...] "brought an independent engineer in to the studios to point out what was wrong" [...] but Lazy Records refused to invest further finances into the album's recording process. As a result, [...] "much of what was originally the sound of Ecstacy [...] was lost, {{and much of the}} tone was dulled" [...] and the album [...] "showed a group who appeared to have run out of money half way through recording".|$|E

500|$|On June 6, 2008, {{the band}} {{released}} a blog on MTV's Headbangers Ball website. The blog addressed numerous disappointments the band had with Trustkill Records. These disappointments included unpaid royalties, {{lack of funding}} for Declaration, and an unapproved re-release of their 2006 album The Truth. Despite Trustkill's website saying that the new album, Declaration would be released August 2008, the band stated {{that they did not}} intend to hand over the <b>master</b> <b>recording</b> of the album, until they were paid the minimum fees required to pay back producer Devin Townsend, the band's management and Schieppati's father who loaned the band money for recording. In a follow-up blog on their MySpace page, Bleeding Through stated that [...] "Trustkill Records delivered the funds necessary to complete the album and to compensate everyone who had loaned [...] cash." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} {{was completed}} Kannberg was tasked with releasing the music himself, as Malkmus {{had left on}} a trip to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Kannberg designed the cover of the EP and sent copies to various independent labels, distributors, and zines. He recalled [...] "I {{had no idea how to}} do it. I'd send off these little notes to my favorite labels like SST and Twin Tone and ask, 'How do I do this?'" [...] A representative from SST recommended that Kannberg use Erica Records, a Los Angeles 7" [...] manufacturer. Erica Records became the manufacturer of Slay Tracks; however, Kannberg was unhappy with the <b>master</b> <b>recording</b> produced by the company: [...] "It sounds like it sounds now—it's just a mess—but being poor and not really caring I said, 'Okay, that's cool, if it sounds like that–whatever.'" [...] 1000 copies of Slay Tracks were pressed, and the first 50 included a green dinosaur stamp on the label. The EP was distributed on Kannberg's own Treble Kicker Records in the United States and England, although Malkmus came across a copy in a record store while visiting Austria.|$|E
500|$|Music {{supervisor}} Ivan Pavlovich said [...] " [...] to {{pick the}} songs that make New York today what it is, but make sure they won't feel dated {{by the time the}} game comes out." [...] The developers contacted over 2,000 people in order to obtain recording and publishing rights. They even hired a private investigator to locate the relatives of late Skatt Bros. member Sean Delaney to license the band's song [...] "Walk the Night". Citing sources close to the deals, Billboard reported that Rockstar paid as much as $5,000 per composition and another $5,000 per <b>master</b> <b>recording</b> per track. Developers originally considered letting players purchase music by going to an in-game record shop and for Niko to have an MP3 player, but both ideas were cut. DJ Green Lantern produced tracks exclusively for the game's hip-hop radio station The Beat 102.7. Record label owner and record producer Bobby Konders, who hosts the in-game radio station Massive B Soundsystem 96.9, went through the extra effort of flying to Jamaica to get dancehall artists to re-record tracks to make references to the boroughs of Liberty City.|$|E

500|$|In October 1967, {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the second Jimi Hendrix Experience album [...] began at Olympic Studios in London. [...] On October 25, after recording the strongly R [...] "Wait Until Tomorrow", the Experience recorded an instrumental version of [...] "Little Wing". [...] It followed the same chord progression as the later <b>master</b> <b>recording,</b> but had a more forceful rock feel. After another take in the same vein, Chandler called for a different approach. [...] Recording engineer Eddie Kramer explained, [...] "Chas knew right away what was needed. [...] He had Jimi slow the tempo down and try it again". [...] After the basic track was completed, Hendrix and Kramer recorded overdubs on October 28, 1967. [...] For his recordings, Hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve the optimal tone for his guitar tracks. [...] For his rhythm guitar, he had set his pickup selector to a nonstandard position between the neck and middle settings to achieve a [...] "hollow" [...] tone, sometimes mistakenly referred to as [...] "out-of-phase". [...] However, for the lead, Kramer later fed the guitar signal through a makeshift Leslie speaker, which was normally used for electric organs. By rotating the sound, Leslie speakers produce vibrato- and tremolo-like effects, i.e., a pulsing or quivering addition to the sound (Hendrix later popularized {{the use of the}} Univibe phase shifter effects pedal, which can be set to get a roughly similar effect). [...] Next, Hendrix added a straight ("dry, without any effects") glockenspiel to underscore his vocal and guitar. [...] According to Kramer, [...] "Jimi always kept an eye out for odd instruments that would be lying about the studio" [...] and found the glockenspiel in Studio A. [...] Last to be recorded was his vocal, which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound. [...] These have been variously described as artificial double tracking (ADT), phasing, Pultec filter equalization, and processing with a Leslie speaker.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero {{and other}} rock music-based games work with record {{companies}} to license each song for its use, costing a per-song average of $25,000 {{for the rights}} to use a <b>master</b> <b>recording</b> and $10,000 {{for the rights to}} make a cover. [...] The impact of Guitar Hero and Rock Band has caused record companies to create dedicated video game liaisons to handle the inclusions of songs in these games. The record and game companies work together to tie in releases of downloadable content with album releases and concert appearances, such as by the simultaneous release of Metallica's Death Magnetic album and as playable Guitar Hero tracks. [...] However, some in the music industry have raised concerns that the music labels are not receiving fair compensation considering the success of the games. [...] Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman and chief executive for Warner Music Group, stated that [...] "The amount being paid to the industry, even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control, is far too small." [...] Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs at Activision, believes that the increase in popularity of the game series has led more people, including musicians and music labels, to {{want to be part of}} the success: [...] "The number of people interested in being associated with the game is probably a thousand times more than we can get into the game." [...] Activision CEO Robert Kotick has stated, in response to the record company's claims, that the impact that the Guitar Hero games have caused game developers and publishers to question if they [...] "should be paying any money at all and whether it should be the reverse." [...] Mötley Crüe manager Allen Kovac noted that artists make a larger share of the sale of each downloaded game song compared to iTunes, and that bands that own their own master recordings earn even a larger percentage from music licensing rights. [...] Michael Pachter, an industry analyst for Wedbush Morgan, noted that Guitar Hero is not dependent on a single record label, as there is nearly a 2000-year supply of songs available at the current rate of content releases, and a full music industry denial to the game series could lead to anti-trust measures. [...] Patcher also contrasted Bronfman's view, stating that users are not buying the games for the songs, but for the game, with each song providing its own challenge. [...] However, analysis believe that Activision's attitude on music licensing may have influenced the decision of Apple Corps, Ltd. to give the lucrative licensing agreement for The Beatles' music to MTV Games, who were more flexible in their negotiations.|$|E
