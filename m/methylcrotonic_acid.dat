Consequently, the substance was named sabadillic or cevadic acid. It was later found to be identical with Frankland and Duppa's <b>methylcrotonic</b> <b>acid</b> (1865). In 1870 Geuther and Fr√∂hlich prepared an acid from croton oil to which they gave the name tiglic acid (or tiglinic acid) after (Croton) tiglium (Linn.), specific name of the croton oil plant. The compound was shown to be identical with the previously described methyl-crotonic acid.|$|E
