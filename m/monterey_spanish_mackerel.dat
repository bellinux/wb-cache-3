40|$|The genetic {{homogeneity}} of the <b>Monterey</b> <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> Scomberomorus concolor {{population in the}} Gulf of California was confirmed using nine nuclear microsatellite loci in combination with mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences. Samples were collected from the upper and central Gulf areas, representing the two main biogeographical regions of the Gulf. The analyses support {{the existence of a}} single panmictic population of S. concolor inhabiting the Gulf of California which in terms of fishery management represents a single genetic stock. Additionally, the contemporary effective population size estimated for the S. concolor population (Ne = 3056. 9) was high and similar to another pelagic species. The gene flow seems to be bidirectional between the upper and central Gulf, which coincides with the seasonal movements between both regions related to spawning and feeding activities. A population expansion event was detected, which agrees with a colonization-expansion hypothesis of the S. concolor population in the Gulf...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To utilize low-value fish, <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein was hydrolyzed using alcalase for {{production}} of antioxidant peptide. The antioxidant activities of antioxidant peptide from <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein were evaluated. Results: The radical-scavenging properties on hydroxyl and superoxide of protein hydrolysates were 53. 11 % and 23. 1 %. And their reducing power was increased with the peptide {{content of the}} hydrolysates. The hydrolysates significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation in linoleic acid emulsion system, and effectively inhibit autoxidation of linoleic acid; and the inhibition ability increased with the increasing of peptide content in hydrolysates. The hydrolysates inhibited the activity of LOX to a certain extent. Conclusion: The hydrolysates from <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> protein exhibited high antioxidative activity...|$|R

50|$|Japanese <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> is an {{important}} species for fisheries in east Asia. South Korea is the country reporting the biggest annual catches, followed by Japan and Taiwan. These added to a relatively modest total catch of about 56,000 tonnes in 2009. However, China reports very large catches of unidentified seerfish (Scomberomorus spp., fluctuating around 400,000 tonnes in 2000-2009), without reporting catches of any single Scomberomorus species. It is likely that these catches include {{a significant proportion of}} Japanese <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel.</b>|$|R
40|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} (Tursiops truncatus) reduce {{catches of}} <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus maculatus) when {{they interact with}} coastal gillnets off Hatteras, North Carolina. Acoustic alarms, or pingers, are one means of potentially reducing these adverse interactions. We measured the effect of Save Wave alarms on the incidence of dolphin depredation and target fish catches. The study had two goals: (1) to quantify the effect of alarms on target species catch and (2) to quantify the effect of alarms on dolphin depredation. Fieldwork was conducted off Hatteras during June and August 2004. During this period, we attached alarms to 118 <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> gillnet sets (63 active and 55 control). All catches were standardized for effort by incorporating measures of net length and soak duration. We collected data on total catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> CPUE, counts of fish discards, and evidence of depredation. There {{was no difference in}} total CPUE (p = 0. 25) or <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> CPUE (p = 0. 94) between active and control sets. Net position (inshore, middle, offshore) also had no effect on total CPUE (p = 0. 48) or <b>Spanish</b> <b>mackerel</b> CPUE (p = 0. 35). We observed several dolphins interacting with nets with active alarms, but did not observe a sufficient amount of dolphin depredation to quantify their response to the Save Wave alarms. These results suggest that Save Wave alarms do not affect fish catches. Fieldwork for this project will continue during the summer of 2005 {{to determine whether or not}} the alarms reduce dolphin depredation...|$|R
