5|$|After {{leaving the}} British Army in 1968, Mitchell {{embarked}} on a career in politics. He was elected as a Member of the British Parliament in 1970 but stood down at the February 1974 general election. After subsequent involvement in a failed business venture he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> until 1989 as a military consultant.|$|E
5|$|William F. Wayman {{designed}} the structure with Victor Batchelar building the home, while Charles F. Walters {{designed the}} grounds. All the wood was logged by Richard Rice, who <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> as a logging contractor. He also milled the wood. The home {{was designed to}} allow the basement {{to serve as a}} museum for the Rices' collections.|$|E
5|$|Claiborne {{was born}} the county of Kent in England in 1600 to Thomas Clayborn, an {{alderman}} and lord mayor from King's Lynn, Norfolk, who <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> as a small-scale businessman involved {{in a variety of}} industries, including the salt and fish trades, and Sarah Smith, the daughter of a London brewer. The family name was spelled alternately as Cleburn, Cleyborne, or Claiborne. William Claiborne, who was baptized in 1600, was the younger of two sons. The family's business was not profitable enough to make it rich, and so Claiborne's older brother was apprenticed in London, becoming a merchant involved in hosiery and, eventually, the tobacco trade.|$|E

50|$|The elder Cottereau, {{like his}} father before him, <b>made</b> <b>his</b> family's <b>living</b> by {{criss-crossing}} the wooded regions of western France, from the forest between Mondevert and Le Pertre to the forest of Concise, felling trees, stacking and seasoning the timber, and making wooden shoes, which he sold in the villages of Mayenne.|$|R
50|$|Although {{he would}} {{eventually}} sell more than 20 novels, Tucker <b>made</b> <b>his</b> principal <b>living</b> {{as a movie}} projectionist and theater electrician, starting as a prop man at the Majestic Theater in Bloomington, Illinois. He served as President of Local 193 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes (IATSE), and retired as a projectionist in 1972.|$|R
5|$|When World War I {{forced the}} closure of all European opera houses, Paoli <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> as a {{professional}} boxer. Unfortunately, he also lost his singing voice during this period. After the War ended, following medical advice and performing vocal exercises, Paoli regained his voice {{and returned to the}} international stage, in all the glory of days past. He performed in Europe, North and South America, and finally settled with his sister Amalia in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she had opened a singing school.|$|E
5|$|Left {{without any}} family, Morales headed for Antofagasta, then a port town in Bolivia that was booming {{due to the}} nitrate mines in the area. She {{travelled}} there as a steerage passenger, with a ticket she bought by selling nearly all of her possessions. While working there, she met Santiago Pizarro, a Chilean in his 30s who <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> in a Bolivian military band, and married him in mid-1878, aged 13. He was tried and executed on 21 September of that year for killing a Bolivian soldier in a drunken brawl. She found his body dumped {{by the side of}} the railway tracks and took a gold ring from his finger, which she wore for the rest of her life. Pizarro's execution was widely protested by the mostly Chilean population of Antofagasta, which resented what was seen as an unjust Bolivian government.|$|E
5|$|Scottish estate {{houses were}} {{increasingly}} adorned with paintings, including portraits, landscapes and later classical, genre and historical paintings. Thomas Warrender (fl. 1673–1713) <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> {{as a house}} decorator, working closely with architects, including William Adam. He may have trained James Norie (1684–1757), who with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766) also worked with the Adams, painting the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch scenes. They tutored many artists and have been credited with {{the inception of the}} tradition of Scottish landscape painting that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century. The painters Allan Ramsay (1713–84), Gavin Hamilton (1723–98), the brothers John (1744–68/9) and Alexander Runciman (1736–85), Jacob More (1740–93) and David Allan (1744–96), mostly began {{in the tradition of the}} Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland. Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was the most significant artist of the eighteenth century to pursue his entire career in Scotland, and from this point Scottish painters would be able to be professionals in their homeland, often supplying the nobility and lairds with works to fill the walls of their houses.|$|E

50|$|The want of interest, amounting even to hostility, {{with which}} Platen's {{enthusiasm for the}} purity and dignity of poetry was {{received}} in many literary circles in Germany increased the poet's indignation and disgust. In 1826 he visited Italy, which he henceforth <b>made</b> <b>his</b> home, <b>living</b> at Florence, Rome and Naples. His means were slender, but, though frequently necessitous, he felt happy in the life he had chosen, that of a wandering rhapsodist.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{felt his}} face grow a trifle hot with anger. The Tyee had <b>made</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>living,</b> and, since {{anything}} she might bring {{in excess of}} the loan on her would belong to him, it did not seem fitting that she should be flung in this casual fashion on the hands of palpably indifferent purchasers. The result of that sale was of vital interest to him and Thomas Wheelock, and he glanced inquiringly at Jordan.|$|R
5|$|Many Scottish {{painters}} {{of the early}} part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans. Roderick Chalmers' (fl. 1709–30) painting The Edinburgh Trades (1720) shows the artist himself, perhaps ironically, among the glaziers, wrights and masons of the burgh. Thomas Warrender (fl. 1673–1713) produced the Allegorical Still Life (after 1708), of a letter board that seems to be a commentary on the union of 1707, but he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> as a house decorator, working closely with architects, including William Adam. He may have trained James Norie (1684–1757), who with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes.

Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland, born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786.|$|E
25|$|In May 1814 Birney {{returned}} to his hometown and took up {{the practice of law}} there, becoming the acting attorney for the local bank. He handled both civil and criminal lawsuits in Danville and other outlying counties of Kentucky. The economy of Kentucky was rather poor at this time, as the War of 1812 had caused a schism in trade within the state. Having trouble making ends meet, Birney <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> at this time primarily as a claims adjuster.|$|E
25|$|Proenneke's father, William Christian Proenneke, {{served in}} World War I and later <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> as a well driller. His mother, Laura (née Bonn) was a homemaker. His parents married in late 1909, or early 1910, and had three daughters and three sons: Robert, Helen, Lorene, Richard (Dick), Florence, and Raymond (Jake). The year of Richard's birth is often given as 1917, but social {{security}} and census records have him born in Primrose, Harrison Township, Lee County, Iowa, on May 4, 1916.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the age of}} 16, he {{was working}} as a {{professional}} musician on both the guitar and clarinet, but then concentrated on the latter instrument. As his family frowned on music being a person's sole trade, Picou trained and worked as a tinsmith, including putting the copper sheeting on church steeples. Soon Picou was so much in demand as a clarinetist that he <b>made</b> most of <b>his</b> <b>living</b> from music.|$|R
50|$|Vaughan was a {{prisoner}} allegedly as late as 1659, although he was reported on as a potential Royalist activist in Carmarthenshire in 1658, and had some role in the 1659 elections in Carmathen. He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> will when <b>living</b> at Derwydd on 27 November 1660 and was dead before a probate inventory of <b>his</b> estate was <b>made</b> on 5 January 1661, prior to proof of his will at Carmarthen on 22 January.|$|R
50|$|Christian Adolph Klotz {{was then}} {{able to secure}} him the chair in biblical antiquities at the University of Erfurt. As the post was unpaid and Bahrdt was now married, he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> actual <b>living</b> as an inn-keeper and from private tutoring. Once he {{completed}} his doctorate of theology at Erlangen, {{he was able to}} persuade the faculty at Erfurt to appoint him professor designate of theology and began reading lectures. His orthodoxy had by this time completely vanished: Bahrdt was now an extreme rationalist and determined to popularize the position. He was not dismissed on this account, however, but left Erfurt in 1771 on account of his debts and the personal and professional quarrels he had become embroiled in with his colleagues.|$|R
25|$|At one time, {{living in}} Paris, Wold <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> busking, {{mostly on the}} metro. After moving to Norway in 2001, Wold {{released}} his first album, entitled Cheap, recorded with The Level Devils as his rhythm section, with Jo Husmo on stand-up bass and Kai Christoffersen on drums. His debut solo album, Dog House Music was released by Bronzerat Records on November 26, 2006, after he was championed by an old friend, Joe Cushley, DJ on the Balling The Jack blues show on London radio station Resonance FM.|$|E
25|$|In November 1951, he met {{the graphic}} artist Gisèle de Lestrange, in Paris. He sent her many love letters, {{influenced}} by Franz Kafka's correspondence with Milena Jesenska and Felice Bauer. They married on December 21, 1952, despite the opposition of her aristocratic family. During the following 18 years they wrote over 700 letters; amongst the active correspondents of Celan were Hermann Lenz and his wife, Hanne. He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> as a translator and lecturer in German at the École Normale Supérieure. He {{was a close friend}} of Nelly Sachs, who later won the Nobel Prize for literature.|$|E
25|$|Sima Qian states Gongsun's {{background}} {{as that of}} a prison officer, who being dismissed, <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> as a farmhand tending pigs. Sima characterizes Gong (like Dong Zhongshu) as specializing in the Spring and Autumn Annals, but with a bent toward the Gongyang Zhuan commentaries as a disciple of Huwu Zidu. However, neither text is referenced in any of Gongsun's documents, and his actions don't seem to reflect the Gongyang. His family being poor, he did not learn much of the Annals until he was forty, and the Shiji considers his ability secondary to that of Dong Zhongshu.|$|E
50|$|Lawyer Leonard Bradley visits his client, George Hallas, a man {{sentenced to}} death by lethal {{injection}} {{for the murder of}} a young boy, in prison. Hallas will be executed next morning, despite all Bradley’s attempts to prevent it, but so far has never given a statement for why he committed this brutal act. Now, however, he finally feels like talking about what he calls “the bad little kid”; a six or seven-year-old, rather pudgy boy with orange hair, green eyes and a beanie, that <b>made</b> <b>his</b> life a <b>living</b> hell for years.|$|R
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2002, Bajević {{returned}} to AEK. Fans were bitterly divided among those who accepted him and those who couldn't forgive his defection to Olympiacos. The latter <b>made</b> <b>his</b> life a <b>living</b> hell. In the 2002–03 Champions League, AEK became {{the first and only}} team to collect six ties out of six games in the group phase and ended up at third position. A notable match was the 3–3 draw against reigning European champions Real Madrid at the Nikos Goumas Stadium and another 2–2 draw against Real Madrid coming back from 2–0 down at the Bernabeu in Madrid.|$|R

25|$|Protagoras {{was born}} in Abdera, Thrace, {{opposite}} the island of Thasos (today part of the Xanthi regional unit). According to Aulus Gellius, he originally <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> as a porter, but one day he was seen by the philosopher Democritus carrying a load of small pieces of wood he had tied with a short cord. Democritus realized that Protagoras had tied the load together with such perfect geometric accuracy {{that he must be}} a mathematical prodigy. Democritus promptly took him into his own household and taught him philosophy. Protagoras became well known in Athens and even became a friend of Pericles.|$|E
25|$|When Neo-Classicism {{started to}} go into decline by the 1830s, genre and {{portrait}} painting became the focus for the Realist and Romantic artistic revolutions. Many of the great artists of that period included still life in their body of work. The still-life paintings of Francisco Goya, Gustave Courbet, and Eugène Delacroix convey a strong emotional current, and are less concerned with exactitude and more interested in mood. Though patterned on the earlier still-life subjects of Chardin, Édouard Manet’s still-life paintings are strongly tonal and clearly headed toward Impressionism. Henri Fantin-Latour, using a more traditional technique, was famous for his exquisite flower paintings and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> almost exclusively painting still life for collectors.|$|E
25|$|The Bell Witch or Bell Witch Haunting is {{a legend}} from Southern folklore, {{centered}} on the 19th-century Bell family of Adams, Tennessee. John Bell Sr., who <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> as a farmer, resided with his family along the Red River in northwest Robertson County in an area currently within the town of Adams. According to legend, from 1817-1821, his family and the local area came under attack by an invisible entity subsequently described as a witch. The entity was able to speak, affect the physical environment and change forms. Some accounts record the spirit with the capability to be {{in more than one}} place at a time, cross distances with rapid speed and the power of prophecy.|$|E
5000|$|The Observer's editor Donald Horne {{fired him}} in 1958 and {{replaced}} {{him with the}} young Robert Hughes. Hughes told the story in his 2007 Memoir and described Hesling as 'an elderly immigrant Yorkshireman … an artist who <b>made</b> <b>his</b> basic <b>living</b> painting garish enamel tea trays’. Hughes understood Hesling was fired because of his critical review of a Blake exhibition he hadn’t seen. But it seems that Horne was desperate {{to get rid of}} Hesling because he complained about Horne's low pay and he had a reputation for being 'derriere-garde rather than avant-garde'. [...] There is a postscipt to Hughes’ story which Diana Wyndham mentions in Norman Haire and the Study of Sex: in a personal communication Peter Coleman told her he was there and that Hughes’ account was not true: the newspaper proprietor was a friend of the Hughes family and was determined to give Robert a job.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the late}} 1970s he had <b>made</b> most of <b>his</b> <b>living</b> on the live circuit, touring in Europe, North America and the Far East, but in 1981 he {{returned}} to television with Jake Thackray and Songs, a six-part series on BBC2 featuring Thackray and guests, including Richard and Linda Thompson and Ralph McTell, performing {{in a variety of}} venues. An album of the same name, recorded live at the Stables Theatre, Wavendon, Milton Keynes, as part of the recordings for the TV show, followed in 1983.

5000|$|Niels Henrik Abel ( [...] ; 5 August 1802 - 6 April 1829) was a Norwegian {{mathematician}} {{who made}} pioneering contributions {{in a variety}} of fields. His most famous single result is the first complete proof demonstrating the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation in radicals. This question was one of the outstanding open problems of his day, and had been unresolved for 250 years. He was also an innovator in the field of elliptic functions, discoverer of Abelian functions. Despite his achievements, Abel was largely unrecognized during <b>his</b> lifetime; he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> discoveries while <b>living</b> in poverty and {{died at the age of}} 26.|$|R
25|$|John Ashley {{was born}} and raised in the backwoods country along the Caloosahatchee River in the {{community}} of Buckingham, Florida near Fort Myers, Florida. He was one of nine children born to Joe Ashley, a poor Florida woodsman, who <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> by fishing, hunting, and trapping otters. The Ashley family moved from Fort Myers to Pompano in the 1890s where Joe Ashley and his older sons worked on the new railroad being built by industrialist Henry Flagler. In 1911, Joe moved his family to West Palm Beach and briefly served as county sheriff. John Ashley spent much of his youth in the Florida Everglades and, like his father, became a skilled trapper and alligator hunter.|$|E
25|$|However, Seng's son, Tan Nai Kok (陳盛于/陈盛于; Chen Chengyu; Tan Sêng-u), {{emigrated to}} Siam in 1814, {{during the reign}} of King Rama II. Nai Kok settled in Ayutthaya and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> by selling Chinese and Thai sweets; it is said he had made {{innovations}} by combining Chinese and Thai culinary skills. A devout Buddhist, Nai Kok married a Thai woman named Pin. Pin's sister, Boonma, would become an ancestor of Pridi's wife Poonsuk. Their son, Nai Koet, married Khum, daughter of a wealthy Chinese entrepreneur. When Nai Koet died, his wife directed that his remains were to be cremated and interred at the shrine at Phanomyong Hill, which is the origin of their Thai surname. Their son, Nai Siang, who became a wealthy rice merchant, married Lukchan; they were the parents of Pridi.|$|E
25|$|Instead, Cioculescu <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>living</b> {{teaching}} French language at Bucharest's Saint Sava National College. He had {{among his}} students G. Brătescu, the future physician and medical historian, {{also known as}} a Communist Party militant after the war (before being marginalized and excluded by the group in the late 1950s). In his 2003 autobiography, Brătescu recalled that Cioculescu's method went beyond the Romanian curriculum and parallel to the National Legionary requirements, introducing his students to innovative French 19th- and 20th-century authors, from Arthur Rimbaud to Marcel Proust. Also according to Brătescu, Cioculescu introduced his students to the banned or unpublished works of Arghezi, and openly praised the poet's political stance. In late 1940, Cioculescu also reacted to the Iron Guard's mass murders of politicians affiliated with previous regimes—the Jilava Massacre and the killings of Iorga and economist Virgil Madgearu. His Saint Sava student Brătescu, who frequented Iorga's circles in Vălenii de Munte, presented him with some of Iorga's final texts for Cuget Clar.|$|E

In Prague Chandan meets a gypsy girl, Elena. This girl becomes {{the love of his}} life, his inspiration and also the pain of his soul because his past from India refuses to leave him alone. Chandan’s experiences have <b>made</b> him mistrust <b>his</b> own shadow and <b>his</b> insecurities have <b>made</b> <b>his</b> life a <b>living</b> hell. <b>His</b> only ally in his darkest times is his friend Arfie but then it is revealed at the end that Arfie perhaps does not exist and Gulshan is an extension of Chandan himself suggesting that it was Chandan who created these characters in his head.|$|R
