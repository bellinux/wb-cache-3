Note also that Apple engineers visited the PARC facilities (Apple secured the rights for the visit by compensating Xerox with a pre-IPO purchase of Apple stock) and a number of PARC employees subsequently moved to Apple to work on the Lisa and Macintosh GUI. However, the Apple work extended PARC's considerably, adding <b>manipulatable</b> icons, and drag and drop manipulation of objects in the file system (see Macintosh Finder) for example. A list of the improvements made by Apple, beyond the PARC interface, can be read at Folklore.org.

The method uses a directed histogram search of a time-of-flight camera generated 3 D point cloud that exploits the logical connection between objects and the respective supporting surface to facilitate scene segmentation. Once segmented the points above the supporting surface are searched, again with a directed histogram, and potentially <b>manipulatable</b> objects identified. Finally, the <b>manipulatable</b> objects in the scene are identified as those from the potential objects set that are within the manipulators capabilities.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} physical capabilities and the mental simulation of actions. Behavioural {{research suggests that the}} ability to understand of an action {{is directly related to the}} ability to perform it, an idea consistent with the Embodied theory of Cognition. The present work aims to further explore the relationship between the body and cognition and investigate whether the restriction of an action or movement disrupts the simulation of movements during motor imagery tasks, which have been shown to elicit motor activations upon performance. This theory was investigated in a series of seven motor simulation experiments during which participants’ movements were restrained. Studies 1 - 3 investigated simulations that occur unconsciously through the observation of <b>manipulatable</b> objects. Studies 4 - 6 investigated simulations that occur during performance of mental transformations of <b>manipulatable</b> objects and body part stimuli. The results of these studies found no significant difference in performance when movement was restricted compared to when free to move. Study 7 investigated simulations that occur consciously through the observation of actions performed by another individual and found a significant effect of restriction on performance. The findings of these studies indicate that the ability to perform a movement is required for the accurate simulation of actions when an action is being observed but not when a simulated action is required on a stationary object, which suggests a variable relationship between the body and cognitive processes. This thesis offers an interesting contribution to the Embodied Cognition debate and provides a further insight into the relationship between the motor and visual systems...|$|E

At birth, these hearts were not hypertrophic, but already abnormally soft, with cell-autonomous and MLP-sensitive alterations in cytoarchitecture. Thus, MLP promotes proper cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture, whose perturbation can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy.

Several predictive models aim at identifying patients at risk of prolonged ICU stay after cardiac surgery with CPB, but {{almost all of them}} involve a preoperative assessment for proper resource management, while one – the Open-Heart Intraoperative Risk (OHIR) score – focuses on intraoperative <b>manipulatable</b> risk factors for improving anesthetic care and patient outcome. Objective: We aimed to revalidate the OHIR score in a different context. Materials and methods: The ability of the OHIR score to predict a prolonged ICU stay was assessed in 123 adults undergoing cardiac surgery (both coronary bypass graft and valvular surgery) with CPB at two tertiary university hospitals between January 2013 and December 2014. The criteria for a prolonged ICU stay matched a previous study (ie, a stay longer than the median). Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the OHIR score to predict a prolonged ICU stay was 0. 95 (95 % confidence interval 0. 90 – 1. 00). The respective sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of an OHIR score of ≥ 3 to discriminate a prolonged ICU stay was 93. 10 %, 98. 46 %, 98. 18 %, and 95. 9 %. Conclusion: The OHIR score is highly predictive of a prolonged ICU stay among intraoperative patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. The OHIR comprises of six risk factors, five of which are <b>manipulatable</b> intraoperatively. The OHIR can be used to identify patients at risk as well as to improve the outcome of those patients.
