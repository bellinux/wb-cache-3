25|$|Nevertheless, many Romans still viewed his {{character}} {{with a degree}} of respect.

The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice {{in the first years}} of my married life and occupied myself solely with chemistry and writing.|$|E
25|$|In Azerbaijani society, Russians are {{perceived}} mostly as invaders that have controlled Azerbaijan for almost 200 {{years with a}} two-year halfway break. For current generations, Russians are seen as direct and indirect perpetrators of the two <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> events which have occurred in Azerbaijan's modern history. One is the Black January (when Soviet soldiers entered Baku to suppress the independence movement and killed over 100 people in 1990); {{the other is the}} Khojali massacre during the Karabakh War.|$|E
25|$|William Hawi {{created a}} “Military Police” {{in charge of}} {{controlling}} the disorder and chaos that were everywhere and introduced a regulatory mechanism to guarantee road safety and guide the citizens to these safe roads. Perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> ordeal he had to face was that famous massacre on December 6, 1975, that was later called the “Black Saturday” where he was also subjected to menaces and humiliation {{when he tried to}} rescue as many innocents as he could. Several persons owe him their lives, their dignity and their properties.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the true}} {{dangers of the}} oath became {{apparent}} when the lovers Beren and Lúthien recovered one of the jewels from Morgoth, which ultimately came into the possession of Dior, their son, who ruled after his grandfather Thingol in Menegroth. The presence of the Silmaril awoke the oath and caused the brothers to make war on the Elves of Doriath because Dior refused to yield the jewel. The brothers attacked Doriath, killed Dior and sacked {{the halls of the}} Sindar, committing the second Kinslaying. However, the Silmaril escaped the destruction of Doriath and the oath drove the sons onwards. When they learned that it was possessed by Elwing daughter of Dior, who dwelt near the mouths of Sirion together with exiles from Doriath and the city of Gondolin, they attacked the place (after Elwing also refused to return the Silmaril to them), committing the third and <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> Kinslaying. All six of the remaining brothers survived even the complete rout of their forces at the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, but three of the brothers — Celegorm, Curufin, and Caranthir — died in the second sacking of Menegroth. At the third and final Kinslaying, Amras was slain.|$|E

Kelly later stated that the Harpy Coven might [...] "have been self-trained or may have descended from an earlier person or group".|$|E

500|$|The Russians {{eventually}} offered battle outside Moscow on 7 September: the Battle of Borodino {{resulted in}} approximately 44,000 Russian and 35,000 French dead, wounded or captured, {{and may have}} been the bloodiest day of battle in history up to that point in time. Although the French had won, the Russian army had accepted, and withstood, the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive. Napoleon's own account was: [...] "The <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible".|$|E
500|$|The {{perceived}} lack {{of remorse}} by Waddle, plus {{reports in the}} Japanese media that Greeneville had {{made no effort to}} assist Ehime Maru survivors as they waited for almost one hour for rescue angered many Japanese citizens, especially the family members of the missing. [...] One Japanese family member publicly referred to Waddle as, [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> criminal of them all." [...] Another family member, referring to Waddle said, [...] "If you're a man, you should fall on your knees and ask for our pardon!" [...] In response, Waddle delivered letters of apology to the Japanese consulate in Hawaii for delivery to the victims' families during the last week of February.|$|E
60|$|While we mused {{upon this}} discovery, we were {{surprised}} with very bad weather, and especially violent rains, with thunder and lightning, <b>most</b> unusually <b>terrible</b> to us. In this pickle we run for the shore, and getting under the lee of the cape, run our frigates into a little creek, where we saw the land overgrown with trees, and made all the haste possible to get on shore, being exceeding wet, and fatigued with the heat, the thunder, lightning, and rain.|$|R

500|$|Unfriendly sources {{described}} Morton in exceedingly negative terms. [...] "With a superabundance of {{the quality}} called 'force,' Senator Morton possesses one of the <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> natures in public life," [...] and as news correspondent George Alfred Townsend described him: [...] "A dark, determined, brooding and desperate mind is reflected in his warthy complexion and introspective eyes. His powerful frame, prematurely wrecked, yet carrying alive the savage will, towers on his crutch, and in his very hobble is the tyrant's pace.... He wants to be terrible {{for the sake of}} freedom. His conscience and fortitude are thus fed from his fanaticism. Like all bloody bigots, he thinks he feels God's mercy moving in him." ...|$|E
500|$|Mateiu Caragiale {{published}} Remember as {{a volume}} the following year; from 1922, he {{began work on}} [...] "Spovedanii" [...] ("Confessions"), {{the third and final}} section of Craii..., which, as he recounted, coincided with [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> crisis" [...] of his life. Several of his poems were published in a 1925 collection edited by Perpessicius and Ion Pillat (Antologia poeților de azi), and were accompanied by an ink portrait signed Marcel Janco; at the time, Caragiale announced {{that he was going to}} publish a series of poems under the title Pajere (it was to be printed only after his death). In the 1925–1933 period, Caragiale's notes show that he was seeing his life as marked by existential cycles and crucial moments.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rappler.com, Gabriela Lee {{praised the}} writing as [...] "fast-paced and efficient." [...] She {{especially}} highlighted {{the scene in}} which Nico reveals himself to be gay, commenting: [...] "there was nothing soft or comforting about their confrontation. Love was shown as something violent and frightening, and Nico's internal conflict unfolded {{without a hint of}} irony or disrespect." [...] Lee was also surprised by the role given to Bob and confessed to having cried at the end given to the character. To close her analysis, she said: [...] "The best lesson that one can take away from reading this book: that even the <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> person can have a change of heart and make their own choices to do what is right." ...|$|E

500|$|Zapata {{began the}} attack on Cuautla on May 13 with 4000 troops against 400 elite {{soldiers}} of the so-called [...] "Golden Fifth"; the Fifth Cavalry Regiment of the Federal Army. The battle took almost a week and {{has been described as}} [...] "six of the <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> days of battle in the whole Revolution". It consisted of house to house fighting, hand-to-hand combat, and no quarter given by either side. General Victoriano Huerta arrived in nearby Cuernavaca with 600 reinforcements, but decided not to come to the relief of Cuautla as he was afraid that the capital would revolt in his absence. On May 19, the remains of the [...] "Golden Fifth" [...] pulled out of the town which was then occupied by Zapata's soldiers.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{historian}} al-Juwayni, the Stone was returned twenty-three years later, in 952. The Qarmatians held the Black Stone for ransom, {{and forced the}} Abbasids to pay a huge sum for its return. It was wrapped in a sack and thrown into the Friday Mosque of Kufa, accompanied by a note saying [...] "By command we took it, and by command we have brought it back." [...] Its abduction and removal caused further damage, breaking the stone into seven pieces. Its abductor, Abu Tahir, {{is said to have}} met a terrible fate; according to Qutb al-Din, [...] "the filthy Abu Tahir was afflicted with a gangrenous sore, his flesh was eaten away by worms, and he died a <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> death". To protect the shattered stone, the custodians of the Kaaba commissioned a pair of Meccan goldsmiths to build a silver frame to surround it, and it has been housed within a similar frame ever since.|$|E

Governor General Jean and Prime Minister Harper made statements of condolence shortly after his death and, on the anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge (April 9), Canada's monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, issued a statement marking the two events, stating: [...] "As proud and grateful Canadians, we pause today to mark not only the ninety-third anniversary of this Nation's victory at Vimy Ridge but also to pay tribute to the passing of a truly remarkable generation who helped to end the <b>most</b> <b>terrible</b> conflict the world had ever known."

'The poetry prize system,' said he--it is {{astonishing}} what nonsense a man, ordinarily intelligent, will talk after dinner--'is on {{exactly the same}} principle as those penny-in-the-slot machines that you see at stations.
