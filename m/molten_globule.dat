40|$|Close {{packing of}} {{hydrophobic}} residues in the protein interior {{is an important}} determinant of protein stability. Cavities introduced by large to small substitutions are known to destabilize proteins. Conversely, native states of proteins and protein fragments can be stabilized by filling in existing cavities. <b>Molten</b> <b>globules</b> (MGs) were initially used to describe a state of protein which has well-defined secondary structure but little or no tertiary packing. Subsequent {{studies have shown that}} MGs do have some degree of native-like topology and specific packing. Wet <b>molten</b> <b>globules</b> (WMGs) with hydrated cores and considerably decreased packing relative to the native state have been studied extensively. Recently there has been renewed interest in identification and characterization of dry <b>molten</b> <b>globules</b> (DMGs). These are slightly expanded forms of the native state which show increased conformational flexibility, native-like main-chain hydrogen bonding and dry interiors. The generality of occurrence of DMGs during protein unfolding and the extent and nature of packing in DMGs remain to be elucidated. Packing interactions in native proteins and MGs can be probed through mutations. Next generation sequencing technologies make it possible to determine relative populations of mutants in a large pool. When this is coupled to phenotypic screens or cell-surface display, it becomes possible to rapidly examine large panels of single-site or multi-site mutants. From such studies, residue specific contributions to protein stability and function can be estimated in a highly parallelized fashion.

50|$|The folding funnel {{hypothesis}} {{is closely related}} to the hydrophobic collapse hypothesis, under which the driving force for protein folding is the stabilization associated with the sequestration of hydrophobic amino acid side chains in the interior of the folded protein. This allows the water solvent to maximize its entropy, lowering the total free energy. On the side of the protein, free energy is further lowered by favorable energetic contacts: isolation of electrostatically charged side chains on the solvent-accessible protein surface and neutralization of salt bridges within the protein's core. The <b>molten</b> <b>globule</b> state predicted by the folding funnel theory as an ensemble of folding intermediates thus corresponds to a protein in which hydrophobic collapse has occurred but many native contacts, or close residue-residue interactions represented in the native state, have yet to form.|$|E

(2008) {{published}} {{a variation on}} the thermofluor assay where SYPRO Orange was replaced by N-4-(7-diethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)phenylmaleimide (CPM), a compound that only fluoresces after reacting with a nucleophile.

Cysteines are typically buried in the interior of a folded protein as they are hydrophobic. When a protein denatures cysteine thiols become available and a fluorescent signal can be read from reacted CPM. The exitation and emission wavelengths for reacted CPM are 387 nm/ 463 nm so a fluorescence plate reader or a qPCR machine with specialised filters is required.

Here, we report an experimental {{study on the}} conformational dynamics of different folded conformational states of apo- and holomyoglobin in solution. Global protein diffusion and internal molecular motions were probed by neutron time-of-flight and neutron backscattering spectroscopy on the picosecond and nanosecond time scales.

Under strongly denaturing conditions, fluorescence resonance energy transfer histograms show a single peak, arising from unfolded protein. The smFRET efficiency distribution shifts to higher value upon decreasing denaturant concentration because the MG folds. Strikingly, upon approaching native conditions, the fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency of the MG rises above that of native protein.

A close similarity between equilibrium <b>molten</b> <b>globule</b> states and kinetic species observed during refolding has been reported for several proteins. However, the experimental conditions, {{and in particular the}} pH, under which the equilibrium and kinetic species are studied often differ significantly. For human α-lactalbumin (α-LA), the equilibrium <b>molten</b> <b>globule</b> is most often studied at pH  2, the so-called A-state, while kinetic refolding experiments are performed at neutral pH. α-LA contains a large number of acidic amino acid residues that may influence the properties of the <b>molten</b> <b>globule</b> differently at low and neutral pH. In this study, we investigate the structural preferences of the α-LA <b>molten</b> <b>globule</b> at pH  7 at the level of individual residues using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and compare these data with previous results obtained at pH  2. We show that differences exist in the conformational ensemble that describes the α-LA <b>molten</b> <b>globule</b> at these two pH values. The <b>molten</b> <b>globule</b> at pH  7 is generally less stable than that at the low pH A-state. Most notable are differences in the stability of structure for the C-helix and the calcium-binding loop that precedes it and differences in the contribution of long-range hydrophobic contacts between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the α-domain to the stability of the <b>molten</b> <b>globule.</b> Our results are discussed in the context of previous studies of the α-LA <b>molten</b> <b>globule</b> and can be used to reconcile apparent discrepancies in published data relating to the C-helix.

40|$|AbstractAlpha-solenoid {{proteins}} {{are suggested}} to constitute highly flexible macromolecules, whose structural variability and {{large surface area}} is instrumental in many important protein-protein binding processes. By equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we show that importin-β, an archetypical α-solenoid, displays unprecedentedly large and fully reversible elasticity. Our stretching molecular dynamics simulations reveal full elasticity over up to twofold end-to-end extensions compared to its bound state. Despite {{the absence of any}} long-range intramolecular contacts, the protein can return to its equilibrium structure to within 3 Å backbone RMSD after the release of mechanical stress. We find that this extreme degree of flexibility is based on an unusually flexible hydrophobic core that differs substantially from that of structurally similar but more rigid globular proteins. In that respect, the core of importin-β resembles <b>molten</b> <b>globules.</b> The elastic behavior is dominated by nonpolar interactions between HEAT repeats, combined with conformational entropic effects. Our results suggest that α-solenoid structures such as importin-β may bridge the molecular gap between completely structured and intrinsically disordered proteins...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of intramolecular disulfides in a noncovalent dimeric protein interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) {{has been studied}} by replacing cysteines {{in each of the}} two disulfide pairs with α-aminobutyric acid (CH 2 -SH→CH 2 -CH 3). Both disulfide mutants are less stable and exist as <b>molten</b> <b>globules</b> in the monomeric state. Interestingly, both mutants dimerize, though with slightly lower affinities compared to the native protein. NMR studies suggest a molten globule-like structure also in the dimeric state. Structures, sequence analysis, and mutagenesis {{studies have shown that the}} conserved hydrophobic residues are packed against each other in the protein core and that H bonding and van der Waals interactions stabilize the dimer interface. Deleting either disulfide in IL- 8 results in substantial loss in receptor activity, indicating that both disulfides are critical for function in the folded protein. These data together suggest that the packing interactions of the hydrophobic core determine IL- 8 monomer fold, that disulfides play only a marginal role in dimer formation, and that the stability imparted by the disulfides is intimately coupled to fold and function...|$|R
