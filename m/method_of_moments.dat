Delay is one of important parameter in network internal performances, so the measure of delay performance is very necessary. The upto-date algorithms on delay tomography are mainly Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) and EM-MLE (Expectation Maximum) algorithm, but it is complex in their computation, especially when the size of network topology is large. So the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>moment</b> was proposed to infer the delay performance of internal network. In contrast to other methods, it is simple in the computational complexity using the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>moment</b> but its accuracy is not high.

25|$|The modern {{field of}} {{statistics}} {{emerged in the}} late 19th and early 20th century in three stages. The first wave, {{at the turn of}} the century, was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics – height, weight, eyelash length among others. Pearson developed the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, defined as a product-moment, the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution, among many other things. Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics (then called biometry), and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new concept called moment components and a new method based on it to obtain passive reduced-order models of interconnect networks. In this method, the impedance matrix <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> the interconnect network are partitioned into their inductive, capacitive and mixed inductive/capacitive <b>moment</b> components. The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>moment</b> components is described in a formal manner using analysis and synthesis equalities. Two significant contributions <b>of</b> the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>moment</b> components are: 1) new decomposition <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> into parts which reflect passivity in all <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> passive networks and 2) the analysis equalities impart a regular pattern in terms <b>of</b> the <b>moment</b> components, thus simplifying the moment generation for our <b>method.</b> None <b>of</b> these features is observable in conventional complete moment terms. Two new methods for obtaining passive reduced-order models based on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>moment</b> components are introduced. The passive reduced-order models are obtained by matching their impedance moment components {{to those of the}} original interconnect network through the synthesis equalities. Due to nonnegative definiteness <b>of</b> the <b>moment</b> components, the match in the moment components preserves the passivity of the original interconnect in the reduced-order model. The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>moment</b> components does not have the instability problem <b>of</b> general <b>moment</b> matching techniques. The reduced-order model is specifically targeted for fast timing simulators so that interconnect effects can be simulated efficiently. Consequently, the calculation of all model parameters is based on explicitly formulated analytical expressions. To maintain the speed advantage of the fast timing simulator, the number <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> needs to be kept low. However, since the capacitive and inductive <b>moment</b> components <b>of</b> the original interconnect are matched respectively to the capacitive and inductive <b>moment</b> components <b>of</b> the reduced-order model, a more refined match is achieved and accurate results are obtained even with a small number <b>of</b> <b>moments.</b> Simulation results <b>of</b> original interconnect networks and their reduced-order models are compared using circuits of practical interest.

40|$|A {{predictive}} modelling for {{the simulation}} of bioreactors must account {{for both the}} biological and hydrodynamics complexities. Population balance models (PBM) are the best approach to conjointly describe these complexities, by accounting for the adaptation of inner metabolism for microorganisms that travel in a large-scale heterogeneous bioreactor. While being accurate for solving the PBM, the Class and Monte Carlo methods are expensive in terms of calculation and memory use. Here, we apply <b>Methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>Moments</b> to solve a population balance equation describing the dynamic adaptation of a biological population to its environment. The use <b>of</b> quadrature <b>methods</b> (Maximum Entropy, QMOM or EQMOM) is required for a good integration of the metabolic behavior over the population. We then compare the accuracy provided by these methods against the class method {{which serves as a}} reference. We found that the use <b>of</b> 5 <b>moments</b> to describe a distribution of growth-rate over the population gives satisfactory accuracy against a simulation with a hundred classes. Thus, all <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> allow a significant decrease of memory usage in simulations. In terms of stability, QMOM and EQMOM performed far better than the Maximum Entropy method.
