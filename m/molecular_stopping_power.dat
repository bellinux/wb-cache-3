The Gordon-Kim's molecular charged density model is employed {{to obtain a}} formula to evaluate the <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> of many useful <b>molecular</b> systems.

The unrestricted linear {{energy transfer}} is identical to linear electronic <b>stopping</b> <b>power,</b> as discussed below. But the <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> and LET concepts are different in the respect that total <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> has the nuclear <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> component, and this component does not cause electronic excitations.

The influences of the magnetized field, the angle between the test particle velocity and magnetized field, and certain plasma densities and temperatures on the <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> are studied.

A detector model {{is used for the}} energy calibration to improve the accuracy of the <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> curve for 4 He ions in the low energy region. The estimated uncertainty in the <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> values is ca. 1. 5 % for 4 He ions and ca. 2 % for 1 H ions. A comparison is made between a parametrization of the present data and several parametrizations of the <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> found in the literature. The <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> values closest to the present experimental data for 4 H ions are obtained by adding elemental <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> using Bragg's rule. for this the experimental values for the C 1 <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> reported earlier should be used.

40|$|The wakefield and <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> of an ion-beam pulse {{moving in}} {{magnetized}} plasmas are investigated by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The effects of beam velocity and density on the wake and <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> are discussed.

The corresponding <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> are enhanced due to the drag of these whistler waves. As beam velocities increase, the whistler waves disappear, and only are conversed V-shape wakes observed. The corresponding <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> are reduced compared with these in isotropic plasmas.

40|$|The {{slowing down}} of {{energetic}} ions in materials {{is determined by}} the nuclear and electronic <b>stopping</b> <b>powers.</b> Both of these have been studied extensively for ordinary matter ions. For antiprotons, however, there are numerous studies of the electronic <b>stopping</b> <b>power,</b> but none of the nuclear one. Here, we use quantum chemical methods to calculate interparticle potentials between antiprotons and different atoms, and derive from these the nuclear <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> of antiprotons in solids. The results show that the antiproton nuclear <b>stopping</b> <b>powers</b> are much stronger than those of protons, and can also be stronger than the electronic <b>stopping</b> <b>power</b> at the lowest energies. The interparticle potentials are also implemented in a molecular dynamics ion range calculation code, which allows to simulate antiproton transmission through degrader foil materials.
