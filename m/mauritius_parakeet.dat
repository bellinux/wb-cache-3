50|$|In {{addition}} to the study skin, it is known from descriptions, as well as illustrations {{of which it is}} unknown whether they were drawn from live or stuffed specimens. It was closely related to the extant but endangered <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> and became extinct in about 1770.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, this parakeet was almost extinct. The roughly 10 birds {{that were left}} had hardly ever bred {{successfully}} since the early 1970s {{due to lack of}} suitable trees, nest predation, disturbance by humans and feral pigs and deer, and competition with more plentiful bird species including the introduced rose-ringed parakeet. The <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> seemed doomed to extinction.|$|E
50|$|A study {{skin had}} been {{discovered}} at the Royal Museum of Scotland, explicitly referencing a book description of the Réunion birds. This {{may be the only}} material proof of these birds' existence, or be from Mauritius. Even in that case, ancient DNA analysis of this specimen will give new insight into these questions, because very little data exists on the genetic diversity of the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> in former times.|$|E
50|$|The Réunion parakeet P. eques, {{taxonomy}} is also confusing. Extinct since 1770, {{little evidence}} even exists {{of the birds}} existence. A study skin had been discovered at the Royal Museum of Scotland, explicitly referencing a book description of the Réunion birds. It is known from other descriptions, as well as illustrations {{of which it is}} unknown whether they were drawn from live or stuffed specimens. This may be the only material proof of these birds' existence. Taxonomists are unsure if the birds were a distinct species, or conspecific with the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet.</b>|$|E
50|$|Over 100 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in Mauritius. There are seven or eight surviving endemic species on the main island depending on taxonomy. The Mauritius grey white-eye {{is the most common}} of these, being widespread across the island including in man-made habitats. The others are less common and are mainly restricted to the Black River Gorges National Park in the south-west of the island. The Mauritius kestrel, <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> and pink pigeon all came close to extinction but are now increasing thanks to intensive conservation efforts.|$|E
50|$|The park protects {{most of the}} island's {{remaining}} rainforest {{although much}} {{of this has been}} degraded by introduced plants such as Chinese guava and privet and animals such as rusa deer and wild pigs. Several areas have been fenced off and invasive species have been eradicated from them to preserve native wildlife. Many endemic plants and animals still occur in the park including the Mauritian flying fox and all of the island's endemic birds: Mauritius kestrel, pink pigeon, <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet,</b> Mauritius cuckoo-shrike, Mauritius bulbul, Mauritius olive white-eye, Mauritius grey white-eye and Mauritius fody.|$|E
50|$|The echo parakeet or <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula eques), is {{a parrot}} endemic to Mauritius in the {{southern}} Indian Ocean. It is the only extant parrot of the Mascarene islands, all others have become extinct due to human activity. The extinct Réunion parakeet of nearby Réunion was previously considered a distinct species, but a 2015 DNA study determined {{it to be a}} subspecies of the same species as the Mauritius population. If the Mauritius and Réunion birds are considered the same species, and the subspecies model is considered, then the Echo parakeet becomes the English group name for both, with the Mauritian birds using the scientific name Psittacula eques echo.|$|E
50|$|The Trust’s {{headquarters}} {{is also a}} ‘window’ {{to the work of}} Durrell Wildlife around the world - where visitors can enjoy the opportunity {{to see some of the}} planet’s most endangered species and learn how the Trust is working to save them. What keeper-conservationists learn about a species while it is living in Jersey can help to save its cousins struggling for survival in the wild. Some species, such as gorillas and orangutans, are well known while other species, such as the Livingstone's fruit bat, the pied tamarin, the giant jumping rat, the Madagascar teal (Bernier's teal), the echo parakeet (<b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet),</b> the mountain chicken (actually a giant frog), and Round Island boa, are more obscure.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} {{similar to the}} rose-ringed parakeet—its closest living relative—except that the Mascarenes bird is a stockier species with a markedly shorter tail and a more intensive emerald green. The females lack the neck collar, and notably possess an all-black beak, unlike the males which have a red upper beak. The latter feature is notably absent in the rose-ringed parakeet {{as well as the}} Alexandrine parakeet, which is also generally similar and not too distantly related. However, it is found in the red-breasted parakeet, the Derbyan parakeet and the Nicobar parakeet which are morphologically dissimilar and apparently very closely related among each other, though not to the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> or its immediate relatives.|$|E
5000|$|Recognizing {{that the}} <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> was not acutely {{threatened}} with extinction anymore but [...] "merely" [...] very rare, it is downlisted from critically endangered to endangered in the 2007 IUCN Red List. The {{goal for the}} near future {{is to have a}} stable population of 300 mature birds in the wild by 2010, and it is most likely that this will be achieved. At present, not all remaining and reconstituted habitat is utilized by the birds, so that it's hoped that the population will continue to expand in the near future. It is still threatened by unforeseeable events like tropical cyclones and psittacine beak and feather disease, the impact of which is at present unknown, and of course the threats which had brought it to near-extinction only some two decades ago continue to hamper its recovery.|$|E
5000|$|Many extant or extinct birds {{endemic to}} the Mascarene Islands {{are derived from}} South Asian ancestors, {{including}} the dodo, and a South Asian provenance has been proposed for the parrots as well. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so {{it was possible for}} species to [...] "island hop" [...] to the isolated islands. Of the about eight endemic Mascarene parrot species, all but the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> have gone extinct. In spite of many of them being poorly known, fossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced [...] elements, and robust leg elements. Julian Hume has suggested their common origin is within the Psittaculini radiation, based on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. This group may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have diverged on hot spot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s, the <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula echo), {{the only}} {{surviving}} parrot species endemic to Mauritius and the Mascarenes, had suffered huge losses due to competing invasive species, predation from introduced mammals {{and loss of}} native trees in which to nest. By the early 1980s there {{were thought to be}} around 10 Mauritius parakeets left, with precious little recruitment throughout the decade. Whilst speaking at a 1990 captive breeding conference, Jones told delegates that the echo parakeet had a perilously low population and would likely become extinct, not for lack of expertise, but because attempts at gaining funding for the necessary actions had been fruitless. Mike Reynolds of the Parrot Trust approached Jones after the presentation, and the resultant collaboration brought much needed funds and veterinary expertise to the assistance of the species restoration project. Under Jones' guidance, nest boxes were placed in the forest, treatments to dissuade tropical nest flies from attacking the young in the nest and supplementary feeding for breeding pairs, and by 2005, 139 birds had been released. By 2015, there was a population of about 650 birds, and the species had been down-listed from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2007.|$|E
40|$|We {{characterized}} 21 polymorphic microsatellite loci in {{the endangered}} <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula eques). Loci were isolated from a <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> genomic library {{that had been}} enriched separately for eight different repeat motifs. Loci were characterized in up to 43 putatively unrelated Mauritius parakeets from a single population inhabiting the Black River Gorges National Park, Mauritius. Each locus displayed between three and nine alleles, with the observed heterozygosity ranging between 0. 39 and 0. 96. All loci were tested in 10 other parrot species. Despite testing few individuals, between seven and 21 loci were polymorphic in each of seven species tested...|$|E
40|$|For {{conservation}} managers {{tasked with}} recovering threatened species, genetic structure can exacerbate {{the rate of}} loss of genetic diversity because alleles unique to a sub-population {{are more likely to}} be lost by the effects of random genetic drift than if a population is panmictic. Given that intensive management techniques commonly used to recover threatened species frequently involve movement of individuals within and between populations, managers need to be aware not only of pre-existing levels of genetic structure but also of the potential effects that intensive management might have on these patterns. The <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula echo) has been the subject of an intensive conservation programme, involving translocation and reintroduction that has recovered the population from less than 20 individuals in 1987 to approximately 500 in 2010. Analysis of genotype data derived from 18 microsatellite markers developed for this species reveals a clear signal of structure in the population before intensive management began, but which subsequently disappears following management intervention. This study illustrates the impacts that conservation management can have on the genetic structure of an island endemic population and demonstrates how translocations or reintroductions can benefit populations of endangered species by reducing the risk of loss of genetic diversity...|$|E
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} are widely recognized to have substantial impact on wildlife populations. These impacts are sometimes exacerbated in small endangered populations, and therefore, {{the success of}} conservation reintroductions to aid the recovery of such species can be seriously threatened by outbreaks of infectious disease. Intensive management strategies associated with conservation reintroductions can further compound these negative effects in such populations. Exploring the sublethal effects of disease outbreaks among natural populations is challenging and requires longitudinal, individual life-history data on patterns of reproductive success and other indicators of individual fitness. Long-term monitoring data concerning detailed reproductive information of the reintroduced <b>Mauritius</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Psittacula echo) population collected before, during and after a disease outbreak was investigated. Deleterious effects of an outbreak of beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) were revealed on hatch success, but these effects were remarkably short-lived and disproportionately associated with breeding pairs which took supplemental food. Individual BFDV infection status was not predicted by any genetic, environmental or conservation management factors and {{was not associated with}} any of our measures of immune function, perhaps suggesting immunological impairment. Experimental immunostimulation using the PHA (phytohaemagglutinin assay) challenge technique did, however, provoke a significant cellular immune response. We illustrate the resilience of this bottlenecked and once critically endangered, island-endemic species to an epidemic outbreak of BFDV and highlight the value of systematic monitoring in revealing inconspicuous but nonetheless substantial ecological interactions. Our study demonstrates that the emergence of such an infectious disease in a population ordinarily associated with increased susceptibility does not necessarily lead to deleterious impacts on population growth and that negative effects on reproductive fitness can be short-lived...|$|E
