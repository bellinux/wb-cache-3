5|$|The Touchet Formation is {{also found}} in Oregon, in areas flooded by Lake Condon. This lake back-flooded into the Umatilla and John Day River Valleys as well as other tributaries. As one example, silt-sand rhythmites {{associated}} with the Missoula Floods are present along Willow Creek, a valley tributary to the Columbia River. Willow Creek conflues with the Columbia a few <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> of Boardman, Oregon. Excellent exposures of the unit (which contains abundant clastic dikes) can be found in roadcuts along Hwy 74 (Heppner Highway) near the ranching community of Cecil, Oregon. These deposits are associated with former Lake Condon.|$|E
5|$|On June 12, Egyptian {{infantry}} numbering {{at about}} 4,000, {{reinforced by the}} republican army and mercenaries from the Aden protectorate invaded the town of Beit Adaqah, about thirty <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> of San'a, where Prince Abdullah held a front extending from the Hodeida road, through Kawakaban province, to southern Hajjah. In two days, the attackers advanced about twelve miles, before being repelled by a counter-attack. The royalists admitted about 250 casualties. Next, the Egyptians attacked Sudah, about 100 miles north-west of San'a. They used the unpopularity of the local royalist commander to bribe several local sheiks and occupied the town unopposed. After a month, the sheiks sent delegations to al-Badr soliciting pardons and asking for guns and money with which to fight the Egyptians. Al-Badr sent new forces and managed to regain the surroundings of Sudah, though not the town itself.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, {{convection}} {{associated with}} Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics, but still retained its status. Early on October1, the extratropical transition was fully apparent. Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal {{and there was}} little convection around {{the center of the}} system. With minimal shower and thunderstorm activity remaining around the center of Laura, the storm degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area on October1 while still producing tropical storm-force winds. The next day, the remnant system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and began to re-intensify as it rapidly tracked towards the north. Early on October3, the system slowed down as it turned towards the east and strengthened into a hurricane-force cyclone with winds of 75mph (120km/h). After accelerating towards the east, another large extratropical cyclone absorbed the remnants of Laura while located several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>west</b> of the British Isles on October4.|$|E
