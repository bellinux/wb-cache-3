5|$|Knowing that Cleomenes got the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for his mercenaries from Ptolemy, Antigonus, {{according}} to Peter Green, {{seems to have}} ceded some territory in Asia Minor to Ptolemy in return for Ptolemy withdrawing his financial support of Sparta. Whether this assumption is accurate or not, Ptolemy certainly withdrew his support, which left Cleomenes without <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for his mercenaries. Desperate, Cleomenes freed all helots able to pay five Attic minae; in this way he accumulated 500 talents of silver. He also armed 2,000 of the ex-helots in Macedonian style to counter the White Shields, the Macedonian crack troops, before planning a major initiative.|$|E

According to drummer Dafydd Ieuan the band didn't have the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the artists involved for these remixes so, {{in order to provide}} them with royalties, promised to release an album featuring the tracks on their own label.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice {{completed}} {{the investigation into}} Jowers' claims but did not find evidence to support allegations about conspiracy. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented. A sister of Jowers {{admitted that he had}} fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story, and she in turn corroborated his story in order to get some <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> her income tax.|$|E

5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} about the lack of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even provide him with the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E
5|$|Wyn died in 1967, and {{the company}} grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed {{contracts}} to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later {{found out that the}} author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Lent's awards were {{auctioned}} at Sotheby's, London, on 18 July 1966. The items were bought in one lot by an anonymous bidder {{for the total}} sum of £500. The purchaser was Adolf Galland, the former Inspector of Fighters, {{acting on behalf of}} the West German Ministry of Defence. The awards were sold by Helmut Lent's elder daughter after consultation with her mother who was in urgent need for <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for an operation. The Ministry presented the collection to the Wehrgeschichtliches Museum Rastatt.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the {{government}} {{through a combination}} of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E
5|$|By 354/353 BC, in just 5 {{years since}} his accession, Philip had unified Macedon {{and turned it}} into the {{dominant}} power in Northern Greece. He had completely reduced Athenian influence in the region, and was allied to the other major Greek power in the region, the Chalkidian League. He had, in the process, secured access to the Aegean sea, which had been an age-old problem in Macedon, since suitable sites had been monopolised by Greek colonists in the Archaic period. Furthermore, he had overhauled and re-trained the army, which was now battle-hardened, and he now had a supply of ready <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for more troops.|$|E

After being held hostage by a convict friend of Nick, she returns to the square and is shocked when Nick returns unexpectedly. He tries to steal her money again by claiming he has AIDS and needs <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for illegally imported medication. Dot believes him but later discovers it is a lie and {{he is on the}} run from the police. She contacts the police, and he is arrested a week after his return.|$|E

5|$|During the Panic of 1893, Lilly {{created a}} {{commission}} to help provide food and shelter to the poor people who were adversely affected. His work with the commission led {{him to make a}} personal donation of funds and property to the Flower Mission of Indianapolis in 1895. Lilly's substantial donation allowed it to establish Eleanor Hospital, a children's hospital in Indianapolis named in honor of his deceased daughter. The hospital cared for children from families who had no <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for routine medical care; it closed in 1909.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, the Barr {{campaign}} was sued by libertarian pundit Jim Bovard, {{who was hired}} to ghostwrite {{a book about the}} campaign. Bovard claims he was never paid the $47,000 he was to receive for his efforts. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated that the campaign hoped to raise enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Bovard, and asked for donations. The ensuing litigation resulted in a judgment entered for Bovard against the Bar 2008 Presidential Committee, Inc., in the full amount of $47,000.00.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's four {{infantry}} regiments and two cavalry {{units that}} {{served in the}} Spanish–American War were beset by poor sanitation and disease in the army camps where they were stationed. The units saw little action in the war, but 84men {{died as a result}} of the poor conditions. When the time came for the troops to return home, Bradley found that the state had no <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the hospital trains needed for their trip. Bradley personally borrowed money from a bank to secure their passage, and trusted that the General Assembly would reimburse him.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{prevented}} {{the company from}} going bankrupt that year. The Desjardins Group, which was Cirque du Soleil's financial institution at the time, covered about $200,000 of bad checks. Also, a financier named Daniel Lamarre, who worked {{for one of the}} largest public relations firms in Quebec, represented the company for free, knowing that they didn't have the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his fee. The Quebec government itself also came through again, granting Laliberté enough money to stay solvent for another year.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimation}} that 300 senators were proscribed {{was presented}} by Appian, although his earlier contemporary Livy asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed. This decree {{issued by the}} triumvirate was motivated {{in part by a}} need to raise <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the salaries of their troops for the upcoming conflict against Caesar's assassins, Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger and Gaius Cassius Longinus. Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.|$|E
5|$|When the Bank Street {{ground was}} {{temporarily}} closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the club's next away game at Bristol City {{and found a}} temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham. Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, {{as well as the}} ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.|$|E

When he asks her what she would like as a wedding gift, she asks him for a divorce. Startled, Chandrakumar asks her why; in a flashback, Divya remembers {{when she was in}} love with Manohar, whom she met as a college student. Manohar and his gang assault and rob the son of Thamizhmani, an MP. Divya reports Manohar to the police, and he is arrested. She later learns that Thamizhmani's son had run over a girl with his car, and Manohar stole the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the girl's medical treatment. Divya feels guilty, and bails him out.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt to}} sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory {{were on their way to}} a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E

Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to theft. She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a Matisse painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is caught by Brian, who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing {{is not going to}} solve problems. Lois accepts his reasoning, but as she loads up the car to return her stolen goods, she is caught by Joe and arrested.|$|E
