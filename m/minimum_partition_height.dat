Transverse gradient of temperature is applied {{on the two}} opposing regular walls of the inclined enclosure while the other walls are maintained adiabatic. The problem is formulated {{in terms of the}} vorticity-stream function procedure. A numerical solution based on the finite volume method is obtained. Representative results illustrating the effects of the enclosure inclination angle and the degree of irreg-ularity on the contour maps of the streamlines and temperature are reported and discussed.

One wishes to partition G into connected components by deleting edges from G {{so that the}} total weight of each component is at least l and at most u.

The project consisted primarily of experiments performed in a full-scale controlled environment chamber (CEC) which a typical modular office environment was set up. The range of partition configurations and environmental parameters investigated included (1) <b>partition</b> <b>height,</b> (2) solid vs. airflow partitions, (3) airflow gap size, (4) supply air volume, (5) supply~room temperature difference, (6) supply diffuser location, (7) heat loud density, (8) workstation size, and (9) cooling vs. heating mode. Under steady-state conditions, multipoint measurements were made of air velocities, air temperatures, and radiant (globe) temperatures to characterize the key environmental variables affecting thermal comfort, and tracer gas methods using multipoint sampling locations were employed to determine the ventilation performance within the test chamber. The results indicated that variations in solid <b>partition</b> <b>height</b> produce only small differences in overall thermal and ventilation performance.

40|$|Abstract Background Determination {{of genetic}} {{relatedness}} among microorganisms provides information necessary for making inferences regarding phylogeny. However, {{there is little}} information available on how well the genetic relationships inferred from different genotyping methods agree with true genetic relationships. In this report, two genotyping methods – restriction fragment analysis (RFA) and partial genome DNA sequencing – were each compared to complete DNA sequencing as the definitive standard for classification. Results Using the Genbank database, 16 different types or subtypes of papillomavirus were selected as study samples, because numerous complete genome sequences were available. RFA was achieved by computer-simulated digestion. The genetic similarity of samples, based on RFA, was determined from the proportion of fragments that matched in size. DNA sequences of four specific genes (E 1, E 6, E 7, and L 1), representing partial genome sequencing, were also selected for comparison to complete genome sequencing. Laboratory error was not taken into account. Evaluation of the correlation between genetic similarity matrices (Mantel's r) and comparisons {{of the structure of}} the derived dendrograms (partition metric) indicated that partial genome sequencing (for single genes) had higher agreement with complete genome sequencing, achieving a maximum Mantel's r = 0. 97 and a <b>minimum</b> <b>partition</b> metric = 10. RFA had lower agreement, with a maximum Mantel's r = 0. 60 and a <b>minimum</b> <b>partition</b> metric = 18. Conclusions This simulation indicated that for smaller genomes, such as papillomavirus, partial genome sequencing is superior to restriction fragment analysis in representing genetic relatedness among isolates. The generalizability of these results to larger genomes, as well as the impact of laboratory error, remains to be demonstrated. </p...|$|R
