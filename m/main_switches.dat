The converter utilizes two-stage switched-capacitors as voltage sources {{to extend the}} voltage gain and auto-balance two branches current.

The Winding-coupled inductors work in fly-back or forward mode at different operation stages, which extends the voltage gain and {{make use of the}} magnetic as possible to improve the power density. The <b>main</b> <b>switches</b> are turned off under zero voltage switching(ZVS) condition because of a passive clamp circuit and turned on under zero current switching (ZCS) condition due to the coupled inductor inherent leakage.
