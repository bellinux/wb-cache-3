5|$|In 1319, the King and Lancaster {{fell out}} during a failed {{campaign}} against Scotland. The next year Lancaster refused {{to attend a}} parliament summoned by the King, and later the same year, Edward obtained papal absolution from his oath to follow the Ordinances. Meanwhile, an inheritance dispute had broken out in the Welsh Marches between the Despensers and certain <b>marcher</b> lords, including Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. Lancaster now took the initiative with the discontented. In 1321 he summoned two meetings of magnates, one at Lancaster's residence of Pontefract in March, and the other at Sherburn in June. The meetings consisted of northern and <b>marcher</b> lords, as well as Lancaster's own retainers, but little assistance was forthcoming from the northerners. The <b>marcher</b> rebellion, {{and the threat of}} civil war, forced the King to exile the younger Despenser, but the favourite was recalled within weeks.|$|E
5|$|In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a {{coalition}} of the Despensers' enemies across the <b>Marcher</b> territories. Edward and Hugh the Younger became aware of these plans in March and headed west, hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis. This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May. The Despensers' lands were quickly seized by {{a coalition}} of the <b>Marcher</b> Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances. Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers. Fearing that he might be deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the <b>Marcher</b> Lords for their actions.|$|E
5|$|In the end {{the fines}} were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had {{nevertheless}} demonstrated an important point. After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of the <b>Marcher</b> lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to the <b>Marcher</b> lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was therefore {{a good opportunity to}} assert the royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.|$|E
50|$|The host {{city itself}} was busy {{dealing with the}} Ontario Hunger <b>Marchers.</b> <b>Marchers</b> were holding meeting in Toronto parks without permits. While the hunger <b>marchers</b> had walked the {{highways}} down to the event, they were sent home via capacity-loaded trucks, as ordered by Premier Mitchell Hepburn, to remove them from the city. These <b>Marchers</b> were so prominent that some children mistook a veteran with a red beret for one.|$|R
5000|$|In Canton, Mississippi, on June 23, {{the march}} was {{attacked}} and tear-gassed by the Mississippi State Police, who {{were joined by}} other police agencies, after <b>marchers</b> tried to erect tents {{on the grounds of}} McNeal Elementary School. This contradicted the governor's commitment to protect them. Leaders felt the violence took place because the president did not offer federal forces to protect them after the violence in Philadelphia. Before that, while relations were often tense, the police had mostly respected the <b>marchers.</b> Several <b>marchers</b> were wounded in this attack, one severely. Human Rights Medical Committee members conducted a house-to-house search that night looking for wounded <b>marchers.</b> The <b>marchers</b> sought refuge at Holy Child Jesus Catholic mission. There the Franciscan sisters extended their help and hospitality to the <b>marchers,</b> especially to the wounded. [...] The following night the <b>marchers</b> returned to McNeal School without incident as they did not attempt to erect their tents.|$|R
50|$|Maryport {{became a}} ghost town. The {{government}} declared West Cumberland a ‘Special Area' but, by 1933, 57.3% of the town's insured workforce was unemployed. 1,684 men {{were out of}} work. Maryport was “for the most part, living on public funds” In 1936 twenty unemployed men marched from Maryport to join the Jarrow Crusade to London. Known as the Maryport <b>Marchers,</b> {{they were joined by}} two <b>marchers</b> from Cleator Moor and two <b>marchers</b> from Frizington. The Maryport <b>Marchers</b> Council organised this.|$|R
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{strategy}} {{for dealing with the}} <b>Marcher</b> Lords, Llywelyn married his eldest son, Dafydd, to Isabella, the daughter of William de Braose, a powerful lord in Brecon, Builth and Abergavenny. The <b>Marcher</b> Lords had adopted a style of stone castle that included circular keeps and an integrated system of curtain walls. Following Dafydd's marriage, Llywelyn appears to have started a second phase of building at Dolbadarn, probably in the 1240s, adding these elements to the existing castle. The prince was probably aiming not only to incorporate the latest military technology, but also to create a castle of equal prestige to those of his new allies in the south. Traditionally the surrounding district of Is Gwyrfai had been run from the town of Llanbeblig; after the 1240s, this role was transferred to Dolbadarn.|$|E
5|$|In December, Edward led {{his army}} across the River Severn and {{advanced}} into the Welsh Marches, where the opposition forces had gathered. The coalition of <b>Marcher</b> Lords crumbled and the Mortimers {{surrendered to the}} King, but Damory, Audley and the Earl of Hereford marched north in January to join Lancaster, who had laid siege the King's castle at Tickhill. Bolstered by fresh reinforcements from the <b>Marcher</b> Lords, Edward pursued them, meeting Lancaster's army on 10 March at Burton-on-Trent. Lancaster, outnumbered, retreated without a fight, fleeing north. Andrew Harclay cornered Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and captured the Earl. Edward and Hugh the Younger met Lancaster at Pontefract, where, after a summary trial, the earl {{was found guilty of}} treason and beheaded.|$|E
5|$|Not {{content with}} his part, Despenser used his {{relationship}} with the king to impinge on the lands of other <b>Marcher</b> lords. This caused resentment among such men as Hereford and Roger Mortimer, who rose up in rebellion in 1321. The rebellion was crushed, but resistance continued under the <b>Marcher</b> lords' ally Thomas of Lancaster, who was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322, and executed. Although this victory temporarily secured Edward's position on the throne, he was eventually deposed in 1326 by Roger Mortimer, {{with the help of the}} king's wife, Isabella of France. The title of Earl of Gloucester was recreated by EdwardII's son EdwardIII in 1337, for Hugh de Audley.|$|E
50|$|Stories {{and legends}} {{have long been}} linked to Manoa Falls. However, {{none other than the}} legend of the Night <b>Marchers</b> evokes shuddering fear from the locals. The Night Marchers-or the Phantom Marchers- are told to be the Spirits of Ancient Hawaiian Warriors. As the legend tells, the direct path of the Night <b>Marchers</b> is the Banyan Tree located in the {{beginning}} of the Manoa Falls Trail. It is said the Night <b>Marchers</b> haunt the Manoa Falls Trail and the sounds of banshee screams can be heard as you hike the trail. If one is ever hiking the Manoa Falls Trail it is important to listen for the sound of Conch Shells, the beating of drums, and the light of torches, for these all mark the arrival of the Night <b>Marchers.</b> If one encounters the arrival of the Night <b>Marchers</b> it is crucial to do the following: crouch low to the ground, rest on stomach, and resist the temptation to look the Night <b>Marchers</b> in the Eye. One real life encounter of the Night <b>Marchers</b> happened in the 1970s when two Hawaiian Fishermen claimed they saw the torches of the Night <b>Marchers.</b> The fishermen were baiting their lines when around 10pm they heard the sound of the conch shell followed by the sight of torches in the distance. The fishermen in response laid down on lava rock and avoided eye contact until the Night <b>Marchers</b> left.|$|R
50|$|In early August 2009, the National Resistance Front {{organised}} a converging national march, {{composed of}} many individual marches from {{different parts of}} Honduras, with convergence in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa on 11 August. As of 9 August, about five thousand <b>marchers</b> who had left Colón and Atlántida on 4 August arrived in El Progreso, Yoro, the town from which de facto President Roberto Micheletti originates. About eight thousand <b>marchers</b> from the Ocotepeque, Lempira, Copán and Santa Bárbara departments were expected to join with these <b>marchers</b> in San Pedro Sula on 11 August. Thousands of other <b>marchers</b> were expected for the Tegucigalpa convergence. The <b>marchers</b> declared their aims to be the restoration of elected President Manuel Zelaya and the establishment of a constituent assembly.|$|R
5000|$|After Meredith {{was shot}} and wounded on the second day, {{and had to be}} hospitalized, other {{prominent}} activists and many <b>marchers</b> joined the effort, taking up his cause. The <b>marchers,</b> including Martin Luther King and Dick Gregory, spent about a week demonstrating in Grenada before moving on. During that time, the town officials appeared cooperative, protecting the <b>marchers</b> with local police.|$|R
5|$|Within {{four years}} of the Battle of Hastings, England had been {{completely}} subjugated by the Normans. William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors along the Welsh border, the boundaries fixed only to the east. This frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie, the Welsh Marches, in which the <b>Marcher</b> Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law. The area of the March varied as {{the fortunes of the}} <b>Marcher</b> Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. The March of Wales, which existed for over 450 years, was abolished under the Acts of Union in 1536.|$|E
5|$|Bohun's {{spent most}} of his early career reconquering <b>Marcher</b> lands {{captured}} by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd during the Welsh war in England. This was finally accomplished through Edward I's war in Wales in 1277. Hereford also fought in Wales in 128283 and 129495. At the same time he also had private feuds with other <b>Marcher</b> lords, and his conflict with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, eventually ended with the personal intervention of King Edward himself. Hereford's final years were marked by the opposition he and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, mounted against the military and fiscal policy of Edward I. The conflict escalated to a point where civil war threatened, but was resolved when the war effort turned towards Scotland. The king signed the Confirmatio Cartaruma confirmation of Magna Cartaand Bohun and Bigod agreed to serve on the Falkirk Campaign. Bohun died in 1298, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.|$|E
5|$|By February 1326, it {{was clear}} that Isabella was {{involved}} in a relationship with the exiled <b>Marcher</b> Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power. The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this had no effect.|$|E
25|$|In late 1933, Gold {{served a}} brief prison {{sentence}} {{after having been}} arrested for participating in a hunger march in Wilmington, Delaware. Hunger marches had been occurring throughout the United States since 1931. Catholic social activist Dorothy Day herself encouraged Gold {{to participate in a}} march from New York City to Washington, D.C. Gold was one of 315 <b>marchers</b> who left New York City on November 29, 1932, bound for Washington. The <b>marchers</b> reached Wilmington on December 2, their number having increased by several hundred. Their permit to march in the city was withdrawn. That night, the police herded most of the <b>marchers</b> into a warehouse downtown, but Gold, most of the women and most of the <b>marchers</b> from New England stayed in a rented church two blocks away. That night, the <b>marchers</b> at the church were refused permission to hold a meeting in the street, so they held it on the church steps. When the police tried to stop the meeting, the <b>marchers</b> resisted. The police began beating the people listening to the speaker, and the <b>marchers</b> fled into the church and barricaded the doors. The police fired tear gas through the windows of the building, then broke down the doors and entered the building with weapons drawn. The <b>marchers</b> resisted by hurling chairs at the police, but were beaten and gassed repeatedly until subdued. Twenty-three <b>marchers,</b> including Gold, were arrested. Four police and three <b>marchers</b> were hospitalized. Gold was convicted of incitement to riot, and served a brief prison term in Wilmington in late 1933 and early 1934. Gold participated in additional hunger marches in 1933 and 1934, and was arrested again in Albany, New York, in late October 1934.|$|R
50|$|In 1984 {{one year}} after Former Senator Ninoy Aquino's assassination, the church became the refuge of {{political}} activist when the <b>marchers</b> commemorating the anniversary of Ninoy's untimely death in a political march called Tarlac-to-Tarmac were prevented from entering Metro Manila by the Philippine military with a barricade on MacArthur Highway, between Meycauayan and Valenzuela towns. Support for the <b>marchers</b> snowballed from the residents of Meycauayan and the nearby towns, and the <b>marchers</b> were given an invitation {{to stay in the}} Church during the standoff. With the outpouring of support for the <b>marchers,</b> the former strongman President Marcos finally allowed the <b>marchers</b> to proceed to the Manila International Airport, the final destination of the march after a day of waiting. In hindsight, it was a small victory for the Filipinos from the former dictator, a precursor of the People Power Revolution.|$|R
50|$|The {{standoff}} {{lasted for}} some time as the sheriff tried to convince the <b>marchers</b> {{to give up their}} march. Although many of the <b>marchers</b> had not yet been to the encampment, the sheriff sent to the encampment to have leaders brought to the scene in an effort to resolve the situation. When many women continued to refuse to leave the road, they were charged with disorderly conduct and taken into custody; some <b>marchers</b> did clear the road and were not charged. One local woman, the wife of a bank president, felt that those blocking the road, not the <b>marchers,</b> should be arrested and she joined the <b>marchers</b> and was charged as well. A total of 54 women were detained; nearly all refused to identify themselves, and so they were held in lieu of bail which they refused to post.|$|R
5|$|David may {{perhaps have}} had {{varying degrees of}} overlordship in parts of Dumfriesshire, Ayrshire, Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire. In the lands between Galloway and the Principality of Cumbria, David {{eventually}} set up large-scale <b>marcher</b> lordships, such as Annandale for Robert de Brus, Cunningham for Hugh de Morville, and possibly Strathgryfe for Walter Fitzalan.|$|E
5|$|Repairs and renovations were {{sometimes}} carried out. When Edward II was threatened in South Gwynedd by the Mortimer <b>Marcher</b> Lord family, he ordered his sheriff, Sir Gruffudd Llywd, {{to extend the}} defences {{leading up to the}} gatehouse with additional towers. Edward, the Black Prince carried out extensive work at Caernarfon after he took over control of the fortification in 1343.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{power in}} Wales was {{unevenly}} applied, {{with the country}} divided between the <b>marcher</b> lords along the borders, royal territories in Pembrokeshire and the more independent native Welsh lords of North Wales. John took a close interest in Wales and knew the country well, visiting every year between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter, Joan, to the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great. The king used the <b>marcher</b> lords and the native Welsh to increase his own territory and power, striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals backed by royal military power with the Welsh rulers. A major royal expedition to enforce these agreements occurred in 1211, after Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the removal of William de Braose, through the Welsh uprising of 1211. John's invasion, striking into the Welsh heartlands, was a military success. Llywelyn came to terms that included an expansion of John's power across much of Wales, albeit only temporarily.|$|E
50|$|Governor Paul Johnson, Jr. of Mississippi {{vowed to}} protect the <b>marchers</b> if they obeyed the law, but {{relations}} between the Highway State Police and <b>marchers</b> were sometimes tense. In some localities, mayors and local officials worked to keep relations peaceful. Local black communities and their churches provided food, housing and places of rest to <b>marchers.</b> They generally camped along the way, after returning to Memphis {{at the end of}} the first days.|$|R

Women can be seen sitting on the float while <b>marchers</b> walk on both sides holding up poles with emblems on the top. More <b>marchers</b> {{can be seen in the}} right {{background}} while spectators watch from the left side of the street...|$|R
50|$|As {{part of a}} {{nationwide}} march organised by the Frente Nacional de Resistencia contra el Golpe de Estado en Honduras {{in opposition to the}} coup d'état, and planned to end as a convergence simultaneously in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula on 11 August, about five thousand <b>marchers</b> who had left the departments Colón and Atlántida on 4 August arrived in El Progreso, Yoro, the town from which de facto President Roberto Micheletti originates. The <b>marchers</b> were welcomed by the local residents. About eight thousand <b>marchers</b> from the departments Ocotepeque, Lempira, Copán and Santa Bárbara are expected to converge with the five thousand from Colón and Atlántida on 11 August in San Pedro Sula, while <b>marchers</b> from other states converge in Tegucigalpa. The <b>marchers</b> demand the restoration of deposed President Manuel Zelaya and the establishment of a national constituent assembly. During a regional summit in Mexico, Obama reiterated his rejection of the coup and his desire to see democratic order restored to Honduras with Zelaya's return to power.|$|R
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established <b>Marcher</b> Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|De Lacy {{witnessed}} charters of the Empress in 1141. During {{the later}} 1140s, de Lacy {{was able to}} recover many of his father's Welsh <b>marcher</b> lands, {{and one of his}} efforts at Ludlow was later embroidered in the medieval romance Fouke le Fitz Waryn. He and Miles of Gloucester were claimants to many of the same lands, and during Stephen's reign were generally {{on opposite sides of the}} succession dispute. In June 1153, de Lacy was in the company of Matilda's son, Henry fitzEmpress, who became King Henry II of England in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy and {{his troops}} were again summoned into the King's service to retake Berwick in 1319, after Scottish forces {{had taken it}} a year earlier. The {{majority}} of the forces from Wales came from the southern <b>Marcher</b> Lords, but Goronwy, Gruffudd Llwyd and Hywel ap Gruffudd ap Geruath led those from {{the northern part of}} the country. Around the same time, as a yeoman of the king, Goronwy was made forester of Snowdon. He remained loyal to Edward II, but following the king's death, he resumed service to Edward III.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, Nichidatsu Fujii {{dispatched}} {{his followers}} to march and chant around the globe {{in support of the}} U.N. 2nd. special session for disarmament. In the U.S. <b>marchers</b> began in New Orleans, L.A. and San Francisco, in Canada <b>marchers</b> began in Montreal and Toronto. The San Francisco March began on Oct. 21, 1981 with a ceremony on Alcatraz. 13 <b>marchers,</b> being Buddhist followers of Nipponzan-Myōhōji, Native Americans, U.S. and German citizens, began the S.F. march. marching about 20 mile per day they were hosted each night by community groups in every town and on Native reservations. many mayors and town councils made proclamations and such honoring the peace and disarmament <b>marchers.</b> Over the course of the march citizens were moved to join. By the time they arrived in Chicago the S.F. <b>marchers</b> numbered about 30. In May 1982 the group of about 40 <b>marchers</b> from Toronto joined the S.F. group in Buffalo N.Y. at the International Peace Bridge doubling the size of the group. Through the state of N.Y. 10 to 20 people joined the march daily. When the S.F. group walked across the George Washington Bridge they numbered about 300. The groups on other march routs also grew over the 7 months. On June 12, 1982, in Central Park Nipponzan-Myōhōji <b>marchers</b> from the U.S.A., Europe, Africa, and Asia, joined with mobilization for survival organizers and religious and peace groups from around the world in a peaceful demonstration for disarmament of many million people.|$|R
50|$|Goals {{differed}} {{among the}} various groups, and the logistics of food and shelter were more difficult to organize for larger groups. But, they negotiated and collaborated, also with some groups expanding the march to achieve community organizing and voter registration in the Delta communities which they reached. National leaders tended to come and go, checking in on the march {{in the midst of}} other responsibilities; some <b>marchers</b> also walked for short periods, while others stayed through most of the journey. With high-spirited gatherings and song, they recruited <b>marchers</b> from local residents, inviting them to join the occasion. The state had promised to provide police protection if the <b>marchers</b> obeyed the law. Many local whites jeered and threatened the <b>marchers,</b> driving near them and waving Confederate flags.|$|R
5000|$|March 7 was a bitterly {{cold day}} in Detroit, and a crowd {{estimated}} at between 3,000 and 5,000 gathered near the Dearborn city limits, {{about a mile}} from the Ford plant. The Detroit Times called it [...] "one of the coldest days of the winter, with a frigid gale whooping out of the northwest". <b>Marchers</b> carried banners reading [...] "Give Us Work, [...] "We Want Bread Not Crumbs", and [...] "Tax the Rich and Feed the Poor". Communist leader Albert Goetz gave a speech, asking that the <b>marchers</b> avoid violence. The march proceeded peacefully along the streets of Detroit until it reached the Dearborn city limits. There, the Dearborn police attempted to stop the march by firing tear gas into the crowd, and began hitting <b>marchers</b> with clubs. One officer fired a gun at the <b>marchers.</b> The crowd scattered into a field covered with stones, and then began throwing stones at the police. The angry <b>marchers</b> regrouped and advanced nearly a mile toward the plant. There, two fire engines began spraying cold water onto the <b>marchers</b> from an overpass. The police were joined by Ford security guards, and began shooting into the crowd. Joe York, Coleman Leny and Joe DeBlasio were killed, and at least 22 others were wounded by gunfire.|$|R
5|$|Loughor Castle was {{constructed}} {{on the western}} edge of the Welsh commote, or land unit, of Gwyr. The castle was built shortly after 1106, when Henry de Beaumont, the Earl of Warwick, was given the Gower Peninsula by Henry I. The Anglo-Norman colonisation of the region followed, with Gower becoming a <b>Marcher</b> territory, enjoying extensive local independence. Loughor Castle was strategically important because it controlled the main road running through Gywr from Beaumont's main base at Swansea Castle, and was a valuable coastal port. The castle took its name from a corruption of the title of the Roman fort.|$|E
5|$|Numerous globes {{purported to}} have been owned by Hitler exist {{throughout}} the world, although the authenticity of many of them is doubtful. There are {{a total of three}} in Berlin, one at a geographical institute, another at the <b>Marcher</b> Museum, and the third at the German Historical Museum. Another two reside in public collections in Munich. Many of the globes show Germany with a bullet hole or simply wiped out, an act committed out of contempt by either Soviet or American soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Sibyl {{was born}} in about 1100 in Brecon Castle, Brecon, Wales, the only {{daughter}} of <b>Marcher</b> Lord Bernard de Neufmarché, Lord of Brecon, and Nest ferch Osbern.
