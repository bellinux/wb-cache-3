But 'Let's All Chant' really put me on the 'map' as a composer, producer and arranger.|$|E
500|$|As the {{psychologist}} and computer scientist Christopher Evans has noted, [...] "One aspect of [...] war record {{that is particularly}} confused, and again typical {{of the mixture of}} glamour and obscurantism which surrounds Hubbard and his past, is the matter of wounds or injuries suffered on active service." [...] Hubbard asserted after the war that he had been [...] "blinded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back... Yet I worked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> fitness and strength in less than two years, using only what I knew about Man and his relationship to the universe." [...] Accounts published by the Church of Scientology asserted that he had been [...] "flown home in the late spring of 1942 in the secretary of the Navy's private plane as the first U.S.-returned casualty from the Far East". A 2006 publication goes further, describing him as [...] "the first American casualty of South Pacific combat".|$|E
2500|$|In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman {{to persuade}} Taylor {{to return to}} the Giants. [...] Bowerman sat in the stands while Taylor was {{pitching}} and negotiated the terms of Taylor's return to the Giants by signing. Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to me with his fingers. I kept shaking my head [...] "No", and Frank kept boosting the money. Soon, I nodded my head [...] "Yes", and that night I was on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York with Frank.|$|E

2500|$|Boyzone {{released}} {{their debut}} single, a cover {{version of the}} Four Seasons' hit [...] "Working <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> You", in 1994 and it reached number three on the Irish Singles Chart. The release of their second single and cover version of the classic Osmonds' hit, [...] "Love Me for a Reason", was their debut elsewhere. It peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart and was included on their 1995 debut album Said and Done. The album reached number one in Ireland and the UK. Boyzone's second album, A Different Beat, was released in 1996 and contained the band's first UK number one single, a cover of the Bee Gees' hit [...] "Words". The album also contained the singles [...] "A Different Beat" [...] and [...] "Isn't It a Wonder". Their third album, Where We Belong, was released in 1998 and it contained the singles [...] "All That I Need", [...] "Baby Can I Hold You" [...] and [...] "No Matter What".

2500|$|The Detroit Spinners {{were also}} signed to the Motown label {{and had a}} hit with the Stevie Wonder-produced song [...] "It's A Shame" [...] in 1970. They left soon after, {{on the advice of}} fellow Detroit native Aretha Franklin, to Atlantic Records, and there had disco hits like [...] "The Rubberband Man" [...] (1976). In 1979, they {{released}} a successful cover of Elton John's [...] "Are You Ready for Love", as well as a medley of the Four Seasons' song [...] "Working <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> You" [...] and Michael Zager's [...] "Forgive Me, Girl". The Four Seasons themselves were briefly signed to Motown's MoWest label, a short-lived subsidiary for R/soul artists based on the West Coast, and there the group produced one album, Chameleon (1972) - to little commercial success in America. However, one single, [...] "The Night", was released in Britain in 1975, and thanks to popularity from the Northern Soul circuit, reached number 7 on the UK Singles Chart. The Four Seasons left Motown in 1974 and went on to have a disco hit with their song [...] "December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)" [...] (1975) for Warner Curb Records.|$|E

Put on my tombs, if you please, The malady which killed this German mans was--Lofely Feench. When I am away from her--gif me your sympathies: I so much want it--I sweat with {{anxiousness}} for young Miss. Your damn-mess-fix about those two brodders {{is a sort}} of perpetual blisters on my mind. Instead of snoring peaceably all night in my nice big English beds, I roll wide awake on my pillows, fidgeting for Feench. I am here to-day before my time. For what? For to try her eyes--you think? Goot Madam, you think wrong! It is not her eyes which troubles me. Her eyes will do. It is You--and the odders at your rectory-place. You make me nervous-anxious about my patients. I am afraid some of you will let the mess-fix of those brodder-twins find its way to her pretty ears, and turn her poor little mind topsy-turvies when I am not near to see to it in time. Will you let her be comfortable-easy for two months more? Ach Gott! if I could only be certain-sure of that, I might leave those weak new eyes of hers to cure themselves, and go <b>my</b> <b>ways</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may be a}} slave a long time," [...] he said, [...] "but {{sooner or}} later I will escape. I will get to speak the {{language}} like a native.

By watching {{for a long time}} I found that my brother had not yet returned, and so I continued to live in a cave beside a valley which my race seldom frequents, awaiting the time that he should come back and free me from Jubal.|$|R

According <b>to</b> Johnny Rogan's book Starmakers & Svengalis, their earnings from these hits was £3,513.

6000|$|Meanwhile the sun {{was shining}} outside; and being very cold in that miserable room, I knocked and shouted till my gaoler came and let me out. He carried me <b>to</b> the <b>back</b> of the house, where was a draw-well, and told me to [...] "wash my face there, if I wanted"; and when that was done, I made the best of <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the kitchen, where he had lit the fire and was making the porridge. The table was laid with two bowls and two horn spoons, but the same single measure of small beer. Perhaps my eye rested on this {{particular}} with some surprise, and perhaps my uncle observed it; for he spoke up as if in answer to my thought, asking me if I would like to drink ale--for so he called it.|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{departed}} on {{my usual}} evening pilgrimage. I entered the flower garden {{by a little}} iron gate, and walked slowly amongst my roses. Here the air was full of delicate scents--lavender insistent; mignonette faint, but penetrating; homely wall-flowers, sweet even as the roses themselves. Night insects now were buzzing around me; the bushes took to themselves phantasmal shapes; even the path, very narrow and overgrown, was hard to find. I filled my hand with flowers and made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the cedar-tree. The shadows were deeper now. It was the one hour of darkness before the rising of the late moon. I threw myself into a low chair, and the flowers on to the seat which encircled the cedar-tree. Oh, wonderful Feurgéres, who had taught me the sweetness of such moments as this! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, citizen, I {{shall have}} to bid you adieu and make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Bath. The nags have had the rest they needed and I cannot spend the night here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Awful dark--isn't it?" [...] said an owl, one night, {{looking in}} upon the {{roosting}} hens in a poultry-house; [...] "don't see how I am to find <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my hollow tree." ...|$|E
60|$|All day {{the wind}} continued; and I {{sat in my}} room and made a feint of reading, or walked up and down, and listened to the riot overhead. Night fell, and I had {{not so much as a}} candle. I began to long for some society, and stole down to the court. It was now plunged in the blue of the first darkness; but the recess was redly lighted by the fire. The wood had been piled high, and was crowned by a shock of flames, which the draught of the chimney brandished to and fro. In this strong and shaken {{brightness}} the Senora continued pacing from wall to wall with disconnected gestures, clasping her hands, stretching forth her arms, throwing back her head as in appeal to heaven. In these disordered movements the beauty and grace of the woman showed more clearly; but there was a light in her eye that struck on me unpleasantly; and when I had looked on awhile in silence, and seemingly unobserved, I turned tail as I had come, and groped <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own chamber.|$|R
6000|$|After viewing it awhile, and {{listening}} to the babble of some children who lay on the grass near by, I resumed my walk, and, meeting a Welshman in the village street, I asked him <b>my</b> nearest <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rhyl. [...] "Dim Sassenach," [...] said he, after a pause. How odd that an hour or two on the railway should have brought me amongst a people who speak no English! Just below the castle, there is an arched stone bridge over the river Clwyd, and the best view of the edifice is from hence. It stands on a gentle eminence, commanding the passage of the river, and two twin round towers rise close beside one another, whence, I suppose, archers have often drawn their bows against the wild Welshmen, on the river-banks. Behind was the line of mountains; and this was the point of defence between the hill country and the lowlands. On the bridge stood a good many idle Welshmen, leaning over the parapet, and looking at some small vessels that had come up the river from the sea. There was the frame of a new vessel on the stocks near by.|$|R
60|$|Her {{letters to}} me--very sad and very short--reported a melancholy state of things at Dimchurch. While I had been away, the dreadful epileptic {{seizures}} had attacked Oscar {{with increasing frequency}} and increasing severity. The moment I could see <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> getting <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England, I wrote to Lucilla to cheer her with the intimation of my return. Two days only before my departure from Paris, I received another letter from her. I was weak enough to be almost afraid to open it. Her writing to me again, when she knew {{that we should be}} re-united at such an early date, suggested that she must have some very startling news to communicate. My mind misgave me that it would prove to be news of the worst sort.|$|R
