5|$|STS-74 was {{the fourth}} <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US/Russian Shuttle-Mir Program, and the second docking of the Space Shuttle with Mir. Space Shuttle Atlantis lifted off from Kennedy Space Center launch pad 39A on 12 November 1995. The mission ended 8 days later with the landing of Atlantis back at Kennedy. It was the second {{in a series of}} seven {{straight}} missions to the station flown by Atlantis.|$|E

5|$|The last Egyptian {{transport}} sailed away on October 5, taking Ibrahim Pasha. Of the 40,000 men he {{had brought}} from Egypt, he was taking back barely 20,000. A few Ottoman soldiers remained in order to hold the different strongholds of the Peloponnese. The next <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French troops was to “give security” to these and hand them back to independent Greece.|$|E
5|$|After sailing for the Clyde {{and back}} to New York in July on its first mercy mission, Blanche F. Sigman moved to its new homeport of Charleston in August 1944. Sailing later that month, the Sigman headed to the Mersey and Liverpool. In October the ship sailed for Gibraltar, Oran, and Leghorn. In December, it {{repeated}} its previous voyage but also stopped at Naples as well, eventually making its way back to Charleston in January 1945. Throughout 1945, the hospital ship made six transatlantic treks, visiting Marseille three times, Naples, Oran, Gibraltar, Milford Haven, Wales, Avonmouth, Cherbourg, and Horta. The Sigmans sixth <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year was a return trip to Cherbourg that ended with a return to its new homeport of New York.|$|E
5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for the <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee}} that the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of chronometers, especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E

5|$|For the Americans, Laos {{became almost}} {{exclusively}} an air war, one which saw {{a reversal of}} the role it played in the conflict in neighboring South Vietnam. In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. The <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{he founded}} {{a mission to}} work with the Asháninka due to {{deforestation}} caused by settlers. He maintained the Cutivereni (alternate spelling Cutivireni) <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ene River parish in the Peruvian Amazon, southeast of Satipo. Cutivereni was a hub for 5,000 Asháninkas who lived in the area. The mission, located at the confluence of three rivers, had 91 buildings and housed 700 people. The mission was equipped with a plaza, a chapel, a generator building, an infirmary, a bilingual school, workshops, and a landing strip. The Asháninka hunted, and farmed manioc other foods. They also grew cocao, a cash-crop.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944 the Currans {{were part}} of a group of British {{scientists}} invited to go to the US to take part in the Manhattan Project – the Allied project to develop an atomic bomb. They joined the British Mission at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in California, headed by Mark Oliphant, a distinguished Australian scientist that Joan knew from the Cavendish Laboratory. Oliphant also acted as de facto deputy to Ernest Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory. The <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laboratory was to develop the electromagnetic isotope separation process to create enriched uranium for use in atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|On December 20, Davis {{was in one}} {{of twelve}} Thunderbolts patrolling Mindoro when eight A6M Zeroes were spotted {{attempting}} to ambush the flight from behind. Davis managed to rake the cockpit of one Zero and kill the pilot, earning him his fifth victory to become a flying ace. Immediately after this, however, Davis' P-47 was stuck by machine-gun fire from another aircraft, damaging the propeller and left wing components. On December 24, on a mission to escort several B-24s on a bombing <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese-held Clark Field at Manila, Davis shot down two more Zeroes, {{part of a group of}} Japanese aircraft attempting to harass the bombers. Davis was awarded a Silver Star for this action.|$|E
5|$|Operation Deny Flight was a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) {{operation}} that began on 12 April 1993 as {{the enforcement of}} a United Nations (UN) no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United Nations and NATO later expanded the <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation to include providing close air support for UN troops in Bosnia and carrying out coercive air strikes against targets in Bosnia. Twelve NATO members contributed forces to the operation and, by its end on 20 December 1995, NATO pilots had flown 100,420 sorties.|$|E

PSLV-C37 {{successfully}} carried and deployed a record 104 satellites in sun-synchronous orbits. Launched on 15 February 2017 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, it broke the earlier record of launching 37 satellites by a Russian Dnepr rocket on 19 June 2014. The cost of the launch was US$15million. According to ISRO, the 101 international satellites were launched {{as part of a}} commercial arrangement between several countries and its commercial arm Antrix Corporation Limited, run {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Government's Department of Space.|$|E
5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
