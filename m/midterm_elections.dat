5|$|Romney campaigned heavily for Republican {{candidates}} in the 2010 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections,</b> raising {{more money than the}} other prospective 2012 Republican presidential candidates.

5|$|Menem {{supported}} the Washington Consensus, and tackled inflation with the Convertibility plan in 1991. The plan was complemented {{by a series}} of privatizations, and was a success. Argentina re-established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, suspended since the 1982 Falklands War, and developed special relations with the United States. The country suffered two terrorist attacks. The Peronist victory in the 1993 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections</b> allowed him to force Alfonsín to sign the Pact of Olivos for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. This amendment allowed Menem to run for re-election in 1995, which he won. A new economic crisis began, and the opposing parties formed a political coalition that won the 1997 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections</b> and the 1999 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro {{continued}} to battle cancer, making repeated visits to hospitals during her {{last year and}} undergoing difficult procedures. Much of her care took place at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where she also acted as an informal advocate for other patients. She {{was able to make}} a joint appearance with Palin on Fox News Channel's coverage of the November 2010 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Emanuel was {{reported}} to have conflicts with other senior members of the president's team and ideological clashes over policy. He was also the focal point of criticism from left-leaning Democrats for the administration's perceived move to the center. By September 2010, with the Democrats anticipating heavy losses in <b>midterm</b> <b>elections,</b> this was said to precipitate Emanuel's departure as chief of staff.|$|E

40|$|Exit polls {{from the}} 2014 <b>midterm</b> <b>election</b> suggest that 4 % of the {{electorate}} identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, representing the highest recorded LGB turnout in a <b>midterm</b> <b>election</b> since 1998. These LGB voters, 75 % in fact, overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates in key congressional races. If LGB people had not voted in the 2014 election, Virginia Senator Mark Warner and Vermont Governor Peter Chumlin would have both been defeated by their Republican challengers.  The strong LGBT support for Democratic candidates becomes even more decisive during close races. This research brief considers {{the impact of the}} LGBT vote in the 2014 <b>midterm</b> <b>election...</b>|$|R
5|$|She {{was elected}} {{national}} senator in the 1995 general elections. She opposed most bills proposed by Menem, {{such as a}} treaty with Chilean president Patricio Aylwin that benefited Chile {{in a dispute over}} the Argentina–Chile border. The Minister of Defense Oscar Camilión was questioned in Congress about the Argentine arms trafficking scandal; Kirchner told him that he had to resign, which he refused to do. As a result, she made a name for herself as a troublemaker. She was removed from the PJ bloc in the Congress in 1997 for misconduct. She resigned her senatorial seat that year and ran for national deputy in the 1997 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections</b> instead. Menem ended his term of office in 1999 and was replaced by Fernando de la Rúa. Kirchner took part in a commission to investigate money laundering with fellow legislator Elisa Carrió, and got into conflicts with her. She ran again for senator in the 2001 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections</b> saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E
5|$|McClellan then {{resisted}} the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders {{to move the}} Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections,</b> he replaced McClellan with Republican Ambrose Burnside. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1998 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections,</b> where the GOP lost five House seats and failed to make a net gain of seats in the Senate, House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia stood down for the speakership and declined to take his seat for an 11th term. In mid-December, Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisianathe former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and the Speaker-designatestated in a dramatic surprise announcement on the House floor that he would not become Speaker, following widely publicized revelations of his extramarital affairs.|$|E
5|$|It was {{suggested}} that she would run for senator for the Buenos Aires Province at the 2017 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections,</b> but her former minister Florencio Randazzo wanted to run for those elections as well. Refusing to run in primary elections, Kirchner asked for a shared ticket as a condition to run for senator. Randazzo did not accept the proposal. The FPV was renamed as the Citizen's Unity Party at the province and registered as a coalition of minor parties only, leaving the PJ out of it. As a result, both parties would run to the elections as unrelated parties.|$|E
5|$|Lavagna {{refused to}} run for senator in the 2005 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections,</b> and criticized the {{overpricing}} of public works managed by Minister of Federal Planning Julio de Vido. As a result, Kirchner asked Lavagna to resign. Finance secretary Guillermo Nielsen, who managed the debt restructuring, also resigned. Felisa Miceli, head of Banco de la Nación Argentina, replaced Lavagna as Minister of Economy. Miceli resigned in 2007, months before the presidential elections, because of a scandal over a bag with {{a large amount of}} money which was found in her office bathroom. She was replaced by Secretary of Industry Miguel Gustavo Peirano.|$|E

5|$|Nixon's agenda {{had been}} impeded {{by the fact}} that Congress was {{controlled}} by Democrats and he hoped {{to take control of the}} Senate in the 1970 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections.</b> Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.|$|E
5|$|Néstor Kirchner {{was elected}} {{president}} in 2003, and Cristina became the First Lady. Under these circumstances, she sought a lower profile in Congress. Néstor Kirchner had a political dispute with the previous president, Eduardo Duhalde. Their dispute continued during the 2005 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections.</b> Without consensus in the PJ for a single candidate for senator of the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their respective wives run for the office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ, and Cristina Kirchner for the Front for Victory. Cristina Kirchner won the election.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections</b> {{took place}} {{a year after}} the crisis with the farmers. The Kirchners were highly unpopular at the time, and people {{rejected}} their policies and governing style. The growing rates of inflation and crime also eroded their public support. Seeking to reverse their declining popularity, Néstor Kirchner led the list for deputy candidates at the Buenos Aires province. He was narrowly defeated by Francisco de Narváez, who led a Peronist faction opposed to the Kirchners. The Kirchners lost the majority of Congress {{as a result of the}} election.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{month of}} the 2010 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections,</b> Obama {{announced}} a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes. The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities {{in both houses of}} Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.|$|E
5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then {{in the third year}} of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections,</b> and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde was {{succeeded by}} Néstor Kirchner on May 25, 2003. Kirchner soon {{distanced himself from}} Duhalde, and removed all the people close to Duhalde from the {{government}} to reduce his political influence. Kirchner also sought supporters from all {{the social and political}} spectra to counter the influence of Duhalde within the party. However, both men delayed an open dispute and stuck together during the 2003 legislative elections, held in October. The dispute continued in the 2005 <b>midterm</b> <b>elections.</b> Without consensus in the PJ for a single candidate for senator of the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their respective wives run for the office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ, and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which was kept by the Kirchners. Cristina Kirchner won those elections.|$|E
