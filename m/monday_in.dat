5|$|Kentucky {{is one of}} {{only five}} U.S. states to hold gubernatorial {{elections}} in odd-numbered years—commonly called an off-year election. Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, and New Jersey also hold off-year gubernatorial elections. The general election for governor and lieutenant governor is held on the first Tuesday after the first <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> November. The governor and lieutenant governor are inaugurated on the fifth Tuesday after their election. This was changed from the fourth Tuesday after the election by the 1850 constitution.|$|E

5|$|The first {{constitution}} of 1803 allowed governors to serve for two three-year terms, limited to six of any eight years, commencing {{on the first}} <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> the December following an election. The current {{constitution of}} 1851 removed the term limit, and shifted {{the start of the}} term to the second <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> January following an election. In 1908, Ohio switched from holding elections in odd-numbered years to even-numbered years, with the preceding governor (from the 1905 election) serving an extra year. A 1957 amendment lengthened the term to four years and allowed governors to only succeed themselves once, having to wait four years after their second term in a row before being allowed to run again. An Ohio Supreme Court ruling in 1973 clarified this to mean governors could theoretically serve unlimited terms, as long as they waited four years after every second term.|$|E
5|$|A {{weekly market}} was {{granted to the}} town by Baldwin de Redvers and the first market took place in 1149 at the {{junction}} of Castle Street and High Street. These weekly markets stopped in 1872 but resumed a century later in a car park next to the town hall, now the site of Saxon Square. When construction of the square began in 1983, the market was moved to a car park in Bank Close. Today it is held every <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> High Street which is then closed to traffic. Periodically there are food fairs and a French market in the town.|$|E

Total views were reported to exceed 8 million by the end of 2007. Ezarik said she earned $2,000 from the video from Revver.|$|E
5|$|Once elected, a {{governor}} serves a four-year term beginning {{on the date}} he is sworn into office; inauguration day is the second <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> January. He remains governor until his successor takes the oath of office. The governor's term can be shorter if he resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or impeached. There is no limit to how many terms {{a governor}} may serve; however, the governor is limited to being elected to two consecutive terms {{at a time and}} may remain in office a maximum of eight years in any twelve-year period. To be eligible to run for a third term, the governor would have to sit out for one election period.|$|E

5|$|The state {{constitution}} of 1912 {{called for the}} election of a governor every two years. The term was increased to four years by a 1968 amendment. The constitution originally included no term limit, but an amendment passed in 1992 allows governors to succeed themselves only once; before this, four governors were elected more than twice in a row. Gubernatorial terms begin on the first <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> the January following the election. Governors who have served the two term limit can run again after four years out of office.|$|E
5|$|Washington was {{admitted}} to the Union on November 11, 1889. The term for governor is four years, commencing on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> the January following the election. If the office of governor is vacant or the governor is unable to discharge their duties, the lieutenant governor assumes the office of governor. If both the offices of governor and lieutenant governor are unable to fulfill their duties, the secretary of state is next in line, and then the treasurer. There is no limit to the number of terms a governor may serve. The office of lieutenant governor is not elected on the same ticket as the governor.|$|E
5|$|Indiana was {{admitted}} to the Union on December 11, 1816. The original 1816 Constitution of Indiana provided for the election of a governor and a lieutenant governor every three years. The second and current constitution of 1851 lengthened terms to four years and set the commencement of the governor's term on the second <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> the January following the election. Governors were allowed to serve for four years in any eight-year period, but this was extended by a 1972 amendment permitting governors to serve for eight years in any twelve-year period. Should the office of governor become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Nine lieutenant governors have succeeded to the governorship. If the office of lieutenant governor is vacant, the president pro tempore of the Indiana Senate becomes governor; this has happened once, when James B. Ray succeeded William Hendricks.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Maryland Senate {{are elected}} every four years, in off-year {{elections}} {{in the middle of}} terms for Presidents of the United States. Party nominations are determined by primary elections. The general election for Senate seats and all other state and federal {{elections in the}} normal cycle is held on the Tuesday after the first <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> November. Should a Senate seat become vacant {{in the middle of a}} term, because of death, illness, incapacitation, disqualification, resignation, or expulsion of a member of the Senate, that seat is filled by appointment. The Central Committee of the previous Senator's party in the county or counties in which the Senate district lies makes a recommendation to the Governor on whom to appoint to the seat. Within fifteen days of the Central Committee's recommendation being selected, the Governor must appoint that person to the vacant seat.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{effectively}} {{became the}} entirety of Rhodesia in 1964 when Northern Rhodesia became independent as Zambia. After Southern Rhodesia's colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, the anniversary became celebrated as Independence Day. The penultimate <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> October was designated Republic Day in 1970 following {{the adoption of a}} republican system of government. All of these holidays were celebrated until 1979, when Rhodesia reconstituted itself under majority rule as the unrecognised state of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. The country's national holidays were replaced soon after with alternatives intended to be more inclusive: President's Day, Unity Day and Ancestors' Day. These were in turn superseded in April 1980, when the country became the recognised state of Zimbabwe. The modern Zimbabwean holiday calendar differs radically from that of Rhodesia, but retains every one of the traditional holidays defined by name in the 1895 Bills of Exchange Regulations, with the exception of Whit Monday.|$|E
5|$|The Florida Constitution of 1838 {{provided}} that a governor be elected every four years, {{who was not}} allowed to serve consecutive terms. The secessionist constitution of 1861 would have reduced this to two years and removed the term limit, but the state fell to the Union before the first election under that constitution. The rejected constitution of 1865 and the ratified constitution of 1868 maintained the four-year term, though without the earlier term limit, which was reintroduced in the 1885 constitution. The current constitution of 1968 states that should the governor serve, or would have served had he not resigned, more than six years in two consecutive terms, he cannot be elected to the succeeding term. The start of a term was set in 1885 at the first Tuesday after the first <b>Monday</b> <b>in</b> the January following the election, where it has remained.|$|E
