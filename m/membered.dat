The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent epoxides, and so are more readily excreted by the organism.|$|E

25|$|Hexacyclic CPT analogues {{have shown}} great potency. For example, {{methylenedioxy}} or ethylenedioxy group connected between 10 and 11 form a 5 or 6 <b>membered</b> ring {{which leads to}} more water-soluble derivates and increased potency. Researches have shown that ethylenedioxy analogues are less potent than methylenedioxy. The reason is the unfavorable steric interactions of ethylenedioxy analogues with the enzyme.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} modification is {{to insert}} a methylene between hydroxyl and lactone on the E-ring yielding a seven <b>membered</b> β-hydroxylactone group, so-called homocamptothecin (hCPT).

This enhances {{the interaction of the}} free hydroxyl group optimally with topo I and the covalent complex that forms in its presence are more stable. The E-ring of hCPT opens more slowly and the opening is irreversible. hCPTs exhibit enhanced human plasma stability because of decreased protein binding and more affinity for red blood cells than CPT.|$|E

25|$|In heterocyclic {{aromatics}} (heteroaromatics), {{one or more}} of {{the atoms}} in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon. This can lessen the ring's aromaticity, and thus (as in the case of furan) increase its reactivity. Other examples include pyridine, pyrazine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, thiophene, and their benzannulated analogs (benzimidazole, for example). In all these examples, the number of π-electrons is 6, due to the π-electrons from the double bonds as well as the two electrons from any lone pair that is in the p-orbital that is in the plane of the aromatic π system. For example, in pyridine, the five sp2-hybridized carbons each have a p-orbital that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring, and each of these p-orbitals contains one π-electron. Additionally, the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and has one electron in a p-orbital, which adds up to 6 p-electrons, thus making pyridine aromatic. The lone pair on the nitrogen is not part of the aromatic π system. Pyrrole and imidazole are both five <b>membered</b> aromatic rings that contain heteroatoms. In pyrrole, each of the four sp2-hybridized carbons contributes one π-electron, and the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and contributes two π-electrons from its lone pair, which occupies a p-orbital. In imidazole, both nitrogens are sp2-hybridized; the one in the double bond contributes one electron and the one which is not in the double bond and is in a lone pair contributes two electrons to the π system.|$|E
