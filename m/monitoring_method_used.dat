40|$|A real-time, vibrations-based {{condition}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> <b>used</b> to detect, localize, {{and identify}} a faulty bearing in an ocean turbine electric motor {{is presented in}} this paper. The electric motor is installed in a dynamometer emulating {{the functions of the}} actual ocean turbine.

Once a defect has been detected, envelope analysis is used to identify the exact bearing containing the defect. After a brief background on bearing fault detection, this paper introduces a simplified mathematical model of the bearing fault, followed with the signal processing approach used to detect, locate, and identify the fault.

40|$|Abstract. There {{are rather}} {{large parts of}} deserts and semi deserts in central Asia, {{belonging}} to the region of drought and semi-drought, with little annual precipitation and sharp change of daily and seasonal temperature change. This region is the concerning ecological fragile region {{in the study of}} global environmental change. The paper analyzed the landscape characteristics of desertification and soil desertification in the study area, as well as their relationship Based on the high-resolution TM image. And then, the 1 km spatial resolution NOAA/AVHRR image was used to acquire the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The vegetation coverage was estimated to ensure the monitoring index of desertification. The NDVI graph was overlapped with the image to set up the interpretation relationship between the ground objects and remote sensing features, {{on the basis of the}} relevant technique standards of desertification monitoring, its classification method, as well as the actual conditions. From the desertification interpretation, the area and degree of desertification could be monitored to analyze the changing trend of desertification in central Asia from 1989 to 2009.

40|$|This is an {{exploratory}} investigation on the self-sensing capabilities of nano-enriched glass/fibre laminates for damage detection purposes through {{changes in the}} dynamic responses, which are estimated by measuring the changes in voltage due to a dynamic strain. The deformation of the nano-enriched structure introduces changes in the resistance/voltage of the nanocomposites. The measured voltage signals contain information of the vibratory response of the laminated beam. This research uses a vibration-based data driven methodology for damage detection applied for the estimated vibratory signals using the conductivity properties of the embedded nano-particles. The structure considered {{in this study is}} a glass/fibre laminated beam enriched with carbon black nanoparticles (CB). The structure is subjected to a direct electric current and the voltage signal is measured. The vibration based <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> <b>used</b> is generally based on singular spectrum analysis applied on the estimated vibratory response. The voltage response signal is divided into a certain number of principal components which contain the oscillatory components distributed by their content of variance in the voltage signal. The components with more variance are used to define a reference state based on the status of the healthy structure. Consequently, the estimated vibratory signals from beams with a simulated damage are compared to the healthy state which eventually results in the damage detection procedure. The damage was simulated firstly by adding an additional mass on the beam tip and secondly by drilling a hole on the beam tip. The results demonstrate the potential for using the voltage estimated vibratory signals for self-sensing damage detection purposes in carbon nano-enriched glass/bre structures...|$|E

40|$|Independent {{component}} analysis (ICA) {{is an effective}} feature extraction tool for process monitoring. However, the conventional ICA-based process <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> usually adopt noise-free ICA models and thus may perform unsatisfactorily under the adverse effects of the measurement noise. In this paper, a process <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> <b>using</b> a new noisy independent {{component analysis}}, referred to as NoisyICAn, is proposed. Using the noisy ICA model which considers the measurement noise explicitly, a NoisyICAn algorithm is developed to estimate the mixing matrix by setting {{up a series of}} the fourthorder cumulant matrices of the measured data and performing the joint diagonalization of these matrices. The kurtosis relationships of the independent components and measured variables are subsequently obtained based on the estimated mixing matrix, for recursively estimating the kurtosis of independent components. Two monitoring statistics are then built to detect process faults using the obtained recursive estimate of the independent components' kurtosis. The simulation studies are carried out on a simple three-variable system and a continuous stirred tank reactor system, and the results obtained demonstrate that the proposed NoisyICAn-based <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> outperforms the conventional noise-free ICA-based <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> as well as the benchmark <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> based on the existing noisy ICA schemes adopted from blind source separation, in terms of the fault detection time and local fault detection rate...|$|R

40|$|A kernel {{independent}} {{component analysis}} (KICA) {{is widely regarded}} as an effective approach for nonlinear and non-Gaussian process monitoring. However, the KICA-based <b>monitoring</b> <b>methods</b> treat every KIC equally and cannot highlight the useful KICs associated with fault information. Consequently, fault information may not be explored effectively, which may result in degraded fault detection performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a new nonlinear and non-Gaussian process <b>monitoring</b> <b>method</b> <b>using</b> Gaussian mixture model (GMM) -based weighted KICA (WKICA). In particular, in WKICA, GMM is first adopted to estimate the probabilities of the KICs extracted by KICA.

A nonlinear contribution plots method is also developed based on the idea of a sensitivity analysis to help identifying the fault variables after a fault is detected. Simulation studies conducted on a simple four-variable nonlinear system and the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional KICA-based method...|$|R
