WSU users can access the article via IEEE Xplore database licensed by University Libraries: [URL] increasing interest in supporting the nomadic nature of mobile nodes has lead to interesting ideas towards the deployment of Internet access to ad-hoc nodes. Most of the proposed solutions using mobile IP assume that the <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> is located adjacent to the ad-hoc domain. The current work differs from others in that it assumes a separation between the ad-hoc domain and the <b>mobility</b> <b>agent.</b> Mobile IP requires establishing layer- 2 connectivity between the mobile device and the <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> to provide mobility support. This paper proposes using a gateway and a layer 2 tunneling protocol version 3 (L 2 TPv 3) based tunnel between the ad-hoc domain and the <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> to provide Internet connectivity.

40|$|As {{the number}} of mobile nodes {{registering}} with a network rapidly increases in Mobile IP, multiple mobility (home of foreign) agents can be allocated to a network {{in order to improve}} performance and availability. Previous fault tolerant schemes (denoted by PRT schemes) to mask failures of the mobility agents use passive replication techniques. However, they result in high failure-free latency during registration process if {{the number of}} mobility agents in the same network increases, and force each <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> to manage bindings of all the mobile nodes registering with its network. In this paper, we present a new fault-tolerant scheme (denoted by CML scheme) using checkpointing and message logging techniques. The CML scheme achieves low failure-free latency even if the number of mobility agents in a network increases, and improves scalability to a large number of mobile nodes registering with each network compared with the PRT schemes. Additionally, the CML scheme allows each failed <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> to recover bindings of the mobile nodes registering with the <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> when it is repaired even if all the other mobility agents in the same network concurrently fail...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel and efficient multicast algorithm that aims at reducing delay and communication {{cost for the}} registration between mobile nodes and <b>mobility</b> <b>agents</b> and solicitation for foreign agent services based on Mobile IP. The protocol applies anycast group technology to support multicast transmissions for both mobile nodes and home/foreign agents. Mobile hosts use anycast tunneling to connect to the nearest available home/foreign agent where an agent is able to forward the multicast messages by selecting anycast route to a multicast router so as to reduce end-to-end delay. The performance analysis and experiments demonstrated that our algorithm is able to enhance the performance over existing remote subscription and bi-directional tunneling approaches regardless of the locations of mobile nodes.

40|$|Compared {{with the}} U. S., Japan is {{believed}} to have a collectivist culture that nurtures high trust. Results from laboratory and survey research, however, show that Americans are more likely to trust strangers than are Japanese. Why would trust be lower in a collectivist culture? We use an agent-based computational model to explore the evolutionary origin of this puzzling empirical finding. Computer simulations suggest that higher social mobility in the U. S. may be the explanation. With low <b>mobility,</b> <b>agents</b> rarely encounter strangers and thus remain highly parochial, trusting only their neighbors and avoiding open-market transactions with outsiders. With moderate <b>mobility,</b> <b>agents</b> learn to read telltale signs of character so that they can take advantage of better opportunities outside the neighborhood. However, if mobility is too great, there is too little trustworthiness to make the effort to discriminate worthwhile. This finding suggests that higher mobility in the U.

40|$|A {{foreseeable}} {{scenario is}} where, on the Internet, Mobile IPv 6 is deployed {{and a large}} percentage of the clients are mobile nodes. These mobile clients will communicate with large servers, which under the point of view of Mobile IPv 6 will be Correspondent Nodes. In Mobile IPv 6 if a mobile node wants to communicate with a Correspondent Node directly (Route Optimization) it must perform the Return Routability procedure which includes sending and receiving signaling messages, cryptographic calculations and storing a state. This procedure must be performed for each mobile client connection and for each handover. The Return Routability procedure would introduce a very significant load on these servers. Moreover the servers must be modified in order to support the Route Optimization of Mobile IPv 6. These issues may be a drawback for the deployment of Mobile IPv 6. In this paper we propose <b>Mobility</b> <b>Agents,</b> a centralized solution that performs Route Optimization on behalf the Correspondent Nodes. <b>Mobility</b> <b>Agents</b> reduce the deployment cost, do not require modifying the servers, they are compatible with NEMO and other mobility protocols.

40|$|In {{this study}} the Fast Hinted Cell Switching {{movement}} detection method for Mobile IP is introduced. This method {{assumes that the}} Link-Layer is capable of delivering information to Mobile IP regarding {{the identity of the}} local <b>mobility</b> <b>agent.</b> This tends to negate the need for Mobile IP movement detection as well as agent discovery and leads to accelerated Mobile IP hand-offs. Moreover, the existence of Link-Layer information renders the presence of periodic <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> broadcast advertisements as unnecessary which enables a more efficient utilisation of the network capacity. The performance of the proposed solution is experimentally compared against that of Eager Cell Switching that is considered the fastest of traditional Mobile IP movement detection methods. The scenarios investigated involve straight line movement patterns and Mobile IP hand-offs between Foreign Agents that provide wireless network connectivity through IEEE 802. 11 b Wireless LAN standard, compliant hardware. The IEEE 802. 11 SSID field was utilised to contain information important to Mobile IP such as the identity of the local <b>mobility</b> <b>agent.</b> The overlying communication involves a unidirectional GSM audio stream directed to the mobile node.

40|$|AbstractÐFor a PCS {{network to}} {{effectively}} deliver services to its mobile users, {{it must have}} {{an efficient way to}} keep track of the mobile users. The location management fulfills this task through location registration and paging. To reduce the signaling traffic, many schemes such as Local Anchor (LA) scheme, per-user caching scheme and pointer forwarding scheme have been proposed in the past. In this paper, we present a new location management scheme which intends to mitigate the signaling traffic as well as reduce the tracking delay in the PCS systems. In this strategy, we choose a set of VLRs traversed by users as the <b>Mobility</b> <b>Agents</b> (MA), which form another level of management in order to make some registration signaling traffic localized. The idea is as follows: Instead of always updating to the HLR, which would become the bottleneck otherwise, many location updates are carried out in the <b>mobility</b> <b>agents.</b> Thus, the two-level pointer forwarding scheme is designed to reduce the signaling traffic: Pointers can be set up between VLRs as the traditional pointer forwarding scheme and can also be set up between MAs. The numerical results show that this strategy can significantly reduce the network signaling traffic for users with low CMR without increasing much of the call setup delay.

WSU users can access the article via IEEE Xplore database licensed by University Libraries: [URL] the past few years support for mobility has increased to a large extent. Mobile IP enables nodes to move from one network to the other while maintaining the same IP address. Minimal packet loss during handoff is a requirement for provisioning QoS for real-time applications. However, loss of packets during handoff and the best effort service offered by the Internet degrades the quality of applications such as voice and video. High-speed mobility such as those in trains and vehicles further deteriorates the services of such time critical applications. In this paper, the authors propose a new handoff technique based on location tracking by wireless sensor networks. Networks of such sensors perform movement detection of mobile nodes in a particular direction and inform the <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> to which the mobile node is attached. This agent looks up the new <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> determination table and informs the new agent to which the node is moving. Based on entries in the proposed IP-QoS mapping table, old <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> also informs the new agent about the mobile nodes traffic characteristics so it can make reservations in advance.

Each agent keeps in its buffer all packets {{that are likely}} to be requested by any of its mobile nodes.

When a mobile node moves to another subnet, transmission errors tend to happen in bursts, because the two subnets have differential transmission delays from the sender. We propose a new scalable buffer management scheme taking into account this fact. Under our scheme, mobile nodes do not acknowledge for every correctly received packet to their local mobility agent; instead, they send infrequent feedbacks to their agent. The feedback schedule of each mobile node is adaptive to their transmission error patterns. The mobility agents can also perform adaptive packet discarding based on the feedbacks.

Cur-rent mobility management protocols, such as the Mo-bile IP, as dened in RFC 2002, do not scale well into these requirements. Mobile IP employs mobility agents called home agent and foreign agent to support Internet-wide mobility. We present a distribution of the <b>mobility</b> <b>agent</b> functionalities into fully scalable, arbitrarily deep tree hierarchies of foreign agents. We show that by distributing part of the functional-ity of the home agent into the foreign network we in-crease the performance signicantly and securely. Our performance measurements show that the reduction of network latency, due to signaling locality in the hierar-chical mode, enables faster location update frequencies than in a RFC 2002 -compliant non-hierarchical mode.
