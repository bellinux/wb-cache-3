40|$|Review of EU {{subsidies}} in {{the fruit}} and vegetable sector Although {{the fruit and}} vegetable sector is not formally part of the CAP mid-term review, it is proposed to replace {{the current system of}} support through producer organisations and export refunds with an annual flat-rate payment of € 100 per hectare for a <b>maximum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>area</b> of 800, 000 hectares, divided into national guaranteed areas. This could be topped up by an annual maximum amount of € 109 per hectare by member states. This USDA briefing points out that since the start of marketing year 2000 / 01 aid for fruit and vegetables intended for processing have been paid directly to the producer organisations and no longer to the processors and that as a consequence the new arrangements have made the fixing of a minimum price obsolete. In 2003 production aid to processed tomatoes is set at € 279 million a 25 % increase over 2001, while aid for processing fruit-based products is set at € 86 million, a 21 % increase over 2001, and aid for citrus fruit is set at € 249 million, a 46. 5 % increase over 2001. It should be noted that fruit processors may also be eligible for support under EU rural-development programmes. However these programmes are non-product specific and it is therefore impossible to determine the level of support being extended to specific types of processors under these programmes. The briefing also notes that fruit and vegetable grower may also benefit from member states' aid measures (e. g. the greenhouse sector in the Netherlands). The EU also grants financial support for the promotion of EU agricultural products, including fruit and vegetables on the internal market and third-country markets, with such promotional measures being part-financed by the EU (50 %), part by the member states (20 %) and part by the producer organisation (30 %). Comment: The current trends in the fruit and vegetable sector exemplify the low-profile nature of many aspects of the CAP and the extent of the fallacy which claims that reform results in lower levels of public-sector support.

30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the {{streaming}} services are the ones with the highest volume, having the highest data rate; the minimum guaranteed data rate varies between 0.58 and 2.71  Gbps. The data rate allocated to this class in low load (when there are only 300 subscribers) is 67 % of the <b>maximum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> one, but it reduces to the minimum one (i.e., 50 % of the contracted data rate) for the maximum load case. The other service classes (i.e., interactive, conversational and background) are served according to capacity needs. It {{can be seen}} that, in the low load situation, the <b>maximum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> data rates are assigned, but as demand increases, data rates move towards the lower boundary. The interactive service class is a very good example for this behaviour: while it receives the <b>maximum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> data rate of 0.54  Gbps in low load, the allocated capacity for the high one is reduced from the maximum to 1.45  Gbps, the minimum guaranteed data rate. Considering the slope of allocated data rates in various services, the effect of serving weights and the service volume can be seen. Since the interactive class has a lower serving weight compared to the conversational one, it receives almost the minimum acceptable data rate with 1100 subscribers; in the same situation, conversational services are still provided by the highest acceptable data rate.|$|R

Both should be bounded to a certain limit, RL to ensure reliable clock recovery and RD to limit baseline wander. In a previous paper, we presented a very low overhead line coding with <b>guaranteed</b> <b>maximum</b> run length. In this paper, we propose a low overhead technique to bound the running disparity that can do up to 10 x better than existing encodings in terms of overhead and for the same RD bounds.

30|$|Since network {{capacity}} is considerably {{higher than the}} minimum guaranteed data rates, best effort services are also served well; the allocation of 2.39  Gbps to VNO BE is the evidence to this claim.

The reason behind this observation is the <b>maximum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> data rate of the guaranteed services.

30|$|We first {{consider}} homogeneous traffic for two cases; one {{in which}} we consider that all the SUs are elastic users with flexible rate requirements and {{one in which}} we assume that all the SUs are streaming users which correspond to the real-time transfer of various signals (e.g., voice, streaming audio/video) that requires a <b>maximum</b> <b>guaranteed</b> average delay. Simulation results show that streaming traffic achieve higher throughput than of the elastic traffic for both PF and max–min fairness. This results from the fact that, for streaming applications, stringent transmission rate guarantees are necessary to ensure real-time communication. Our results also indicate that resource allocation solutions are fairer for the streaming traffic in comparison to elastic users.|$|R
