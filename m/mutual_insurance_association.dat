We show that in equilibrium, participants in larger partnerships keep a smaller share of their own proceeds. We test and confirm this prediction using a sample of partners in law firms. ...|$|R

40|$|On August 18, 1990, President Bush {{signed into}} law the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), the most {{comprehensive}} federal legislation ever dealing with oil spill liability, compensation, prevention, response and research. Upper limits on shipowners and operators' liability are set under OPA, but are somewhat artificial and can be overidden by individual states choosing to impose unlimited liability. Consequently, <b>mutual</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>associations</b> are refusing to provide the required financial guaranties needed to acquire the Certificates of financial responsibility, basing their refusal on an interpretation that OPA grants unlimited liability for oil pollution claims. The purpose of this thesis {{is to focus on}} the potential exposure of charterers and cargo owners who are not specifically mentioned in the Act. If U. S. courts classify them as "operators", the whole oil industry is threatened. The U.

5000|$|It is {{perfectly}} consistent {{to say that}} a tax avoidance scheme escapes tax (there being no provision to impose a tax charge) and yet constitutes the avoidance of tax.
