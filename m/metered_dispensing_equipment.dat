40|$|This thesis for the Master of Science degree was {{performed}} at Oppunda Electronics AB. The assignment was to further develop an existing prototype of a <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment</b> doses {{a kind of}} glue, bonding which dentist use to mend teeth. The <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment</b> is adjusted to dose 12 micro litres of bonding. With the <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment</b> SafeBond Electronic the user can reduce the bonding consumption with approximately 50 percent. Furthermore will {{the handling of the}} bonding be more hygienic, because the photoelectric sensor allows the user to start a dosage without touching any part of the <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The main requirements for the development was {{to reduce the size of}} the existing prototype and implement functions to makeit possible to change the dose time and display the current dose time. Some parts and components have been replaced and reorganized to reduce the size of the dispenser. The choice of a steep motor, which makes the rotation when a dosage is performed, is the largest contribution to shrink the size of the equipment. Also the new designed circuit board makes it possible to reduce the size of the <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment.</b> A LCD is used to show the current dose time. The LCD is a part of a LCD module. To change the dosing time two push buttons are being used. A microcontroller is controlling the steep motor. The microcontroller is a PIC 16 F 877 A from Microchip. The microcontroller in the <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment</b> is controlling all the functions. The program code is designed to function in an interrupt routine. This makes it possible to set the processor in a sleep mode when the dispenser is not in use and decrease the power consumption. More functions have been implemented in the dispenser and it is now more suitable for itsassignment. In the mean time it has been possible to reduce the size of the equipment. The chosen parts andcomponents make a good price function ratio. During the product development a lot of documentations have been done. Which make the <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment</b> ready to be implemented in production...|$|R

25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. <b>Dispense</b> <b>equipment</b> consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of <b>dispense</b> <b>equipment</b> components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and wollastonite.|$|R

50|$|The {{game has}} {{declined}} {{not only because}} of the demise of old-style amusement parks, but also the age of the machines themselves. The heart of the system relied on relays used in telephone system, which have long been obsolete; moreover, manufacturers of the tables have long ago shut down, so spare parts have to be salvaged from old tables. Operation is also labor-intensive, with at least three employees (often more) at a time required to run a game.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the development of}} an innovative conformal phosphor deposition method. Several existing conformal phosphor deposition methods are compared and discussed first. Afterwards, a new 'quasi-conformal phosphor dispensing' method is proposed. This method uses conventional dispersed phosphor <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment</b> without any modification. The only requirements are the control of phosphor concentration/volume and the mounting of an additional platform underneath the LED chip. In this paper, the packaging structure and the implementing procedure of the quasi-conformal phosphor dispensing method are demonstrated in detail. In addition, the optical performance of prototypes is characterized and compared to that of matching conventional packages. Furthermore, the impact on production cost is also discussed. Compared with the conventional dispersed phosphor deposition method, more than 50 % of phosphor saving could be achieved with the proposed new method. Such a saving is considered essential for the cost reduction in LED manufacturing. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|There are but {{a handful}} of {{systematic}} studies on the history of automated teller machines (ATMs) yet all fail {{to address the issue of}} paternity while perpetrating ‘common wisdom’ beliefs. This article looks at the birth of currency <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment,</b> the immediate predecessor to the ATM. At the simplest level, at least four separate instance of innovation can reasonably claim to be the origin of the concept. However, the question as to who invented it is less illuminating than an understanding of the process of innovation itself and how these competing families developed into the modern conception of an ATM. Our research supports the view of user-driven innovation as surviving business records and oral histories tell of close involvement of bank staff in establishing requirements and choosing amongst alternative solutions in the implementation of first generation technology. This case thus shows greater understanding in the user’s role in shaping and directing technological development. ...|$|R
50|$|SMA {{is mixed}} {{and placed in}} the same plant as that used with {{conventional}} hot mix. In batch plants, the fibre additive is added direct to the pugmill using individually wrapped press packs or bulk <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment.</b> Mixing times may be extended ensure that fibre is homogeneously distributed throughout the mix and temperatures controlled in order to avoid overheating or damage to the fibre. In drum plants, particular care must be taken to ensure that both the additional filler content and fibre additive are incorporated into the mixture without excessive losses through the dust extraction system. Filler systems that add filler directly into the drum rather than aggregate feed are preferred. Pelletised fibres may be added through systems designed for addition of recycled materials, but a more effective means is addition through a special delivery line that is combined with the bitumen delivery, so that the fibre is captured by bitumen at the point of addition to the mixture.|$|R
40|$|The need to <b>meter</b> and <b>dispense</b> dry powders or {{mixtures}} of powders {{occurs in a}} wide range of processes and industries. These include the preparation of pharmaceutical products, the mixing of pigments for paints, inks and glazes, the incorporation of processing additives and pigments into polymer processing lines such as extrusion and in solid freeforming processes. This short review identifies the common features of powder handling in these widely different areas and seeks to distinguish and classify the various principles. Examples are given of designs that span a range of industries. This review is stimulated by current developments in the selective laser sintering of powder assemblies; a solid freeforming pathway for polymer, ceramic and metal prototyping and manufacturing. The goal is to find <b>metering</b> and <b>dispensing</b> systems that are effective in providing the spatial arrangement of composition.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the perceptions and early experiences associated with a recent trend in the United States 2 ̆ 7 foodservice and wine industry: wine-on-tap. Three study populations were investigated: wine consumers, restaurant and winery professionals. Contrary to expectations driven by literature and the diffusion of other wine product innovations, American wine consumers showed interest in trying wine-on-tap, stating that the main reason for non-adoption was limited availability. Early adopters, across the three study populations, reported positive experiences and acknowledged several benefits of wine-on-tap such as improved freshness, better value, improved eco-friendliness, and premium wine quality. However, kegging wine and serving kegged wine appear to be more complex than it seems at first.

Additionally, keg logistics and the perceived, yet controversial, need to overcome guests 2 ̆ 7 resistance seem to slow down the diffusion.

40|$|Dispensing {{solder paste}} with {{automated}} <b>dispensing</b> <b>equipment</b> provides many challenges {{that must be}} overcome before a production process can be considered robust. The primary challenge to overcome is the tendency for solder paste to plug in dispensing pumps and needles. This paper outlines the important process parameters that must be determined and controlled for good production robustness, including the selection of valve or pump technology, selection of dispensing needles, selection of solder paste packaging, generic equipment settings, and paste formulation. In particular, the effect and interdependence of solder paste mesh size, % metal content, and alloy of metal is discussed. Many production facilities have overcome these problems, only to have them re-appear when switching to a lead free solder formulation. This paper {{will focus on the}} formulation of solder paste for robust dispensing and how that formulation must be altered when lead free alloys are used.
