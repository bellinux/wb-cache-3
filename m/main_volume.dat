5|$|Over the centuries, {{the book}} has been rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some {{illustrations}} being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the <b>main</b> <b>volume.</b> In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened at a major decorated page, and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>volume</b> {{of water}} from the Ganges River began flowing through the Padma channel in the sixteenth century. Silt from the Padma helped in {{building}} up the southern portion of north Bengal. This is the most plausible explanation for the existence of a depression around Chalan Beel. The Teesta was active in the region until it changed its course in 1787. This territory lies in between the land raised in the north by the Teesta system when it was active and that in the south by the Padma.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his fiction, the exiled Eliade authored several volumes of memoirs and diaries and travel writings. They were published sporadically, and covered various stages of his life. One of the earliest such pieces was India, grouping accounts of the travels he made through the Indian subcontinent. Writing for the Spanish journal La Vanguardia, commentator Sergio Vila-Sanjuán described {{the first volume of}} Eliade's Autobiography (covering the years 1907 to 1937) as [...] "a great book", while noting that the other <b>main</b> <b>volume</b> was [...] "more conventional and insincere."

2500|$|When Boy was {{informed}} of the situation he immediately managed to have the repayment postponed and {{wrote a letter to}} the Swedish monarch who happened to be in Kalmar. The infuriated king {{wrote a letter to the}} Duke of Alba to have the monument sent to Sweden. [...] Furthermore, to ensure Dutch merchants in Sweden would support his cause, he threatened to free them from their favoured position and demanded that they produce a security at least equal to the value of the monument. The Dutch magistrates eventually backed down and Boy was given a respite. The sarcophagus was safely delivered to Uppsala in 1583.

2500|$|Architecturally, the Gillender Building, {{designed}} by Charles I. Berg and Edward H. Clark, belonged to [...] "a series of elegant towers in various classical modes erected in New York in the 1890s" [...] {{and is now}} considered [...] "a notable example" [...] of its period along with the Central Bank Building (William Birkmire, 1897, demolished) and the American Surety Building (Bruce Price, 1894–1896, extant). Structurally, {{it was based on}} fully wind-braced steel frame with masonry infill. The <b>main</b> <b>volume</b> of the tower rose to [...] without setbacks, with a three-story cupola crown reaching [...] The New York Times erroneously called Gillender the [...] "highest office structure in the world", although the earlier Manhattan Life Insurance Building (1894) was taller at [...] Berg and Clerk followed the Italian rule of triple vertical partitioning: expensive decoration was limited to the three bottom floors (what the pedestrians see from the street) and the upper two floors and the crowning tower. Massive cornices above the second and third floors visually separated the lower levels from the clean wall surface stretching above up until the fourteenth floor; starting from the ninth floor, it gradually re-acquired ornaments and arched windows as if in anticipation of the ornate Italian Baroque cupola above.|$|E

60|$|The Neckar is in {{many places}} so narrow that a person can throw a dog across it, if he has one; when it is also sharply curved in such places, the raftsman has to do some pretty nice snug {{piloting}} to make the turns. The river is not always allowed to spread over its whole bed--which is as much as thirty, and sometimes forty yards wide--but is split into three equal bodies of water, by stone dikes which throw the <b>main</b> <b>volume,</b> depth, and current into the central one. In low water these neat narrow-edged dikes project four or five inches above the surface, like the comb of a submerged roof, but in high water they are overflowed. A hatful of rain makes high water in the Neckar, and a basketful produces an overflow.|$|E

50|$|To prevent {{digital signal}} {{overflow}} and its audible result, the digital output volume {{must be kept}} low enough so that bit 14 will never be used. On the first generation MT-32, this can simply be done by selecting a lower <b>main</b> <b>volume</b> on the unit's front panel, which directly controls the software <b>main</b> <b>volume</b> setting, which in turn directly translates into the amplitude of the digital output signal. On later generation units, this does not work, as the <b>main</b> <b>volume</b> knob and the software <b>main</b> <b>volume</b> setting only modify {{the volume of the}} analogue output using voltage-controlled amplifiers and have little effect on the amplitude of the digital signal. To prevent signal overflow, each individual part's volume (controller #7) must be kept low instead.|$|E
