5|$|Although ministers are {{entitled}} to obtain views from other departments or ministries when making decisions, they <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> objections and not disable themselves from exercising their discretion. In H. Lavender and Son Ltd. v. Minister of Housing and Local Government (1969), the Housing Minister's decision was quashed because he had, by his stated policy, delegated to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the effective decision on any appeal where the latter had an objection.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} concepts {{have been}} used for decompression modelling. The first assumes that dissolved gas is eliminated while in the dissolved phase, and that bubbles are not formed during asymptomatic decompression. The second, which is supported by experimental observation, assumes that bubbles are formed during most asymptomatic decompressions, and that gas elimination <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> both dissolved and bubble phases.|$|E

Factors such as lifestyle, personalities, opinions, activities {{and interests of}} its potential consumers <b>must</b> <b>considered</b> (Schlanger & Maas, 2013).

5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{construction is}} a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a luthier makes only stringed instruments. Some make only {{one type of}} instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of game theory as a {{mathematical}} discipline. Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928. This theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves {{that have taken place}} so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E
30|$|Any {{analysis}} about transport modes <b>must</b> <b>considers</b> {{two fundamental}} parameters they are speed and energy intensity. Increasing speed increases social efficiency and allows reducing costs for {{both public and}} private institutions and for citizens. On the other side, energy consumption causes economic, environmental and social costs.|$|R
50|$|When {{examining}} {{probative value}} several factors <b>must</b> be <b>considered.</b> First, the court must examine {{the strength of}} the evidence in showing that the past events actually occurred. The credibility of the witness <b>must</b> be <b>considered</b> and if there is any motive to lie must have an effect.|$|R

This motivates the subscripts [...] and [...] for identifying the null basis vectors.|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} a variety of visual {{repellent}} and harassment techniques used in airport wildlife management. They include using birds of prey and dogs, effigies, and lasers. Birds of prey have been used with great effectiveness at landfills were there were large populations of feeding gulls (Cook et al. 2008). Dogs have also been used with success as visual deterrents and means of harassment for birds at airfields (DeVault et al. 2013). However airport wildlife managers <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> the risk of knowingly releasing animals in the airport environment. Both birds of prey and dogs must be monitored by a handler when deployed and must be cared for, when not deployed. Airport wildlife managers <b>must</b> <b>consider</b> the economics of these methods (Seamans 2001).|$|E
