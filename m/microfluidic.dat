25|$|With the {{development}} of microfabrication and nanotechnology, the study of microfluidics and nanofluidics is drawing more attention. Research on <b>microfluidic</b> found its advantages in DNA analysis, lab-on-a-chip, and micro-TAS. Devices in a <b>microfluidic</b> system include channels, valves, mixers, and pumps. Integration of these <b>microfluidic</b> devices enables sorting, transporting, and mixing of substances within fluids. However, the failure of moving parts in these systems is usually the critical issue and the main drawback. Mechanisms to control flow without using mechanical parts are always desired for reliability and lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Also, lately, <b>microfluidic</b> {{devices have}} been more and more {{frequently}} used to test quantitatively, and precisely, for chemotaxis.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>microfluidic</b> qPCR methods are {{providing}} a flow cytometry-like method of quantifying 48 or more RNA molecules per cell.|$|E

5000|$|Droplet-based <b>microfluidics</b> is a {{subcategory}} of <b>microfluidics</b> {{in contrast}} with continuous microfluidics; droplet-based <b>microfluidics</b> manipulates discrete volumes of fluids in immiscible phases with low Reynolds number and laminar flow regimes. Interest in droplet-based <b>microfluidics</b> systems has been growing substantially in past decades. Microdroplets allow for handling miniature volumes (μl to fl) of fluids conveniently, provide better mixing, encapsulation, sorting, and sensing, and suit high throughput experiments. Exploiting the benefits of droplet-based <b>microfluidics</b> efficiently requires a deep understanding droplet generation [...] to perform various logical operations such as droplet motion, droplet sorting, droplet merging, and droplet breakup.|$|R
50|$|An {{interesting}} approach combining electrokinetic {{phenomena and}} <b>microfluidics</b> is digital <b>microfluidics.</b> In digital <b>microfluidics,</b> a substrate surface is micropatterned with electrodes and selectively activated. Manipulation of small fluid droplets occurs via electrowetting, {{which is the}} phenomenon where an electric field changes the wettability of an electrolyte droplet on a surface.|$|R
25|$|Emerging {{biotechnology}} and Biomedical research uses PMMA {{to create}} <b>microfluidic</b> lab-on-a-chip devices, which require 100 micrometre-wide geometries for routing liquids. These small geometries {{are amenable to}} using PMMA in a biochip fabrication process and offers moderate biocompatibility.|$|E
25|$|Automated patch clamp {{systems have}} {{recently}} been developed, in order to collect large amounts of data inexpensively in a shorter period of time. Such systems typically include a single-use <b>microfluidic</b> device, either an injection molded or a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cast chip, to capture a cell or cells, and an integrated electrode.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, a {{group from}} the University of Tokyo {{developed}} cell laden fibers up to a meter in length and {{on the order of}} 100µm in size. These fibers were created using a <b>microfluidic</b> device that forms a double coaxial laminar flow. Each 'layer' of the <b>microfluidic</b> device (cells seeded in ECM, a hydrogel sheath, and finally a calcium chloride solution). The seeded cells culture within the hydrogel sheath for several days, and then the sheath is removed with viable cell fibers. Various cell types were inserted into the ECM core, including myocytes, endothelial cells, nerve cell fibers, and epithelial cell fibers. This group then showed that these fibers can be woven together to fabricate tissues or organs in a mechanism similar to textile weaving. Fibrous morphologies are advantageous in that they provide an alternative to traditional scaffold design, and many organs (such as muscle) are composed of fibrous cells.|$|E
30|$|<b>Microfluidics</b> is a newly {{developed}} and highly integrated system that sequentially processes or manipulates small volumes of fluids (10 − 9 – 10 − 18  l) in channels with dimensions of tens {{to hundreds of}} micrometers to achieve single cell culture and sequencing, that {{has been applied to}} single cell experiments [19, 20] (Fig.  1 e). Recently, various <b>microfluidics</b> platforms have emerged for single cell whole-genome, whole-transcriptome or epigenomics sequencing [21 – 23]. The advancement of <b>microfluidics</b> research has extended to separate nanoparticles, such as DNA isolation [24]. The advantages for <b>microfluidics</b> are the ability to input nanoliter-to-picoliter volumes of samples and to output accurate results with high resolution and sensitivity [19]. Additionally, <b>microfluidics</b> can provide parallel and timely analyses to make studies more efficient.|$|R
30|$|<b>Microfluidics</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} as a potential technology to miniaturize the conventional equipments and technologies. It offers advantages in terms of small volume, low cost, short reaction time and highthroughput. The applications in biology and medicine research and related areas are almost the most extensive and profound. With the appropriate scale that matches the scales of cells, <b>microfluidics</b> is well positioned to contribute significantly to cell biology. Cell culture, fusion and apoptosis were successfully performed in <b>microfluidics.</b> <b>Microfluidics</b> provides unique opportunities for rare circulating tumor cells isolation and detection from the blood of patients, which furthers the discovery of cancer stem cell biomarkers and expands {{the understanding of the}} biology of metastasis. Nucleic acid amplification in <b>microfluidics</b> has extended to single-molecule, high-throughput and integration treatment in one chip. DNA computer which is based on the computational model of DNA biochemical reaction will come into practice from concept in the future. In addition, <b>microfluidics</b> offers a versatile platform for protein-protein interactions, protein crystallization and high-throughput screening. Although <b>microfluidics</b> is still in its infancy, its great potential has already been demonstrated and will provide novel solutions to the high-throughput applications.|$|R
40|$|<b>Microfluidics</b> tools {{have been}} {{developing}} rapidly {{over the past}} decade, as they offer unparalleled ability for controlling nucleation and tracking crystallisation events inside very large numbers of individual nanolitre-size droplets. They have demonstrated a significant potential for screening protein crystallization conditions and for the direct determination of inorganic products solubility curves. The accepted basis for analysing <b>microfluidics</b> data is the probabilistic nucleation model originally proposed by Pound and La Mer (1952). Given {{the significance of this}} model for the purpose of analysing <b>microfluidics</b> data, the paper conducts a review of its hypotheses, usage and applicability. A step-by-step derivation of the model equations confirms that the time variation of the proportion of empty droplets which <b>microfluidics</b> experiments can provide with high accuracy is indeed the recommended method for estimation of nucleation kinetic parameters from <b>microfluidics</b> experiments. The paper shows that, depending on its implementation, the model predicts different rates of appearance of crystals inside individual droplets. The paper focuses on two distinct implementation modes, referred to as constant supersaturation and single nucleation event modes. By confronting model prediction with <b>microfluidics</b> measurements for eflucimibe in octanol, the paper finds that both modes yield different model predictions, shedding light on the potential and limits of the probabilistic nucleation model for the analysis of <b>microfluidics</b> data...|$|R
25|$|Nanochannels are {{utilized}} to achieve single-molecule sensing and diagnosis, {{as well as}} DNA separation. In many cases, nanofluidic devices are integrated within a <b>microfluidic</b> system to facilitate logic operation of fluids. The future of nanofluidic systems will be focused on several areas such as analytical chemistry and biochemistry, liquid transport and metering, and energy conversion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Microfluidic</b> {{devices have}} the ability to perform highly {{parallel}} analysis in a single PCR step. Absolute quantification can be achieved rather than relative quantification compared to RT-PCR. Thus, point mutations, copy number variations, loss of heterozygosity or aneuploidy can be detected. Digital PCR can differentiate between maternal blood plasma and fetal DNA in a multiplex fashion.|$|E
25|$|Micron-scale {{mechanical}} components such as springs, gears, fluidic and heat transfer devices are fabricated {{from a variety}} of substrate materials such as silicon, glass and polymers like SU8.

50|$|Microchannel/microcoil interfaces, {{previous}} {{to digital}} <b>microfluidics,</b> had several drawbacks such as  in that many created {{large amounts of}} solvent waste and were easily contaminated. In this way, the use of digital <b>microfluidics</b> and its capability to manipulate singlet droplets is promising.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen rapid {{progress}} in using digital <b>microfluidics</b> based biochips for biomedical assays. The testing and reliability of these biochips is crucial when they are used in point-of-care diagnostics applications. As the scalability and complexity of biomedical assays increases, {{there is a need}} for efficient testing methodologies to ensure reliability of these biochips. The conventional testing methodologies will not be sufficient for the recently proposed and highly scalable Micro-electrode-dot array (MEDA) architecture based digital <b>microfluidics.</b> This is because of the advanced fluidic movement operations incorporated in the MEDA architecture. This paper investigates the testing methodologies for conventional digital <b>microfluidics</b> based biochips and their relevancy to the MEDA architecture based digital <b>microfluidics</b> biochip...|$|R
40|$|<b>Microfluidics</b> is an {{emerging}} new interdisciplinary field {{that deals with}} the manipulation of fluids at the microscale and nanoscale.

25|$|March 2011: A team of {{researchers}} from UC Berkeley, DCU and University of Valparaíso have developed lab-on-a-chip that can diagnose diseases within 10 minutes {{without the use of}} external tubing and extra components. It is called Self-powered Integrated <b>Microfluidic</b> Blood Analysis System (SIMBAS). It uses tiny trenches to separate blood cells from plasma (99 percent of blood cells were captured during experiments). Researchers used plastic components, to reduce manufacturing costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} method {{utilized}} for bottom-up fabrication is self-assembled monolayers (SAM). This method usually use biological materials {{to form a}} molecular monolayer on the substrate. Nano-channels can also be fabricated from the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and quantum wires. The bottom-up methods usually give well-defined shapes with characteristic length about few nanometers. For these structures to be utilized as nanofluidic devices, the interconnection between nano-channels and <b>microfluidic</b> systems becomes an important issue.|$|E
25|$|Nanofluidic {{circuitry}} is a nanotechnology {{aiming for}} control of fluids in nanometer scale. Due {{to the effect of}} an electrical double layer within the fluid channel, the behavior of nanofluid is observed to be significantly different compared with its <b>microfluidic</b> counterparts. Its typical characteristic dimensions fall within the range of 1–100nm. At least one dimension of the structure is in nanoscopic scale. Phenomena of fluids in nano-scale structure are discovered to be of different properties in electrochemistry and fluid dynamics.|$|E

2500|$|The first impedance-based {{flow cytometry}} device, using the Coulter principle, was {{disclosed}} in U.S. Patent 2,656,508, issued in 1953, to Wallace H. Coulter. Mack Fulwyler was {{the inventor of}} the forerunner to today's flow cytometers - particularly the cell sorter. Fulwyler developed this in 1965 with his publication in Science. [...] The first fluorescence-based flow cytometry device (ICP 11) was developed in 1968 by Wolfgang Göhde from the University of Münster, filed for patent on 18 December 1968 and first commercialized in 1968/69 by German developer and manufacturer Partec through Phywe AG in Göttingen. At that time, absorption methods were still widely favored by other scientists over fluorescence methods. Soon after, flow cytometry instruments were developed, including the Cytofluorograph (1971) from Bio/Physics Systems Inc. (later: Ortho Diagnostics), the PAS 8000 (1973) from Partec, the first FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting) instrument from Becton Dickinson (1974), the ICP 22 (1975) from Partec/Phywe and the Epics from Coulter (1977/78).
