40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of neutron noise analysis (NNA) to the ex-core neutron detector signal for monitoring the vibration {{characteristics of a}} reactor core support barrel (CSB) was investigated. Ex-core flux data were generated by using a nonanalog Monte Carlo neutron transport method in a simulated CSB model where the implicit capture and Russian roulette technique were utilized. First and third order beam and shell modes of CSB vibration were modeled based on parallel processing simulation. A NNA module was developed to analyze the ex-core flux data based on its time variation, normalized power spectral density, normalized cross-power spectral density, coherence, and phase differences. The data were then analyzed with a fuzzy logic module to determine the vibration characteristics. The ex-core neutron signal fluctuation was directly proportional to the CSB's vibration observed at 8  Hz and 15  Hz in the beam <b>mode</b> <b>vibration,</b> and at 8  Hz in the shell <b>mode</b> <b>vibration.</b> The coherence result between flux pairs was unity at the vibration peak frequencies.
