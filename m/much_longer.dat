5|$|A mutant {{and expert}} tracker with super agility, reflexes, acute senses and {{enhanced}} strength. In {{preparation for the}} role, Stewart gained 50 pounds and grew his hair <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> than its usual length.|$|E
5|$|Conceived by La Gazzetta {{to boost}} its {{circulation}} {{at the expense}} of its rival Corriere della Sera, the 1909 Giro was the first stage road race. Its eight stages, although relatively few compared to modern Grand Tours, were each <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> than those raced today.|$|E
50|$|A <b>much</b> larger <b>longer</b> {{and higher}} {{trackway}} ramp than the ARK for crossing 60 ft. The 25-foot-long front ramps were launched into position with rockets. Ten built and two delivered in 1945 but {{not used in}} action.|$|R
5000|$|... refer sees little use, {{primarily}} because troff {{itself is not}} used <b>much</b> for <b>longer</b> technical writing that might need software support for reference and citation management. , some reference management software (for instance, RefWorks) will import refer data.|$|R
3000|$|... is no <b>longer</b> <b>much</b> of a factor, {{leading to}} the upper limit on (saturation of) the {{performance}} with increasing rotation speed.|$|R
5|$|Albatrosses live <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> {{than other}} birds; they delay {{breeding}} for longer and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species survive upwards of 50 years, the oldest recorded being a Laysan albatross named Wisdom that was ringed in 1956 as a mature adult and hatched another chick in February 2017, making her at least 66 years old. She {{is the oldest}} confirmed wild bird {{as well as the}} oldest banded bird in the world.|$|E
5|$|At {{home that}} night, Scrooge is visited by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth, entwined by heavy chains and money boxes, forged during a {{lifetime}} of greed and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has one chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and he must listen to them or be cursed to carry chains of his own, <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> than Marley's chains.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
5000|$|... “Im still here” {{was written}} by Esther Nabaasa and {{produced}} by Michael Fingerz. Produced at Masters Music. The song was released on Juliana’s official Youtube channel on March 30th 2017. The song basically celebrates a strong woman, who however <b>much</b> and <b>longer</b> they are weighed down by hardships, they still get up and move on.|$|R
5000|$|There is some overlap of {{personnel}} and events with Maori Women's Welfare League, but the League has a <b>much</b> broader remit, <b>longer</b> history and more political outlook.|$|R
30|$|All load {{profiles}} are normalized {{by dividing}} {{every one of}} the 96 load values by the average load per day. We use the captured data as load profile forecasts F as described in Section 3. Note that forecasting can be done with historic data (e.g., [35, 36]) since usage patterns are unlikely to change very <b>much</b> over <b>longer</b> periods of time.|$|R
5|$|Coastal plants {{begin to}} flower at around {{five years from}} seed, but plants in the Stirling Range take <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> to mature. In one Stirling Range population, only 15% of plants had flowered after eight years. Flowering time is highly variable, but in general it occurs between March and August, with a peak around June. More flowers open during the day than at night.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> than the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{technological}} revolution took <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> in Wales {{than it had}} in England, with slow adoption of machinery. Until {{the latter part of}} the 18th century carding and spinning was done at home, and weaving in the village ty-gwydd (loom house), although fulling was done by machine in fulling mills.|$|E
50|$|A bear's fur {{consists}} of two types of hair: the underfur and the outer guard hairs. The underfur, which is soft and dense, serves primarily as an insulator. The outer guard hairs are <b>much</b> thicker, <b>longer</b> and coarser, and while they also insulate, they primarily serve to protect the body from dirt, debris and insects, {{as well as to}} repel water.|$|R
6000|$|But Bianca's lips, parted, indrawn, seemed saying: 'You ask too <b>much!</b> I no <b>longer</b> attract you. Am I to sympathise in the {{attraction}} this common little girl has for you?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{there was}} no <b>longer</b> <b>much</b> {{interest}} in history of the white, male working-class. Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.|$|R
5|$|In August 1867, the {{commander}} of the Department of Washington wrote to the Chief of Ordnance, asking how <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> he needed Fort Greble as an ordnance depot for materiel removed from dismantled forts. When it could do so, the Ordnance Department removed its property to the Washington Arsenal, now Fort McNair, or transferred it to a still-garrisoned fort, though with post-war budget cuts, these were becoming few and far between.|$|E
5|$|In Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film series (2001–2003), {{all of the}} elves (including Wood Elves) {{are portrayed}} as fair, graceful, and wise beings with supernatural {{abilities}} like enhanced eyesight. While they facially resemble humans, they transcend beauty, with <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> and finer hair and an apparent inner glow. They also have pointed ears and no facial hair.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{resistance}} was stubborn, and Montejo {{did not complete}} the conquest of western and central Honduras until 1539. Once he had established Spanish control there, he headed east to pacify the Olancho valley. Although the conquest {{of the west and}} centre of the territory was difficult, and the natives were well organised, resistance in the east took <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> to put down, and rebellions there lasted throughout the colonial period.|$|E
50|$|The tail {{feathers}} are imprinted biserially {{along the}} caudal vertebrae, which is typical for the genus, and preservation begins around the 9th caudal. The longest tail feathers, at the distal tip, are also <b>much</b> relatively <b>longer</b> than the same feathers in the London specimen. The {{reason for the}} Munich specimen’s comparatively longer wing and tail feathers is not known, but could be individual variation, age difference or sex difference.|$|R
6000|$|... "While {{your former}} system was in operation!" [...] I said, repeating his words--"do I {{understand}} you, then, {{to say that}} the 'soothing system' of which I have heard so <b>much</b> is no <b>longer</b> in force?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The older name [...] "South Caucasian" [...] is no <b>longer</b> <b>much</b> used, as it {{derives from}} the idea that Kartvelian {{is related to the}} Northwest Caucasian and Northeast Caucasian languages, a {{position}} which is no longer maintained.|$|R
5|$|On May 21, 1906, the Supreme Court upheld Burton's convictions. That same day, {{another of}} Burton's lawyers, former Senator John Mellen Thurston, filed a {{petition}} for rehearing, which operated as a 60-day continuance, and in effect stayed the matter <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> because the Court {{was set to}} adjourn until October.|$|E
5|$|Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) {{are about}} to kiss in the hall when Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) stops them. He tells them that he has {{received}} complaints about their public displays of affection, which Santana decries as a double-standard, citing the <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> public kisses of Finn (Cory Monteith) and Rachel (Lea Michele).|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} by Andrew Harrison and Aaron Harrison {{on whether to}} enter the 2014 NBA draft would be the determining factor on whether Ulis became an immediate starter or not. Many thought Andrew would be Calipari's seventh consecutive point guard to declare for the NBA Draft after his freshman season, but that Ulis would likely last <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> at Kentucky. On April 25, the Harrisons announced {{that they would be}} returning to Kentucky.|$|E
6000|$|Owen could contain himself no <b>longer,</b> <b>much</b> as {{his mind}} dreaded {{anything}} {{of the nature of}} ridicule. 'The people all seem to look at me, as if something seriously concerned me; is it this stupid matter, or what is it?' ...|$|R
50|$|Armstrong {{has been}} a member of R. Crumb and his Cheap Suit Serenaders since the 1970s, {{performing}} vocals, musical saw, and guitar. As of 2006, Crumb is no <b>longer</b> <b>much</b> involved with the group; Armstrong continues to perform with the band.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{there is}} no <b>longer</b> <b>much</b> {{in the way of}} pure moorland in the community, but conservationists have been trying for a few years to recultivate these as the moors, a habitat for some {{threatened}} animal species, are becoming scarcer.|$|R
5|$|The entire {{theme for}} the film celebrates the {{relationship}} between a small girl named Emily (voiced by Emily Osborne), and her kindly but ailing grandfather (voiced by Peter Ustinov). Emily's playful innocence is contrasted with Granpa's increasing frailty. Aware that he will not be around for <b>much</b> <b>longer,</b> he shares his memories of adventures and days gone by.|$|E
5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} factor {{that helped the}} All Blacks to success was their {{superior}} fitness. In New Zealand each half was 45 minutes, not 35 like in Britain. As well as that, the All Blacks spent much time on fitness. This enabled them to play with speed <b>much</b> <b>longer</b> than their opposition.|$|E
6000|$|We had further {{trouble with}} this individual, who {{continually}} lamented {{he had ever}} come to a country wherein there was no beer, and derided his Ontario comrade for doing too <b>much.</b> The <b>longer</b> a job lasted the better for those employed on it {{and the rest of}} the profession, he said: to which, as we heard later, the Ontario man replied: [...] "If the job lasts too long in this country they pretty well fire you out of it." ...|$|R
50|$|Inversely, Artaxerxes II {{placed his}} {{left on the}} river, with a unit of cavalry {{supporting}} it also. Artaxerxes was {{in the center of}} his line, with 6,000 units of Persian cavalry (which were some of the finest in the world and by far superior to anything Cyrus or the Greeks could field) which was to the left of Cyrus, his line being so <b>much</b> the <b>longer.</b> Artaxerxes line overlapped Cyrus' line quite significantly, since he was able to field many more troops.|$|R
50|$|After Eden Paul's {{death in}} 1944, Cedar Paul {{published}} {{only a small}} number of translations under her own name. A. J. P. Taylor, who had read the Pauls' work as a teenager, observed that the pair were no <b>longer</b> <b>much</b> remembered fifty years later.|$|R
