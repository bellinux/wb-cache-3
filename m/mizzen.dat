5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the <b>mizzen</b> whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter <b>mizzen</b> mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter <b>mizzen</b> stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing <b>mizzen</b> cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the <b>mizzen</b> channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the <b>mizzen</b> chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these <b>mizzen</b> chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing <b>mizzen</b> stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|E
5|$|The replica {{standing}} <b>mizzen</b> {{is built}} to this shorter measurement and stepped {{in the hold}} on the keelson, as is the model in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. There {{is a difference between}} the height of the <b>mizzen</b> fore-and-aft spar in the contemporary painting of Earl of Pembroke before the naval refit of 1768 by Luny (below) and its position on the replica in the photographs, compared to the height of the lowest spars on the fore and mainmasts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the <b>mizzen</b> mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure <b>mizzen</b> had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} Sea Cloud featured royal-sails over single topgallant- and double top-sails on the fore and <b>mizzen</b> masts. The main mast {{was equipped with}} a royal-sail over double topgallant- and double top-sails. Today the first three masts are rigged with double top-sails, single topgallants, royals and a main skysail.|$|E
5|$|After {{fifteen minutes}} of combat, Boston lost its cross-jack yard and by 05:45 had {{suffered}} significant damage to its rigging and sails, rendering the ship significantly less manoeuvrable than Embuscade. At 06:10 the main topmast was knocked over and the <b>mizzen</b> mast badly damaged, and ten minutes later, as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts, a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler were standing. Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell to the deck unresponsive, possibly killed. Believing his commander to be dead, Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard {{in an effort to}} prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain. Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06:40 the <b>mizzen</b> mast was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away. Casualties mounted, with Lieutenant Edwards and Lieutenant Alexander Kerr both badly wounded, the latter blinded in one eye and the former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Low {{used the}} same flag as Edward Teach ("Blackbeard"). Later, he used his own flag, a red {{skeletal}} figure on a black background, which became notorious. He first flew his own flag in late July 1723. Low also used a green silk flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a trumpet; this Green Trumpeter was hoisted on the <b>mizzen</b> peak to call his fleet's captains to meetings aboard the flagship.|$|E
5|$|The {{casualty}} list included Captain Westcott, five lieutenants and ten {{junior officers}} among the dead, and Admiral Nelson, Captains Saumarez, Ball and Darby, and six lieutenants wounded. Other than Culloden, the only British ships seriously damaged in their hulls were Bellerophon, Majestic, and Vanguard. Bellerophon and Majestic {{were the only}} ships to lose masts: Majestic the main and <b>mizzen</b> and Bellerophon all three.|$|E
5|$|Agamemnon {{was part}} of Vice-Admiral Robert Calder's fleet {{cruising}} off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, when the combined Franco-Spanish fleet from the West Indies was sighted to windward. The British ships formed into line of battle, with Agamemnon fifth in the line, and engaged Admiral Villeneuve's fleet in hazy conditions with light winds. Agamemnon had three men wounded in the Battle of Cape Finisterre, and lost her <b>mizzen</b> topmast and the foresail yard. By nightfall, Calder's fleet had become scattered, and he signalled for the action to be discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{midshipman}} originated {{during the}} Tudor and Stuart eras, and originally {{referred to a}} post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the main and <b>mizzen</b> masts and had more responsibility than an ordinary seaman, but was not a military officer or an officer in training. The first published {{use of the term}} midshipman was in 1662. The word derives from an area aboard a ship, amidships, but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship, or the location where midshipmen were berthed.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the <b>mizzen</b> mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
5|$|The first udema Gamla was c. 30m (100ft) {{long and}} with a draft of 1.5m (5ft). The later udemas,Torborg and Ingeborg, carried a <b>mizzen</b> mast, and were both longer and wider, 37m (121ft) long and almost 9m (29ft) wide with a draft of just over 3m (10ft). Torborg, built in 1772, had three {{additional}} 12-pounders, eleven in the centerline and two in the bow facing forwards, housed under a decked superstructure with gun ports, but with the rowing seats left undecked. This arrangement proved to be less successful with reports about problems with splintering and lingering gunpowder smoke. She was also a poor sailer and slow under oars, earning the udema a poor reputation.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and <b>mizzen</b> staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E
5|$|The French were {{initially}} {{unable to take}} possession of the fourth rate as {{every single one of}} the boats on board had been smashed by British shot. In the end, a French midshipman and a boatswain dived into the sea and swam to the British ship to take the formal surrender. Leander had lost a third of the crew: 35 men killed and 57 wounded, the latter including Thompson three times and Berry, who had a piece of human skull lodged in his arm. The ship had been completely dismasted except the stubs of the fore and main masts and the bowsprit, and was leaking badly from dozens of shot holes. Généreux had also been damaged, losing the <b>mizzen</b> topmast and almost losing the foremast as well. Losses on the crowded decks had been far more severe than on Leander, with casualties estimated at 100 killed and 188 wounded, again approximately a third of the total.|$|E
5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the <b>mizzen</b> rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E
5|$|With {{his main}} and <b>mizzen</b> masts {{collapsed}} and escape impossible, Leissègues turned his ship towards the shore at 11:30, outdistancing the {{fire from the}} drifting Northumberland and leaving Superb behind, Duckworth reluctant to risk his ship in the shallow coastal shoals. Canopus maintained the pressure, pursuing the French flagship until it was clear at 11:40 that Impérial was hard aground on a coral reef, {{less than a mile}} from the beach. Diomède, under attack by Atlas and the recently returned Spencer, followed Impérial ashore. As they struck the reef, both French ships lost their remaining masts and suffered severe damage to their hulls. Their crews then gathered on deck and made preparations to abandon ship as the British squadron pulled back out of range of fire from the shore. During the engagement the French frigates and corvette had all slipped between the battling squadrons and the shoreline and escaped to the westwards. The British frigates were too preoccupied with boarding and towing prizes to initiate a chase.|$|E
25|$|Three masts: <b>mizzen</b> (aft), main (midship), and fore, {{and also}} a {{spritsail}} in the bow area.|$|E
25|$|A yawl {{is similar}} to a ketch, with a shorter <b>mizzen</b> mast carried astern the {{rudderpost}} more for balancing the helm than propulsion.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{set up a}} jury {{main mast}} and began heading back east towards Portsmouth, {{spending}} {{the rest of the}} day trying to set up a jury <b>mizzen</b> mast.|$|E
25|$|On 30 September the French frigate Weser, {{under the}} command of captaine de vaisseau Cantzlaat, Chevalier de L'ordre Imperiale de la Reunion, sailed from the Texel for the North Sea. There she {{captured}} two Swedish ships before a gale on the 16th took away her main and <b>mizzen</b> mast. Two days later Scylla encountered her 60 leagues west of Ushant, making her way towards Brest under jury main and <b>mizzen</b> masts. Rather than engage her and risk being crippled and so unable to follow her given the weather, Macdonald decided to follow her.|$|E
25|$|In January 1803 Caldicot Castle was {{returning}} to Liverpool from Quebec {{when she had to}} put in at Crookhaven. She had lost her <b>mizzen</b> mast and rudder, and sustained other damage.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} all other Royal Navy wooden screw gunvessels, the Cormorants were rigged as barques, that is with three masts, with the fore and main masts square rigged, and the <b>mizzen</b> fore-and-aft rigged.|$|E
25|$|Whiting {{sent the}} Mountaineer, Dow, master, into Plymouth, where she arrived on 6 July 1811. Mountaineer had been sailing from London to Honduras {{when she ran}} into Whiting off Dungeness, {{carrying}} away her main mast, and for and <b>mizzen</b> topmast.|$|E
25|$|On 16 June, Chiffone {{captured}} the East Indiaman Bellona {{on her way}} from Bengal to London. In taking Bellone, Chiffone had her <b>mizzen</b> mast crippled. A prize crew under Ensign Jean-Michel Mahé took Bellona to Mauritius where she arrived a month later.|$|E
25|$|After this, Captain George Wolfe assumed command, {{having been}} {{appointed}} in April 1801. On 1 July Galatea came into Plymouth after a cruise of 18 {{weeks in the}} Atlantic and off the western islands. Then during October and November {{she was on a}} 28-day cruise in the Bay of Biscay. Here she not only endured fifteen severe gales, but on 1 and 2 November she nearly foundered. Hurricane-force winds sent her <b>mizzen</b> mast and the main and foretop masts over the side, even though she had no sails set. Furthermore, when the <b>mizzen</b> mast went it took one seaman to go overboard with it and severely injured others. When the winds died down on 3 November, Byng sailed Galatea for Cork. There he jury rigged a rigged a mizzen-mast, main, and foretop-mast. Galatea finally reached Plymouth on 22 November.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, Pacifics {{passenger}} accommodations were {{increased to}} include an additional 80 second-class passengers. On 4 December 1851, Pacific rescued {{the crew of the}} barque Jesse Stevens, which had foundered in the Atlantic several hundred miles southeast of Newfoundland. In 1853, Pacifics <b>mizzen</b> mast was removed, presumably in order to reduce drag.|$|E
25|$|Later, when CSS Tennessee {{made her}} {{unsupported}} {{attack on the}} Federal fleet, Farragut climbed into the <b>mizzen</b> rigging. Still concerned for his safety, Captain Drayton had Flag Lieutenant J. Crittenden Watson tie him to the rigging again. Thus, the admiral had been tied to the rigging twice {{in the course of}} the battle.|$|E
25|$|An action ensued {{at about}} 11a.m. with Trincomalee {{engaging}} Iphigénie and Comet engaging Pearl. The exchange of fire lasted {{about two hours}} when suddenly Trincomalee exploded. She {{was so close to}} Iphigénie that the explosion knocked down Iphigénies main and <b>mizzen</b> masts and ruptured her sides, with the result that she soon started to founder.|$|E
25|$|When in port, the ensign {{should always}} be flown from {{the staff at the}} stern. This is traditional, because in former times the gaff was then lowered along with the <b>mizzen</b> sail. The only ensign ever flown from the {{starboard}} spreader or yardarm is that of a nation being visited. This is known as a courtesy hoisting of a courtesy Flag.|$|E
25|$|Brails {{run from}} the leech of a fore-and-aft rigged sail (a spanker or lateen <b>mizzen,</b> for example) to the gaff and mast and serve the same {{function}} as buntlines: to haul in the sail when furling. In this case, however, the action is more horizontal than vertical, hauling the sail forwards, toward the luff and a bit up, towards the gaff.|$|E
25|$|Taeping was {{the first}} {{composite}} ship built by Robert Steele & Co (the third from this yard out of the five ships listed here), being launched in 1863. On her maiden voyage she was dismasted in a typhoon off Formosa (Taiwan), losing her foremast and main and <b>mizzen</b> topmasts. After repairs in Amoy (Xiamen), she then made a remarkably fast passage of 89 days to London.|$|E
25|$|Ships of {{the class}} were armed with two 7-inch (90 cwt) muzzle-loading rifled guns on {{pivoting}} mounts, and four 64-pounder muzzle-loading rifled guns (two on pivoting mounts, and two broadside). Four machine guns and one light gun completed the weaponry. All the ships {{of the class}} were provided with a barque rig, that is, square-rigged foremast and mainmast, and fore-and-aft sails only on the <b>mizzen</b> mast.|$|E
25|$|At nightfall, a Dutch pinnace made a probe {{from the}} {{direction}} of the bay. It was assessing the defenses and approached the eastern side of the fort in front of the breastworks. Portuguese guns opened fire and after several shots they managed to score a direct hit. The pinnace lost its <b>mizzen</b> mast and was forced to retire. Thereafter, Dutch ships did not approach the fort from that direction.|$|E
25|$|Captain Pringle Stokes was {{appointed}} captain of Beagle on 7 September 1825, {{and the ship}} was allocated to the surveying section of the Hydrographic Office. On 27 September 1825 Beagle docked at Woolwich to be repaired and fitted out for her new duties. Her guns were reduced from ten cannon to six and a <b>mizzen</b> mast was added to improve her handling, thereby changing her from a brig to a bark (or barque).|$|E
25|$|After {{the opening}} exchanges, Réunion lost her fore yard and <b>mizzen</b> topmast while Crescent lost the top off her foremast. Both ships had rigging cut {{and a number}} of sails damaged but Crescent was still able to {{manoeuvre}} across Réunion's stern and rake her. This raking caused huge damage to the French ship and her crew, and although Réunion continued to resist for some time, she was no longer able to move effectively.|$|E
25|$|At sea, {{it used to}} be {{that the}} ensign was flown from the <b>mizzen</b> gaff. When Bermudian sails came into general use, some skippers started to fly the ensign from two-thirds the way up the main-sail leech. Many {{consider}} this an affectation with the past. Others have taken to flying the ensign from a backstay. These are not good locations because the flag does not fly out well when hoisted raked forward.|$|E
25|$|Loch Vennachar was {{considered}} an unlucky ship narrowly surviving a cyclone in the Indian Ocean in June 1892. Around 8pm on 3 June, the barometer began to fall ominously and the sail was promptly shortened. At approximately 5.00am as darkness lifted it showed terrific head seas that swept down upon the vessel, lashed by the North-East gale. Two large waves approached the ship. Loch Vennachar rode the first wave and sank into the trough at the other side. While in this position, the second wave came on and broke on deck {{with such force that}} it broke the foremast, mainmast and the <b>mizzen</b> topmast. Without her masts to steady her, the Loch Vennachar rolled dangerously in heavy seas. After 9 days, the weather eased and the crew were able to rig a spar forward and sail on the damaged <b>mizzen.</b> After 5 weeks of sailing, she arrived at Port Louis, Mauritius. Although her stay lasted 5 months while new spars were sent from England, repairs only took 10 days to complete. Captain Bennett was awarded the Lloyd's Medal for his leadership and bravery at sea.|$|E
