Devices vary {{in size from}} below one micron to millimeters in size, functioning individually or in arrays to sense, control, and activate mechanical processes on the micro scale.

Photoresist has traditionally been applied to wafers in IC manufacturing using a spin coating technique. In complex MEMs devices that have etched areas with high aspect ratios, {{it can be difficult}} to achieve uniform coverage along the top, side walls, and bottoms of deep grooves and trenches using spin coating techniques due to the high rate of spin needed to remove excess liquid. Ultrasonic spray techniques are used to spray uniform coatings of photoresist onto high aspect ratio MEMs devices and can minimize usage and overspray of photoresist.|$|R

Thanks to the miniaturization and low cost of <b>Microelectromechanical</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>MEMs),</b> in particular of Inertial Measurement Units, in recent years body-worn activity recognition has gained popularity. In this context, the proposed work aims to recognize nine different gestures involved in daily activities using hand and wrist wearable sensors.

In order to achieve the proposed goals, an extensive experimentation was performed in a realistic environment. Twenty users were asked to perform the selected gestures and then the data were off-line analyzed to extract significant features. In order to corroborate the analysis, the classification problem was treated using two different and commonly used supervised machine learning techniques, namely Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine, analyzing both personal model and Leave-One-Subject-Out cross validation. The results obtained from this analysis show that the proposed system is able to recognize the proposed gestures with an accuracy of 89. 01 % in the Leave-One-Subject-Out cross validation and are therefore promising for further investigation in real life scenarios...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRecent {{years have}} seen the {{proliferation}} in our skies of flying drones otherwise called UAVs (Unmaned Aerial Vehicle). Their current and potential uses are many: from the military uses to leisure activities through business applications like photography, aerial imaging, spotting, pest extermination (like hornets nest), home delivery, etc. This was made possible and facilitated by the miniaturization and {{the reduction of the}} power consumption of <b>Microelectromechanical</b> <b>Systems</b> (<b>Mems),</b> but also by the dissemination of techniques making the navigation easier. We refer of course to satellites geolocation techniques such as the well-known Global Positioning System (GPS) and Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS), which is its extension to all existing constellations. The growing interest in UAVs is obvious, however, this brings some questionings: are there any limits to what a drone can do? This article aims to put the problematic of the drone linked to the vulnerability of the GPS signal and its consequences. Indeed, one of the characteristics of civilian GNSS signals (therefore free to use) is their very low power. A GNSS receiver is therefore easy to decoy by means of a fake GNSS signal that reproduces the aspect of a real signal but contains false positioning information. Under these conditions, the GNSS receiver embarked by the drone calculates a position which is not the real position. Consequently, the trajectory of the drone is distorted. We will see, from a theoretical point of view, what happens when a receiver is submitted to a fake signal and the consequences that this induces to the navigation of the drone. Simulations will support our words and laboratory tests on existing UAV navigation systems will be presente...|$|R

The surface energies of nanocrystalline perovskites of these alkali tantalates and niobates were experimentally determined for the first time by calorimetry. The energies of the hydrated surface are 1. 04 +/- 0. 34, 1. 21 +/- 0. 78, 1. 58 +/- 0. 29, 2. 16 +/- 0. 57 and 2. 95 +/- 0. 59 J m(- 2) for LiTaO 3, LiNbO 3, NaTaO 3, NaNbO 3 and KNbO 3, respectively. The stability of the lead-free perovskites of I-V type is discussed based on their tolerance factor and acid-base chemistry. The formation enthalpy becomes more exothermic (higher thermodynamic stability) and the surface energy increases (greater destabilization for a given particle size) with the increase in the ionic radius of the A-site cations (Li, Na and K) and with increase in the tolerance factor. These correlations provide key insights into how lead-free niobates and tantalates behave during synthesis and processing; i. e. they explain, for example, why KNbO 3 and KTaO 3 nanoparticles are thermodynamically more reactive than their Li and Na counterparts. This understanding will facilitate the development of optimized processing techniques and applications...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films of}} micro and nanostructured metals are {{important}} {{for the construction of}} plasmonic devices and <b>microelectromechanical</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>MEMs).</b> The fabrication of individual metallic, pyramidal shells as well as ultra-smooth metal films with grooves, bumps, pyramids and holes has previously been demonstrated 1, 2, as has direct raster milling with 5 nm machining precision in 100 nm thick gold films 3. Routine fabrication of micro and nanostructured thin films is desirable. In this work, the fabrication of arrays of nanoscale pyramidal structures in free-standing gold films is demonstrated, and single nanopores are milled into the nanostructures for DNA translocation. Silicon Klarite® pyramidal micro-structured substrates are an effective tool for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) experiments, owing to the strong field enhancement within the pyramids. Here, the substrates are used as moulds for creating pyramidal structured gold as free-standing thin films. The silicon substrates contain an array of pyramids etched into a 4 mm x 4 mm square region on the substrate's surface. These pyramids are 1. 5 µm x 1. 5 µm square and 1 µm deep on a pitch of 2 m. An Edwards E 306 A Thermal Evaporator is used to coat silicon samples in a 50 nm layer of Teflon® and then a 100 nm layer of gold. Epoxy is then deposited on top of the gold layer using a pipette. Once the epoxy has cured, the epoxy together with the gold is mechanically lifted from the Teflon® coated substrate. The gold-coated epoxy is then placed over a micron-sized aperture and the epoxy dissolved away using acetone. Initial imaging is performed using a Carl Zeiss SMT, Inc., Evo® scanning electron microscope (SEM), while the subsequent imaging and milling of 50 nm holes through the free-standing gold is carried out using an Carl Zeiss SMT, Inc., Orion® Plus helium ion microscope (HIM).
