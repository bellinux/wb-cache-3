Before this development, milk could be kept fresh for only a short while and was available only in the immediate vicinity of a cow. While returning from a trip to England in 1851, Borden was devastated by the deaths of several children, apparently from poor milk obtained from shipboard cows. With less than a year of schooling and following a series of failures, both of his own and of others, Borden was inspired by the vacuum pan he had seen being used by Shakers to condense fruit juice and managed to reduce milk without scorching or curdling it.

40|$|In cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) high iron concentration in airway secretion plays {{a pivotal role}} in bacterial multiplication and biofilm formation as well as in inflammatory response. Burkholderia cenocepacia, an opportunistic facultative pathogen responsible for chronic lung infections and cepacia syndrome, recurrently infects CF patients. Lactoferrin (Lf), an iron binding multifunctional glycoprotein synthesized by exocrine glands and neutrophils, has been found at higher concentration in the airway secretions of infected CF patients than in healthy subjects. Here the influence of <b>milk</b> <b>derivative</b> bovine lactoferrin (bLf), an emerging important regulator of iron and inflammatory homeostasis, on invasiveness of B. cenocepacia iron-modulated biofilm, as well as on inflammatory response by infected CF bronchial (IB 3 - 1) cells, is reported. bLf did not significantly affect invasion efficacy by biofilm-forming B. cenocepacia clinical strains. Conversely, the addition of bLf to cell monolayers during infection significantly decreased the pro-inflammatory Interleukin (IL) - 1 beta and increased the anti-inflammatory IL- 11 expression compared to that observed in cells infected in the absence of bLf. The bLf ability to modulate genes expressed following B. cenocepacia infection seems related to its localization to the nucleus of infected IB 3 - 1 cells. These results provide evidence for a role of bLf in the protection of infected CF cells from inflammation-related damage, thus extending the therapeutic potential of this multifunctional natural protein...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium {{phosphate}} (CPP-ACP) is a <b>milk</b> <b>derivative</b> which holds nanoclusters of calcium and phosphate ions. The presence of CPP-ACP {{has been found}} to reduce demineralization and enhance remineralization in subsurface enamel and in dentin. Incorporation of CPP-ACP into luting cements has not been investigated. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect on the physical properties of two commercially available zinc oxide non-eugenol temporary luting cements with incorporation of up to 8 % (w/w) CPP-ACP. Methods: Setting time, compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, film thickness and solubility tests were investigated for 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 0 and 8. 0 % (w/w) CPP-ACP incorporated into Freegenol™ and Temp-Bond® NE. Tests were carried out based on ISO 3107 requirements. Results: Compressive and diametral tensile strengths progressively decreased with increasing concentrations of up to 8. 0 % (w/w) CPP-ACP incorporated into both Freegenol™ and Temp-Bond® NE. Setting time was delayed beyond ISO requirements. Film thickness was not adversely affected. Increased solubility of Temp-Bond® NE with 8. 0 % (w/w) CPP-ACP incorporation suggested an effect of the CPP-ACP on this property for this cement. Significance: The incorporation of up to 8. 0 % (w/w) CPP-ACP into two zinc oxide non-eugenol luting cements has no adverse effects on the film thickness, compressive strength and diametral tensile strength of the cements investigated. Solubility investigations suggest that CPP-ACP leaches out of the zinc oxide non-eugenol luting cements into an aqueous environment. © 2010 Academy of Dental Materials. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Objective: The present research shows as {{it is possible to}} determine in a successfully and inexpensive way, respectively using an immunosensor and an enzyme sensor, both the lactoferrin content, and the total antioxidant capacity values in real samples. Food samples analyzed to this purpose have been food integrators containing lactoferrin, available in drug stores, edible animal milk samples and dairy derivatives, such as powdered milk, or yogurt. Method: Using two sensors, optimized in previous researches, we simultaneously measured lactoferrin concentration and antioxidant capacity in {{food supplements}} sold in drugstores as well as in cow, goat, powdered milk and in yoghurt. Results: It was also tried to verify if exists between found lactoferrin content and total antioxidant capacity data values, any correlation.

Spoilage microorganisms with proteolytic and/or lipolytic properties are primarily responsible for the decrease in the quality of milk, which is reflected in the shelf life of pasteurized <b>milk</b> and all <b>derivatives.</b> The aim of this study was to determine the spoilage microbial load of refrigerated raw milk from the northeast and southern regions of Brazil, which have different climatic and technological conditions of production. We evaluated 46 samples of milk from the state of Paraná in the southern region, and 10 samples of milk from the state of Maranhão in the northeast region, totaling 56 samples collected from November 2013 to November 2014. The producers of Paraná were divided into large (20) or small (26) according to the average daily production. All producers of Maranhão were considered small (< 500 L/day). The proteolytic and lipolytic microorganism counts were conducted in milk agar and tributyrin agar, respectively. Milk from the large producers of Paraná had average counts of 1. 4 × 104 CFU/mL for proteolytic microorganisms and 1. 2 × 103 CFU/mL for lipolytics microorganisms, significantly (p < 0. 05) lower than the small producers in the same state, and the producers of Maranhão. Producers of Maranhao had counts of 1. 1 × 105 CFU/mL for proteolytic microorganisms and 2 × 105 CFU/mL for lipolytic microorganisms, with the proteolytic count significantly lower than that of small Paraná producers. The amount of proteolytic and lipolytic spoilage microorganisms in milk is influenced by the adaptation of the microorganisms to cold, promoted by the cooling of milk, which is practiced less frequently in the country’s northeastern region. The amount of spoilage microorganisms is also affected by the implementation of milking hygiene practices, which reduce contamination. Such practices are more frequently and efficiently implemented among large producers with more advanced technology, which can improve the microbiological quality of raw milk, thus increasing the shelf life of pasteurized milk, and reducing problems in UHT milk as well as <b>milk</b> <b>derivatives.</b>  </p...|$|R
