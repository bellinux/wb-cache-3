5|$|It {{was during}} this period that Marquis became {{interested}} in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the death of Custer.

Most information had come from soldiers who only witnessed the aftermath. Marquis realized that {{there were a number of}} Cheyenne participants of the battle still alive on the reservation. However, interviewing them at length seemed too difficult at this time. There was the language barrier, and Marquis was busy as a doctor trying to cover a large area.|$|E
