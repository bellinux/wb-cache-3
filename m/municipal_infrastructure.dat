2500|$|The {{new town}} of Chauncey {{remained}} a small suburban village until Purdue University opened in 1869. In 1871 Chauncey voted to be annexed by Lafayette {{because it was}} unable to provide the infrastructure (such as improved streets, waterworks, police and fire protection). Lafayette voted against annexing Chauncey {{because of the high}} cost of the many improvements that the village lacked. In May 1888, the town of Chauncey voted to change its name to West Lafayette after a petition signed by 152 electors. By that time, the growth of the university was fueling the growth of the little town. The address of Purdue University was given as [...] "Lafayette, Indiana" [...] until well into the twentieth century. West Lafayette never gained a railroad depot and lagged several years behind Lafayette in the establishment of <b>municipal</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and services. [...] Today, West Lafayette has established itself as a separate city, with independent services and unique neighborhoods distinct from those of its sister city, Lafayette.|$|E

2500|$|Municipal {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} <b>municipal</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, sidewalks, water supply networks, sewers, street lighting, municipal solid waste management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), public parks and cycling infrastructure. In the case of underground utility networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services. It can also include the optimizing of waste collection and bus service networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority. [...] Municipal engineers may also design the site civil works for large buildings, industrial plants or campuses (i.e. access roads, parking lots, potable water supply, treatment or pretreatment of waste water, site drainage, etc.) ...|$|E

40|$|According to the United Nations’ report, State of World Population 2008, {{humankind}} {{has come}} to a turning point; more than 50 % of the earth’s population now lives in urban centres. Along with considerations for housing, employment, and public health, this shift changes the way we design roads and streets; it escalates the number of automobiles in urban areas with finite room for road expansion. 	Space constraints, along with intense development of alternative transportation fuels, and the burden of sprawling suburbs on <b>municipal</b> <b>infrastructures</b> suggest the hypothesis that before we run out of energy alternatives for personal mechanized transport, we will run out of space in which to use it. 	This thesis explores how Toronto, a city largely designed for automobile use, is being re-adapted into a city wherein public and active transportation can once again be the primary means of urban mobility and the opportunities inherent in the development of interregional multi-modal transit stations for the cultivation of civic space, local commerce, urban form, and commercial transportation...|$|R

40|$|Key words: Urban runoff, {{sensitivity}} analysis, SWMM model, permeable zones, manning roughness. Expansion {{of housing}} and <b>municipal</b> <b>infrastructures</b> because of the ever increasing population {{on one hand and}} the conversion of agricultural, pasture and forest lands to urban areas on the other hand have led to many natural problems like agitated ecosystems and unbalanced hydrological status in different areas. Sensitivity analysis serves as a way of identifying influential factors in shaping final model’s output. This study strives for the identification of influential factors in water Inundation using SWMM model. To this end, of the 9 primary factors of the model, 15 and 30 percent reduction or addition were made and the resulting peak flow was examined in each case. The results showed that the most sensitive parameters to low orders of sensitivity include the percentage of impermeable area, channel roughness coefficient, Manning's roughness coefficient of impermeable areas, width of the equivalent rectangle, slope, curve number (CN), impermeable areas storage, Manning roughness coefficient in permeable zones. Since the use of impermeable surfaces in urban areas is inevitable, new methods based on the criteria of sustainable development, long-term planning and existing facilities could be devised in order to at least reduce the damage caused by the floods. By restoration of natural cycle of water remarkable leaps could be taken to conserve current water resources and maintaining current development an...|$|R
