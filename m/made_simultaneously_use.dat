40|$|A novel {{method to}} {{stabilize}} a channeled spectropolarimeter is described. The fluctuating retardations of the high-order retarders {{used in the}} spectropolarimeter are calibrated in parallel to the measurement of the wavenumber-dependent state of polarization (SOP) of light. Both the calibration of the retarders and the measurement of the SOP can be <b>made</b> <b>simultaneously</b> <b>using</b> a single light to be measured, and hence the resultant wavenumber-dependent SOP is almost immune to fluctuation of the retardations. The effectiveness of this method is experimentally demonstrated with retardation fluctuations induced by a temperature change up to 40 °C...|$|R

An ambitious pilot experiment was conducted involving the recording of various different programme items using eight different recording techniques simultaneously. This was undertaken to determine the practicality of making of such recordings, to allow informal comparisons between microphone techniques, and to create a set of simultaneous multichannel recordings for subsequent perceptual evaluation. This paper details experimental design considerations and practical limitations, as well as reporting initial observations regarding the resulting recordings...|$|R
40|$|Observations of the {{development}} of a convective field in clear air were <b>made</b> <b>simultaneously</b> <b>using</b> radar and an instrumented aircraft. The growth of the field as seen by the radar was compared with the characteristics of the temperature and humidity measurements made by aircraft at various times and locations within the convective depth. Probability distributions of the temperature and mixing ratio fluctuations exhibit distinct, identifiable characteristics for different regions within the field. The altitude of the aircraft measurement, referenced to the maximum altitude of the convective field {{at the time of the}} measurement, was found to be a usable parameter in the comparison of aircraft data and in the characterization of convective field growth. Using the relative height parameter, it was found that the area covered by convective cells (modified air) varies linearly with height in the upper reaches of the convective field. The characteristics of individual cells as seen by the radar and as deduced from the aircraft measurements are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{natural water}} bodies like oceans and lakes, {{biological}} organisms and other chemical species cover the water surface affecting the air-sea boundary conditions. At moderate wind speeds, short gravity wind waves {{occur on the}} water surface. It has been speculated {{that most of these}} short gravity waves are microscale breaking waves, which {{play a significant role in}} air-sea gas and heat transfer. This work reports on results from a series of laboratory experiments investigating the impact of surface contamination on the flow characteristics in the near surface region beneath short gravity waves at moderate wind speeds. In addition, the characteristics of parasitic capillary waves and their relation with microscale breaking waves are explored. In this study, the two-dimensional velocity fields were measured using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) and water surface temperature measurements were <b>made</b> <b>simultaneously</b> <b>using</b> infrared imagery.

40|$|The {{selection}} of right process, use of optimal machining parameters and specification of best tolerance parameters {{have been recognized}} by industry as key issues to ensure product quality and reduce production cost. The three issues have thus attracted {{a great deal of}} attention over last several decades. However, they are often addressed separately in existing publications. In reality, the three issues are closely interrelated. Analyzing the three issues in isolation will inevitably lead to inconsistent, infeasible, or conflicting decisions. To avoid the drawbacks, an integrated approach is proposed to jointly solve process selection, machining parameter optimization, and tolerance design problems. The integrated problem is formulated as a bi-criterion model to handle both tangible and intangible costs. The model is solved using a modified Chebyshev goal programming method to achieve a preferred compromise between the two conflicting criteria. The application of the proposed bi-criterion approach has been demonstrated by first using the single component single part feature case. The integrated approach is then extended to the multiple components multiple part features case (the assembly case). Examples are provided to illustrate the application of the two models and the solution procedure. The results have shown that the decisions on process selection, machining parameter selection and tolerance design can be <b>made</b> <b>simultaneously</b> <b>using</b> the models...|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of examining electro‐mechanical {{activity of the}} human masseter muscles using non‐invasive recording techniques was examined in six healthy dentate adults (aged 34 ‐ 57 years). Electrical activity of the muscle was examined by surface electro‐myography (EMG) and the mechanical activity, {{in the form of}} muscle sounds, was examined by acoustic myography (AMG). Bilateral recordings of EMG and AMG were <b>made</b> <b>simultaneously</b> <b>using</b> composite probes which were placed on the skin over the masseter muscles. A standardized pressure was applied to the probes via adjustable rods attached to a safety helmet. Pressures were monitored by strain gauges placed between the ends of the rods and the probes. With the subject seated, recordings of AMG and EMG were obtained during maximal jaw clenching for 4 s and the raw signals were stored on a computer. Of three maximal contractions performed, the last two were used in the analysis. The raw amplified signals underwent frequency analysis by fast Fourier Transform. Total activity was also assessed after amplification, full‐wave rectification and integration, and repeatability of the results was assessed. The AMG frequency range was 6 ‐ 15 Hz and was similar to values for other human skeletal muscles. The integrated values for EMG and AMG were repeatable {{on both sides of the}} face (IEMG, right r = 0. 99, left r = 0. 99; IAMG right r = 0. 70, left r = 0. 71). Simultaneous recordings of AMG and EMG from the masseter muscles may be useful for assessing electro‐mechanical muscle function but further validation studies are required before the technique can be used clinically.

30|$|However, {{as noted}} by Hoddinott (1994), in none of the {{theoretical}} literature on migration and remittances, there is a distinction made between factors influencing the decision to remit {{and the level of}} remittances. It is possible to avoid such a challenge by adopting a second approach, which assumes that the decision to remit and level of remittances are <b>made</b> <b>simultaneously.</b> We <b>used</b> a censored Tobit model that uses data from both remitters and non-remitters, where the independent variable has two effects: it affects the probability of migrants falling in the remitting sub-sample and the amounts they remit. The maximum likelihood estimation of this model yields parameter estimates that are consistent in the context of modeling remittance behavior and has the disadvantage that a given determinant is restricted to having the same sign effect on the decision to remit as {{on the size of the}} remitted amount (Hoddinott 1994). It is therefore possible to explore both econometric procedures in this case.|$|R
40|$|Microfluidic biochips are revolutionizing {{many areas}} of {{biochemistry}} and biomedical sciences. Several synthesis tools have recently been proposed for the automated design of biochips from the specifications of laboratory protocols. However, {{only a few of}} these tools address the problem of droplet routing in microfluidic arrays. These methods typically rely on post-synthesis droplet routing to implement biochemical protocols. Such an approach is not only time-consuming, but it also imposes an undue burden on the chip user. Moreover, post-synthesis droplet routing does not guarantee that feasible droplet pathways can be found for area-constrained biochip layouts; non-routable fabricated biochips must be discarded. We present a droplet-routing-aware automated synthesis tool for microfluidic biochips. Droplet routability, defined as the ease with which droplet pathways can be determined, is estimated and integrated in the synthesis flow. The proposed approach allows architectural-level design choices and droplet-routing-aware physical design decisions to be <b>made</b> <b>simultaneously.</b> We <b>use</b> a large-scale protein assay as a case study to evaluate the proposed synthesis method...|$|R

The research of nuclei is <b>made</b> <b>simultaneously</b> by <b>using</b> Quantum Mechanics and Semi­classical Physics, while that of hypernuclei {{is made by}} using only Semi­classical Physics {{due to lack of}} sufficient experimental data. In addition, for the isotopes the low energy excitation spectra are studied. Be­sides the interest of the present study of the ten nuclei considered by themselves and the good agreements between theoretical predictions and corresponding experimental data, the choice of the aforementioned nuclei permits the investigation of a possible common reason for the appearance of certain phenomena which have been observed recently in some exotic nuclei, e. g., in (extra large radii of some valence nucleons, very small binding energies of the above nucleons, the appearance of intruder states, etc.), and in the very light “stable” nuclei, i. e., in the and isotopes (high momentum components for the nucleons in the interior of the nucleus and presence of -state admixture in 1 s nuclei). It seems that a common reason does exist for the appearance of the above phenomena, which is the appearance of an interior collective rota­tion of certain nucleons in all aforementioned nuclei due to an incomplete pairing of nucleon momenta in these nuclei. The experience gained from the study of the above light nuclei is transferred to the light hypernuclei, a fact which permits their first study and also leads to a first prediction of the existence of similar unusual phenom­ena in these hypernuclei as well. ...|$|R
