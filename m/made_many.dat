Fillmore <b>made</b> <b>many</b> speeches along {{the way from the}} train's rear platform, urging acceptance of the Compromise, and afterwards went on a tour of New England with his Southern cabinet members. Although Fillmore urged Congress to authorize a transcontinental railroad, it did not do so until a decade later.|$|E
5|$|According to Quirky, Wink {{products}} were in 300,000 homes by 2015. In April 2015 Wink experienced a security problem that <b>made</b> <b>many</b> of its hubs go offline or break, forcing {{the company to}} issue a recall. The recall caused a several-month inventory backlog and subsequent shortage of the Wink hub. Due to financial difficulties, {{due in part to}} the recall, Quirky began looking for buyers to sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to Flextronics (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of firmware and hardware. Wink continues to operate as an independent subsidiary of Flex. As of 2016, 1.3 million devices are connected to Wink.|$|E
