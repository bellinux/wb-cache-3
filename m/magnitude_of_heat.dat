Just like cooling loads, heat gains can be separated into sensible and latent heat gains that can occur through conduction, convection, and radiation. Thermophysical properties of walls, floors, ceilings, and windows, lighting power density (LPD), plug load density, occupant density, and equipment efficiency play an important role in determining the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> gains in a building.

50|$|At low flight speeds the DASS engine relies {{solely on}} the {{on-board}} turbojet that runs on a conventional hydrocarbon fuel. The variable geometry intake (PCT patent pending) allows large gaps to form between the heat exchanger (which is not operating at this stage), minimizing intake pressure losses. During this mode, the bypass is closed and all air is processed through the turbojet core. The exhaust nozzle (PCT patent pending) contracts in the subsonic mode for optimal specific thrust. As the engine accelerates to supersonic velocities, the articulated portions of the intake direct flow into the heat exchanger (PCT patent pending). Liquid hydrogen fuel is passed through the heat exchanger, decreasing {{the temperature of the}} air prior to engine compression. Some of the air bypass the turbojet core, and is mixed with the hydrogen exiting the heat exchanger in the afterburner section. Note that the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> transfer is coupled to the amount of hydrogen available for combustion in the afterburner. The combustion products are then expanded through a supersonic nozzle, variable geometry nozzle. The engine will be designed to completely consume the air to optimize for thrust. The level of bypass changes throughout the supersonic flight regime. The engine can operate at Mach 4 and provide thrust in excess of a conventional ramjet. At high Mach numbers (~4.88) air cannot be cooled below the turbojet limit (1200K). As a result, no combustion can occur in the core turbojet and the engine must transition into a pure ramjet mode. The variable inlet continues to articulate (PCT patent pending) to completely block air access to the turbojet, while optimizing intake to exit area ratios for ramjet combustion using hydrogen. The engine still realizes an efficiency boost from the cooling effects of the heat exchanger (albeit much less in this mode). The terminal flight speed is limited to that of a hydrogen fueled ramjet.|$|E

In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler first expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower pressure (LP) cylinders.

30|$|The {{temperature}} {{reading of}} the present study indicates that, on average, a high temperature of (> 55 Â Â°C) was recorded only for 8 Â days in windrows and during which the pile was turned only once letting it to experience the high temperature of > 55 Â Â°C for only a day after this first turning. This would therefore suggest that, had the piled feedstock been turned more frequently such that every 2 or 3 Â days, the biomass would have enjoyed the lethal high temperature uniformly and for relatively longer period of time and thus would have resulted in increased efficiency of helminth egg elimination. This justification is of course in argument with the reports of KonÃ© et al. (2007) who demonstrated the non-significant effect of turning frequency on the inactivation efficiency of helminths egg. However, it has been explained that the size of the piled feedstock determines the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generated and the time duration in which the thermophilic phase would be maintained during the composting process. The larger the size of the pile the higher the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> generated and the longer the thermophilic phase would be maintained within the pile, and thus the less frequently it can be turned. In cases where the pile size is smaller, the thermophilic phase would last {{for a short period of}} time; therefore, unless turned frequently there would be no chance for the out laid biomass to enjoy the lethal high temperature which is usually formed inside the pile. In the United States of America, the compost is regarded as hygienically safe if a temperature > 55 Â Â°C is maintained in windrows for at least 15 Â days with a minimum of 5 turnings during the high temperature period (USEPA 1999).|$|E
