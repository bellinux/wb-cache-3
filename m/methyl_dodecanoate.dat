Maximal glycerol ester hydrolase (lipase) activity {{was observed at}} pH 5. 0 to 5. 5 and 50 C when trioctanoin and olive oil were used as substrates. The enzyme also showed esterase activity; it hydrolyzed, {{with the exception of}} methyl butyrate, all methyl esters tested. A minimum chain length of six carbons appeared to be a requirement for esterase activity, which was maximal at about pH 5. 5 with <b>methyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> (C 12) as the substrate. Neither the glycerol ester hydrolase (lipase) nor the esterase activity of the enzyme appeared to be affected by thiol group inhibitors, chelating agents, and reducing compounds. On the other hand, hydrolysis of triolein and <b>methyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> was arrested to the same extent in the presence of diisopropyl fluorophosphate, which suggested the involvement of serine in the active center of the enzyme.

30|$|The {{biotransformation}} of FAMEs {{has been}} widely used {{for the production of}} dodecanedioic acid (12 carbon chain of DCAs) from dodecane (Yi and Rehm 1982; Picataggio et al. 1992), <b>methyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> (Funk et al. 2017), or {{a combination of the two}} (Lee et al. 2017). However, the use of this strategy for the production of sebacic acid has not been much reported (Shiio and Uchio 1971; Beardslee et al. 2014; Chung et al. 2015). Researchers have used decane induction for biotransformation of methyl decanoate to sebacic acid (Beardslee et al. 2014). Particularly, decane induction was performed using 10  g/L decane for 6  h before methyl decanoate was fed into the fermenter for biotransformation. However, while examining this method, we found the accumulation of decanoic acid and 10 -hydroxydecanoic acid during the decane induction period even at lower concentrations of decane, which possibly could decrease the productivity of sebacic acid.|$|E

ChemCad 6. 0. 1 version is used for this simulation. Reactants are fed, methanol to dodecanoic acid feed ratio = 1. 3 : 1 (1 kmol/h). The RD column has 20 stages and reflux ratio (R = 3). The fatty acid is fed above and methanol below the reactive zone (mid 15 stages), respectively. In {{order to reduce the}} amount of dodecanoic acid in the final product, the fatty acid—- heavier than the alcohol—must be fed in the top of reactive zone. The composition and temperature profile in the reactive distillation column are obtained. It is concluded that reduced capital and operating costs, due to less units and lower energy consumption, biodiesel is produced by using RD column...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to determine the volatile profile of four cultivars - Barker, Collinson, Fortuna and Geada of avocado (Persea americana, Mill.) fruit and to perform a detailed study on the effect of volatiles extraction conditions. The best conditions for extraction for Collinson and Fortuna cultivars were by using a mixture of pentane and ethyl ether (2 : 1) as solvent for 80 min, while for Barker and Geada cultivars, the solvents were hexane and pentane-ether (2 : 1), respectively but for a shorter extraction period of 60 min. A total number of 158 compounds were separated in all 4 avocado cultivars, among them eighty-four volatile compounds were identified. The principal volatile compounds viz. hexanal, ethyl acetate, <b>methyl</b> <b>dodecanoate,</b> 2, 5 -dimethyl furan, 1, 3 -butanediol, 2 -ethylphenol, 2 -butanol, &# 945;&# 8722;bergamotene, &# 946;&# 8722;caryophyllene, (E) - 2 -decenal were common in all the 4 cultivars. (E) - 2 -pentenal which possesses fruity aroma was found only in the cultivar Fortuna while ethyl acetate possessing fresh fruity flavor was present in higher content in Collinson cultivar. Benzaldehyde which possesses characteristic fruity and nutty odor note was present at a higher concentration (4. 3 %) in only Geada cultivar and in traces in Barker cultivar but it was not detected in Collinson and Fortuna cultivars...|$|E
40|$|High {{pressure}} phase equilibria measurements of long chain saturated methyl esters (methyl decanoate, <b>methyl</b> <b>dodecanoate,</b> methyl tetradecanoate, methyl hexadecanoate, methyl octadecanoate and methyl docosanoate) in supercritical ethane have been measured for temperatures between 312 K and 355 K and for methyl ester mass fractions from 0. 65 to 0. 018. The results show a generally linear {{relationship between the}} phase equilibria pressure and the temperature with complete mutual solubility above 17 MPa. No three-phase regions or temperature inversions (change in sign of gradient of temperature-pressure relationship at constant composition) were observed while maxima in the phase transition pressures were found for methyl ester mass fractions usually between 0. 2 and 0. 3. When the phase transition pressure is plotted {{as a function of}} carbon number at constant temperature and mass fraction methyl ester, a linear relationship is realised. This linear relationship can be used to determine the solubility of any saturated methyl ester with between 10 and 22 carbon atoms, with limited extrapolation being possible. Thermodynamic modelling of the measured phase equilibria with the sPC-SAFT and Peng Robinson equations of state showed that, even with the use of an interaction parameter, these equations of state are not able to model the phase behaviour and the linear pressure-carbon numbers provide more accurate predictions. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|The European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is a {{worldwide}} pest of maize (Zea mays L.) and other crops. The semiochemicals released by maize plants and structurally-related compounds {{can be used}} by adult female O. nubilalis for host-plant location and oviposition. Headspace volatile compounds emitted by watered and water-deprived maize plants are collected and identified by their retention indices and mass spectra. The most abundant compounds from watered plants are limonene, linalool, benzoic acid, indole, β-caryophyllene and acetophenone, whereas, in water-deprived plants, limonene, acetophenone, hexanoic acid, benzoic acid and indole are dominant. In addition, (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene, 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, anisole and 1 -carvone are undetected in the water-deprived plants. Some of the identified compounds show electrophysiological activity (electroantennogram) in the antennae of both sexes, with the responses elicited by tridecane, tetradecane, dodecane, nonanal, decanal and 2 -ethylhexanol on males being particularly noteworthy. In a dual-choice olfactometer, adult females show a preference for 2 -hexanol, heptanal, methyl salicylate, hexyl acetate, nonanal, <b>methyl</b> <b>dodecanoate,</b> β-pinene and (E) - 2 -hexenyl acetate over hexane controls. Tetradecane, linalool, methyl hexanoate, methyl nonanoate, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl benzoate, tridecane, 2 -cyclopentylcyclopentanone, 3 -methylbutyl acetate, β-myrcene and (Z) - 3 -hexenyl butanoate result in fewer females in the test arm compared with the control arm. No single compound displays an activity similar to watered maize plants, supporting the hypothesis that blends of volatiles in specific ratios are more effective than single volatile chemicals. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that methyl salicylate, which elicits also one of the highest electrophysiological responses in female antennae, plays a role in host preference by O. nubilalis females.

30|$|PLFAs were {{extracted}} from 300  mg compost as described (Frostegård et al. 1991, 1993; Hedlund 2002) {{based on the}} methods of Bligh and Dyer (1959) and White et al. (1979). In short, PLFAs were extracted using 10  ml Bligh and Dyer solution (CHCl 3 :MeOH:citrate buffer, 1 : 2 : 0.8  v/v/v). Phases were separated by addition of 4  ml CHCl 3 and 4  ml citrate buffer during overnight incubation at room temperature. An aliquot of 3  ml of the lipid extract was transferred to a glass tube. After evaporation of the solvent with a stream of N 2, samples were solubilized in CHCl 3 and applied on a silica column. Phospholipids were eluted with 1.5  ml MeOH after eluting the neutral and glycolipids with 1.5  ml CHCl 3 and 6  ml acetone, respectively. 5  µg of methyl nonadecanoate (C 19 : 0, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each sample as an internal standard. Samples were transesterified at 37  °C for 15  min by addition of 1  ml toluene:methanol (1 : 1) and 1  ml freshly made 0.2  M KOH in methanol. After cooling to room temperature for 20  min, 2  ml hexane:CHCl 3 (4 : 1 v/v), 0.3  ml 1  M HAc, and 2  ml H 2 O were added. Samples were centrifuged for 5  min at 685  g and 5  µg of <b>methyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> (C 12 : 0, Sigma Aldrich) was added as an internal control to the upper phase that contained the PLFAs. After evaporation of the solvent by a stream of N 2, lipids were taken up in 200  µl hexane for gas chromatography-flame ionization detector analysis. PLFAs were identified based on retention time and equivalent chain length as calculated using C 12 : 0, C 16 : 0, and C 19 : 0. Abundance in nmol g− 1 was calculated using spiked C 19 : 0. The C 18 : 2 ω 6 marker was used to estimate fungal biomass, while various PLFA markers (Additional file 1 : Table S 1) were used as markers of bacterial biomass (Frostegård and Bååth 1996; Hedlund 2002; Ruess and Chamberlain 2010).|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Numerous {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on the contribution of butter cultures to the flavor of cultured cream butter, but production of uniform cultured cream butter has not been possible in industry. Therefore, it was desirable to investigate in detail the qualitative and quantitative chemistry of the flavor of high quality butter cultures, and to examine more closely some of the aspects of flavor production by butter culture organisms. Volatile flavor components of high quality butter culture and control heated milk were isolated from intact samples {{by means of a}} specially designed low-temperature, reduced-pressure steam distillation apparatus. Most of the flavor compounds present in the resulting distillate fractions were tentatively identified by gas chromatographic relative retention time data. Flavor concentrates obtained by ethyl ether extractions of aqueous distillates were also separated by temperature-programmed, capillary column gas chromatography, and the effluent from the capillary column was analyzed by a fast- scan mass spectrometer. Many of the flavor compounds in the flavor concentrates were positively identified by correlation of mass spectral and gas chromatographic data. In addition, supporting evidence for the identification of some flavor components was obtained through the use of qualitative functional group reagents, derivatives and headspace gas chromatography. Compounds that were positively identified in butter culture include ethanol, acetone, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, butanone, 2 -butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methane, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide and methanol; also included were 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, acetoin, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, methyl octanoate and ethyl octanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in butter culture include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, n-butanal, n-butanol, 2 -hexanone, n-pentanal, n-pentanol, 2 -mercaptoethanol, n-butyl formate, n-butyl acetate, 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methylpropanal, methyl heptanoate, n-octanal, 2 -tridecanone, methyl benzoate, methyl nonanoate, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl decanoate, <b>methyl</b> <b>dodecanoate,</b> ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. Compounds that were positively identified in control heated milk include acetaldehyde, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, ethyl octanoate and methyl decanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in control heated milk include dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, methyl acetate, acetone, methanol, butanone, butanal, n-butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -mercaptoethanol, 2 -furfuryl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl heptanoate, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. The data indicated that the qualitative flavor composition of control heated milk and butter culture were very similar. Diacetyl, ethanol, 2 -butanol and acetic acid were noted to be consistently absent in the data for the control heated milk. Other compounds were not observed in the heated milk fractions, but were also absent from some of the culture fractions. This was attributed to their presence in low concentrations, chemical instability or inefficient recovery. A modified 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone spectrophotometric procedure was adapted for the determination of acetaldehyde produced in lactic starter cultures. The procedure was applied in conjunction with diacetyl measurements in studying single- and mixed-strain lactic cultures. The diacetyl to acetaldehyde ratio was found to be approximately 4 : 1 in desirably flavored mixed-strain butter cultures. When the ratio of the two compounds was lower than 3 : 1 a green flavor was observed. Acetaldehyde utilization at 21 °C by Leuconostoc citrovorum 91404 was very rapid in both acidified (pH 4. 5) and non-acidified (pH 6. 5) milk cultures. The addition of five p. p. m. of acetaldehyde to non-acidified milk media prior to inoculation greatly enhanced growth of L. citrovorum 91404 during incubation at 21 °C. Combinations of single-strain organisms demonstrated that the green flavor defect can result from excess numbers of Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus diacetilactis in relation to the L. citrovorum population. Diacetyl, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and carbon dioxide were found to be "key" compounds in natural butter culture flavor. Optimum levels of these compounds in butter culture were ascertained by chemical or flavor panel evaluations. On the basis of these determinations, a synthetic butter culture prepared with heated whole milk and delta-gluconolactone (final pH 4. 65) was flavored with 2. 0 p. p. m. of diacetyl, 0. 5 p. p. m. of acetaldehyde, 1250 p. p. m. of acetic acid, 25. 0 p. p. b. of dimethyl sulfide and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for production of carbon dioxide. The resulting synthetic butter culture exhibited the typical aroma, flavor and body characteristics found in natural high quality butter cultures, except that the delta-gluconolactone was found to contribute an astringent flavor...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Numerous {{attempts}} have been made to identify the flavor compounds in Blue cheese, however, duplication of Blue cheese flavor has not yet been accomplished. Therefore, it was desirable to make a qualitative and quantitative investigation of Blue cheese flavor compounds and to study the effect of certain microorganisms on Blue cheese flavor. The aroma fraction of Blue cheese was isolated by centrifugation of the cheese and molecular distillation of the recovered fat. The volatiles were separated by gas chromatography on packed columns containing polar and nonpolar phases and by temperature programmed capillary column gas chromatography. Relative retention time data and fast scan mass spectral analysis of the capillary column effluent were used to identify compounds in the aroma fraction. Compounds positively identified were as follows: 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -octanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -decanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, 2 -propanol, 2 -pentanol, 2 -heptanol, 2 -octanol, 2 -nonanol, methyl butanoate, methyl hexanote, methyl octanoate, methyl decanoate, <b>methyl</b> <b>dodecanoate,</b> ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethanal, 3 -methyl butanal, 2 -methyl butanol, 3 -methyl butanol, 1 -pentanol, benzene, and toluene. Tentatively identified compounds included acetone, delta-octalactone, delta-decalactone, methyl acetate, isopropyl hexanoate, 3 -methylbutyl butanoate, pentyl hexanoate, ethyl- 2 -methylnonanoate, isopropyl decanoate, furfural, 2 -methyl propanal, methanol, ethanol, 2 -phenylethanol, cresyl methyl ether, dimethylcyclohexane, diacetyl, methyl mercaptan, and hydrogen sulfide. A combination of liquid-liquid column chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography was utilized to quantitate the major free fatty acids in Blue and Roquefort cheese samples. The average concentration (mg acid/kg cheese) in three Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 : 0, 826; 4 : 0, 1, 448; 6 : 0, 909; 8 : 0, 771; 10 : 0, 1, 318; 12 : 0, 1, 588; 14 : 0, 5, 856; 16 : 0, 12, 789; 18 : 0, 4, 243; 18 : 1, 12, 455; 18 : 2, 1, 072; 18 : 3, 987. Roquefort cheese was found to be proportionately more abundant in 8 : 0 and 10 : 0 acids and low in 4 : 0 acid compared to Blue cheese. No formic, propionic, or isovaleric acid was detected in any of the cheeses tested. A quantitative procedure involving adsorption chromatography, liquid-liquid chromatography and absorption spectrophotometry was used to isolate and measure the concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones in the fat of Blue and Roquefort cheese. The average methyl ketone concentration (micromoles ketone/ 10 g cheese fat) of five Blue cheese samples was as follows: acetone, 1. 7; 2 -pentanone, 5. 9; 2 -heptanone, 11. 2; 2 -nonanone, 9. 3; 2 -undecanone, 2. 4. Considerable variation in ketone concentration was noted between samples, but no consistent differences were observed between Blue and Roquefort cheese. One Roquefort sample contained no acetone. The annount of ketone formed during cheese curing does not depend directly on the amount of available fatty acid precursor. There appears to be a selective conversion of the 8 : 0, and to a lesser extent the 6 : 0 and 10 : 0, fatty acids to methyl ketones by the Penicillium roqueforti spores. The concentration of the C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols was determined in the same cheeses used for ketone analysis. The previously measured ketones acted as internal standards and facilitated a semi-quantitative calculation of alcohol concentrations from peak areas of gas chrorriatograms. The average alcohol concentration (micromoles alcohol/ 10 g cheese fat) in five Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 -pentanol, 0. 3; 2 -heptanol, 2. 1; 2 -nonanol, 0. 8. The alcohols were present in approximately the same ratios as their methyl ketone analogs, but at much lower concentrations. A synthetic Blue cheese flavor was prepared using a blend of butterfat, dry curd cottage cheese, cream, and salt as a base. The most typical flavor was obtained using the following' compounds: the 2 : 0, 4 : 0, 6 : 0, and 8 : 0 fatty acids at two-thirds the average concentration found in cheese; twice the average concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones and C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols found in cheese: 2. 0 mg/kg of base of 2 -phenylethanol; 1. 5 mg/kg of base of ethyl butanoate; 6. 0 mg/kg of base of both methyl hexanoate and methyl octanoate. Incorporation of higher acids caused a soapy flavor. The presence of 2 -phenylethanol and the esters was judged as very important in duplicating Blue cheese flavor. The mycelia of Penicillium roqueforti appear to be more active in the reduction of methyl ketones to secondary alcohols than the spores. Yeasts associated with Blue cheese are capable of reducing methyl ketones to secondary alcohols. Yeasts also may play a role in Blue cheese flavor by producing ethanol and other alcohols and certain esters...|$|E
