40|$|Shriver, W. GregoryConservation of {{tidal marsh}} birds {{is a high}} {{priority}} in the United States in light of continued habitat loss from anthropogenic impacts, including climate change. The north Atlantic coast of the U. S. is considered a hotspot for accelerated sea level rise, where rates are increasing {{three to four times}} faster than the global average. Increased inundation and coastal storm severity and frequency affect tidal marsh habitat quantity and quality and threaten tidal <b>marsh</b> <b>bird</b> populations with rapid declines or extinction. Tidal <b>marsh</b> <b>bird</b> distributions and abundance are relatively unknown, but are critical for developing effective, novel conservation strategies to increase the likelihood of species persistence. I developed a regional monitoring framework to assess the status of the tidal <b>marsh</b> <b>bird</b> community breeding in the Northeast U. S. (Maine to Virginia), and derived a conservation strategy for the state of Delaware. I sampled 1, 780 locations during the 2011 - 2012 breeding seasons to estimate species distribution and abundance in tidal marsh habitat patches for five specialist birds: Clapper Rail (Rallus crepitans), Willet (Tringa semipalmata), Nelson's Sparrow (Ammodramus nelsoni), Saltmarsh Sparrow (A. caudacutus), and Seaside Sparrow (A. maritimus). I used the survey estimates to develop Bayesian Network models to predict distribution and abundance in un-sampled habitat patches as a function of patch covariates. Overall, I found the prevalence of Nelson's Sparrow was similar in Coastal Maine and Cape Cod - Casco Bay and the four other species were most common in patches in Long Island (Saltmarsh and Seaside Sparrows), Delaware Bay (Clapper Rail), and Coastal Delmarva (Willet). I estimated 109, 758 (± 48, 505 95 % CI) Clapper Rails; 111, 021 (± 41, 566) Willets; 6, 640 (± 2, 750) Nelson's Sparrows; 60, 058 (± 19, 829) Saltmarsh Sparrows; and 234, 542 (± 119, 419) Seaside Sparrows in the Northeast. In Delaware, I used an optimization algorithm to determine the most favorable, yet cost-effective, unprotected tidal marsh parcels for bird conservation; however, greater than 95 % of the marsh area on the selected parcels was inundated under all sea level rise scenarios evaluated. Agricultural land was the greatest remaining land cover type, highlighting the need to assess the potential for marsh transgression on adjacent lands. The monitoring framework, baseline species assessments, and modeling approaches presented here, can be incorporated into an adaptive management tool to guide complex decision-making for tidal marsh habitat and bird populations in an increasingly changing landscape.

40|$|Shriver, W. GregoryIn North American tidal marshes, {{prescribed}} burning has been employed to manage waterfowl, furbearers, invasive plants, and fuels {{since at least}} the 1930 ???s. Prescribed burning may also affect non-target species, such as <b>marsh</b> <b>birds,</b> but few studies have examined these potential impacts, particularly in the mid-Atlantic region. To address this informational need, I studied breeding secretive <b>marsh</b> <b>birds</b> on the Chesapeake Bay in Dorchester County, Maryland, where prescribed marsh burning has been conducted for at least 70 years. I examined the effect of time since fire on density, nest success, productivity and occupancy. Seaside Sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus maritimus) were the most abundant species in the study area. Seaside Sparrow density was greatest on 2 - 4 months post-fire marshes, and densities decreased as time since fire increased. Seaside Sparrow nest survival rates were lowest on 5 or more years post-fire marshes, and highest on 3 - 4 years post-fire marshes. Nest survival was also dependent on landscape context and annual weather variation. Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) and Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) occupancy was positively influenced by fire. Saltmarsh Sparrows (Ammodramus caudacutus) appear to have a delayed response to winter prescribed burns, as occupancy was negatively impacted by burning over the short-term (3 years), but positively impacted over the long-term (24 years). Coastal Plain Swamp Sparrows (Melospiza georgiana nigrescens) occupied only ecotonal habitat, and did not respond strongly to prescribed burns. I found that prescribed marsh burning had a positive effect on Least Bittern, Virginia Rail, and Saltmarsh Sparrow occupancy, and that Seaside Sparrows were abundant in burned areas. However, there was some evidence that predation may increase immediately following a burn, which may have negatively impacted Seaside Sparrow nest success and productivity on marshes burned 2 - 4 months ago. The natural fire frequency of the study area has been estimated to be 4 - 6 years, indicating that <b>marsh</b> <b>birds</b> may have adapted to occasional fire events.

Information on habitat use of the American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus) and a statistically valid survey design for monitoring changes in populations of inconspicuous marsh birds, which include American and Least Bitterns (Ixobrychus exilis), Pied-billed Grebes (Podilymbus podiceps), Soras (Porzana carolina), and Virginia Rails (Rallus limicola)) is needed to inform conservation and management actions. My research, from 1999 - 2002, examined breeding habitat use and home range of American Bitterns. Also, I used pilot survey data to guide design options to meet objectives for monitoring <b>marsh</b> <b>bird</b> occupancy rates in association with habitat changes. Nest sites of American Bitterns in wetlands (n = 47) and grasslands (n = 33) were positively associated with percent dead vegetation cover and density and negatively associated with vegetation height. Foraging sites of American Bitterns were negatively associated with distance to small water openings and vegetation height. Daily survival rate was 0. 96 (95 % CI 0. 930 - 0. 979) and nest survival rate of American Bitterns was 0. 35 (95 % CI = 0. 15 - 0. 58). The average core home range size (50 %) was 18. 08 ha ([plus or minus] 6. 38) and the 95 % home range was 109. 28 ha ([plus or minus] 38. 47) using the fixed-kernel estimator.

40|$|Although Aves {{is one of}} the best-studied taxa, {{much remains}} to be learned about <b>marsh</b> <b>bird</b> populations. Understanding species-environment {{relationships}} for marsh birds is complicated by the low detection probabilities of many species and the challenges associated with sampling wetland habitats. I evaluated habitat relationships at multiple spatial scales for a marsh passerine, the Swamp Sparrow (M. g. georgiana), in the Great Lakes Region. At the local scale, I monitored breeding Swamp Sparrows at restored and natural marshes and assessed the degree to which habitat attributes influenced nesting success. I hypothesized that nesting success would be lower in restored marshes because of shallower water depths and differences in vegetation composition that may increase nest site accessibility to predators or alter food resources. The daily nest survival rate varied as a quadratic function of date, with survival being highest {{in the middle of the}} nesting season. Pooled daily nest survival rates were 0. 917 (SE = 0. 010) for the restored marshes and 0. 937 (SE = 0. 009) for the natural marshes. The nest success rate of 0. 11 for restored marshes was significantly less than the nest success rate of 0. 18 in natural marshes. All four marshes appeared to function as demographic sinks, although there were large uncertainties in estimated adult and juvenile survival rates. ^ At the patch or wetland scale, I surveyed 21 wetlands using the North American <b>Marsh</b> <b>Bird</b> Monitoring Protocol to compare detection probabilities, species densities, and <b>marsh</b> <b>bird</b> community composition at restored and natural marshes. I expected that detection probabilities and community composition would be generally similar, although I expected slightly fewer wetland species at restored marshes because of lower water levels. I recorded 35 wetland-associated species, comprised of 30 species at natural marshes and 31 species at restored marshes. I estimated detection probabilities for the Swamp Sparrow, Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), and Song Sparrow (Melospiza melodia). Detection probabilities differed among species but did not differ between restored and natural marshes. Densities of these three species were similar in natural marshes; however, Swamp Sparrows trended toward lower densities in restored marshes. Species richness and similarity and diversity indices suggested that the breeding bird communities were similar at restored and natural marshes. ^ At the population scale, I modeled Swamp Sparrow abundance and evaluated how the choice of spatial and temporal scales used to aggregate Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data influenced model fit and performance. I hypothesized that Swamp Sparrow abundance would be negatively influenced by the amount of cropland and medium- and high-density development, road density, and temperature, and be positively influenced by the amount of wetland area, stream density, and winter precipitation. I expected that models based on intermediate spatial data aggregation scales (e. g., 5 -stop or 10 -stop segments) would exhibit the highest concordance with environmental variables but that route-scale models would exhibit the best performance. All top-ranked models of Swamp Sparrow abundance contained a measure of proximal wetland land cover. The highest concordance between wetland land cover and Swamp Sparrow abundance occurred at small rather than intermediate spatial extents, ranging from 200 m to 400 m from BBS stops, segments, or routes. Contrary to my expectations, road density, the amount of cropland, and the amount of high- and medium-density development did not exhibit a strong negative effect on Swamp Sparrow abundance. The average temperature recorded during each breeding bird survey influenced Swamp Sparrow abundance within a single year, but this effect disappeared when counts were summed over multiple years. Winter precipitation positively influenced Swamp Sparrow abundance aggregated for 5 -stop and 10 -stop segments, but was not a significant predictor in route-scale models. Route-scale models exhibited the best performance, with Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank coefficients between observed and predicted mean values averaging 0. 47. Correlation coefficients for models based on 5 -stop and 10 -stop segments ranged from 0. 26 to 0. 38. My findings confirm that Breeding Bird Survey data may be useful for monitoring and modeling the populations of abundant marsh birds; however, greater uncertainty may be present in <b>marsh</b> <b>bird</b> models based on fine spatial and temporal data aggregation scales.
