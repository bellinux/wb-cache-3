Such θ-regions (phases, fractions) are very tiny in the space of X state parameters. We also discover the cases when the conditional entropy has a local maximum inside the interval (0,π/ 2).

40|$|AbstractHammering test {{is widely}} used to inspect the defects in {{concrete}} structures. However, this method has a major difficulty in inspect at high-places, such as a tunnel ceiling or a bridge girder. Moreover, its detection accuracy is dependent on a tester's experience. Therefore, we study about the non-contact acoustic inspection method of the concrete structure using the air borne sound wave and a laser Doppler vibrometer. In this method, the concrete surface is excited by air-borne sound wave emitted with a long range acoustic device (LRAD), and the vibration velocity on the concrete surface is measured by a laser Doppler vibrometer. A defect part is detected by the same flexural resonance as the hammer method. It is already shown clearly that detection of a defect can be performed from a long distance of 5 m or more using a concrete test object. Moreover, it is shown that a real concrete structure can also be applied. However, when the conventional LRAD {{was used as a}} sound source, there were problems, such as restrictions of a <b>measurement</b> <b>angle</b> and the surrounding noise. In order to solve these problems, basic examination which used the strong ultrasonic wave sound source was carried out.
