25|$|In 1954, the {{government}} was embarrassed by the Crichel Down affair which focused public fears about maladministration and the abuse of executive authority. The magnitude and complexity of <b>ministerial</b> <b>decisions</b> had caused many such decisions gradually to be delegated to {{a growing number of}} tribunals and in 1955, {{the government}} used the debate created by Crichel Down to order a committee under Sir Oliver Franks to report on administrative tribunals and inquiries, though not <b>ministerial</b> <b>decisions</b> of the kind that Crichel Down had exposed.|$|R

2500|$|According to Matthew, [...] "Asquith's {{decision}} for war with Germany {{was the most}} important taken by a British prime minister in the twentieth century, and was more important than any prime <b>ministerial</b> <b>decision</b> of the nineteenth century. It not only dictated the involvement of the United Kingdom in war but affected much of the pattern of imperial, foreign, and economic history {{for the rest of the}} century." [...] Matthew deemed the decision Asquith's, in that without prime ministerial support, it was not likely Britain would have entered the war. Given the deep divisions in the Liberal Party, Pearce and Goodlad noted, [...] "it was a measure of (Asquith's) skill that he took Britain into the war with only two relatively minor Cabinet ministers… choosing to resign".|$|E
2500|$|This {{prompted}} a bitter debate in Israel, with Knesset member Yossi Sarid of the Labor Party declaring that [...] "Freedom of expression in Israel {{has been brought}} to half mast!". Some reports even claimed that Begin himself was stunned that the film was being censored. In protest at the <b>ministerial</b> <b>decision,</b> IBA employees decided to black out the broadcast for 48 minutes during the night that Khirbet Khize was to be screened (February 6, 1978) to protest the IBA's decision to allow the government to intervene in television broadcasting. The next week, the Board of the IBA decided to screen the film. It aired on 13 February 1978, and Ram Loevy earned the reputation of an iconoclast who was {{willing and able to}} fight a deeply politicized system. This was a turning point in his career, and his later films continued to challenge the established mythology of modern Israel.|$|E

60|$|After Mr. Gladstone’s first {{resolution}} was carried, {{the prime minister}} acknowledged {{the change in the}} relations of the government and the House. He and his party had conducted the business of the country though in a minority, just as Lord John Russell between 1846 and 1851 had conducted business for five or six years, though in a minority, “but being morally supported by a majority, as we have been supported by a majority.” In this crisis he pursued a peculiar course. He advised the Queen to dissolve the parliament; {{but at the same time}} he told her Majesty that if she thought the interests of the country would be better served, he tendered his resignation. The Queen did not accept it, he said; and the <b>ministerial</b> <b>decision</b> was to dissolve in the autumn when the new constituencies would be in order. The statement was not clear, and Mr. Gladstone sought in vain to discover with precision whether the prime minister had begun by resigning, or had presented two alternatives leaving the decision to the Queen, and did he mean a dissolution on existing registers? The answer to these questions was not definite, but it did not matter.|$|E
