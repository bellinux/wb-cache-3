40|$|To {{identify}} if {{lower extremity}} <b>malalignments</b> {{were associated with}} increased propensity {{of a history of}} anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures in males and females using a case control design. Twenty subjects (10 males, 10 females) had a history of ACL injury and twenty (10 males, 10 females) had no history of ACL injury. Subjects were assessed for navicular drop, quadriceps angle, pelvic tilt, hip internal and external rotation range of motion, and true and apparent leg length discrepancies. Statistical analysis was performed to identify differences in these measures in regard to injury history and gender, and to identify if any of these measures were predictive of ACL injury history. Increased navicular drop and anterior pelvic tilt were found to be statistically significant predictors of ACL injury history regardless of gender. Limbs that had previously suffered ACL ruptures were found to have increased navicular drop and anterior pelvic tilt compared to uninjured limbs. Based on the results of this retrospective study, the lower extremity <b>malalignments</b> examined do not appear to predispose females to tearing their ACLs more than males...|$|R

50|$|Tendon {{injuries}} {{arise from}} a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors; acute tendon injuries may be predominantly caused by extrinsic factors, whereas in overuse syndromes {{as in the case of}} tendinopathy it may be caused by multifactorial combinations of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. An example of an intrinsic factor for tendinopathies are: poor biomechanics such as limb <b>malalignments</b> and hyperpronation that may cause increased traction loads acting on the foot and ankle that may increase the incidence of Achilles, flexor hallucis longus muscle, and tibialis posterior muscle tendinopathies.|$|R

30|$|Nowadays, the {{treatment}} of the hammertoe is still disputable; indeed, a lot of procedures, both on the soft tissues and the bone structures are purposed and considered efficient. In the rigid and structured deformities not suited for manual correction, arthrodesis of the proximal inter-phalangeal (PIP) joint represents the standard treatment [1]. This procedure is performed by removing the articular surfaces of the proximal and intermediate phalanges. Many systems such as cannulated screws or absorbable pins have been designed for the fixation of the arthrodesis, yet still the K-wire is the traditional method, and most utilized [2 – 6]. However, recently, new intramedullary devices have been used persistently, trying to solve problems such as infections [3, 7], traumatic breaks [8, 9] and <b>malalignments</b> [10] tied to the K-wire.|$|R
30|$|Fifty-six {{professional}} and amateur athletes with partial tears of the ACL {{were enrolled in}} this project from June 2009 to August 2012. The inclusion criteria were history of trauma (direct or indirect) and partial ACL tear, all in a symptomatic athlete. The exclusion criteria were complete ACL tears, multiple ligament injuries, nonathletic patients, significant <b>malalignments</b> in need of correction, asymptomatic patients referred only for MRI findings and injuring the intact bundle during surgery. Chondral lesions and meniscal tears were not considered exclusion criteria, and were addressed at the same operation before augmenting the partial ACL tear. All patients were examined, selected, consented and later operated on by a senior surgeon. Follow up examinations were also conducted by the same senior orthopaedic surgeon.|$|R
40|$|Context: In jump-landing sports, {{the injury}} {{mechanism}} that most frequently {{results in an}} injury is the jumplanding movement. Influencing the movement patterns and biomechanical predisposing factors are supposed to decrease injury occurrence. Objectives: To evaluate {{the influence of a}} 3 -mo coach-supervised jump-landing prevention program on jump-landing technique using the jump-landing scoring (JLS) system. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: On-field. Participants: 116 athletes age 15 - 41 y, with 63 athletes in the control group and 53 athletes in the intervention group. Intervention: The intervention program in this randomized control trial was administered {{at the start of the}} basketball season 2010 - 11. The jump-landing training program, supervised by the athletic trainers, was performed for a period of 3 mo. Main Outcome Measures: The jump-landing technique was determined by registering the jump-landing technique of all athletes with the JLS system, pre- and postintervention. Results: After the prevention program, the athletes of the male and female intervention groups landed with a significantly less erect position than those in the control groups (P <. 05). This was presented by a significant improvement in maximal hip flexion, maximal knee flexion, hip active range of motion, and knee active range of motion. Another important finding was that postintervention, knee valgus during landing diminished significantly (P <. 05) in the female intervention group compared with their control group. Furthermore, the male intervention group significantly improved (P <. 05) the scores of the JLS system from pre- to postintervention. Conclusion: <b>Malalignments</b> such as valgus position and insufficient knee flexion and hip flexion, previously identified as possible risk factors for lower-extremity injuries, improved significantly after the completion of the prevention program. The JLS system can help in identifying these <b>malalignments.</b> Level of Evidence: Therapy, prevention, level 1 b...|$|R

40|$|In {{an eight}} year period, 31 {{patients}} with proximal femoral fractures resulting from sports accidents were treated by implantation of either a Gamma nail or a dynamic hip screw. Return {{to work or}} sports and the time to bone healing did not differ very much between the treatments. Gamma nailing was clearly the best with regard to stability and time to full mobilisation (4. 5 days), but required 39 minutes to perform compared with insertion of a dynamic hip screw (27 minutes). The incidence of complications and <b>malalignments</b> did not differ very much between the two, although, when Gamma nailing was first used in the authors' clinic, more intraoperative complications occurred than with the dynamic hip screw. Stable pertrochanteric fractures may be treated with a dynamic hip screw. Unstable pertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures are treated with a Gamma nail at the authors' institution...|$|R
40|$|Supporters {{of touch}} therapy claim it can treat and cure {{a wide variety}} of illnesses, {{including}} heart failure, diabetes and infections. The "theory" is that people who are ill have disturbed "energy fields," and that by moving trained hands over the patient's body (without contact), a touch therapist can detect <b>malalignments</b> and repattern energy fields to create "energy balance. " In a quasi- experimental study, 30 subjects in 6 hours post cesarean section state were divided into therapeutic touch or placebo (speech induction) groups in a university hospital. In order to assess the pain, Visual Analog scale (VAS) was used, before and after intervention. The mean pain score decreased significantly only in the therapeutic touch group (50. 66 to 39. 53 p< 0. 01). In conclusion, it is recommended that therapeutic touch, as an attentive technique, can be used in pain relieve after cesarean section...|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} to select the most appropriate reference region when manually superimposing the 3 D images. The ideal reference region should be a stable area such as the forehead [39] which {{is unlikely to be}} affected by surgical intervention. Some rotational errors were encountered during forehead registration as the forehead is relatively flat and lacks unique 3 D shape features. Therefore, similar to Jayaratne et al. [40], surfaces over the root of the nose and zygoma were chosen. The relatively thin and immobile nature of the overlying soft tissues in these regions helped eliminate some of the spatial image <b>malalignments.</b> Guest et al. [41] evaluated four methods of superimposition in two surgical patients. All methods were found to produce errors in the calculation of final surface changes. However, the registration algorithm chosen in the present study produced promising and realistic results because no assumptions were made about the direction of displacement between surfaces.|$|R

50|$|The angle {{normally}} has volar tilt of 11° to 12°. The {{most common}} fracture pattern usually demonstrates <b>malalignment</b> of this angle and collapse in a dorsal direction.

After closed reduction, a residual dorsal tilt of a maximum of 5° (16° - 17° deviation) {{is regarded as the}} maximal residual angle for a satisfactory result.|$|E
50|$|Many orthopaedists have {{challenged}} these contraindications and have advocated meniscal transplantation, {{in conjunction with}} cartilage repair, ACL reconstruction or osteotomy in patients with evidence of arthritic deterioration, instability or <b>malalignment.</b> One paper demonstrated that results of meniscus transplantation in patients with arthritic changes were {{similar to that of}} previous reports of meniscus transplantation in patients without arthritic changes, so long as articular cartilage defects were addressed at the time of surgery. In the same paper, the success of meniscus transplantation was not affected by mal-alignment.|$|E
30|$|The present {{retrospective}} study aims {{to evaluate the}} outcome in 41 patients of femoral shaft fractures, who had closed intramedullary nailing in lateral decubitus position without fracture table or image intensifier.

The cannulated reamer in proximal fragment (as intramedullary joystick) and Schanz screw in the distal fragment (as percutaneous joystick) were simultaneously used to assist closed reduction of the fracture {{without the use of}} image intensifier.

40|$|Tendon {{injury is}} a common sports-related problem that affects both the upper and the lower extremities, and it often has eponyms that {{describe}} the offending activity, such as jumper’s knee and tennis elbow.

5000|$|If {{the pain}} does not resolve {{in the first}} 1-2 weeks, then the patient may benefit from a steroid and {{anesthetic}} mixture fluoroscopically injected into the joint (this also serves in confirming diagnosis), as well as manipulative or manual therapy. For the most severe and chronic forms of sacroiliac dysfunction, treatment should proceed {{with the support of}} a sacroiliac belt, injection therapy, and finally, surgery. [...] The anti-inflammatory effect of injection therapy is not permanent, and the injections do not offer an opportunity to stabilize an incompetent joint. Surgery is often considered a last resort, but for some patients, it is the only method of effectively stabilizing the loose joint. A fixation of the joint (screws or similar hardware only, without the use of bone grafting) is more common than a spinal fusion, as it is much less invasive, surgically straightforward, and results in a quicker recovery time for the patient. [...] Some experts in the field believe {{that it is important to}} make sure the sacroiliac joint is in an anatomically correct position prior to fixation or fusion, but published research contradicts this belief. The problem of alignment of the pelvis is that this does not accurately indicate the true status of the inside articular structure, the SIJ. After over 2 decades of pre-fusion pelvic alignment, there is no objective measure to indicate the utility. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that well intentioned clinicians blame the SIJ as causative for the patient's pelvic misalignment. Aligning the pelvis provides temporary relief or relief of pain may occur because multiple structures respond to <b>malalignment</b> such as the hip and lumbar spine; provoking a self-fulfilling prophecy of so-called [...] "SIJ instability." [...] Numerous studies have indicated poor to fair intertester reliability with pelvic palpation and the dubious nature of palpation and traditional gross motion testing was brought into question.|$|E

40|$|Chiropractic is {{the largest}} 'unorthodox' health {{profession}} in the U. S. A. It is licensed in all 50 states and its services are covered by governmental and private health insurance. Yet chiropractic remains, {{in the opinion of}} medical commentators, an unscientific healing cult. Chiropractic holds that much illness is caused, directly or indirectly, by derangements in homeostasis that result from subtle vertebral <b>malalignments</b> called 'subluxations'. Only a minority of 'straight' chiropractors continue to provide spinal manipulation as their only modality, while the majority 'mixers' have embraced physical therapy, vitamin supplements and a wide variety of drugless treatments. Clinical trials suggest that spinal manipulation itself has short-term benefit in back pain, but the success of chiropractic is not fully explained by that effect. The clinical art, though, as manifested in the chiropractic-patient interaction contributes greatly to chiropractic healing. This process promotes patient acceptance and validation, fulfills expectations, provides explanations and engages the patient's commitment.

40|$|A {{recurring}} complication {{voiced by}} trans-tibial prosthetic limb users is ‘poor socket fit’ with painful residuum-socket interfaces, {{a consequence of}} excess pressure. This is attributable to both poor socket fit and poor socket alignment, however, their interaction has not been quantified. Through evaluation of kinetic data this study aimed to articulate an interaction uniting socket design, alignment and interface pressures (IPs). Results will help refine future studies, which will help determine if sockets can be designed, fitted and aligned to maximise mobility whilst minimising injurious forces. IPs were recorded throughout ambulation in one user with ‘optimal (reference) alignment’ followed by five <b>malalignments</b> in a patellar tendon-bearing (PTB) and a hydrocast socket. Marked differences in pressure distribution were discovered when equating the PTB against the hydrocast socket and when comparing IPs from reference to offset alignment. PTB sockets were established more sensitive to alignment perturbations than hydrocast sockets. A complex interaction was found, with the most prominent finding demonstrating the requisite for attainment of optimal alignment: a translational alignment error of 10 mm can increase maximum peak pressures by 227 percent (x̄= 17. 5 %).
