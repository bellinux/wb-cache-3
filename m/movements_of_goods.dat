In 2012, mutual trade was USD 67.9 billion and combined exports reached USD 593.7 billion, while imports were USD 340.9 billion. The first integration stage primarily enhanced trade among member states, bolstered economies and created a legal and institutional foundation for the member states.

The four freedoms came into effect on 1 January 2015 (the day the Eurasian Economic Union was officially established). The free movement of people means that citizens can move freely among member states to live, work, study or retire. Citizens of the member states of the union may travel to other member states on an internal passport. Although Russia also admits access to citizens of other CIS states without a passport, it is expected that after 2015 only citizens of the Customs Union will have this privilege.|$|E

The nearby Naneghat (Toll collection booth) was used for commercial purpose by traders to help in easy <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> As this was an important pass joining the seas to the mainland, it was heavily guarded from enemies. The Jivdhan fort stood as an important guard fort to protect the interests of various kingdoms. The last emperor of Adilshahi of Ahmednagar was little Murtaza. He was kept as a prisoner by Mughal at Jivdhan fort. In 1635 the father of Chatrapati Shivaji Mararaj, Shahaji maharaj released him from the prison and declared him as a King of Ahmednagar. Jivdhan to Naneghat has an open field of 2-3 km, which gives any clear indication of enemy approach. The British captured this fort in 1818 and destroyed all approaches. This fort was captured by Col. Prother of the East India company and later destroyed.|$|E

5000|$|The TAR {{was seen}} as a way to {{accommodate}} the huge increases in international trade between Eurasian nations and facilitate the increased <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> between countries.

A big challenge is the differences in rail gauge across Eurasia. Four different major rail gauges (which measures the distance between rails) exist across the continent: most of Europe, as well as Turkey, Iran, China, and the Koreas use the [...] gauge, known as Standard gauge; Russia, and the former Soviet republics use a [...] gauge; Finland uses a [...] gauge; almost all of the railways in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka use the [...] gauge, known as Indian gauge; and most of Southeast Asia has [...] metre gauge.

5000|$|One of {{the many}} frustrations of the crisis was {{the erosion of the}} {{development}} effort financed by the international community, since the overwhelming emphasis in donor work was now directed towards mitigating the impact of the economic and social crisis. A collapse of the PNA was averted by emergency budget support from donor countries. Despite a significant increase in donor commitments in 2002 compared with 2001, commitments to infrastructure and capacity-building work with a medium-term focus continued to decline. In 2000, the ratio was approximately 7:1 infavor of development assistance. By 2002, the ratio had shifted to almost 5:1 in favor ofemergency assistance.Yasser Arafat's death in 2004 and Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza created new hopes to the donor community. In March 2005, the Quartet on the Middle East underscored the importance of development assistance, and urged the international donors community to support Palestinian institution building, without however ignoring budgetary support. The Quartet also urged Israel and the PNA to fulfill their commitments arising from the Road map for peace, and the international community [...] "to review and energize current donor coordination structures ... in order to increase their effectiveness." [...] The international community's attempt in late 2005 to promote Palestinian economic recovery reflected a long-standing assumption that economic development is crucial to the peace process and to prevent backsliding into conflict. Although a mild positive growth returned in 2003 and 2005, this fragile recovery stalled {{as a result of the}} segmentation of the Gaza Strip, the stiff restrictions on <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and people across the borders with Israel and Egypt, and the completion of the Israeli West Bank barrier.
