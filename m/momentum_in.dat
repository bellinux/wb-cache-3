This paper is the first {{to address the issue of}} the dollar capacity of <b>momentum</b> strategies <b>in</b> the Australian market. We find evidence of a strong <b>momentum</b> effect <b>in</b> Australia amongst the S 2 ̆ 6 P/ASX 200 constituents. We find that momentum portfolios suffered during the GFC, but the effect was not persistent. Finally, we show that the capacity of the <b>momentum</b> effect <b>in</b> Australia is large enough in dollar terms to reject the assertion that momentum is more of a theoretical than a practical construct...|$|R

5|$|At the time, Baden-Powell {{intended}} {{that the}} scheme {{would be used}} by established organizations, in particular the Boys' Brigade, from the founder William A. Smith. However, because of the popularity of his person and the adventurous outdoor games he wrote about, boys spontaneously formed Scout patrols and flooded Baden-Powell with requests for assistance. He encouraged them, and the Scouting movement developed <b>momentum.</b> <b>In</b> 1910 Baden-Powell formed The Boy Scouts Association in the United Kingdom.

5|$|Between 1925 and 1929, the SS was {{considered}} to be a small Gruppe (battalion) of the SA. Except in the Munich area, the SS was unable to maintain any <b>momentum</b> <b>in</b> its membership numbers, which declined from 1,000 to 280 as the SA continued its rapid growth. As Heiden attempted to keep the SS from dissolving, Heinrich Himmler became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler displayed good organizational abilities compared to Heiden. The SS established a number of Gaus (regions or provinces). The SS-Gaus consisted of SS-Gau Berlin, SS-Gau Berlin Brandenburg, SS-Gau Franken, SS-Gau Niederbayern, SS-Gau Rheinland-Süd, and SS-Gau Sachsen.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the union, the process of gradual Polonization gained steady <b>momentum.</b> <b>In</b> culture and social life, both the Polish language and Catholicism became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Belarusian as the official language—with the Belarusian language being banned from administrative use.

5|$|Meanwhile, former Ohio Works {{players in}} Zanesville quickly regained their <b>momentum.</b> <b>In</b> March 1907, the new club was {{admitted}} into the Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League, a Division D league. By {{the close of}} the 1907 season, the club had seized the championship of the eight-team P-O-M league. In 1908, Hogan's final season as manager, the team was christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. Further {{research is needed to determine}} the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at {{the close of the}} 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up.|$|E

5|$|Nationalist {{movements}} {{in some countries}} and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups, or perceived in the West to be allied with communists. In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained <b>momentum</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s and early 1960s; additionally, the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology.

5|$|The league {{was unusually}} competitive; {{a mistake in}} early April caused Benfica to lose much of their lead. Qualifying for the Portuguese Cup final did not help them to gather <b>momentum.</b> <b>In</b> early May, Benfica {{suffered}} a major blow, losing away to Penafiel and dropping to second. A crucial win against Sporting brought back thei title hope, and a week later Benfica won their first league title in ten seasons. The season ended with a loss against Vitória de Setúbal in the Taça de Portugal Final, preventing Benfica from winning their first double since 1987.|$|E
5|$|The sudden boom of {{the silk}} {{industry}} in the Italian state of Lucca, starting in the 11th and 12th centuries was due to much Sicilian, Jewish, and Greek settlement, alongside many other immigrants from neighbouring cities in southern Italy. With the loss of many Italian trading posts in the Orient, the import of Chinese styles drastically declined. Gaining <b>momentum,</b> <b>in</b> order to satisfy {{the rich and powerful}} bourgeoisie's demands for luxury fabrics, the cities of Lucca, Genoa, Venice and Florence were soon exporting silk to all of Europe. In 1472 there were 84 workshops and at least 7000 craftsmen in Florence alone.|$|E

5|$|After Lithuania {{successfully}} re-established its independence, {{interest in}} his story gained <b>momentum</b> <b>in</b> Lithuania and elsewhere. In Jurbarkas, a street was named after him. The Lithuanian Air Force now sponsors the Marcinkus Pistol Marksmanship Cup. In 2001 the British Ambassador in Vilnius gave Marcinkus' previously unclaimed war medals to a surviving relative, his nephew, Alvydas Gabėnas, during a commemorative ceremony. The RAF provided a fly-past of Harrier jets from Marcinkus' No. 1 Squadron RAF, in which one aircraft saluted the ceremony. In the same year a plaque was dedicated to honour the famous Lithuanian pilot in Kaunas. Gražina Sviderskytė, a CNN award-winning journalist, wrote {{a detailed account of}} Marcinkus' life in her book Uragano kapitonas ("Hurricane Captain"), which was published in 2004. A documentary film with the same title was produced in 2004. Marcinkus' life story was reprinted in various foreign publications in the USA, Canada, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal kicked-off {{the match}} and {{did their best}} to {{restrict}} Liverpool's passing game in the opening 45 minutes through tackling and quick counter-attacking with the long ball; with the game's flow interrupted and the two teams cancelling each other out, neither side built any <b>momentum</b> <b>in</b> the first half with few clear-cut chances. The first notable action came for Arsenal when a cross from Michael Thomas on the right which was met by Steve Bould, but Steve Nicol cleared it over the bar for a corner. Liverpool responded with a shot from outside the box from Rush after being teed up by Aldridge. However, soon after Rush was forced to go off with a groin strain and had to be replaced by Peter Beardsley in the 32nd minute. The score was 0–0 at half time.|$|E
5|$|As the day (26 January 1965) of {{switching}} over to Hindi as sole {{official language}} approached, the anti-Hindi movement gained <b>momentum</b> <b>in</b> Madras State with increased support from college students. On 25 January, a full-scale riot {{broke out in}} the southern city of Madurai, sparked off by a minor altercation between agitating students and Congress party members. The riots spread all over Madras State, continued unabated for the next two months, and were marked by acts of violence, arson, looting, police firing and lathi charges. The Congress Government of the Madras State, called in paramilitary forces to quell the agitation; their involvement resulted in the deaths of about seventy persons (by official estimates) including two policemen. To calm the situation, Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long as the non-Hindi speaking states wanted. The riots subsided after Shastri's assurance, as did the student agitation.|$|E

Soon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury and the other to suspension. Duquesne lost its final non-conference game and slipped into a five-game losing streak. The team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any <b>momentum.</b> <b>In</b> mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd.

5|$|In {{the first}} {{possession}} of the second half, the Terrapins were forced to punt after a run attempt for loss, a false start penalty, and two incomplete passes. The Maryland defense took the field and stopped a Clemson drive. On the first play of their second series, wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey executed a reverse to gain 76yards before being stopped at the Clemson four-yard line. This set up a short Chris Turner touchdown pass to receiver Torrey Smith, and shifted the game's <b>momentum</b> <b>in</b> favor of Maryland. In the fourth quarter, three completions to Danny Oquendo {{set the stage for}} a one-yard rush into the endzone by Da'Rel Scott. In the second half, the Maryland defense allowed Clemson just 31rushing yards and zeropoints, compared with 204rushing yards and 17points in the first half.|$|E
