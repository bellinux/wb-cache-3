5|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>toe</b> {{is greatly}} elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking, and are of little use as weapons or organs of prehension as in birds of prey and Old World vultures. The beak is hooked, and adapted to tear rotting meat. The irises of the male are brown, while those of the female are deep red. The eyelids lack eyelashes. Contrary to the usual rule for sexual dimorphism among birds of prey, the female is smaller than the male.|$|E
5|$|Equine hooves {{and legs}} have evolved over {{millions}} of years to the form in which they are found today. The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the <b>middle</b> <b>toe,</b> while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones. Prairie-dwelling equine species developed hooves and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food. Forest-dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling equine species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family.|$|E
50|$|Therapsid {{legs were}} {{positioned}} more vertically beneath their bodies {{than were the}} sprawling legs of reptiles and pelycosaurs. Also compared to these groups, the feet were more symmetrical, with {{the first and last}} toes short and the <b>middle</b> <b>toes</b> long, an indication that the foot's axis was placed parallel to that of the animal, not sprawling out sideways. This orientation would have given a more mammal-like gait than the lizard-like gait of the pelycosaurs.|$|R
50|$|It is speculated by paleontologists {{that during}} the Eocene period, hoofed marsh dwellers carried their body weight mainly {{on two of the}} <b>middle</b> <b>toes,</b> which grew to equal size, {{becoming}} the Artiodactyla or even-toed hoofed animals. Prior to the close of the Eocene period the side toes of some had dwindled and practically disappeared while the basal pieces or metapodium of the pair of supporting toes became fused together, thus producing the appearance of a cloven hoof.|$|R
30|$|Hallux varus, syndactaly and {{conjoint}} delta first metatarsals are {{the most}} common toe deformities associated with FH that benefit from surgical treatment of the toes. Syndactaly of the first to second toes is easily treated by release and skin grafting. Syndactaly between the <b>middle</b> <b>toes</b> {{does not need to be}} separated. Hallux varus is always associated with a short bracket (delta) first metatarsal. In most cases this is a conjoint metatarsal (fusion of first and second metatarsal) associated with syndactaly of the first and second toes. The treatment for this requires separation of the syndactaly combined with splitting of the conjoint metatarsal into two parts and reorienting of this osteotomy to realign the first metatarso-phalangeal joint surface.|$|R

At Wimbledon, {{she was one of}} six seeded female players to be knocked out in the first round, losing to Jana Čepelová in three sets. During her match against Čepelová, Halep {{suffered}} a blister on the <b>middle</b> <b>toe</b> of her left foot. After Wimbledon, Halep took a couple of weeks off to regroup and make her game stronger again.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{technique}} {{is also evident}} from a dancer's body alignment, by visualizing a straight line that extends {{from the center of}} the hip through the toes. When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and big toe joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and the joints of the second toe or <b>middle</b> <b>toe</b> or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.|$|E

50|$|The eared nightjars {{are large}} {{compared}} to many nightjars, but otherwise {{are similar in}} structure. They are long-winged and long-tailed, and are light for the wing area, making them powerful and agile in flight. An important difference from typical nightjars {{is the lack of}} bristles around the beak. They are nocturnal and have a reflective tapetum lucidum {{at the back of the}} eye. The beaks are small, but these birds have a very large gape for catching insects in flight. The feet and legs are small and weak, and the toes are partly webbed. the <b>middle</b> <b>toe's</b> claw has a comb-like pecten on its inner edge, which may be used for plumage care.|$|R

The movable headcrest, which is present in all cockatoos, is spectacular in many species; it is raised when the bird lands from flying or when it is aroused. Cockatoos share many features with other parrots, including the characteristic curved beak shape and a zygodactyl foot, with the two <b>middle</b> <b>toes</b> forward and the two outer toes backward. They differ {{in the presence of}} an erectile crest and their lack of the Dyck texture feather composition which causes the bright blues and greens seen in true parrots.|$|R
500|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's small bill is {{used for}} {{plucking}} feathers and pulling prey apart, rather than killing or cutting. Its long legs and toes are an adaptation for catching and eating birds. The outer toe is [...] "fairly long and slender"; the inner toe and back toe are relatively short and thick. The <b>middle</b> <b>toe</b> is very long {{and can be used}} to grasp objects, while a protuberance {{on the underside of the}} toe means that the digit can be closed without leaving a gap, which helps with gripping.|$|E
2500|$|As regards {{other parts}} of the skeleton, the {{proposed}} synapomorphies of pelagornithids and waterfowl are found mainly in the arm- and handbones: the ulna had a strongly [...] upper backside at its elbow end – at the handward end of which the scapulotricipital muscles attached –, a point-tipped dorsal cotyle and only a shallow depression to house the meniscus between ulna and radius; towards the elbow, the intercondylar sulcus of the ulna becomes wide and is bordered by a long winding ridge on the belly side. The radius, meanwhile, has a convex ventral border to the humeral cotyle, which prominently continues the hind edge of the knob where the biceps brachii muscle attaches; towards the upper side of the radius bone the surface becomes flat and triangular handwards of the articular surface for the ulna. The carpometacarpus of both Anseriformes and pseudotooth birds has a prominent pisiform process, which extends from the carpal trochlea far fingerwards along the bone's forward side. On the carpometacarpus' underside, there is a long but narrow symphysis of the distal metacarpals, with the large metacarpal bone having a mid-ridge that at its outer end curves tailwards, and the thumb joint has a well-developed knob on the hind side of its articular surface. The leg and foot bones, as is to be expected from birds not as specialized for swimming as waterfowl are, show less similarities between Anseriformes and pseudotooth birds: on the tibiotarsus there is a wide incision between the condyles and the middle condyle is narrower than the side condyle and protrudes forwards; the tarsometatarsus has a low distal vascular [...] with recessed opening on its plantar surface and a <b>middle</b> <b>toe</b> trochlea that is elongated, slightly oblique, projects to the underside of the foot and is pointed at the tip.|$|E

5000|$|Talenkauen {{was rather}} like Dryosaurus {{in shape and}} build, but with a {{proportionally}} longer neck. The full length {{of the body is}} estimated at no more than 4 m. Unlike more derived iguanodontians, it still had teeth in the tip of the beak (premaxillary teeth), and a first toe. More derived iguanodonts lose this toe, retaining only the three <b>middle</b> <b>toes.</b> The humerus has reduced areas for muscle attachment, a featured shared with other South American ornithopods like Notohypsilophodon and Anabisetia. This and other similarities to South American ornithopods suggests {{that there may have been}} a distinct Southern Hemisphere ornithopod group, but at the time the authors cautioned that such an interpretation was not entirely justified.

40|$|Frasier {{syndrome}} {{is a very}} rare developmental disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance. It is characterized by male hermaphroditism, primary amenorrhea, chronic renal failure (CRF), {{and a number of}} other abnormalities. A 28 -year-old Nigerian female who was considered as a possible case of Frasier syndrome first presented to us in July 2002 with primary amenorrhea, congenital bilateral absence of <b>middle</b> <b>toes,</b> elevated blood pressure, and the uremic syndrome. The management of the case was mainly conservative, including blood pressure control with appropriate antihypertensives. The problems inherent in this index case are discussed while proffering appropriate management approach in a near-ideal situation, which unfortunately is nonexistent in our local environment. The presentation of this case is informed by the need to create awareness about this rare syndrome being a possible cause of CRF in some of our patients...|$|R
5000|$|Human feet {{have evolved}} {{enlarged}} heels {{in order to}} bear the amount of weight that has also been increased. The human foot evolved as a platform to support the entire weight of the body, rather than acting as a grasping structure, {{as it did in}} early hominids. Humans therefore have smaller toes than their bipedal ancestors. This includes a non-opposable hallux, which is relocated in line with the other toes. [...] Moreover, humans have a foot arch rather than flat feet. [...] When non-human hominids walk upright, weight is transmitted from the heel, along the outside of the foot, and then through the <b>middle</b> <b>toes</b> while a human foot transmits weight from the heel, along the outside of the foot, across the ball of the foot and finally through the big toe. This transference of weight contributes to energy conservation during locomotion.|$|R

50|$|The ibisbill is 38 - 41 cm {{long and}} is quite unmistakable in appearance. The adult is grey {{with a white}} belly, a crimson, long down-curved bill {{similar to that of}} the {{unrelated}} ibis, and a black face and black breast band. The sexes are similar, but young birds lack the black on the face and breast, and the bill is duller. The bill is 6.8 - 8.2 cm long and is slightly longer in females. The legs are greyish purple in the breeding adults and dull sepia in juveniles or greenish in younger or non-breeding adults. The legs of deceased ibisbills change color to a crimson similar to the bill shade shortly after death. The tarsi is short and reticultated. The ibisbill has three toes, lacking the hind toe. The outer and <b>middle</b> <b>toes</b> are connected by a small, idented web, while the <b>middle</b> and inner <b>toes</b> possess no webbing. The Ibisbill typically weighs 270 - 320 g and females weigh slightly more than males. In spite of its spectacular appearance it is inconspicuous in its stony environment. The call is a ringing Klew-klew similar to that of a greenshank. In flight, its outstretched neck and rounded wings give an ibis-like appearance.|$|R

40|$|Individual Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) may be {{identified}} by comparing their toe-scale patterns. Comparisons are, however, very tedious when dealing {{with a large number}} of birds. This study developed a computer-assisted classification system to facilitate the identification process, based on visual analysis of photographs of the dorsal surface of the <b>middle</b> <b>toes</b> of both feet. One-hundred-eighty photographs of right and left feet of 90 Peregrine Falcons (F. p. anatum) were analyzed. Toe-scale patterns were classified on the basis of similarities, reducing the number of prints for visual comparison to a more practical level. The classification system was based on the formulation of an alphanumeric code which distinguished right from left feet, and single from double scales. Each code was entered into a computerized filing program. To determine whether a 2 ̆ 2 suspect 2 ̆ 2 print was included in the computer file, it was characterized in a similar manner. The code was entered into the search option of the filing program, which displayed all similar code sequences in the file. The 2 ̆ 2 suspect 2 ̆ 2 print could then be compared visually with each of the possible matches until a correct match was found. Using prints from both feet, conscientious evaluators with minimal training and no prior experience in using the system were able to correctly identify 2 ̆ 2 suspect 2 ̆ 2 falcons with a high rate of success...|$|R
40|$|Plantar {{pressures}} during locomotion have causal {{links with}} foot pathologies e. g. osteoarthritis and foot abscesses. The causes of these pathologies are multifactorial but the foot-ground interaction {{is a major}} factor, particularly the frequencies and amplitudes of loading at foot impact, which can exacerbate pathology even if not the primary cause. Foot anatomy varies enormously amongst hoofed mammals, yet the functional consequences of foot anatomical variations are still a mystery. Elephants and rhinos respectively have five and three toes bound in a flexible pad of fibrous tissue (digital cushion), which is heavy and costly to swing, but seems to dampen vibrations when the foot hits the ground. Are the digital cushion and multi-toed foot structure thus marvellous solutions that control peak foot pressures in giant animals? How then do intermediate designs such as cows and giraffes work? We here study six species (pigs, horses, cows, rhinos, giraffes and elephants) to determine how foot anatomy and body mass influence the distribution of regional plantar pressures during walking. Our results show that peak pressure levels are maintained at near-constant relative levels across animal sizes by foot specializations, but that pressures on the distal ends of <b>middle</b> <b>toes</b> are significantly beyond those of {{other parts of the}} feet. Our study is the first attempt to measure plantar pressure distributions using spatially continuous descriptive statistical images and subsequent topological analysis, a set of techniques recently developed for human plantar pressure studies...|$|R
60|$|The tarsi vary {{considerably}} in length, being relatively to the femur considerably {{longer in the}} Spanish and Frizzled, and shorter in the Silk and Bantam breeds, than in the wild G. bankiva; but in the latter, as we have seen, the tarsi vary in length. The tarsi are often feathered. The feet in many breeds are furnished with additional toes. Golden-spangled Polish fowls are said (7/64. Dixon 'Ornamental Poultry' page 325.) to have the skin between their toes much developed: Mr. Tegetmeier observed this in one bird, {{but it was not}} so in one which I examined. Prof. Hoffmann has sent me a sketch of the feet of a fowl of the common breed at Giessen, with a web extending between the three toes, for about a third of their length. In Cochins the <b>middle</b> <b>toe</b> is said (7/65. 'Poultry Chronicle' volume 1 page 485. Tegetmeier 'Poultry Book' 1866 page 41. On Cochins grazing ibid page 46.) to be nearly double the length of the lateral toes, and therefore much longer than in G. bankiva or in other fowls; but {{this was not the case}} in two which I examined.

60|$|I {{know this}} breed only from description. (5/8. Boitard and Corbie 'Les Pigeons' etc. page 177 pl. 6.) It {{approaches}} in general form the Dutch Pouter, but the inflated oesophagus assumes a spherical form, {{as if the}} pigeon had swallowed a large orange, which had stuck close under the beak. This inflated ball is represented as rising to a level with the crown of the head. The <b>middle</b> <b>toe</b> alone is feathered. A variety of this sub-race, called the claquant, is described by MM.

Some of these weigh less than seven ounces, whereas the wild rock-pigeon weighs about fourteen ounces. The feet, too, are very short and small, and the <b>middle</b> <b>toe</b> has twelve or thirteen instead of fourteen or fifteen scutellae.

This is an autosomal dominant condition resulting from a single mutation on chromosome number 7. It is reported that those with the condition are not handicapped and well-integrated into the tribe.

50|$|The long-beaked echidna {{is larger}} than the short-beaked and has fewer, shorter spines {{scattered}} among its coarse hairs. The snout is two-thirds of the head length and curves slightly downward. There are five digits on both hind and forefeet, but on the former, only the three <b>middle</b> <b>toes</b> are equipped with claws. Males have a spur on each of the hind legs. This echidna is primarily a nocturnal animal that forages for its insect food on the forest floor. The animals are not usually foraging in the daylight. The long-beaked echidna lives in dens and they are commonly found to be in underground burrows. The breeding female has a temporary abdominal brood patch, in which her egg is incubated and in which the newborn young remains in safety, feeding and developing. Since they reproduce by laying eggs and are incubated outside of the mother’s body it is accompanied by the prototherian lactation process show that they are early mammals. The long-beaked echidna has a short weaning period. During this time milk is their only source of nutrition and protection for the hatchlings; they are altricial and immunologically naive. Little is known about the life of this rarely seen animal, but it is believed to have habits {{similar to those of the}} short-beaked echidna; unlike them, however, the long-beaked echidnas feed primarily on earthworms rather than ants. The population of echidnas in New Guinea is declining because of forest clearing and overhunting, and the animal is much in need of protection.|$|R
50|$|Nine-banded {{armadillos}} generally weigh from 2.5 - 6.5 kg, {{though the}} largest specimens can scale up to 10 kg. They {{are one of}} the largest species of armadillos. Head and body length is 38 - 58 cm, which combines with the 26 - 53 cm tail, for a total length of 64 - 107 cm. They stand 15 - 25 cm tall {{at the top of the}} shell. The outer shell is composed of ossified dermal scutes covered by nonoverlapping, keratinized epidermal scales, which are connected by flexible bands of skin. This armor covers the back, sides, head, tail, and outside surfaces of the legs. The underside of the body and the inner surfaces of the legs have no armored protection. Instead, they are covered by tough skin and a layer of coarse hair. The vertebrae attach to the carapace.The claws on the <b>middle</b> <b>toes</b> of the forefeet are elongated for digging, though not to the same degree as those of the much larger giant armadillo of South America.Their low metabolic rate and poor thermoregulation make them best suited for semitropical environments.Unlike the South American three-banded armadillos, the nine-banded armadillo cannot roll itself into a ball. It is, however, capable of floating across rivers by inflating its intestines, or by sinking and running across riverbeds. The second is possible due to its ability to hold its breath for up to six minutes, an adaptation originally developed for allowing the animal to keep its snout submerged in soil for extended periods while foraging. Although nine is the typical number of bands on the nine-banded armadillo, the actual number varies by geographic range.Armadillos possess the teeth typical of all sloths and anteaters. The teeth are all small, peg-like molars with open roots and no enamel. Incisors do form in the embryos, but quickly degenerate and are usually absent by birth.|$|R
