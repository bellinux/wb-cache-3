500|$|A {{variety of}} topics in physics such as crystallography, metallurgy, elasticity, magnetism, etc., were treated as {{distinct}} areas until the 1940s, when they were grouped together as solid state physics. Around the 1960s, the study of physical properties of liquids was added to this list, forming {{the basis for the}} new, related specialty of condensed matter physics. According to physicist Philip Warren Anderson, the term was coined by him and Volker Heine, when they changed the name of their group at the Cavendish Laboratories, Cambridge from Solid state theory to Theory of Condensed Matter in 1967, as they felt it did not exclude their interests in the study of liquids, nuclear matter, and so on. Although Anderson and Heine helped popularize the name [...] "condensed matter", it had been present in Europe for some years, most prominently {{in the form of a}} journal published in English, French, and German by Springer-Verlag titled Physics of Condensed Matter, which was launched in 1963. The funding environment and Cold War politics of the 1960s and 1970s were also factors that lead some physicists to prefer the name [...] "condensed matter physics", which emphasized the commonality of scientific problems encountered by physicists working on solids, liquids, plasmas, and other complex matter, over [...] "solid state physics", which was often associated with the industrial applications of <b>metals</b> <b>and</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> The Bell Telephone Laboratories was one of the first institutes to conduct a research program in condensed matter physics.|$|E

Synthesizing <b>metal</b> <b>and</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanoparticles with narrow size distribution, uniform shape, and good crystalline nature represents a significant challenge. Our research group has taken the synthesis procedure a step forward when we discovered that “when a polydispersed colloidal solution upon heating {{at or near the}} boiling point of the solvent in presence of excess surface active ligands, the particles evolve into a thermodynamic equilibrium size regime and this phenomenon was named “Digestive Ripening”. The ability to tune the nanoparticles size with a narrow size distribution after post - preparation in a reproducible fashion is remarkable.

The possibility of superconductivity arising from an interface interaction between the <b>metal</b> <b>and</b> <b>semiconductor</b> has been investigated.

The effect of rapid cooling the alloys from the liquid state on the microstructure and on the superconducting properties has been studied. It was found that {{a decrease in the}} characteristic domain sizes of the <b>metal</b> <b>and</b> <b>semiconductor</b> was accompanied by an increase of the superconducting transition temperature of the alloy. The results suggest that the enhancement of Tc depends on the Fermi energy of the metal. In metal-metal eutectic systems with comparable microstructure, no increase of Tc was observed.

50|$|Unlike {{a regular}} metal, semimetals have charge {{carriers}} of both types (holes and electrons), {{so that one}} could also argue {{that they should be}} called 'double-metals' rather than semimetals.

50|$|At one {{particular}} angle {{for a given}} n1 and n2, the value of Rp goes to zero and a p-polarised incident ray is purely refracted. This angle is known as Brewster's angle, and is around 56° for a glass medium in air or vacuum. Note that this statement is only true when the refractive indices of both materials are real numbers, {{as is the case}} for materials like air and glass.

50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the slowing-down process at high energies, the ion is slowed down mainly by electronic stopping, and it moves almost in a straight path. When the ion has slowed down sufficiently, the collisions with nuclei (the nuclear stopping) become more and more probable, finally dominating the slowing down. When atoms of the solid receive significant recoil energies when struck by the ion, they will be removed from their lattice positions, and produce a cascade of further collisions in the material.
