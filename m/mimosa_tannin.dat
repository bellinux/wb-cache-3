40|$|The {{stabilization}} of alumina suspensions {{is key to}} the development of high-performance materials for the ceramic industry, which has motivated extensive research into synthetic polymers used as stabilizers. In this study, <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin</b> extract and a chitosan derivative, that is, macromolecules obtained from renewable resources, are shown to be promising to replace synthetic polymers, yielding less viscous suspensions with smaller particles and greater fluidity, that is, more homogeneous suspensions that may lead to better-quality products. The functional groups of tannin present in mimosa extract and N,N,N-trimethylchitosan (TMC) are capable of establishing interactions with the alumina surface, thus leading to repulsion between the particles mainly due to steric and electrosteric mechanisms, respectively. The {{stabilization of}} the suspension induced by either TMC or <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin</b> was confirmed by a considerable decrease in viscosity and average particle size, in comparison with alumina suspensions without stabilizing agents. The viscosity/average particle size decreased by 49 / 84 % and 52 / 87 % for suspensions with TMC and <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin,</b> respectively. In addition, the increase in the absolute zeta potential upon addition of either TMC or <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin</b> extract, especially at high pHs, points to an increased stability of the suspension. The feasibility of using derivatives of macromolecules from renewable sources to stabilize aqueous alumina suspensions was therefore demonstrated. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Nevertheless, {{in the field of}} wood protection, borates are only used for indoor non-exposed applications or in association with other biocides, due to their main disadvantage of being readily leachable from treated wood. To overcome this problem, boric acid was fixed into wood with condensed tannins and hexamine through a non-formaldehyde emission polymer network. Treated mixtures were tested with different proportions of <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannins</b> and hexamine, with and without co-added boric acid. The treated beech samples were leached and tested according to European Standard EN 113 against Pycnoporus sanguineus in tropical conditions.

These effluents have various chemical compounds which may cause toxicity and endocrine disruption and are thus known as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Tanning stabilizes the protein structure of the hide and imparts heat stability, enhanced tensile properties, and resistance to microbial degradation. Currently most high quality leather is "chrome-tanned," produced by treatment of the hide with salts of the mineral chromium. In this study, the wastewater characteristics and ecotoxicity before and after tanning and retanning processes using <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin</b> are assessed. Vegetable leather production procedure was followed using one dose <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin.</b> Leather quality was evaluated according to standard methods.

40|$|Vegetable tannins used in tanning of {{hides and skins}} {{are limited}} to surface {{reactions}} by their large molecular weights. The molecular weight reduces penetration into the skin and lowers the thermal stability or tanning effect. Investigation into the utilisation of small phenolic compounds such as catechin to improve penetration with subsequent in situ enzymecatalysed polymerisation may provide a novel and alternative tanning agent. In this research, catechin was oxidised by enzymatic catalysis using laccase, with the polymerisation confirmed by FT-IR and UHPLC. Tanning experiments were undertaken to measure the effect of laccase-catalysed polymerisation of catechin in the thermal stabilisation of collagen, by monitoring the change in shrinkage temperature between the treated and untreated sample of hide powder (ΔTs). This study demonstrates that the stabilisation of collagen (ΔTs) is increased {{with the use of}} in situ enzyme-catalysed polymerisation. Depolymerisation of condensed tannins is presented as an alternative source of low molecular weight phenolics to be applied in the stabilisation of collagen. In this research, <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin</b> from the Black Wattle tree (Acacia mearnsii) was used in the depolymerisation process. Preliminary experiments on depolymerisation were undertaken using the methods laccase-mediator system and L-cysteine in mild acidic medium, both showing unsatisfactory results. Acid-catalysed depolymerisation followed by nucleophile addition is a common analytical method for determining the degree of polymerisation of proanthocyanidins. The acid-catalysed depolymerisation method was scaled-up, with the addition of pyrogallol as a nucleophile trapping agent, and powdered depolymerised mimosa was obtained. Data show an increase in the monomeric content and decrease in percentage of condensed tannins for the acid-catalysed process, indicating the potential of the depolymerisation of <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin</b> in obtaining environmentally friendly sources of low molecular weight phenolic compounds for use in large scale/industrial applications.

The results showed that in most cases tannin addition at 0. 5 mg/ml decreased significantly (P < 0. 05) total and rate of gas production, OMD, total VFA and iso-VFA. Tannin addition also decreased methane production (P < 0. 05). Hydrolysable tannins seemed to have better methane reduction effect than condensed tannins. The best tannin to decrease methane was chestnut tannin, which contained hydrolysable tannins. Present research should be shifted from evaluating only the effect of condensed tannins in reducing methane emission towards some potential hydrolysable tannins since the nature and the toxicity of hydrolysable tannins are quite diverse...|$|E
30|$|We {{examined}} {{the ability of}} chemically modified tannin and tannin-copper complexes to penetrate wood {{and the ability of}} the treated wood to resist termites. Only the tannin-treated wood retained the agents after treatment. Wood with untreated <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin</b> (MT) retained the least amount, followed by wood with resorcinolated tannin (RMT) and that with catecholated tannin (CMT). When RMT or CMT was mixed with ammonia-copper, the wood retained twice as much of these solutions as the MT -ammonia-copper solution. The degree of retention of RMT-NH 3 -Cu and CMT-NH 3 -Cu ranged from 268 to 326 kg/m 3. The solutions penetrated 2 – 13 mm from the tangential sections of the logs. We also measured the termite resistance conferred by these solutions. Most of the tannin-NH 3 -Cu solutions showed contact lethality for termites in the contact toxicity test. However, the termites were fed cellulose treated with those solutions and most survived the oral toxicity test (14 days). Moreover, these solutions reduced the amount of damage to the wood by termites. However, the mortality rate of the termites during the eating-damage test (> 21 days) did not reach 100 % for any of the solutions except for RMT. As a result of the field stake test with the same log's used for the penetrability test, the mass loss of wood treated with RMT or CMT alone or with RMT + NH 3 + CuCl 2, was about one-third to one-half that of the controls. Because these solutions have good wood penetrability and good termite resistance, they have potential use as low-toxicity wood preservatives.|$|E
40|$|Kraft (LN-T-CO 2 - 2) {{and wheat}} straw (CIMV) glyoxalated lignin mixed with <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin</b> and {{hexamine}} as a hardener {{were used as}} wood adhesive resins in particleboard fabrication. The adhesive systems proportion used were 40 / 60 and 50 / 50 w/w for lignin and tannin, respectively. The gel time test was determined by knowing the polymerization time between the different mixes under the controlled conditions. The results showed a slower polymerization with the kraft lignin/mimosa tannin blending than with the wheat straw lignin/mimosa tannin one. Thermomechanical analyses (TMA) tests were carried out {{as an indication of}} the final strength of the adhesive systems revealed by the elasticity modulus (MOE). The MOE results have demonstrated the best mechanical resistance values in 40 / 60 lignin/mimosa tannin proportion with respectively 3. 422 and 3. 347 (MPa), for CIMV and LN-T-CO 2 - 2, and 2. 122 (MPa) for 50 / 50 proportion. Particleboards were prepared and the internal bond (IB) tests were carried out according to the European Standard EN 312. The IB tests confirmed the TMA results. The higher mechanical results of the IB were 0. 43 and 0. 53 (MPa), for CIMV and LN-T-CO 2 - 2 lignin in a 40 / 60 lignin/mimosa tannin proportion. They were classified as interior panel P 2 in according with the standard request EN- 312. Free-formaldehyde was determined through the flask method EN 717 - 3. Particleboards prepared with these natural adhesive resins registered emissions at least 87 and 75 % lower than the commercial UF and MUF adhesive resins. The panels were classified as E 0...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of natural}} fibres (e. g. flax, hemp etc.) instead of {{synthetic}} fibres (carbon and glass etc.) as composite reinforcements not only benefits the environment, but also provides economical lightweight products for transports. Although {{there are a few}} studies reported in literature on use of flax fibres, there is no comprehensive guide on use of flax fibres with bio-resins to re-engineer bio- composite systems {{that can be used in}} vehicle structures. The state-of-art of the current research towards using natural fibre reinforced composites is reviewed by the thesis. The review covers the performances of flax composites, concentrating on the effect of matrix types and existing development methods. The review also identifies the rational of selecting tannin resins and bio-epoxy resins to combine with flax fibre reinforcements. In the experimental work, <b>mimosa</b> <b>tannin</b> resin (natural phenolic resin) and pine- oil derived supersap epoxy resin are selected to manufacture the fully renewable flax composites. By tailoring the fibre configurations and chemical surface treatments, the resultant composites were investigated to provide information for engineers to understand the composite behaviours and properties. Mechanical properties (tension, flexural, shear, impact etc.) and physical properties (moisture, ageing etc.) were assessed through adequate tests and analysing methods. In addition, bio-sandwich structures based on the novel studied composites and commercial bio-foams were evaluated to study the energy absorption which could be very important in vehicle design. Based on the results, flax/supersap epoxy and flax/tannin composites are suitable for possible exterior structural and interior non-structural applications, respectively. The developed flax fibre composites with innovative bio-matrices have a potential to prevail in modern vehicle applications, due to the competitive performances, economic viability and environmental acceptability...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of tannins on in sacco disappearance in the rumen and post-ruminal digestion using the mobile bag and pepsin-pancreatin (in vitro) methods, and the tube-feeding technique in poultry.   The treatment of Lotus pedunculatus with PEG increased in sacco disappearance compared with untreated lotus.   Quebracho tannin (QT) reduced the disappearance of lupin seeds and soyabean meal.    No effect of QT {{was found on the}} disappearance of chickpea, and an increase was observed for the disappearance of pea. Tannins increased the excretion of nitrogenous compounds and sialic acid, and reduced nutrient digestibility of most feeds tested, as measured by the 4 poultry model.   Tannins reduced the proportion of uric acid nitrogen in the excreta.   Tannins in lotus reduced intestinal digestion of N as measured by mobile bag and in vitro methods.   Nitrogen digestibility of soyabean meal and chickpea as measured by the mobile bag and in vitro methods was not affected by QT. <b>Mimosa</b> <b>tannin</b> (MT) inhibited the attachment of microbes to cellulose and decreased gas production.   Polyethylene glycol completely restored the gas production from cellulose treated with MT.    Pectin improved microbial attachment in the presence of MT, and the inhibition of the gas production from cellulose was partially restored.   The gas production from maize shoots decreased with MT, and it was restored with the addition of PEG.   Pectin did not improve the gas production from MT-treated maize shoots.   The presence of both MT and pectin improved EMPS, but reduced the incorporation of 15 N into microbial protein.
