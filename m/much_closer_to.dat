5|$|Once {{considered}} {{as having the}} largest angular diameter of any star in the sky after the Sun, Betelgeuse lost that distinction in 1997 {{when a group of}} astronomers measured R Doradus with a diameter of 57.0 ± 0.5mas, although R Doradus, being <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Earth at about 200ly, has a linear diameter roughly one-third that of Betelgeuse.|$|E
5|$|Early genetic {{studies were}} focused on lions from eastern and {{southern}} parts of Africa, and already showed that lions can possibly be divided in two main clades: one {{to the west of}} the Great Rift Valley and the other to the east. Lions in eastern Kenya are genetically <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> lions in South Africa than to lions in the Aberdare Range in western Kenya or in Uganda.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, former Chicago White Sox {{teammate}} Ted Lyons was the {{new manager}} of the White Sox, and offered Berg a coaching position. Berg declined. Boston Red Sox owner Thomas Yawkey, who was <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Berg when he played for the Red Sox, matched Lyons' offer, but Berg still turned them down. Berg did not apply for a teaching position, or join a law firm.|$|E

5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> pn, {{than it is to}} 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, and there are no infinitesimals.|$|E
5|$|The planets were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} formed in or near their current orbits. However, this view underwent radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Currently, {{it is thought that}} the Solar System looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt was <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the Sun.|$|E
5|$|A 1994 {{analysis}} of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by Dr. D. A. B. Young concluded that his medical symptomsmdash&including his past relapses, fevers and hepatic conditionsmdash&were <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> those resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, rather than tuberculosis. He had two episodes of dysentery {{before he left}} India. When not properly treated, dysentery can lie dormant for years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. Amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease at the time.|$|E
30|$|From Table  3, we can {{see that}} PSNR and UIQI are {{improved}} compared with the other algorithms. SSIM of the proposed algorithm is <b>much</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 1. That means the method proposed can get an image that is highly similar to the ideal phantom image.|$|R
30|$|It {{could be}} seen that the {{calculated}} (65.9  mg/g) and experimental values (62.3  mg/g) showed nice agreement in pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Figure  6 b shows the correlation coefficient is very <b>much</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> unity. These results concluded that the pseudo-second order kinetic model best describes the adsorption kinetics of the present study.|$|R
5000|$|Dorian Hawkmoon {{is one of}} {{the less}} [...] "problematic" [...] {{characters}} Moorcock ever created a series around. Unlike the anti-hero Elric of Melniboné, or the alienated and tragic Corum, or the sometimes savage Erekosë, Hawkmoon is described as being very <b>much</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> an all-around [...] "good guy", despite lacking some subtlety (or perhaps, for this very reason).|$|R
5|$|Assuming this {{warning shot}} {{had been fired}} {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign and the pennant of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly {{identified}} as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers to drift closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour flags and red pennants, a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> two batteries Childers suddenly came under heavy fire, the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work has {{suggested}} that the regular army of the 2nd century was considerably larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. This is because the 2nd-century auxilia were not just equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st century, but some 50% larger. The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd century. Furthermore, the evidence is that the actual strength of 2nd-century units was typically <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> official (c. 85%) than 4th century units.|$|E
5|$|Bureaucratic affairs were {{completed}} during Diocletian's stay: a census took place, and Alexandria, in punishment for its rebellion, {{lost the ability}} to mint independently. Diocletian's reforms in the region, combined with those of Septimius Severus, brought Egyptian administrative practices <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Roman standards. Diocletian travelled south along the Nile the following summer, where he visited Oxyrhynchus and Elephantine. In Nubia, he made peace with the Nobatae and Blemmyes tribes. Under the terms of the peace treaty Rome's borders moved north to Philae and the two tribes received an annual gold stipend. Diocletian left Africa quickly after the treaty, moving from Upper Egypt in September 298 to Syria in February 299. He met with Galerius in Mesopotamia.|$|E

30|$|The partial {{elongation}} in {{the middle}} of the SLT 3 specimen was obtained using the difference between the displacements of LVDT 05 and LVDT 06. The measured portion was <b>much</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the fixed end location. The partial elongation {{in the middle}} was very small because the measured original length was only a portion (26 %) of the total free length.|$|R

5|$|Near its {{junction}} {{with the}} River Arun, the river loops {{to the south}} in a large meander. A cut ran {{from the start of}} the meander to join the Arun above the original junction, with a lock towards the downstream end. The meander fed Hardham Corn Mill. A lock bypassed the mill and the millstream, to enable boats to reach the Hardham Tunnel cut, which headed south from a junction above the mill. The Tunnel Branch was destroyed by the construction of a water treatment works, and the modern weir near the mouth is <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the junction than the lock was.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human occupation. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans {{returned}} as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000–5,000BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{generally}} saw the Knights as heroic {{and noble}} men who brought Christianity and civilization to the east. In August 1914, during World War I, Germany won a battle against Russia near the site. When the Germans realized its propaganda potential, they named the battle the Battle of Tannenberg, despite it having actually taken place <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Allenstein (Olsztyn), and framed it as revenge for the Polish–Lithuanian victory 504 years earlier. Nazi Germany later exploited the sentiment by portraying their Lebensraum policies as {{a continuation of}} the Knights' historical mission.|$|E

5|$|The Mangalorean Catholic dialect {{is largely}} {{derived from the}} Bardeskaar (North Goan) dialect and bears a good degree of {{intelligibility}} with the modern Bardeskaar dialect (spoken by North Goan Christians, North Goan Hindus, and South Goan Hindus) and to a slightly lesser extent with the standard Konkani dialect. It consequently differs from the dialect spoken by the Goud Saraswat Brahmins in South Canara, which is copiously derived and bears a good degree of intelligibility with the modern Sashtikaar (South Goan) dialect spoken by South Goan Christians and North Canara Konkani Hindus. It is <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the dialects of the Goan Hindus than {{to that of the}} Goan Catholics.|$|E
5|$|The nearest star to the Earth, {{apart from}} the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, which is 39.9 {{trillion}} kilometres, or 4.2 light-years. Travelling at the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle (8 kilometres per second—almost 30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to arrive. km / (3 × 104 km/h × 24 × 365.25) = 1.5 × 105 years. This is typical of stellar separations in galactic discs. Stars can be <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> {{each other in the}} centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or much farther apart in galactic halos.|$|E
5|$|The {{officer corps}} formed {{part of the}} social elite in Canada, and {{considered}} themselves to be <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the prestigious, regular military than to their equivalents in the local police forces. Commissioned officers were expected to join and participate in an officers' mess, which the police based on the corresponding military tradition. Many were members of the Freemasons, a popular movement among Protestant Canadians. The officers were made Justices of Peace, giving them powers to try civilian cases, and they also had authority to summarily try members of the force itself, potentially imprisoning constables for up a year for even minor offences.|$|E

This score for the ordered probit model as {{obtained}} using Table  6 {{was found to be}} 0.45, which is very <b>much</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> zero. Thus, it is concluded from all these investigations and observations that, the proposed model is well validated with traveler intercept data sets, and could be well applied for service quality assessments in mid-sized cities.|$|R
5|$|The {{reductions}} were self-sufficient {{indigenous communities}} of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions {{and played the}} role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, {{the degree to which the}} Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the degree to which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the mark.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{boats were}} filled <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> capacity {{and in an}} increasing rush. No.11 was filled with five people more than its rated capacity. As it was lowered, it was nearly flooded by water being pumped out of the ship. No.13 narrowly avoided the same problem but those aboard were unable to release the ropes from which the boat had been lowered. It drifted astern, directly under No.15 as it was being lowered. The ropes were cut in time and both boats made it away safely.|$|E
5|$|After {{the mixed}} {{reception}} to the 2003 film Hulk, Marvel Studios reacquired {{the rights to}} the character. Leterrier, who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man, was brought onboard and Penn began work on a loose sequel that would be <b>much</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the comics and the 1978 television series of the same name. In April 2007, Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn's screenplay in order to distance itself from the 2003 film and establish its own identity, although he would go uncredited for his writing. Filming mostly took place in Toronto, Ontario, from July to November 2007. Over 700 visual effects shots were created in post-production using a combination of motion capture and computer-generated imagery to complete the film.|$|E
