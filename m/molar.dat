5|$|On {{the first}} lower <b>molar,</b> the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are {{separated}} by an anteromedian fossette. The second lower <b>molar</b> bears a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps, the protoconid and metaconid, that form {{the front edge of}} the <b>molar</b> in some other oryzomyines. There is a distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the <b>molar,</b> before the protoconid. The third lower <b>molar</b> also bears an anterolophid and an anterolabial cingulum. The first lower <b>molar</b> has large roots at the front and back of the tooth and two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have two large roots, one at the front and one at the back.|$|E
5|$|Salanoia durrelli has a {{more robust}} {{dentition}} than the brown-tailed mongoose; the teeth have larger surface areas. The first and second upper incisors are smaller than the third, which is separated by a pronounced diastema (gap) from the canine tooth. The canine is more robust than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The first upper premolar is small, but {{the second and third}} are larger; these two teeth are shorter and broader than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The fourth premolar is large, as is the first <b>molar.</b> The second upper <b>molar</b> is less than one-third the size of the first, and is more highly reduced than that of the brown-tailed mongoose, which is about two-thirds the size of the first <b>molar.</b> The first lower incisor is smaller than the other two. The lower canine, premolars, and first <b>molar</b> are well-developed. The second <b>molar</b> is broad, but smaller than in the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
5|$|The first lower <b>molar</b> is rounded at {{the front}} end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower <b>molar</b> is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form {{the front edge of}} the <b>molar</b> in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) is at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the <b>molar,</b> before the protoconid. The lower third <b>molar</b> is about as long as the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower <b>molar</b> has large roots {{at the front}} and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.|$|E

5|$|The mandible, {{which is}} {{severely}} damaged and lacks the condyloid, coronoid, and angular processes {{at the back}} of the bone, contains the second and third <b>molar</b> and part of the lower incisor, but the first <b>molar</b> is missing. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is small. The preserved alveoli, the impressions left by the roots, show that the first <b>molar</b> was supported by large roots at the front and back and a smaller root in between these. The second <b>molar</b> is about square and shows the four main cusps commonly present in rodents: the protoconid, metaconid, hypoconid, and entoconid. A strongly developed mesolophid (a crest) is also present, as in most oryzomyines. The main valley between the cusps, the hypoflexid, is broad and V-shaped. The third <b>molar</b> is as long as the second, but it is narrower and the entoconid is poorly developed. Again, the hypoflexid is broad and V-shaped. The length of the toothrow at the alveoli is 8.7mm. The length of the second <b>molar</b> is 2.5mm and the width is 2.2mm. The third <b>molar</b> has a length of 2.5mm and width of 1.8mm.|$|E
5|$|The molars are high-crowned (hypsodont) and planar, {{with the}} main cusps {{as high as the}} crests {{connecting}} them, a configuration shared only with Holochilus and Carletonomys among oryzomyines. The first molars are the longest and the third molars are longer but narrower than the second molars. The molars lack many accessory ridges, including the anteroloph on the first upper <b>molar,</b> the posteroloph on the first and second upper <b>molar,</b> and the anterolophid and mesolophid on all lower molars. The first and second upper <b>molar</b> have a short mesoloph and the front cusp of the first lower <b>molar,</b> the anteroconid, encloses a large internal pit. Most of the folds between the cusps and crests are open at the margins of the molars, but two—the posteroflexid on the lower second <b>molar</b> and the entoflexid on the lower third molar—are closed by a wall, or cingulum, at the inner margin of the tooth. As in most oryzomyines, the upper molars all have one root on the inner (lingual) side and two on the outer (labial) side and the lower molars have a single root at the front and back of each molar; in addition, the first upper <b>molar</b> has another labial root and the first lower <b>molar</b> has a small labial and usually also a small lingual root located between the main roots.|$|E

5|$|Afrasia {{is known}} from four {{isolated}} teeth: a first upper <b>molar</b> (M1), with {{a length of}} 2.13mm and width of 3.06mm; a second upper <b>molar</b> (M2), the holotype, of 2.27mm by 3.35mm; a second lower <b>molar</b> (m2) of 2.09mm by 1.41mm; and a third lower <b>molar</b> (m3) of 2.05mm by 1.27mm. Like other eosimiiforms, {{it was a small}} primate that weighed around , which is estimated based on the measurements of its m2 and M1, respectively. It is generally similar to other eosimiiforms in general and Afrotarsius in particular; some distinguishing features are the well-developed small cusps (conules) on the upper molars, the variable development of the lingual cingulum (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) of the upper molars, and the unreduced talonid (posterior portion) on the m3. Its teeth are smaller than those of the eosimiids Phenacopithecus, Bahinia, and Phileosimias.|$|E
5|$|As in all oryzomyines except Holochilus and {{its close}} relatives, the molars are brachyodont, low-crowned, and bunodont, with the cusps {{extending}} {{higher than the}} central parts of the molars. They are characterized by strong cusps and absence or reduction of accessory crests. The cusps of the upper molars are opposite, but in the lower molars the labial (outer) cusps are slightly further to the front than the lingual (inner) ones. On the upper first <b>molar,</b> one accessory ridge, the anteroloph, is lacking, but another, the mesoloph, is present. Unlike in most other oryzomyines, however, which have mesolophs reaching the labial margin of the <b>molar,</b> the mesolophs of Pseudoryzomys are short and protrude only slightly {{from the middle of}} the <b>molar.</b> The corresponding structure in the lower molars, the mesolophid, is completely absent. The hindmost valley between cusps on the lower first <b>molar,</b> the posteroflexid, is severely reduced, foreshadowing its loss in Lundomys and Holochilus. A number of <b>molar</b> traits support Pseudoryzomyss relationship with Holochilus and Lundomys, forming steps in the transition from the complex, low-crowned generalized oryzomyine <b>molar</b> pattern to the simpler, high-crowned pattern of Holochilus.|$|E

40|$|Objectives We {{report the}} mineral (hydroxyapatite) density {{of sound and}} opaque areas in DMH <b>molars</b> with sound parts of (carious) {{deciduous}} teeth serving as controls. Methods Twenty-nine extracted second primary <b>molars</b> obtained from 15 children were studied. Thirteen of these <b>molars</b> were DMH <b>molars</b> with yellow opacities, seven were DMH <b>molars</b> with white opacities, three DMH <b>molars</b> with brown opacities and eleven were <b>molars</b> without DMH. Prior to microCT scanning, the teeth were mounted in impression material (Impregum®) and stored in water with a thymol crystal. Spot analysis and line scans were performed in areas with opacities and in sound areas. An ANOVA test and t-tests were used to test if {{there were significant differences}} between the groups. Results The average densities of the hydroxyapatite in yellow and brown opacities (1368 mg HA/cm 2 and 1407 mg HA/cm 2, respectively) were significantly lower than in clinically unaffected enamel (1747 mg HA/cm 2) of DMH <b>molars</b> or of sound <b>molars</b> (1758 mg HA/cm 2). The mineral density in white opacities (1737 mg HA/cm 2) was not different from that in the enamel of sound <b>molars.</b> The mineral density values in yellow and brown enamel opacities were in between those of dentine (1018 mg HA/cm 2) and enamel. Conclusions DMH <b>molars</b> with yellow or brown opacities had a 20 - 22 % lower mineral density in the hypomineralised enamel compared with sound <b>molars.</b> White opacities do not show a lower mineral content. The reduction in enamel mineral content in DMH <b>molars</b> stressed the need for a preventive approach in DMH...|$|R
