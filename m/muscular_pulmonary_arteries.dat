50|$|Finally, the {{pulmonary}} pathology of PPH is {{very similar}} to that of primary pulmonary hypertension. The <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> become fibrotic and hypertrophy while the smaller arteries lose smooth muscle cells and their elastic intima. One study found at autopsy significant thickening of pulmonary arteries in cirrhotic patients. This thickening and remodeling forms a positive feedback loop that serves to increase PAP and induce right heart hypertrophy and dysfunction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{peripheral}} airways and {{the adjacent}} <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> were studied by morphometric methods in the autopsy lungs of six asthmatic subjects who died suddenly during an asthma attack, {{and they were}} {{compared with those of}} six control subjects who died of other causes and had no history of respiratory diseases. Bronchioles of asthmatic subjects had an increased amount of lumen occlusion (p less than 0. 01), smooth muscle thickness (p less than 0. 001), and inflammatory infiltrate (p less than 0. 001), and both mononuclear cells and eosinophils contributed to this increased inflammation. The <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> adjacent to occluded and inflamed bronchioles did not have the morphologic features of chronic hypoxia, as shown by the normal medial and intimal thickness, but they had an important inflammatory process in their walls that was particularly marked at sites adjacent to airways. Although the functional significance of these findings is unknown, they may be responsible in part for the gas exchange abnormalities observed in acute severe asthma...|$|E

Aim:To investigate bronchial and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>arteries</b> morphology and the expression of elastic fibers (EF) and collagen I in the lungs of mild/moderate COPD patients. Methods:Lung tissue of 18 COPD subject (FEV 1 : 67 ± 15 %pred), 14 non-obstructed smokers(NOS) (FEV 1 : 95 ± 10 %pred) and 11 never-smoking controls(CTRL) (FEV 1 : 108 ± 15 %pred) was used to analyze the morphology of bronchial and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>arteries</b> and the expression of EF and collagen I in the tunica intima, media and adventitia, using immune- and histochemistry and image analysis. Values (mean±SD) were expressed as (stained) area⁄vessel outer perimeter (μm 2 ⁄μm) and as staining density (collagen I). Results:The intimal areas of pulmonary (CTRL= 8. 87 ± 4. 3, COPD= 14. 7 ± 5, p= 0. 04) and the adventitia of bronchial arteries (CTRL= 27. 7 ± 11. 4, COPD= 50. 6 ± 23. 7, p= 0. 007) were larger in COPD patients than in CTRL. Higher EF expression was observed in adventitia of bronchial arteries of NOS group (8. 8 ± 13. 2) than CTRL (3. 1 ± 1. 3, p= 0. 04). The CTRL group had higher collagen I staining density in the adventitia of bronchial (CTRL= 81. 6 ± 35. 8; NOS= 32. 8 ± 15; COPD= 40. 9 ± 25. 4, p= 0. 002) and pulmonary (CTRL= 96. 5 ± 23. 2; NOS= 54. 8 ± 24; COPD= 69. 6 ± 19. 1, p= 0. 0005) arteries than NOS and COPD. Within COPD group, negative correlations were observed between the intimal area of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> and FEV 1 (R=- 0. 57, p= 0. 04) and FEV 1 ⁄FVC (R=- 0. 56, p= 0. 04). Conclusions:Remodeling of bronchial and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>arteries</b> occurs in mild⁄moderate COPD, is associated with impaired lung function and it might {{contribute to the development of}} pulmonary hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Chronic thromboembolic {{pulmonary}} hypertension (CTEPH) is generally recognized {{to be caused}} by persistent organized thrombi that occlude the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the characteristics of small vessel remodeling and its impact on the hemodynamics in CTEPH patients. Hemodynamic data were obtained from right heart catheterization in 17 CTEPH patients before pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). Lung tissue specimens were obtained at the time of PEA. Pathological observations and evaluation of quantitative changes in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins were performed using light microscopy on 423 slides in 17 patients. The relationship between the results and the hemodynamics of CTEPH was investigated. Pulmonary arteriopathy and venopathy were recognized in most cases, although no plexiform lesions and no capillary-hemangiomatosis-like lesions were detected in any of the specimens. The severity of pulmonary arteriopathy was correlated with pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in the postoperative and follow-up periods. The PVR and mean pulmonary arterial pressure were significantly higher in the high-obstruction group than in the low-obstruction group. The findings in pulmonary venopathy were similar to the findings seen in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease in some cases, although severe venopathy was only observed in a portion of the pulmonary veins. There was a significant correlation between the extent of pulmonary arteriopathy and venopathy, although an effect of pulmonary venopathy to hemodynamics, including pulmonary arterial wedged pressure (PAWP), could not be identified. The vascular remodeling of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>arteries</b> was closely associated with the hemodynamics of CTEPH. Severe pulmonary arteriopathy might be related to residual {{pulmonary hypertension}} after PEA. Those altered <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> might be a new target for the persistent PH after the operation...|$|R
40|$|The role of Pulmonary and Activation-Regulated Chemokine (PARC) in the {{physiopathology}} of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is {{not fully}} understood. The aim {{of the present study}} is to analyze the expression of PARC in lung tissue and its relationship with the vascular remodeling of the systemic and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> of COPD subjects. To achieve this objective, protein and gene expression experiments, together with ELISA assays, were performed on the lung tissue, intercostal arteries and serum samples from COPD patients, non-obstructed smokers (NOS) and never-smokers (NS). A total of 57 subjects were included in the analysis (23 COPD, 18 NOS and 16 NS). In the comparisons between groups, a significantly increased lung protein expression of PARC was observed in the COPD group compared to the NOS group (1. 96 ± 0. 22 vs. 1. 29 ± 0. 27, P-adjusted = 0. 038). PARC was located predominantly in the smooth muscle cells of the remodeled <b>pulmonary</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>arteries</b> and the macrophage-rich area of the alveolar parenchyma. No differences were detected in PARC gene expression analyses. The protein content of PARC in the intercostal arteries were similar between groups, though little remodeling was observed in these arteries. Circulating levels of PARC were numerically higher in patients with COPD compared to NOS and NS. The {{results of the present study}} suggest an increased lung protein expression of PARC in COPD subjects. This protein was mainly localized in the smooth muscle cells of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>arteries</b> and was associated with the severity of intimal thickening, indicating its possible role in this remodeling process...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the {{structure}} and function of <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> are crucial for normal adaptation to extrauterine life and rapid changes in matrix protein gene expression are likely necessary for this adaptation. We hypothesized that pathological stimuli imposed {{at the time of}} birth would alter developmental changes in matrix protein gene expression thereby affecting the normal post-uterine changes in pulmonary hemodynamics. We used in situ hybridization to examine the normal developmental expression of three extracellular matrix protein mRNAs, fibronectin, tropoelastin, and alpha 1 (I) procollagen, in <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> of both fetal and neonatal calves and assessed the impact of severe hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension on their expression. Morphometric techniques were used to assess whether changes in matrix protein mRNA levels were related to changes in matrix fiber accumulation. Exposure to chronic hypoxia postnatally resulted in the persistence, reexpression, and induction of fibronectin, tropoelastin, and alpha 1 (I) procollagen mRNAs, respectively, in <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> In each case the hybridization signal was localized primarily to the adventitial layer of the vessel. Morphometric analysis showed that the increased hybridization signals seen correlated with an increase in both vascular elastin and collagen fiber volumes in the adventitial layer. We conclude that the change in expression of matrix genes in the pulmonary artery wall during exposure to chronic hypoxia is an important adaptive response to changes in hemodynamic factors and/or oxygen tension. The unchecked increase in matrix protein expression seen likely contributes to the pathological pulmonary arterial structural remodeling and loss of vasoreactivity that occurs during the development of severe neonatal pulmonary hypertension...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study, the {{hypothesis}} that dendritic cells (DCs), key players in immunity and tolerance, might {{be involved in the}} immunopathology of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) was tested. The phenotype and localisation of DCs were characterised by immunohistochemistry and double-labelling immunofluorescence in lung samples from controls, human IPAH patients and an experimental pulmonary hypertension model (monocrotaline-exposed rats). As compared with controls, morphometric analysis demonstrated increased numbers of dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) -positive cells in <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> in IPAH and OX- 62 -positive DCs in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. In human samples, the mean¡SEM number of DC-SIGN-positive cells?artery- 1 of 100 – 300 mm diameter was 1. 4 ¡ 0. 4 in controls versus 26. 4 ¡ 2. 7 in IPAH. In rats, the number of OX- 62 -positive cells?artery- 1 of 50 – 150 mm diameter was 0. 5 ¡ 0. 2 in controls, and 0. 7 ¡ 0. 5, 3. 1 ¡ 0. 5 and 8. 4 ¡ 0. 6 at day 7, 14 and 28 after monocrotaline exposure, respectively. Human complex lesions of <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> showed transmural DC infiltration. Phenotyping revealed an immature DC profile in human and experimental pulmonary hyperten-sion. The results support the concept that immature dendritic cells accumulate in remodelled pulmonary vessels and hence could be involved in the immunopathology of pulmonary hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Distribution and {{severity}} of active vasoconstriction of <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> were morphometrically assessed in anaesthetized, paralysed and mechanically ventilated pigs with respiratory distress, induced by oleic acid. Vasoconstriction was deduced from the medial thickness which was measured and expressed {{as a percentage of}} external diameter. Six pigs received oleic acid (0. 12 +/- 0. 07 ml/kg), dissolved 1 : 1 in 96 % alcohol, in multiple injections of 0. 1 ml. Six pigs were used as controls. After the oleic acid injections a stable hypoxaemia (PaO 2 = 57 +/- 8 mmHg, at an inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0. 6) and pulmonary hypertension (mean Ppa = 36 +/- 2 mmHg) were obtained for several hours. Electron microscopy revealed swelling of endothelial cells with signs of degeneration. Medial thickness was far greater in the oleic acid group than in the control group; overall mean values were 8. 1 +/- 3. 2 and 3. 8 +/- 1. 7 % respectively (P < 0. 001). Arteries with prominent vasoconstriction were lying in clusters. This pattern was the same in dependent and non-dependent regions. We concluded that in oleic acid induced respiratory distress active vasoconstriction of <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> {{is an important factor in}} the development of pulmonary hypertension. Besides vasoconstriction, endothelial swelling and intravascular clotting may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{hypobaric}} hypoxia induces structural features {{characteristic of}} pulmonary hypertension, but {{little is known}} of their reversal. In the present study, rats {{have been exposed to}} hypobaric hypoxia for 10 days and subsequently allowed to recover in room air for 3, 14, 28, or 70 days. With the use of 1 -mu sections and electron-microscopic and point-counting techniques, the regression of the medial and adventitial changes in the rat hilar intrapulmonary artery has been followed. In the media, 10 -day hypoxia causes more than a doubling in thickness due to 1) hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells, particularly of rough sarcoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus; 2) an increase in extracellular connective tissue, microfibrils, collagen fibers, and elastin, and 3) edemalike fluid. In addition, the elestic laminas are doubled in thickness, and myofilamentous processes of the hypertrophied smooth muscle cells contact them. After just 3 days' recovery, some cells have already returned to normal diameter, although medial thickening is unchanged. By Day 14 and at Days 28 and 70 of recovery, medial thickness and cell diameter are within the normal range, and by recovery Day 70, there is {{a significant increase in the}} relative areal proportion of extracellular collagen fibers and a decrease in elastin (P less than 0. 001). Hypoxia also produces a more than twofold increase in adventitial thickness. Hypertrophy of fibroblasts and an increase in their number contribute to the thickening, as does as increase in collagen fibers. During 3 - 70 days of recovery, thickness is gradually reduced to normal levels, although it is still significantly above normal at Days 3, 14, and 28. The increases in thickness at these times are due mainly to the accumulation of collagen fibers, which are still apparent after 70 days of recovery. Thus, hypoxia causes a doubling in thickness of the medial and adventitial coats of the hilar <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery,</b> which with recovery regain near normal thickness but whose structure is altered. The increase in collagen fibers contributes to contracture and reduced distensibility in these vessels, which is apparent in arteriograms as narrowed lumen diameter...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Intimal {{enlargement}} of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> {{is an early}} change in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The cellular and extracellular components that are involved in this enlargement are unknown. The present study was designed to characterize the structural changes occurring in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>muscular</b> <b>arteries</b> in the initial disease stages. Lung specimens from patients with moderate COPD (n= 8; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), 66 ¡ 10 % predicted) and smokers without airflow obstruction (n= 7; FEV 1, 86 ¡ 6 % pred), were investigated by histochemistry to characterize extracellular matrix proteins and by immunohistochemistry to identify intrinsic cells of the vascular wall. In both COPD patients and smokers, the majority of cells present in the enlarged intimas were stained by specific smooth muscle cell (SMC) markers. No staining with endothelial or fibroblast markers was shown. A proportion of SMCs did not stain with desmin, suggesting cellular heterogeneity in this population. Elastin was the most abundant extracellular matrix protein and collagen was seen in a lower proportion. The amount of collagen was related to the intimal thickness (pv 0. 001). The findings demonstrated smooth muscle cell proliferation, as well as elastin and collagen deposition, in the thickened intimas of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> in moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and smokers, suggesting that these abnormalities may originate at an early stage in cigarette smoke-induced respiratory disease...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) {{in the development of}} pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary vascular disease in rats given a single subcutaneous injection of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid monocrotaline. Thirty-six young female Wistar rats were divided into a test group of 27 animals and a control group of nine animals. Each test rat was given a single subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline (60 mg/kg body weight). On the first, third, fifth, seventh, tenth, twelfth, fourteenth, seventeenth, and twenty-second days after the injection of monocrotaline the mean right ventricular systolic blood pressure was measured in one control and three test rats. The animals were then killed and we measured the specific activity of ACE in serum and lung homogenate. We also evaluated muscularisation of pulmonary arterioles, medial hypertrophy of <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> and right ventricular hypertrophy. The sequence of changes was as follows: muscularisation of pulmonary arterioles and medial hypertrophy of <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> were apparent seven days after administration of monocrotaline; pulmonary hypertension and reduced lung ACE activity occurred after 10 days; right ventricular hypertrophy was detected after 12 days. Serum ACE activity was unchanged. It is concluded that the reduction in lung ACE activity is a result rather than a cause of the pulmonary hypertension. This reduction in lung ACE activity may be a protective mechanism designed to limit the elevation of the pulmonary arterial pressure...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesPulmonary artery {{stenosis}} is {{a potential}} complication after Norwood palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. It is unclear whether the shunt type or position in the Norwood procedure {{is associated with the}} risk of the development of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis. We examined the risk of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis and the need for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> intervention in children undergoing the Norwood procedure with either the right ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit or modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. MethodsA retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent the Norwood procedure from January 1, 2003, to September 1, 2011. The data from 100 patients were reviewed, including catheterization and echocardiographic data, right ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit (n =  67, right shunt position in 17 and left in 50), and right ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> (n =  33). The primary outcome measure was the need for operative or catheter-based <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> intervention. ResultsNo patients in the right ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> group required catheterization-based <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> interventions. Surgical <b>pulmonary</b> arterioplasty was performed frequently and equally in both the right ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and right ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> groups at the bidirectional Glenn procedure. Catheter-based pulmonary arterioplasty was performed more frequently in the right ventricle to <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> conduit group, especially when the conduit was positioned to {{the right side of the}} neoaorta.

40|$|Using a {{digitiser}} {{for assessing}} the media and intima of <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> we have previously shown that the most sensible measurements are those of medial and intimal area and that artery size should be {{defined in terms of}} the total length of internal elastic lamina. These measurements do not vary with the collapse or constriction of the artery. A cross sectional cut and a well defined internal elastic lamina are essential for measurement using our technique. This study explores methods for obtaining the above three measurements for cross sectionally cut arteries with an ill defined internal elastic lamina, with a view to increasing the number of arteries measured. The methods were tested on three subjects, using arteries for which the true values of the three variables were known. Acceptable estimates of medial and intimal area could be obtained by simply delineating the boundaries of the intima and media and ignoring the crinkles in the elastic laminae. It was also found that <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> may not be uniformly collapsed or constricted round the circumference of their walls and that the overall degree of collapse or constriction seemed to be affected {{by the size of the}} artery.

Lung biopsy of two showed medial hypertrophy of the pulmonary arteries with evidence of fresh and organised thrombi. In one there was also interstitial fibrosis.

The lungs were examined postmortem, and the medial thickness of the <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> was expressed as a percentage of their external diameters. In randomly encountered (large and small) pulmonary arteries the mean percentage medial thickness (MT%) was 11 · 99 ± 0 · 41 % (SEM) in controls and 25 · 28 ± 0 · 94 % in test rats (p< 0 · 001).

The agonists 5 -HT, 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT, unselective for 5 -HT 1 receptors) and sumatriptan (selective for 5 -HT 1 B/D receptors) all caused contraction and were equipotent (pEC 50 s: 7. 0 ± 0. 2, 7. 1 ± 0. 3 and 6. 7 ± 0. 1, respectively) suggesting {{the presence of}} a 5 -HT 1 receptor. Ketanserin (5 -HT 2 A-selective antagonist, 0. 1 [*]μM) inhibited 5 -HT-induced contractions only at non-physiological/pathological concentrations of 5 -HT (> 0. 1 [*]μM) whilst GR 55562 (5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D-selective antagonist, 1 [*]μM) inhibited 5 -HT-induced contractions at all concentrations of 5 -HT (estimated pKB= 7. 7 ± 0. 2). SB- 224289 (5 -HT 1 B-selective antagonist, 0. 2 [*]μM) inhibited sumatriptan-induced contractions (estimated pKB= 8. 4 ± 0. 1) whilst these were unaffected by the 5 -HT 1 D-selective antagonist BRL 15572 (0. 5 [*]μM) suggesting that the 5 -HT 1 B receptor mediates vasoconstriction in this vessel. RT–PCR confirmed the presence of substantial amounts of mRNA for the 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptor subtypes in these arteries whilst only trace amounts of 5 -HT 1 D receptor message were evident. These findings suggest that a heterogeneous population of 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors co-exist in human small <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> but that the 5 -HT 1 B receptor mediates 5 -HT-induced vasoconstriction at physiological and pathophysiological concentrations of 5 -HT. These results have important implications for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in which the 5 -HT 1 B receptor may provide a novel and potentially important therapeutic target...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesOur {{model of}} a systemic–pulmonary shunt {{exhibits}} enhanced reactivity of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> contralateral to a localized shunt between the left lower lobe <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and aorta relative to those of ipsilateral or control <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> 48 hours after anastomosis. We examined the contribution of nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, or cytochrome P 450 production to mediating this enhanced reactivity. MethodsWe created a surgical end-to-side anastomosis of the left lower lobe <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> to the aorta. Forty-eight hours later, we tested tension of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> rings from {{the right and left}} lower lobes for contraction to the thromboxane mimetic U 46619 in the presence of vehicle or inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, cytochrome P 450, or lipoxygenase. Western blots of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> homogenates were probed for endothelial nitric oxide synthase or isoforms metabolizing arachidonic acid. Eicosanoid products from intact <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> rings were detected using labeled arachidonic acid and high-performance liquid chromatography separation. ResultsEnhanced reactivity of unshunted right <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> over that of left <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> from high-flow hosts was not eliminated by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase, cytochrome P 450. Treatment with 2 different lipoxygenase inhibitors, nordihydroguaiaretic acid and cinnamyl- 3, 4 -dihydroxy-α-cyanocinnamate, closed the difference in contractility of shunted and unshunted <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> contralateral to shunts metabolized arachidonic acid to 12 -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in greater quantities than analogous <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> from the experimental left or control <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries.</b> ConclusionsForty-eight hours after anastomosis, enhanced reactivity of contralateral <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> is attributable in part to increased lipoxygenase products as opposed to nitric oxide or other eicosanoid products...|$|R
40|$|In <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> atresia, major aortopulmonary {{collateral}} arteries {{are characteristic}} of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and are rarely seen in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. Two unusual cases of <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> atresia are reported, one with an intact septum and one with a perimembranous ventricular septal defect, closed in utero by aneurysmal tricuspid tissue. In both cases the pulmonary blood supply came entirely from aortopulmonary collaterals. In case 1 a collateral artery connected the left subclavian <b>artery</b> and hypoplastic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> and several aortopulmonary collaterals arose from the descending aorta, without overlap between these two circulations. In case 2 the pulmonary trunk and arterial duct were absent and the pulmonary blood supply came entirely from collateral arteries. The right ventricle was of normal size and tripartite with a closed perimembranous ventricular septal defect, discovered only at postmortem examination. These observations suggest right ventricular outflow tract obstruction early in fetal development, with involution of the pulmonary trunk and sixth arch derivatives, and persistence of primitive aortopulmonary connections. The morphology in case 1 {{is at odds with}} the theoretical division of pulmonary atresia with intact septum and pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect into two separate pathological entities that occur at different stages in fetal development...|$|R

40|$|Ascent to high {{altitude}} is normally associated with amodest increase in pulmonary artery pressure. 1 Theincreased right ventricular afterload, coupled with hypobaric hypoxia-induced reductions in blood oxygen con-tent, {{may lead to}} diminished peripheral oxygen delivery and result in dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise intolerance. 2 The predominant mechanism responsible for the increase in pul-monary artery pressure at altitude is hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which is mediated through an oxygen-sensitive pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell voltage-gated K channel. 3 The primary site of hypoxic pulmonary vaso-constriction is the small (50 to 200 m) <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries,</b> although the pulmonary venous circuit may contrib-ute up to 20 % of the pressor response. 4 A more clinically significant and potentially fatal cardiovascular consequence of exposure to altitude {{is the development of}} high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE).

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{pulmonary}} circulation of three closely related animals, the llama, alpaca, and guanaco. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 12 llamas and one alpaca indigenous to high altitude in the Andes {{was found to be}} slightly but significantly higher than that of three llamas and three guanacos born and bred at low altitude in England. On the other hand, the medial thickness of the <b>muscular</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arteries</b> and the relative weights of the two ventricles were the same in three llamas and one alpaca at high altitude as they were in one llama and two guanacos at low altitude. It is concluded that the pulmonary vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, while present, is greatly reduced in this species and it is suggested that this may have taken place by evolutionary adaptation...|$|E

In addition, this {{is the first}} report of lung involvement by both metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and an embolic agent used for RAE. The patient was a 63 -year-old woman who recently presented with both dyspnea on exertion and productive cough. Her past medical history included clear cell RCC, which was treated with preoperative trisacryl gelatin microsphere RAE and right nephrectomy 9 years earlier.

40|$|A rare anomaly: ‘hemitruncus’ A 7 -year-old {{boy with}} a history of {{frequent}} respiratory tract infections in infancy, presented with easy fatigability and exer-tional dyspnoea. On examination, he had mild cyanosis, club-bing, left parasternal heave and a loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound with no murmurs.

An echocardiogram revealed right ventricular hypertrophy with dilated main <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and left <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery.</b> Right <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> was not visualised.

A right ventricular angiogram showed the main <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and left <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> with absence of the right <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> and a moderate sized patent ductus arterious (panel A). An aortic root angiogram showed the right <b>pulmonary</b> <b>artery</b> arising from the posterior part of the ascending aorta (panel B).
