5|$|Since 30 May 1990 (the first multi-party {{parliamentary}} election held following the 45-year Communist rule), the Republic of Croatia {{has had a}} total of twelve governments headed by ten different prime ministers. The prime minister in the first government after the first <b>multi-party</b> <b>election</b> was Stjepan Mesić, who would later go {{on to become the}} President of Croatia. That government was formed by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), as were seven other governments of Croatia. Three governments have been formed by the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), and one was a national unity government (representing a wide coalition of political parties) formed during the Croatian War of Independence's peak, between July 1991 and August 1992, with Franjo Gregurić as the prime minister.|$|E

The parties boycotting the election included the All-Amhara People's Organization, Council of Alternative Forces for Peace and Democracy in Ethiopia, and Ethiopian Democratic Unity Party.|$|E
25|$|The {{fall of the}} Berlin Wall {{served as}} the {{catalyst}} for Merkel's political career. Although she {{did not participate in}} the crowd celebrations the night the wall came down, one month later Merkel became involved in the growing democracy movement, joining the new party Democratic Awakening. Following the first (and only) <b>multi-party</b> <b>election</b> of the East German state, she became the deputy spokesperson of the new pre-unification caretaker government under Lothar de Maizière. Merkel had impressed de Maiziere with her adept dealing with journalists questioning the role of a party leader, Wolfgang Schnur, as a secret informant for police. In April 1990, the Democratic Awakening merged with the East German CDU, which in turn merged with its western counterpart after reunification.|$|E

This parliamentary election was the 7th since the 1990 first <b>multi-party</b> <b>election.</b> The result was a victory for Fidesz–KDNP alliance, preserving its two-thirds majority with Viktor Orbán remaining Prime Minister. It was the first election {{according to the new}} Constitution of Hungary which went into force on 1 January 2012. The new electoral law also entered into force that day. The voters elected 199 MPs instead of previous 386 lawmakers.

25|$|During {{the first}} <b>multi-party</b> <b>election</b> of Kenya, in 1992, Maathai strove {{to unite the}} {{opposition}} and for fair elections in Kenya. The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) had fractured into FORD-Kenya (led by Oginga Odinga) and FORD-Asili (led by Kenneth Matiba); former vice president Mwai Kibaki had left the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party, and formed the Democratic Party. Maathai and many others believed such a fractured opposition would lead to KANU's retaining control of the country, so they formed the Middle Ground Group {{in an effort to}} unite the opposition. Maathai was chosen to serve as its chairperson. Also during the election, Maathai and like-minded opposition members formed the Movement for Free and Fair Elections. Despite their efforts, the opposition did not unite, and the ruling KANU party used intimidation and state-held media to win the election, retaining control of parliament.|$|E
2500|$|In the Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006, held on July 30 and October 29 in two rounds, the {{incumbent}} Joseph Kabila was elected president. The first round saw 33 candidates {{running for president}} and 9,000 candidates running for the 500 seats in the National Assembly. Kabila had garnered 44.81% of the vote, while his main opponent, Jean-Pierre Bemba, only won 20.03%. Kabila's People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy won 110 seats in the Assembly, compared to the 64 seats won by Bemba's Movement for the Liberation of Congo. The second round, a presidential run-off, saw the deployment of the world's largest United Nations peacekeeping mission, UNMOC. On November 15, the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) announced that Kabila had won the vote with 58.05%, while Bemba had received only 41.95% support, and declared Kabila president. Voter turnout was 65.36% for the second round. Despite Bemba's rejection of the outcome, the Supreme Court upheld the election result, stating that Kabila was the winner by [...] "absolute majority". Throughout the year, rioting and violence was rampant {{in many parts of}} the country. This was the first <b>multi-party</b> <b>election</b> since 1960.|$|E
2500|$|In Estonia, {{environmental}} protests soon {{grew into}} a general revolt against Soviet rule: the [...] "Singing Revolution", which was led by Estonian intellectuals. Lennart Meri’s speech Do Estonians Have Hope focused on the existential problems {{of the nation and}} had strong repercussions abroad. In 1988, Meri became {{a founding member of the}} Estonian Popular Front, which cooperated with its counterparts in Latvia and Lithuania. After the first non-communist-style <b>multi-party</b> <b>election</b> in 1990, Meri was appointed to the post of Foreign Minister. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lennart Meri’s first task was to create the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He developed around him a group of well educated young people, many English speaking, in order to establish an open communication channel to the West, and at the same time to represent Estonia more widely on the international scene. He participated in the CSCE Conferences in Copenhagen, New York, Paris, Berlin and Moscow, and the foundation conference of the Council of the Baltic Sea Countries. He also had several meetings with American and European Heads of State and Foreign Ministers, and was the first Eastern European guest to give a presentation at NATO Headquarters in Brussels.|$|E
