40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} question of identity construction in the <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> role, and seeks to integrate contemporary research on identity construction and leader-follower identity with research on {{the position of the}} manager “in the middle”. A conceptual model, the <b>Middle</b> <b>Manager</b> Role Matrix, is developed which identifies and interprets varying descriptions of <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> behaviour within the context of key choices facing middle managers: whether to act as leaders or followers, and whether to prioritise relationships with subordinates or superordinates. The <b>Middle</b> <b>Manager</b> Role Matrix is tested through a case study of the Team Leader role within a large public sector organisation, using qualitative methods. The findings of the case study support the validity of the <b>Middle</b> <b>Manager</b> Role Matrix and the thesis that <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> identity construction is related to the choices of leader/follower behaviour and subordinate/superordinate relationships. The dissertation therefore proposes ways in which the <b>Middle</b> <b>Manager</b> Role Matrix might be further refined, tested and integrated with existing models of leader-follower identity construction...|$|R
40|$|This article explores {{dilemmas}} in <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> {{work through}} the perspective of leadership-as-practice. An autoethnographic account is outlined of how a dilemma is addressed by a <b>middle</b> <b>manager.</b> The account shows how a dilemma faced by a <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> needs {{to be understood as}} situated within the flow of activity that is itself nested in a context of roles and relationships as well as the strategic context. The authors show how the outcome of the dilemma became accommodated within the emergent practice in the organisation with no sense of recognition of the dilemma’s impact. The notion of <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> agency within leadership-as-practice is explored through aspects of moral disengagement. The article problematizes two aspects: firstly, that normative ethical theorizing that has been unable to cater for the complexity of <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> work seen through the practice lens; second, that traditional notions of leadership as ’leader’ appears absent from the narrative, yet seen through the lens of leadership-as-practice, with attention to context, agency, activity and outcomes, a very different perspective can be seen.

40|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of 262 interviews, I argue that role expectations {{have the potential to}} both enable and constrain <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> strategic agency. To explain why the same role expectations have contradictory effects on agency, I analyse enabling conditions corresponding to four strategic role expectations, based on Floyd and Wooldridge's work on <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> roles. After presenting eight enabling conditions for strategic agency, specific to the four role expectations, I argue that the dominant functionalist view of strategic roles should be augmented from a <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> viewpoint. I suggest a reciprocal view of strategic role expectations, which elucidates the tensions between dialogue, legitimacy and rationality within a set of strategic roles.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{presents}} an ongoing empirical study into strategy {{development at the}} subsidiary management level of the Multinational Enterprise (MNE). The multinational subsidiary is a unique context to study management processes relating to strategy but so far, despite {{the emergence of the}} concept, {{there has not been a}} coherent approach identifiable in the literature. It is recognised that subsidiaries evolve over time and through their own actions and initiatives have the potential to modify the power structures of the Multinational Enterprise (MNE) but little is known about the role of the subsidiary manager in this process. We suggest that the tensions between the headquarters perspective and the subsidiary perspective have resulted in the application of inappropriate frameworks to the study of subsidiary managers. We propose that, the unique position which the subsidiary manager occupies within the overall context of the MNE requires the application of a specific framework which reflects this reality. The subsidiary manager performs the role of a <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> within the overall MNE structure. To analyse this role we have adapted a framework of <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> strategy development based on Floyd and Wooldridge’s (1992,, 1997) seminal work in the field of <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> research. The framework outlined in this study extends Floyd and Wooldridge’s work to include three different types of <b>Middle</b> <b>Manager</b> Strategic activity; Upward, Downward and Horizontal. The items in the survey were developed particularly for the multinational subsidiary context. The model tests subsidiary manager’s engagement in strategy, the antecedents, and the outcomes of that role. A large scale mail survey of the entire population of multinational subsidiary was undertaken to test the model. Data analysis is currently underway. Applying the <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> perspective to the subsidiary manager opens up the possibility to make important theoretical contributions to a number of research streams. Firstly, from an international business perspective, the <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> framework could unlock valuable insights into how subsidiary managers engage in strategic activity. Secondly, for the strategy field, there is an opportunity to apply the <b>middle</b> <b>manager</b> framework of strategy development to a specific and underexplored setting. From a practitioner perspective there is potential to identify the distinctive abilities required to be a successful subsidiary manager in today’s global environment. The importance of these managers cannot be overstated. Their relative success in enacting their role can provide benefit to their own subsidiary unit, the global MNE, and the local economy in which they operate. A greater understanding of how they engage in this process may reveal the true value of the Subsidiary General Manager...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{leadership}} styles of <b>middle</b> level <b>managers</b> working in the Ministry of Education Malaysia. The <b>middle</b> level <b>managers</b> in this research are restricted to those from the Administrative and Diplomatic Officers Scheme of service (PTD: Skim Pegawai Tadbir dan Diplomatik) and Education Officers Scheme of service (DG: Skim Pegawai Perkhidmatan Pendidikan Siswazah/Bukan Siswazah). Leadership style, in this study, is defined as the extent to which a leader exhibits transformational, transactional and/or laissez-faire styles of leadership. This study adopts a mixed methods approach in helping to elicit information pertaining to the leadership styles of the PTD and DG <b>middle</b> level <b>managers.</b> A Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) 5 x rater form is used in the quantitative strand while the qualitative part of this study utilises a standardised open-ended interview approach. A total of 122 respondents working in ten departments in the Ministry of Education answered the questionnaire while eight <b>middle</b> level <b>managers</b> (four PTD and four DG <b>middle</b> level <b>managers)</b> were interviewed. The results of both of the quantitative and qualitative strands indicate that the PTD and DG <b>middle</b> level <b>managers</b> showed more transformational leadership styles as compared to transactional leadership styles. In addition, the t-test reveals that the two groups of <b>middle</b> level <b>managers</b> do not show any significant differences in terms of their leadership styles. The findings also indicate that there were no significant differences in the perceptions of the overall transformational, transactional and laissez-faire leadership styles of the PTD <b>middle</b> level <b>managers</b> as perceived by their subordinates from different schemes of service. However, the same could not be said of DG <b>middle</b> level <b>managers</b> as their overall transformational as well as laissez-faire leadership styles indicate significant differences as perceived by subordinates from different schemes of service.
