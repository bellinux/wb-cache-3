25|$|HMS Grimsby is a Sandown-class <b>minehunter</b> of the British Royal Navy, and {{the second}} ship to bear the name.|$|E
25|$|She {{was built}} by Vosper Thornycroft, in Woolston, Hampshire, and {{commissioned}} in 1999. The class was originally named as the Single Role <b>Minehunter</b> and was planned to complement {{the capabilities of the}} preceding Hunt class and to be cheaper to build. Sandown-class MCMVs are highly manoeuvrable vessels due to being fitted with Voith-Schneider propulsors allowing rapid turning at slow speeds or whilst stationary. They are considered to be amongst the best active minehunters in the world.|$|E
50|$|Between 1999 and 2003, the RAN {{acquired}} six Huon class <b>minehunters.</b> Based on Intermarine SpA's Gaeta class <b>minehunters,</b> each ship {{is equipped}} with a variable depth sonar, and a pair of Bofors Double Eagle underwater clearance vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Coastal <b>minehunters</b> are {{ships that}} are {{designed}} to find, classify, and destroy moored and bottom mines from vital waterways. Coastal <b>minehunters</b> are generally smaller and with lower sea-keeping and endurance than oceangoing <b>minehunters.</b> They are usually tasked with keeping fixed high-value choke points clear of mines, such as the approaches to military ports and harbours. In a Cold War context it was especially important to protect those ports used by a nation's ballistic missile submarines.|$|R

He passed the squadron command examination on 16 July 1991, attended the Staff College, Camberley, the following year, and completed the Army Staff course. He was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander on 1 February and passed the ship command examination on 12 March 1992. From 1993 to 1994, Prince Andrew commanded the Hunt-class <b>minehunter</b> HMS Cottesmore.|$|E
2500|$|... : Six F-16 Fighting Falcon {{fighter jets}} of the Belgian Air Component, were already {{stationed}} at Araxos, Greece for an exercise, and flew their first {{mission in the}} afternoon of 21 March. They monitored the no-fly zone throughout the operation and have successfully attacked ground targets multiple times since 27 March, all of them without collateral damage. The Belgian Naval Component <b>minehunter</b> [...] was part of NATO's SNMCMG1 {{at the start of}} the operation and assisted in NATO's naval blockade from 23 March.

50|$|<b>Minehunters</b> {{differ from}} minesweepers in that minesweepers are used against older {{magnetic}} mines that are moored {{just below the}} surface. <b>Minehunters</b> are designed to seek out mines and destroy them individually, particularly against more advanced modern mines, which sit on the seabed and can be programmed to target specific vessel types (see CAPTOR mine). To do this they have mine-hunting sonar and can act as motherships and support craft for ROVs and combat divers. However, in some circumstances many <b>minehunters</b> can also destroy less advanced magnetic moored mines in the traditional manner.|$|R
2500|$|The sloop's wartime {{service was}} later {{recognised}} with two battle honours: [...] "Libya 1941" [...] and [...] "East Indies 1942". In March 2013, Governor-General Quentin Bryce {{announced that a}} Unit Citation for Gallantry would be retroactively awarded to the ship's company of Yarra {{at the time of}} her sinking. This was presented to the Chief of Navy and the ship's company of the <b>minehunter</b> , on the River Yarra, on 4 March 2014, the anniversary of the sloop Yarras loss.|$|E
2500|$|Mine {{countermeasure}} {{vessels in}} service with the Royal Navy include: seven Sandown-class minehunters and eight Hunt-class mine countermeasure vessels. The Hunt-class combine the separate {{roles of the}} traditional minesweeper and the active <b>minehunter</b> in one hull. If required, the Sandown and Hunt-class vessels can take {{on the role of}} offshore patrol vessels. [...] is an ocean survey vessel and at 13,500 tonnes {{is one of the largest}} ships in the Navy. The other survey vessels of the Royal Navy are the two multi-role ships of the Echo-class, which came into service in 2002 and 2003, and , which at just over 20 tonnes is the smallest commissioned vessel in the Navy.|$|E
2500|$|Five {{of the six}} {{ships were}} {{constructed}} completely in Newcastle, New South Wales, while the hull of the first ship was built in Italy, then transported to Australia for fitting out. Construction ran from 1994 to 2003, with lead ship [...] entering service in 1999. All six vessels are based at , in Sydney. In 2006, following a capability review three years prior, one <b>minehunter</b> was placed in reserve, while another was marked for transfer to reserve status; this instruction was reversed prior to 2008, and the two vessels were tasked with supporting border protection operations. As of January 2014, only four vessels were active, {{with the other two}} placed in reserve.|$|E
