5|$|Taking {{these two}} points of dispute into consideration, the direct death toll {{could be as}} low as fifty-five or as high as sixty. When {{combined}} with the four indirect victims <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier,</b> those numbers range from fifty-nine to sixty-four.|$|E
5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one {{from the end of the}} 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier</b> by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E
5|$|Chad is a religiously diverse country. The 1993 census {{found that}} 54% of Chadians were Muslim (of these, {{according}} to a Pew report 48% professed to be Sunni, 21% Shia, 4% Ahmadi and 23% just Muslim). Roughly 20% of Chadians are Roman Catholic, 14% Protestant, 10% animist, while 3% did not profess any religion. None of these religious traditions are monolithic. Animism includes a variety of ancestor and place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam is expressed in diverse ways; for example, according to the Pew report <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier</b> 55% of Muslim Chadians belong to Sufi orders. Christianity arrived in Chad with the French and American missionaries; as with Chadian Islam, it syncretises aspects of pre-Christian religious beliefs. Muslims are largely concentrated in northern and eastern Chad, and animists and Christians live primarily in southern Chad and Guéra. The constitution provides for a secular state and guarantees religious freedom; different religious communities generally co-exist without problems.|$|E

5|$|Jarasandha is the nemesis of Krishna. No {{one other}} than Bheema {{or the other}} three <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier</b> can defeat him, and the legend is that Krishna escapes to Dwaraka due to threats from Jarasandha, and his {{repeated}} failures in defeating the latter. This time Bheema and Krishna go in disguised form, as Brahmins(purohits) into the fortress of Jarasandha. There they request for a duel from Jarasandha. Jarasandha chooses Bheema as his sparring partner. During the fight, Krishna signals Bheema to tear Jarasandha vertically apart into two pieces so the latter will be killed for good. However the body parts of Jarasandha rejoin because of a boon he possesses, and he regains his life. After a few failed attempts, Krishna signals Bheema to throw apart Jarasandha's torn body parts in opposite directions. This time however Jarasandha dies.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominence}} of a Brahmin in Indian society was {{directly related to}} his virtues, values, knowledge and practice of the scriptures. Manu's list of virtues of a perfect Brahmin, according to Italian Jesuit Roberto de Nobili, in order of importance were righteousness, truthfulness, generosity, almsgiving, compassion, self-restraint and diligent work. Prior {{to the rise of}} the Konkanastha Peshwas, the Konkanastha Brahmins were considered inferior in a society where the Deshasthas held socio-economic, ritual and Brahminical superiority. As <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier,</b> all the Pant Pradhan during Shivaji's rule were Deshastha Brahmins and many modern families who have surname, Peshwe, are in fact Deshastha Brahmins tracing descent to Shivaji's Pant Pradhans, Moropant Pingle or Sonopant Dabir. After the appointment of Balaji Vishwanath Bhat as Peshwa, Konkanastha migrants began arriving en masse from the Konkan to Pune, where the Peshwa offered some important offices to the Konkanastha caste. The Konkanastha kin were rewarded with tax relief and grants of land. Historians point out nepotism and corruption during this time.|$|E
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier</b> by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E

5|$|Of Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann {{stands out}} as an {{influence}} in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist Roland John Wiley. As <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier,</b> Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky {{not just as a}} formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression. Leon Botstein claims the music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by Franz Lachner, Jules Massenet, and Joachim Raff after the rediscovery of Bach's works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them. His teacher Anton Rubinstein's opera The Demon became a model for the final tableau of Eugene Onegin. So did Léo Delibes' ballets Coppélia and Sylvia for The Sleeping Beauty and Georges Bizet's opera Carmen (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for The Queen of Spades. Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected; Mozart, whose music he loved; Glinka, whose opera A Life for the Tsar made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; and Adolphe Adam, whose ballet Giselle was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on The Sleeping Beauty. Beethoven's string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky's attempts in that medium. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Henry Litolff.|$|E
