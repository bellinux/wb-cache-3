She advocates a <b>marriage</b> <b>loan</b> (Ehekredit) for young couples similar to practises in the former GDR and a basic allowance for children (Baukindergeld).

5000|$|Initially, {{the loans}} {{required}} that the bride stop work immediately and not take another position during {{the life of the}} loan unless the husband was earning less than 125 RM per month. Planners hoped that the loan programme would cause 800,000 women to leave the workforce over the first four years, and there was an associated programme of subsidies for household goods manufacture intended to provide jobs for another 200,000 men. In November 1933, the Völkischer Beobachter featured as a [...] "shining" [...] example the mass wedding and subsequent resignations of 122 female employees of the Reemtsma cigarette factory in Berlin, who thereby freed jobs for unemployed men. By 1937, full employment had been achieved and women workers were needed, so the requirement was removed and the loan made available to all young people of documented Aryan ancestry and genetic fitness. This caused an increase in applications: by 1936 approximately one third of couples were receiving them; by 1939 this had risen to 42%. In July 1938, a special <b>marriage</b> <b>loan</b> programme for agricultural workers was added as part of the Decree on the Welfare of the Rural Population: couples were eligible if one partner had worked in agriculture or forestry for five years before they married, and the loan would be excused after a further ten years of such work. There was also a renewable 400 RM subsidy to farm workers for setting up a household.|$|E
50|$|The first {{argument}} {{that was used}} in Nazi motherhood propaganda was that German mothers were expected to produce as many children as possible. The mother of Nazi Germany was glorified in visual propaganda. <b>Marriage</b> <b>loans</b> were also created and promoted through propaganda, and these were for recently married couples to fund a baby. These loans were to be used as “vouchers for furniture and other household goods, provided, of course, that the women gave up work on marriage and devoted herself to motherhood”. In order to ensure the success of these <b>marriage</b> <b>loans,</b> there were increased taxes for single people and couples without children.|$|R
50|$|The East German {{government}} forgave all outstanding <b>marriage</b> <b>loans</b> in 1950, and in 1972 instituted its own loan programme, the Ehekredit (marriage credit), {{which was}} strongly {{reminiscent of the}} Nazi marriage loan: newlyweds under 26 received an interest-free loan of 5,000 East German marks, which was progressively forgiven as they had children, again referred to as abkindern.|$|R

The principal reason banks are chartered {{by the government and}} the central bank is to make loans to their customers. Indeed, making loans is the principal economic function of banks to fund consumption and investment spending by businesses, individuals, and units of government. Bank loans support the growth of new businesses and jobs within the banks trade territory and promote economic vitality. For most banks, loans account for half or more of their total assets and about half to two-thirds of their revenues. No wonder, then, when examiners appear at a bank they make a thorough review of the bank’s loan portfolio. Usually this involves a detailed analysis of the documentation and collateral for the largest loans, a review of a sample of small loans, and an evaluation of the bank’s loan policy to ensure that it is sound and prudent {{in order to protect the}} public’s funds. Trust Bank Ltd. gained success from the very beginning of their operation and were capable enough to hold the success year after year because they have a very strong backup to provide them financial support and they are the Army Welfare Trust. Total loans & advances of the bank as on December 31 ’ 2009 was Tk. 3266. 31 Crore as against Tk. 160. 40 Crore in FY 2001. The credit portfolio of the bank is a mix of scheme loans, namely Micro credit, Consumers durable scheme loan (CDS), <b>Marriage</b> <b>Loan,</b> Car Loan, HBF Loan and Commercial Loans. Commercial Loans comprise Trade financing in the form of working Capital and industrial loans in the form of Term loans and other funded & non-funded credit facilities. Term financing indicates the participation in the industrial development of our country while by extending small loans TBL has fulfilled the borrowing needs of the low and medium income groups of our society.

50|$|With {{use of his}} land, Zulu <b>marriages</b> and the <b>loaning</b> of cattle, Dunn built {{a network}} of clients and {{contacts}} along the Zululand coast {{that allowed him to}} exploit the region's wealth. During the 1860s he was involved in the trade of firearms into Zululand with the exchange of cattle for rifles via Lourenço Marques along the Zululand coast, as well as the flow of Tsonga workers to Natal for the agricultural industry, from the former. He would later be appointed as Protector of Immigrants for Zululand in 1874 by Theophilus Shepstone. Another important business income for Dunn was hunting. Organising his Zulu subjects as hunters, guides and porters, they successfully hunted for ivory, hides and skins but by 1880 game had become scarce in Zululand.|$|R
40|$|Everywhere {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} society and correspondingly high incomes {{has been accompanied by}} a fall in births. If one could only explain the fall unambiguously policy measures to counter it could be readily devised. Unfortunately there are many explanations, and from each follows a different policy prescription. If the income derived from women's work in offices and industry has become so high that they cannot afford the time to have children, then payments from the State to cover what they lose through child raising will offset that. If the obstacle is the cost of clothing and educating children to present high standards, then family allowances will serve and be much less expensive than replacing women's salaries. But if the reason for couples holding back is the danger of divorce, where the children would be a handicap to the single parent for work and for remarriage, then state subsidy is not so obviously the answer. And if the obstacle to childbearing is a shift in the culture from a familistic to an individual orientation then perhaps no affordable amount of money will induce people to have children. One could go on this way. If parents do not have children because they cannot find living premises sufficiently large for them, then housing subsidies are the answer. Some "explanations" of the fall in fertility lead to simple policy solutions; others would seem not to be amenable to any kind of policy. The inability to distinguish among competing theories of the fall of fertility means that theory cannot by itself prescribe policy. To get around the inability to understand theoretically we have resort to data. The present paper presents empirical evidence that in fact policy can make a difference. In order to do that it had first to measure the difference between fertility in West Germany and Austria {{on the one hand and}} East Germany on the other. Statistics show clearly that year by year since 1976 when policy measures were introduced in East Germany births have been higher by about half a child each year. But suppose that was due to parents just having earlier whatever number of children they were to have anyway; if this were so the rise in annual rates would be only temporary, and would have only a trifling long term effect. The authors establish that the rise in the East German rate is not of this character. And they also show that such a rise did not occur in West Germany and Austria. The measures that produced the rise included generous maternity leave, plus subsequent paid leave for working mothers, interest free <b>marriage</b> <b>loans</b> whose repayment was partly canceled on the birth or children. By concentrating on third and later children some of the benefits would have more effect on fertility for a given total expenditure. Unfortunately neither the East German authorities nor this paper's authors were able to distinguish the effect of the various elements in a somewhat heterogeneous package of policy measures, but they do show unambiguously the effect of the package as a whole...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the hypothesis that}} the persistence of low spatial and marital mobility in rural India, despite increased growth rates and rising inequality in recent years, is due to the existence of sub-caste networks that provide mutual insurance to their members. Unique panel data providing information on caste <b>loans,</b> <b>marriage,</b> and migration are used to link caste networks to household and aggregate mobility. Wealthier households within their sub-castes are more likely to both migrate and inter-marry, suggesting that they are not being adequately compensated by the network in their role as net lenders. Conversely, among households with the same wealth, those in higher-wealth caste networks are more likely to obtain loans and {{are less likely to be}} mobile, providing direct evidence that the networks restrict mobility. At the aggregate level, the networks appear to have coped successfully with the rising inequality within sub-castes that accompanied the Green Revolution. The results suggest that caste networks will continue to smooth consumption in rural India for the foreseeable future, as they have for centuries, unless alternative credit mechanisms of comparable quality become available. ∗We received helpful comments from Andrew Foster, Rachel Kranton, Ethan Ligon and seminar participants a...|$|R
