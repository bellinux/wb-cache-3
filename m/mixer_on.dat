500|$|As a subplot, Stan {{spends most}} of the episode trying to return the {{aforementioned}} Margaritaville mixer; the trendy retailer Sur La Table will not accept the return because it was bought on a payment plan. He tries to find out to whom he can return it, each person saying the debt has been packaged and sold to someone else (much like real-life mortgage-backed securities). Eventually he {{goes all the way}} to the United States Treasury, where a group of associates [...] "consult the charts" [...] and tell him the mixer is worth $90 trillion. One of the three treasury workers then says that another insurance company is failing and asks what they should do. They say they have to [...] "consult the charts" [...] again. Stan follows the men inside, and he sees a round lit-up game show style board, where the men cut off a chicken's head and let the decapitated chicken run on the board while one of them plays a tune similar to Yakety Sax on a kazoo. The chicken falls on the [...] "bailout!" [...] spot, so that is what the men do. In anger at the ridiculousness of the system, Stan breaks the <b>mixer</b> <b>on</b> the platform by the chicken and walks off.|$|E
500|$|In November 1998, New Ark filed a fifty-page {{lawsuit against}} Hill, her management, also her record label, {{claiming}} that Hill [...] "used their songs and production skills, {{but failed to}} properly credit them for the work" [...] on Miseducation. The musicians {{claimed to be the}} primary songwriters on two tracks, and major contributors on several others, though Gordon Williams, a prominent recorder, engineer, and <b>mixer</b> <b>on</b> Miseducation, described the album as a [...] "powerfully personal effort by Hill" [...] and said [...] "It was definitely her vision." [...] Hill responded that New Ark had been appropriately credited and now were seeking to take advantage of her success. New Ark requested partial writing credits on most of the tracks on the album as well as monetary reimbursement. After many delays, depositions took place during the latter part of 2000. In part, the case illustrated the difficult boundaries between songwriting and all other aspects that went into contemporary arranging, sampling, and recording. The suit would eventually be settled out of court in February 2001, with Hill paying New Ark a reported $5 million. A friend of Hill's later said of the suit, [...] "That {{was the beginning of a}} chain effect that would turn everything a little crazy." ...|$|E
40|$|The gain {{bandwidth}} of NbN hot-electron bolometer terahertz <b>mixers</b> <b>on</b> electrically thin Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 membranes was experimentally {{investigated and}} {{compared with that}} of HEB <b>mixers</b> <b>on</b> bulk substrates. A gain bandwidth of 3. 5 GHz is achieved on bulk silicon, whereas the gain bandwidth is reduced down to 0. 6 – 0. 9 GHz for <b>mixers</b> <b>on</b> 1. 5 um Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 membranes. We show that application of a MgO buffer layer on the membrane extends the gain bandwidth to 3 GHz. The experimental data were analyzed using the film-substrate acoustic mismatch approach...|$|R

2500|$|After a {{demo version}} of the album was put down in Artane, Dickens {{requested}} to have it re-recorded digitally at a more professional studio as the analogue equipment used at Aigle had created an abundance of tape hiss, causing the music to suffer. Nicky found the quality of Enya's multi-track vocals had also diminished, leaving them the only option of re-recording them, though he later found digital record had lost [...] "warmth in the bottom end". With studio time booked at Orinoco Studios in Bermondsey, London, Enya and Nicky re-recorded and mastered Watermark with Ross Cullum who carried out co-production, engineering, and mixing duties. [...] "Storms in Africa" [...] and [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] were completed on the studio's two Mitsubishi 32-track recording machines. Away from the [...] "intimate and personal" [...] setting of recording in Ireland, Enya found working in London more difficult as the busy city caused many distractions. Cullum completed {{the majority of the}} album's mixing at Wessex Sound Studios, with Jim Barton credited as the <b>mixer</b> <b>on</b> [...] "Orinoco Flow". During the final stages of recording, Enya tripped on a step which resulted in two cuts to her knee. She continued to work, [...] "taking these heavy pain-killers, sitting at the desk, in the studio with one foot propped up on cushions." [...] Recording finished in April 1988, ten months after it began.|$|E
