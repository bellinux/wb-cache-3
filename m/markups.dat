25|$|After the Portuguese {{were allowed}} to {{permanently}} settle in Macau, both Chinese and Portuguese merchants flocked to Macau, although the Portuguese were never numerous (numbering just 900 in 1583 and 1200 out of 26,000 in 1640). It quickly became an important node {{in the development of}} Portugal's trade along three major routes: Macau-Malacca-Goa-Lisbon, Guangzhou-Macau-Nagasaki and Macau-Manila-Mexico. The Guangzhou-Macau-Nagasaki route was particularly profitable because the Portuguese acted as middlemen, shipping Chinese silks to Japan and Japanese silver to China, pocketing huge <b>markups</b> in the process. This already lucrative trade became even more so when Chinese officials handed Macau's Portuguese traders a monopoly by banning direct trade with Japan in 1547, due to piracy by Chinese and Japanese nationals.|$|E
25|$|Coxeter–Dynkin {{diagrams}} can explicitly enumerate {{nearly all}} classes of uniform polytope and uniform tessellations. Every uniform polytope with pure reflective symmetry (all {{but a few}} special cases have pure reflectional symmetry) can be represented by a Coxeter–Dynkin diagram with permutations of <b>markups.</b> Each uniform polytope can be generated using such mirrors and a single generator point: mirror images create new points as reflections, then polytope edges can be defined between points and a mirror image point. Faces can be constructed by cycles of edges created, etc. To specify the generating vertex, one or more nodes are marked with rings, meaning that the vertex {{is not on the}} mirror(s) represented by the ringed node(s). (If two or more mirrors are marked, the vertex is equidistant from them.) A mirror is active (creates reflections) only with respect to points not on it. A diagram needs at least one active node to represent a polytope. An unconnected diagram (subgroups separated by order-2 branches, or orthogonal mirrors) requires at least one active node in each subgraph.|$|E

One UNIX application available as free software (under the GNU General Public License) is PDFedit. Another GPL-licensed application native to the unix environment is Xournal. Xournal allows for annotating in different fonts and colours, as well as a rule for quickly underlining and highlighting lines of text or paragraphs. Xournal also has a shape recognition tool for squares, rectangles and circles. In Xournal annotations may be moved, copied and pasted. The freeware Foxit Reader, available for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux, allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's PDF-XChange Viewer allows annotations and <b>markups</b> without restrictions in its freeware alternative. Apple's macOS's integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the freeware Skim, with the latter supporting interaction with LaTeX, SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with BibDesk reference management software. Freeware Qiqqa can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Ward {{relocated}} to Chicago, {{where he worked}} for Case and Sobin, a lamp house. He traveled for them as salesman, and sold goods on commission for a short time. Chicago {{was the center of}} the wholesale dry-goods trade, and in the 1860s Ward joined the leading dry-goods house, Field Palmer & Leiter, forerunner of Marshall Field & Co. He worked for Field for two years and then joined the wholesale dry-goods business of Wills, Greg & Co. In tedious rounds of train trips to southern communities, hiring rigs at the local stables, driving out to the crossroads stores and listening to the complaints of the back-country proprietors and their rural customers, he conceived a new merchandising technique: direct mail sales to country people. It was a time when rural consumers longed for the comforts of the city, yet all too often were victimized by monopolists and overcharged by the costs of many middlemen required to bring manufactured products to the countryside. The quality of merchandise also was suspect and the hapless farmer had no recourse in a caveat emptor economy. Ward shaped a plan to buy goods at low cost for cash. By eliminating intermediaries, with their <b>markups</b> and commissions, and drastically cutting selling costs, he could sell goods to people, however remote, at appealing prices. He invited them to send their orders by mail and he delivered the purchases to their nearest railroad station. The only thing he lacked was capital.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of population size, type of ownership, number of hours open per week, pharmacy location, type of pharmacy, average annual store sales volume, average number of prescriptions filled per day, patient profile system and delivery service on prescription price, dollar <b>markup</b> and percent <b>markup</b> in Oregon; then to examine the relationship between the selected socioeconomic variables and prescription price, dollar <b>markup</b> or percent <b>markup</b> among Oregon counties. The prescription price, dollar <b>markup</b> and percent <b>markup</b> were obtained from the average of 300 prescriptions from each of 292 observed pharmacies which were drawn by 1977 Survey of Oregon Pharmacies conducted by Adult and Family Services, State of Oregon. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine the effect of the previous nine variables on prescription price, dollar <b>markup</b> and percent <b>markup.</b> Type of ownership, number of hours open per week, type of pharmacy, average annual store sales volume, patient profile system and delivery service affected the prescription price, dollar <b>markup</b> and percent <b>markup</b> significantly. The difference in size of city population had significant effect only on prescription price but not on dollar <b>markup</b> and percent <b>markup.</b> Pharmacy location and number of prescriptions filled per day appeared to cause significant effect on dollar <b>markup</b> and percent <b>markup</b> but not on prescription price. The simple regression analysis reflected a significant relationship between retail drug and proprietary sales and dollar <b>markup</b> among Oregon counties. The stepwise regression also indicated significant relationship between dollar <b>markup</b> and retail drug and proprietary sales, per capita income per person and percentage age over 65 years among Oregon counties. Both stepwise and simple regression showed that there were no significant relationships among all selected socioeconomic variables and either prescription price or percent <b>markup...</b>|$|R

The {{damage to the}} water infrastructure was described as being of [...] "unexpected magnitude," [...] with 160,000 left without water {{a week after the}} storm made landfall. The standing water left following the rainfall caused concern of outbreaks of various diseases, including cholera. Consequently, the population was warned to boil or otherwise disinfect water to prevent disease. In areas where the storm's impact made it difficult to boil water due to the unavailability of gas or stoves, 70,000 jars with colloidal silver were distributed. Additionally, laboratory testing of refuse coming from individuals with gastrointestinary illnesses commenced as a precaution to identify outbreaks of cholera and other diseases, and over 82,000 vaccines were applied throughout the region. Following the storm's passage, PROFECO announced fines of up to $2.5 million (2010 MXN; $191,000 USD) to merchants guilty of price gouging when selling bottled water. This occurred after the agency received complaints of 1500% <b>markups</b> when compared to bottled water's pre-storm price.

40|$|<b>Markup</b> {{language}} {{is the combination}} of text and information (about text s structure and presentation style) about the text. A language that has codes for indicating layout and styling of a document (such as boldface, italics, paragraphs, placement of graphics, etc.) within a text file is called a <b>Markup</b> language. Widely used <b>markup</b> languages include SGML (Standard General <b>Markup</b> Language) and HTML (Hypertext <b>Markup</b> Language. In other words, when we format text to be printed (or displayed on a computer), we need {{to distinguish between the}} text itself and the instructions for printing the text. The <b>markup</b> is the instructions for the text. <b>Markup</b> can also indicate information about the text. For example, many students in school highlight certain phrases in their text books.
