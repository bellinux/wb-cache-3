5|$|Meyerbeer's {{personal}} {{attachment to}} Judaism was a mature personal decision – {{after the death}} of his maternal grandfather in 1811 he wrote to his mother 'Please accept from me a promise that I will always live in the religion in which he died'. In his diaries he noted significant family events including birthdays, not by their Gregorian calendar occurrence, but by their Jewish calendar dates. Moreover, he regularly suffered from (and/or imagined) anti-Jewish slights throughout his life, warning his brothers frequently in his letters against richess (Yiddish for 'Jew-hatred'). Writing to Heinrich Heine in 1839, he offered the fatalistic view:I believe that richess is like love in the theatres and novels: no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> <b>often</b> one encounters it...it never misses its target if effectively wielded... can grow back the foreskin of which we are robbed on the eighth day of life; those who, on the ninth day, do not bleed from this operation shall continue to bleed an entire lifetime, even after death.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{procedure}} calls {{is crucial}} in computer science and everyday programming. Among the most common strategies for passing procedure arguments ('evaluation strategies') are 'call-by-name', 'call-by-need', and 'call-by-value', where the latter is the most commonly used. While reasoning about procedure calls is simple for call-by-name, problems arise for call-by-need and call-by-value, because it <b>matters</b> <b>how</b> <b>often</b> and in which order the arguments of a procedure are evaluated. We shall classify these problems and see {{that all of them}} occur for call-by-value, some occur for call-by-need, and none occur for call-by-name. In that sense, call-by-value is the 'greatest common denominator' of the three evaluation strategies. Reasoning about call-by-value programs has been tackled by Eugenio Moggi's 'computational lambda-calculus', which is based on a distinction between 'values' and arbitrary expressions. However, the computational lambda-calculus deals only implicitly with the evaluation order and the number of evaluations of procedure arguments. Therefore, certain program equivalences that {{we should be able to}} spot immediately require long proofs. We shall remedy this by introducing a new calculus - the 'let-calculus' - that deals explicitly with evaluation order and the number of evaluations. For dealing with the number of evaluations, the let-calculus has mechanisms known from; linear, affine, and relevant logic. For dealing with evaluation order, it has mechanisms which seems to be completely new. We shall also introduce a new kind of denotational semantics for call-by-value programming languages. The key idea is to consider how categories with finite products are commonly used to model call-by-name languages, and remove the axioms which break for call-by-value. The resulting models we shall call 'precartesian categories'. These relatively simple structures have remarkable mathematical properties, which will inspire the design of the let-calculus. Precartesian categories will provide a semantics of both the let-calculus and the computational lambda-calculus. This semantics not only validates the same program equivalences as Moggi's monad-based semantics of the computational lambda-calculus; It is also 'direct' by contrast to Moggi's semantics, which implicitly performs a language transform. Our direct semantics has practical benefits: It clarifies issues that are related with the evaluation order and the number of evaluations of procedure arguments, and it is also very easy to remember. The thesis is rounded up by three applications of the let-calculus and precartesian categories: First, construing well-established models of partiality (i. e. categories of generalised partial functions) as precartesian categories, and specialising the let-calculus accordingly. Second, adding global state to a given computational system and construing the resulting system as a precartesian category. Third, analysing an implementation technique called 'continuation-style transform' by construing the source language of such a transform as a precartesian category...|$|R

6000|$|This, therefore, is {{our first}} {{requirement}} about the ideal towards which progress is directed; it must be fixed. Whistler used to make many rapid studies of a sitter; {{it did not matter}} if he tore up twenty portraits.

How can we make sure that the portrait painter will throw the portrait out of window instead of taking the natural and more human course of throwing the sitter out of window? ...|$|E

40|$|This {{response}} {{picks up}} on Valverde’s call for scholars to excavate contestable assumptions about {{space and time}} that are embedded in contemporary security arrangements. It does so by re-visiting the problem of time in punishment, focusing on how time works in sentencing and punishment theory compared to how it is experienced by prisoners. Time is both a central concern and banal quality of contemporary punishment, the most basic and so taken for granted dimension of modernity’s exemplary penal form – imprisonment. Sentencing theory operationalizes time through the principle of proportionality. The proportionality principle employs a uniform measure of time in which all prison sentences (or fine amounts or probation hours) of the same length equate to an identical amount of pain, no <b>matter</b> to whom, <b>how</b> <b>often</b> or in what order they are applied. By contrast, recent research by Armstrong and Weaver on the lived experience of penal time contradicts in almost every way the temporality assumed in proportionality theory. Such findings expose not only asocial assumptions about time but show how empirical work can be relevant to and inform philosophical and normative thinking on punishment...|$|R

She lay long hours by the wharf-boats of busy towns, exchanging one cargo for another, in that anarchic fetching and carrying which we call commerce, and which we drolly suppose to be governed by laws.

At each return the varying stream and shore must be studied, and every caprice of either divined.
