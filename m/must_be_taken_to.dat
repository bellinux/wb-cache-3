5|$|Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> {{avoid the}} {{accumulation}} of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is {{only a third of}} that of uranium-235. A critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E
5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is almost universally treated with the drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline. Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the weight}} had {{increased}} from 149 to 170 tonnes; to reduce this to 158 tonnes, {{the original idea}} of step-free access was discontinued. Instead, a wheelchair lift was installed, but it proved not to work. The area around the doors are step-free from the platform, but within the trains steps <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> reach the seating area. The Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People have criticized Flytoget for ordering identical additional cars that will not ease access for the disabled.|$|E

50|$|As {{with any}} type of bondage, there <b>are</b> {{considerations}} that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> prior <b>to</b> entry into sleepsack bondage.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} or growing season, the iris {{requires}} lots of moisture to bloom. But care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> not <b>to</b> over-water.|$|R
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
25|$|Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure}} that the {{integral}} converges. But the mean may be finite even if the function itself tends to infinity at some points.|$|E
25|$|The downsides {{to these}} {{fireplaces}} {{is that their}} heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> not <b>to</b> allow {{sheet metal}} to work harden and become brittle during planishing. If it does, it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> annealed.|$|R
50|$|Binary scaling is both {{faster and}} more {{accurate}} than directly using floating point instructions; however, care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> not <b>to</b> cause an arithmetic overflow.|$|R
50|$|Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> not <b>to</b> use {{consumer}} lotions in {{a hospital}} environment, as the perfumes and allergens may be a danger {{to those who are}} immunodeficient.|$|R
25|$|On 3 June Bland visited Balik Pulau himself, {{together}} with MacArthur. He determined that stringent measures and every precaution <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> check {{the spread of}} the disease.|$|E
25|$|Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> {{guard against}} the {{application}} of external heat sources (such as direct sunlight, heating pads, etc.) which in certain circumstances can trigger the release of too much medication and cause life-threatening complications.|$|E
25|$|Control grid modulation: The {{operating}} bias and gain {{of the final}} RF amplifier can be controlled by varying the voltage of the control grid. This method requires little audio power, but care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> reduce distortion.|$|E
50|$|No {{matter the}} quantity, care <b>must</b> always <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> prevent any {{electrostatic}} discharge or friction during mixing or handling, as these may cause accidental ignition.|$|R
50|$|In Kentucky, care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> not <b>to</b> confuse {{this school}} with Ballard Memorial High School, the {{public high school}} that serves Ballard County in the far-western Jackson Purchase.|$|R
5000|$|Caution <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> not <b>to</b> confuse this mark {{with the}} very similar mark tsinnorit, which has the same shape but {{different}} position and use. They differ in the following: ...|$|R
25|$|Apomorphine is {{colourless}} as {{a liquid}} but stains green, therefore care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> avoid splashes. Apomorphine does not remain stable {{for more than}} 24 hours in a plastic container, so syringes are discarded if not used within 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that both}} azeotropes above {{are of the}} positive, or minimum boiling type; care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the correct {{component}} of the separation step is retained, i.e. the binary phase-envelope diagram (boiling-point curve) must be correctly read.|$|E
25|$|Lymph nodes {{may become}} {{discolored}} and inflamed {{with the presence}} of tattoo pigments, but discoloration and inflammation are also visual indicators of melanoma; consequently, diagnosing melanoma in a patient with tattoos is made difficult, and special precautions <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> avoid misdiagnoses.|$|E

50|$|The game very {{strongly}} {{encourages people to}} mix with each other, but is rather complex for some players. Care <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the starting hands are similar in value.|$|R
50|$|It's {{possible}} to walk here from Lyme Regis, but care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> not <b>to</b> get {{cut off by}} the tide. The area is also prone to rock falls and mudslides, particularly during winter storms.|$|R
25|$|Mercuric {{chloride}} {{may be used}} as a {{stabilising agent}} for chemicals and analytical samples. Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> ensure that detected mercuric chloride does not eclipse the signals of other components in the sample, such as is possible in gas chromatography.|$|E
25|$|As with {{environmental}} economics, care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> ensure a complete {{view of the}} costs and benefits involved. For example, paperboard packaging for food products is more easily recycled than most plastic, but is heavier to ship and may result in more waste from spoilage.|$|E
25|$|Lennox–Gastaut {{syndrome}} and drug resistant/drug refractory epilepsy {{have been recorded}} with neurovisceral porphyrias including acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria. Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> avoid porphyrinogenic anti-seizure drugs in these cases. Diagnosis may be difficult in children who require enzyme or DNA testing.|$|E

50|$|When Mrs Mopp gets tired, she can revive {{herself by}} having a swig of sherry, but care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> not <b>to</b> drink too much, or Mrs Mopp will become first tipsy (reversed controls), then drunk (random movement).|$|R
25|$|Box turtles can {{be injured}} by {{dogs and cats}} so special care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> protect them from {{household}} pets. Box turtles require an outdoor enclosure, consistent exposure to the sun and a varied diet. Without these, a turtle's growth can be stunted and its immune system weakened.|$|E
25|$|In {{situations}} where {{neither of these}} two conditions hold (that is, the reaction is low energy and a substantial pool of product(s) exists), the Michaelis–Menten equation breaks down, and more complex modelling approaches explicitly taking the forward and reverse reactions into account <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> understand the enzyme biology.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being sensitive to the stoichiometry of oxygen, the properties of YBCO {{are influenced by the}} crystallization methods used. Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> sinter YBCO. YBCO is a crystalline material, and the best superconductive properties are obtained when crystal grain boundaries are aligned by careful control of annealing and quenching temperature rates.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that care}} <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> in order <b>to</b> avoid infinities caused by zeros in the denominators.|$|R
50|$|For this purpose, the inputs in {{production}} <b>must</b> moreover <b>be</b> {{used in an}} economical way, and care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> not <b>to</b> waste resources {{to the extent that}} this would mean additional costs for an enterprise, or reduce productivity.|$|R
50|$|Care <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> not <b>to</b> confuse it {{with the}} highly {{poisonous}} Inocybe erubescens, which grows in the same habitats. The latter has a more pungent fruity smell and bruises red. Entoloma sinuatum, also poisonous, has a rancid smell.|$|R
