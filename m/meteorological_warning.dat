40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{interest}} in the forecast and prevention of natural hazards related to hydro-meteorological events has increased the challenge for numerical weather modelling, in particular for limited area models, to improve the quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPF) for hydrological purposes. After the encouraging results obtained in the MAP D-PHASE Project, we decided to devote further analyses to show recent improvements in the operational use of hydrometeorological chains, and above all to better investigate the key role played by temperature during snowy precipitation. In this study we present a reanalysis simulation of one meteorological event, which occurred in November 2008 in the Piedmont Region. The {{attention is focused on}} the key role of air temperature, which is a crucial feature in determining the partitioning of precipitation in solid and liquid phase, influencing the quantitative discharge forecast (QDF) into the Alpine region. This is linked to the basin ipsographic curve and therefore by the total contributing area related to the snow line of the event. In order to assess hydrological predictions affected by meteorological forcing, a sensitivity analysis of the model output was carried out to evaluate different simulation scenarios, considering the forecast effects which can radically modify the discharge forecast. Results show how in real-time systems hydrological forecasters have to consider also the temperature uncertainty in forecasts in order to better understand the snow dynamics and its effect on runoff during a <b>meteorological</b> <b>warning</b> with a crucial snow line over the basin. The hydrological ensemble forecasts are based on the 16 members of the meteorological ensemble system COSMO-LEPS (developed by ARPA-SIMC) based on the non-hydrostatic model COSMO, while the hydrological model used to generate the runoff simulations is the rainfall-runoff distributed FEST-WB model, developed at Politecnico di Milano...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and implementation of a real-time flood forecasting system with a hydro-meteorological operational alert procedure during the MAP-D-PHASE Project is described in this paper. This chain includes both probabilistic and deterministic forecasts.

The observed data to run the control simulations were supplied by ARPA-Piemonte. The analysis is focused on Maggiore Lake basin, an Alpine basin between North-West of Italy and Southern Switzerland. Two hindcasts during the D-PHASE period are discussed in order to evaluate certain effects regarding discharge forecasts due to hydro-meteorological sources of uncertainties. In particular, in the June convective event it is analysed how the effect of meteorological model spatial resolution can influence the discharge forecasts over mountain basins, while in the November stratiform event how the effect of the initial conditions of soil moisture can modify <b>meteorological</b> <b>warnings.</b> The study shows how the introduction of alert codes appears to be useful for decision makers to give them a spread of forecasted QDFs with the probability of event occurrence, but also how alert warnings issued on the basis of forecasted precipitation only are not always reliable...|$|R

40|$|Background: Solar {{greenhouses}} {{are very}} popular {{in the north of}} China as a way of meeting the demand for fresh local winter vegetables. Nonetheless, they are more susceptible to biological and meteorological disasters, such as diseases, pests, fog, haze and cold temperatures. Although we have deployed many record keeping equipment and weather stations, we have lower efficiency of usage on data. Big data has great potential in the future. Thus, our aim is to investigate a big data system for disaster forecasting and control to efficiently capture long-term and up-to-the-minute environmental fluctuations inside greenhouses. Methods: A greenhouse disaster survey database was designed from the most important place of solar greenhouse vegetable production, that is the area around Bohai Harbor, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Hebei and Liaoning Provinces. The comprehensive survey provided large amounts of data, such as greenhouse distribution and environment parameter monitoring, for the system. The authors developed and integrated some disease, pest and <b>meteorological</b> disaster <b>warning</b> models using disaster-chain theory. The system was developed using C# in. NET framework. Results: A big data system for greenhouse vegetable disaster was developed combing with monitoring data for diseases and pests, meteorological data and production record data based on the internet of things, while visualization results were illustrated to provide a reference for the prevention decision. The system was applied in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, etc. Discussion: The present system proposes a meteorological disaster framework which includes warning and management of related diseases and pests. Its innovation is in the use of disaster chain-styled theory for <b>meteorological</b> risk <b>warning</b> and management based on the idea of data-intensive scientific discovery.

40|$|Three years ago, the Italian SpaceAgency (ASI), in {{agreement}} with the Italian Department for Civil Protection (DPC), funded a project finalized to the nowcasting of the intense storms that produce floods over the Italian peninsula. A goal of this project was the development of algorithms for the estimation of precipitation from satellite data and, consequently, of products that may be used for issuing <b>meteorological</b> <b>warnings</b> on the basis of satellite observations (Italian acronym: PROSA). The project, which is still running, is coordinated by Carlo Gavazzi Space which is responsible both for the system engineering/quality aspects and for the coordination of the pre-operational activities, while it is scientifically coordinated by the CNR-ISAC Institute which is responsible for the harmonization of the various products that are generated by the scientific partners. Specifically, these precipitation products are generated according to algorithms that are developed by CNR-ISAC and the Universities of Ferrara and Roma in collaboration with the international community, and that exploit the following satellites and instruments: - SSM/I, SSMIS, and AMSR-E conically-scanning microwave (MW) radiometers onboard low Earth orbit (LEO) DMSP and EOS-Aqua satellites; - AMSU-A and AMSU-B / MHS cross-track scanning MW radiometer couples onboard NOAA and MetOp LEO operational satellites; - SEVIRI visible-infrared (VIS-IR) imager onboard the European geosynchronous MSG satellite. The specific products of PROSA are: - Instantaneous precipitation rate at ground from MW radiometer observations, using both physical (Bayesian) and neural network (NN) algorithms; - Instantaneous precipitation at ground from combined MW/VIS-IR observations, using NN, blending and morphing algorithms; - Cumulated precipitation at ground using blending and morphing approaches; - Nowcasted precipitation at ground using hybrid and morphing approaches. While precipitation products are generated in a preoperational fashion, with a delay of few minutes to few hours from observation depending on product and satellite data access, the emphasis is on near-real-time applications – as requested by DPC.

40|$|On 19 January 2013 Portugal {{was once}} again on an extreme <b>meteorological</b> risk <b>warning</b> state due to the {{landfall}} of a rapidly deepening low pressure system exactly on the period of its maximum explosive development. This storm, named Gong, had a central minimum pressure of 968  hPa, observed wind gusts of 140  km h− 1 on some locations of the Portuguese coast and {{was responsible for the}} downfall of thousands of trees on some of the Portuguese national forests, the destruction of several hundred farms among other huge socioeconomic losses and fatalities. The large-scale synoptic conditions and dynamical characteristics of windstorm Gong, as well as the associated meteorological and socioeconomic adverse impacts are reviewed in this paper. For this purpose an objective lagrangean method, which identifies and follows individual lows, is applied for the assessment of the cyclone track and lifetime characteristics, which is complemented by the analysis of several thermohydrodynamical reanalysis fields during the lifetime of the cyclone. Results show that Gong underwent an explosive development with ‘bomb’ characteristics between the Azores and the Iberian Peninsula, with a deepening rate unusually high for these latitudes. The rapid deepening of Gong was supported by the southerly displacement of the polar jet stream; by a pronounced cyclonic potential vorticity streamer which approached Iberia from northwest; and by the presence of an atmospheric river over the western and central subtropical North Atlantic converging into Gong׳s genesis region and then crossing the Atlantic basin, moving along with the storm towards Iberia. Understanding the dynamics of these high impact extreme events may be of relevance in view of improving extreme forecasts as well as of public awareness, policy making and risk assessment and management of severe weather in Portugal...|$|R

40|$|Hydrological {{predictions}} in the UK {{are strongly}} influenced by both rainfall and antecedent soil conditions. The Flood Forecasting Centre (FFC) and Scottish Flood Forecasting Service (SFFS) operationally issue flood alerts and warnings, however these typically apply only days to weeks ahead. There was a desire to produce a more long-term (seasonal) forecast of the water situation for flooding and drought periods similar to that produced {{in countries such as}} the USA and Australia. The Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) along with a number of partners have developed a long-range hydrological forecast for the UK. The Hydrological Outlook UK (www. hydoutuk. net) is the first operational forecast system for the UK that delivers monthly outlooks of the water situation for both river flow and groundwater levels. It brings together information on current and forecast weather conditions, soil moisture, river flows and groundwater levels, and uses a number of modelling approaches to explore possible future hydrological conditions. It is based on merging three complementary methods: (i) a statistical method based on river flow analogues and persistence, (ii) a Streamflow Ensemble Prediction System applied to selected catchments and boreholes; and (iii) a national hydrological forecast driven by an ensemble of 1 and 3 month-ahead rainfall forecasts from the UK Met Office’s GloSea 5 model. Here we focus on the national scale hydrological forecasts, showing an example of the seasonal river flow forecasts and how they contribute to the Hydrological Outlooks UK monthly summary.

40|$|Half of the world's {{population}} lives within 60 km {{of the sea}} and this figure is likely to rise up to 75 % by the year 2025. The extraordinary development of the built environment and of the population densities in the coastal areas are making coastal communities highly exposed. The sea level rise induced by climate change is worsening this coastal vulnerability scenario and a considerable amount of people are expected to be susceptible to and threatened by coastal flooding in the near future. Given that {{the northern part of the}} Mediterranean coastal areas is location of critical infrastructure and buildings, it represents one of the most highly exposed coastal area in the world. Its shores are indeed characterized by high rate of population densities and economic activities that extremely increase the risk of facing impacts and losses subsequent to hydro-meteorological hazards. Considering the rising values of both occurrence and magnitude of storm-induced damages, adequate assessment and forecasting tools are needed in order to enhance the resilience of coastal systems and thus the capability to reduce disaster risks and cascading effects. In particular, thanks to more sophisticated and improved numerical tools, coastal observations and data collection, it is now possible to implement in a timely manner operational morphodynamic predictions able to reduce coastal risk linked to incoming storms. In this scenario, the Integrated COastal Alert SysTem (iCoast) project has been aimed at developing a tool able to address coastal risks caused by extreme waves and high sea water levels in European coastal areas. In the framework of iCoast, a set of Coastal State Indicators (CSIs) has been developed in order to improve the forecasting and the assessment of coastal risks. CSIs are indeed parameters able to provide end-users with an essential information about coastal hazards and related impacts. CSIs have been chosen as parameters that can be retrieved from the meteorological and the hydrodynamic modules. They include both physical variables used as trigger for <b>meteorological</b> and flood <b>warnings</b> from the majority of the operational National/Regional warning systems and further essential parameters, so called ‘storm integrated' coastal-storm indicators, which describe the physical processes that drive coastal damages, such as erosion, accumulation, flooding, destructions.

In such a way, it has been possible and easier to deliver, tailored and adapted alert messages in relation to the different end-users characteristics and requirements.
