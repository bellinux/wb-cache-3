40|$|AbstractTranslation {{should be}} done by {{considering}} the function of a text in the two languages. Verbs {{can be regarded as}} the main argument <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> because of their crucial function <b>in</b> the text. <b>Translation</b> of some verbs, like passives and unaccusatives, is more challenging since they require undergoing more changes to be transferred to the new language. This article tries to investigate the inherent challenge <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> of these verbs from English into Farsi by describing the strategies three Iranian translators used to provide Farsi equivalents for English passives and unaccusatives in Animal Farm written by George Orwell (1945). Moreover, to find complementary data, some extracted translations of these verbs were given to 36 readers in a questionnaire to grade them by considering their fluency, simplicity and acceptability. The questionnaire was designed to examine the effect of the translators’ decisions on the readers. The results of the study revealed that the translators used unaccusatives as the most frequent forms <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> of both verbs. And the results of the questionnaire indicated that the readers were inclined to read actives <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> of passives and unaccusatives <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> of unaccusatives. The researcher {{came to the conclusion that}} shifts were more common <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> of passives although change of verbs into other parts of speech (like phrases) was more common <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> of unaccusatives than passives. Also, based on the results obtained from the questionnaire, it was concluded that using actives <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> of passives and unaccusatives <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> of unaccusatives was more in concordance with Farsi grammar...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the cooperative control of multiple manipulators {{attached to the}} same base as they reposition a common payload. The theory is easily applied to inertially based problems as well as space based free-floating plat-forms. The system equations of motion are developed {{as well as a}} Lyapunov based controller which ensures stability. The closed chain aspect of the problem reduces the system’s degrees of freedom resulting in more actuators than degrees of freedom. This actuator redundancy is used to minimize a weighted norm of the actuator torques. A polynomial refer-ence trajectory describes the path the payload will follow. The disturbance torque transmitted to the spacecraft center-body by the motion of the manipulators is minimized by altering the order of the reference trajectory polynomial and its coefficients. Results from a two dimensional, dual arm configuration are included. Compared to the Lyapunov point controller alone, a fifth order polynomial reference tra-jectory leads to superior performance in terms of actuator torque magnitudes, spacecraft centerbody attitude control, and payload repositioning accuracy and time. An eighth order polynomial reference trajectory results in only mini-mal improvement over the fifth order case. A modified Lyapunov controller which approximates a PD controller produces results better than the Lyapunov point controller but not as good as either reference trajectory simulation. Space based robotics platforms experience conditions unlike those of their terrestrial counterparts. With respect to the dynamics of the systems, the most notable difference is the absence of a fixed base on which to locate the manipula-tors. The consequence of this difference is that motion of the space based manipulator transmits forces and moments to its <b>mounting</b> base resulting <b>in</b> <b>translation</b> and rotation of the base itself. ’- 2 Generally, this motion is unwanted because the attitude control subsystem of the vehicle mus...|$|R
