5|$|In the {{weighted}} maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph with weights on its vertices (or, less frequently, edges) and the output is a clique with <b>maximum</b> <b>total</b> weight. The maximum clique {{problem is the}} special case in which all weights are equal. As well as the problem of optimizing the sum of weights, other more complicated bicriterion optimization problems have also been studied.|$|E
5|$|In April, Pietraru {{met with}} the Provisional Government's Alexander Guchkov, and an {{agreement}} was reached regarding the <b>maximum</b> <b>total</b> of troops to be enlisted in the Romanian Corps. Answering to special pleas from Romanian Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu, Guchkov allowed for the recruitment of 30,000 prisoners in his custody. The order was revised by Alexander Kerensky, who reduced that number to 5,000 prisoners, noting that they were sorely needed as working hands in Russia's agriculture and industry. In practice, Quartermaster Ivan Pavlovich Romanovsky only allowed recruitment {{to take place in}} Moscow Military District, ordering that no more than 1,500 prisoners should be taken into account.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S. Virgin Islands, heavy {{rainfall}} associated with Otto shattered numerous records for October across the US Virgin Islands, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>total</b> of 21.52in (547mm) reported in Red Hook, Saint Tomas. The rain flooded roads and prompted officials opened shelters {{on all three}} islands on October6. In Saint Croix, a roadway section leading into Enfield Green collapsed, temporarily cutting the neighborhood off to traffic until a makeshift roadway was created the next day. In La Vallée, on the island's north shore, floods and landslides affected low-lying areas. Traffic on Saint Thomas and Saint John initially remained unhindered; however, as the rain continued for several days, flooding, rockslides and asphalt erosion forced authorities to close several roads and highways. Damage estimates from the storm reached $2million across the islands.|$|E

40|$|Maximum daily {{precipitation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important hydrometeorological characteristics. Its study in densely developed urban areas can have practical, as well as theoretical, significance, especially for environmental engineering. Indeed, this is where intensive rainfall events can result in drainage problems leading to waterlogging, flooding and potentially to large-scale infrastructural losses. The objective of this study is to determine the annual and multi-annual variability in <b>maximum</b> daily precipitation <b>totals</b> and its determinants in the atmospheric circulation. The two main sources used for the study include records of maximum precipitation spanning the period from 1863 to 2015 in Krakow and the catalogue of atmospheric circulation types over southern Poland by T. Niedźwiedź. Maximum annual and monthly daily precipitation totals were included. The study determined their share of the overall monthly and annual <b>totals.</b> The highest <b>maximum</b> daily precipitation <b>total</b> recorded during the study period was 99 mm (9 September 1963), which approximately corresponds to the exceedance probability of 0. 5 %. It contributed 58. 9 % to the monthly precipitation total and 12. 7 per cent to the annual total in that year. Maximum daily precipitation was recorded between March and November, and is most frequent in July at 27 %. As many as 98. 7 % of the <b>maximum</b> precipitation <b>totals</b> belonged to the "very high" category. The difference between the highest and lowest <b>maximum</b> precipitation <b>totals</b> was 82 mm. No significant trend was identified in the occurrence of <b>maximum</b> <b>totals</b> over the study period. <b>Maximum</b> <b>totals</b> concentrated predominantly on days with cyclonic circulation types, at 87 %, including 31 % per cent which occurred in the cyclonic trough...|$|R

5|$|Lay {{pleaded not}} guilty to the eleven {{criminal}} charges, and claimed that he was misled by those around him. He attributed the main cause for the company's demise to Fastow. Lay was convicted of all six counts of securities and wire fraud for which he had been tried, and he was subject to a <b>maximum</b> <b>total</b> sentence of 45 years in prison. However, before sentencing was scheduled, Lay died on July 5, 2006. At the time of his death, the SEC had been seeking more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines. The case of Lay's wife, Linda, is a difficult one. She sold roughly 500,000 shares of Enron ten minutes to thirty minutes before the information that Enron was collapsing went public on November 28, 2001. Linda was never charged with any of the events related to Enron.|$|E
5|$|Pyridoxine, {{also known}} as vitamin B6, {{can be used to}} {{counteract}} the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a <b>maximum</b> <b>total</b> of 15 to 30g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200mg daily.|$|E
5|$|The {{examination}} {{consists of}} six problems. Each problem is worth seven points, so the <b>maximum</b> <b>total</b> score is 42 points. No calculators are allowed. The examination is held over two consecutive days; each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. The problems chosen are from various areas {{of secondary school}} mathematics, broadly classifiable as geometry, number theory, algebra, and combinatorics. They require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis, and solutions are often short and elementary. However, they are usually disguised {{so as to make}} the solutions difficult. Prominently featured are algebraic inequalities, complex numbers, and construction-oriented geometrical problems, though in recent years the latter has not been as popular as before.|$|E

Structural requirements are specified to ensure that strength is not sacrificed by the need to get weight low down in the keel. Materials are specified plus numerous other details concerning all aspects of the boat. The intention is to challenge designers but ensure competitive racing.|$|E
25|$|While many {{algorithms}} {{reach an}} exact solution, approximation algorithms seek an approximation that {{is closer to}} the true solution. Approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the Knapsack problem. The Knapsack problem is a problem where there is a set of given items. The goal of the problem is to pack the knapsack to get the <b>maximum</b> <b>total</b> value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that we can carry is no more than some fixed number X. So, we must consider weights of items as well as their value.|$|E

The contract may also provide migrant detention support to other government organizations in the event of an immigration emergency, the company said.|$|E
