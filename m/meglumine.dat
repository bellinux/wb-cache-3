25|$|The {{intensity}} of medical management {{is dependent on}} the severity of the colic, its cause, and the financial capabilities of the owner. At the most basic level, analgesia and sedation is administered to the horse. The most commonly used analgesics for colic pain in horses are NSAIDs, such as flunixin <b>meglumine,</b> although opioids such as butorphanol may be used if the pain is more severe. Butrophanol is often given with alpha-2 agonists such as xylazine and detomidine to prolong the analgesic effects of the opioid. Early colic signs may be masked with the use of NSAIDs, so some practitioners prefer to examine the horse before they are given by the owner.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of adhesions {{begins with}} good {{surgical}} technique to minimize {{trauma to the}} tissue and thus reparative responses by the body. Several drugs and substances are {{used to try to}} prevent adhesion formation. Preoperative use of DMSO, a free radical scavenger, potassium penicillin, and flunixin <b>meglumine</b> may be given. The thick intestinal lubricant carboxymethylcellulose is often applied to the GI tract intraoperatively, to decrease trauma from handling by the surgeon and provide a physical barrier between the intestine and adjacent intestinal loops or abdominal organs. It has been shown to double the survival rate of horses, and its use is now a standard practice. Hyaluraonan {{can also be used to}} produce a physical barrier. Intraperitoneal unfractionated heparin is sometimes used, since it decreases fibrin formation and thus may decrease fibrinous adhesions. Omentectomy (removal of the omentum) is a quick, simple procedure that also greatly decreases the risk of adhesions, since the omentum is one organ that commonly adheres to the intestines. The abdomen is usually lavaged copiously before the abdomen is sutured closed, and anti-inflammatories are given postoperatively. A laparoscope may be used post-surgery to look for and break down adhesions, however there is risk of additional adhesions forming post-procedure. Encouraging motility post-surgery can also be useful, as it decreases the contact time between tissues. Adhesion-induced colic has a poor prognosis, with a 16% survival rate in one study.|$|E

50|$|The first {{treatment}} application against trypanosomiasis {{was tested}} in 1906, and the compound's use to treat other tropical diseases was researched. The treatment of leishmania with antimony potassium tartrate started in 1913.

After British physician John Brian Christopherson's discovery in 1918 that antimony potassium tartrate could cure schistosomiasis, the antimonial drugs became widely used. However, the injection of antimony potassium tartrate had severe side effects such as Adams-Stokes syndrome and therefore alternative substances were under investigation. With the introduction and subsequent larger use of praziquantel in the 1970s, the use of antimony based treatments fell out of use.|$|E

5000|$|Treatment for colitis-X {{usually does}} not save the horse. The {{prognosis}} is average to poor, and mortality is 90% to 100%. [...] However, treatments are available, and one famous horse that survived colitis-X was U.S. Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew, that survived colitis-X in 1978 {{and went on}} to race as a four-year-old.Large amounts of intravenous fluids are needed to counter the severe dehydration, and electrolyte replacement is often necessary. Flunixin <b>meglumine</b> (Banamine) may help block the effects of toxemia. Mortality rate has been theorized to fall to 75% if treatment is prompt and aggressive, including administration of not only fluids and electrolytes, but also blood plasma, anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs, and antibiotics. Preventing dehydration is extremely important. Nutrition is also important. Either parenteral or normal feeding can be used to support the stressed metabolism of the sick horse.

Here we present preclinical evidence that the sorbitol derivative <b>meglumine</b> (N-methyl-D-glucamine) can safely protect against several features of metabolic syndrome and diabetes, as well as elicit enhancement in muscle stamina. <b>Meglumine</b> is a compound routinely used as an approved excipient to improve drug absorption {{that has not been}} ascribed any direct biological effects in vivo. Normal mice (SV 129) administered 18 mM <b>meglumine</b> orally for six weeks did not display any gastrointestinal or other observable adverse effects, but had a marked effect on enhancing muscle stamina and at longer times in limiting weight gain. In the established KK.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, {{a simple and}} rapid method was {{developed}} to improve the inÂ vitro dissolution of repaglinide, an oral antidiabetic drug, {{which was based on}} addition of <b>meglumine</b> in 50 % (v/v) ethanol to dissolve repaglinide, and the drug dissolved in meglumine/ 50 % ethanol was used directly with a binder to prepare tablets. The mechanism of solubilization of repaglinide by <b>meglumine</b> was studied by using infrared spectrum (IR), ultraviolet (UV) measurement through dual wavelength, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction methods. Dissolution tests of repaglinide tablets were performed in the media with different pH values and the repaglinide concentrations were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method. The solubility data showed that with the <b>meglumine</b> concentration increasing, the solubility of repaglinide was increased. Meanwhile, tablets with the molar ratio of repaglinide and <b>meglumine</b> 1 : 2 (n/n) resulted in a significant increase in dissolution compared to the repaglinide tablets without using <b>meglumine,</b> and nearly equal to the commercial preparations of NovoNormÂ®, which concluded that <b>meglumine</b> had a great role in promoting the dissolution of repaglinide. The results of IR and UV dual wavelength methods suggested the formation of repaglinideâmeglumine (REPâMEG) molecular complex. DSC results showed that the melting peak of repaglinide disappeared in the REPâMEG coprecipitate, which indicated that repaglinide was stable when existing at amorphous or molecular state. The experiment of X-ray powder diffraction showed that with the solubilization of <b>meglumine,</b> the crystal diffraction peak of repaglinide disappeared, which further inferred that repaglinide was formed complexes with <b>meglumine.</b> It was demonstrated that the method of improving repaglinide with <b>meglumine</b> was reliable and could be suitable for repaglinide tablets production in industry.

40|$|The {{pentavalent}} antimonial (Sb 5 +) <b>meglumine</b> is {{the drug}} of choice {{for the treatment of}} cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Brazil. Although the cardiotoxicity of high-dose, long-term Sb 5 + therapy is well known, the use of low-dose, short-term <b>meglumine</b> has been considered to be safe and relatively free from significant cardiac effects. In order to investigate the cardiotoxicity of low-dose, short-term therapy with <b>meglumine</b> in cutaneous leishmaniasis, 62 CL patients treated with <b>meglumine</b> were studied. A standard ECG was obtained before and immediately after the first cycle of treatment (15 mg Sb 5 + kg- 1 day- 1). The electrocardiographic interpretation was carried out blindly by two investigators using the Minnesota Code. There {{were no significant differences in}} qualitative ECG variables before and after <b>meglumine</b> treatment. However, the corrected QT interval was clearly prolonged after antimonial therapy (420. 0 vs 429. 3 ms, P< 10 - 6).

This previously unrecognized cardiac toxicity induced by short-term, low-dose antimonial therapy has potentially important clinical implications.
