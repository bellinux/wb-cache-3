5000|$|Finally, it is {{necessary}} to tune the thermal coupling between the TES and the bath; a low thermal conductance {{is necessary}} to ensure that incident energy is seen by the TES rather than being lost directly to the bath. However, the thermal link must not be too weak, as {{it is necessary}} to cool the TES back to bath temperature after the energy has been absorbed. Two approaches to control the thermal link are by electron-phonon coupling and by <b>mechanical</b> <b>machining.</b> At cryogenic temperatures, the electron and phonon systems in a material can become only weakly coupled. The electron-phonon thermal conductance is strongly temperature-dependent, and hence the thermal conductance can be tuned by adjusting Tc.

The term single-point diamond turning (SPDT) is sometimes applied, although as with other lathe work, the [...] "single-point" [...] label is sometimes only nominal (radiused tool noses and contoured form tools being options). The process of diamond turning is widely used to manufacture high-quality aspheric optical elements from crystals, metals, acrylic, and other materials. Plastic optics are frequently molded using diamond turned mold inserts. Optical elements produced by the means of diamond turning are used in optical assemblies in telescopes, video projectors, missile guidance systems, lasers, scientific research instruments, and numerous other systems and devices. Most SPDT today is done with computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools. Diamonds also serve in other machining processes, such as milling, grinding, and honing. Diamond turned surfaces have a high specular brightness and require no additional polishing or buffing, unlike other conventionally machined surfaces ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In this {{experimental}} work, {{by using}} the method of plasma-chemical etching, we {{have dealt with the}} causes of the creation of a distorted layer on the surface of silicon wafers during <b>mechanical</b> <b>machining</b> processes, in addition, the elucidation of connections between the structure of this layer and characteristic parameters of the mechanical strength of these wafers have been studied. Experimental results obtained at room temperature show that after cutting and grinding processes, the mean value of mechanical strength σ, which is apparently independent of the types of conductivity, is significantly lower than its theoretical value. Analysis of the dependence of mechanical parameters on the time of plasma-chemical etching indicates that the lower values obtained for the mechanical strength of silicon wafers is basically due to the existence of a distorted layer and corresponding internal stresses created on the surface of these wafers after <b>mechanical</b> <b>machining.</b> Plasma-chemical etching leads to an increase in σ value. Dependency of σ on the etching time is qualitatively described by the microstructure of the distorted layer and parameters of the micro relief surface of the wafers. Correlation between parameters σ, H, K and the microstructure of the distorted layer allows us to suggest the method of plasma chemical etching as a method of investigating the microstructure of the distorted layer after the <b>mechanical</b> <b>machining</b> processes...|$|E

40|$|Nano {{patterns}} on single-crystal silicon are generally manufactured by photolithography, which can form limited cross-sectional shapes such as U-shapes or rectangular channels. Though V-shaped patterns {{are widely used}} in the optical industries because they concentrate light, they are challenging to manufacture by conventional photolithography. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>machining</b> is useful in manufacturing various kinds of cross-sectional shapes including V-shapes with various apex angles, but is hard to apply to single-crystal silicon due to its brittle fracture. Here we suggest a novel way of <b>mechanical</b> <b>machining</b> of single-crystal silicon that suppresses brittle fracture below the critical point (the ductile-brittle transition point) as determined by nano-scratch testing. We find that the first drop point of the cutting force corresponds to a critical point and define the critical forces as the thrust force and the cutting force at the critical point. The critical forces are varied by the applied force per unit length, which {{is the possibility that}} the cutting tool interacts with mechanically weak atomic bonds. When the applied force per unit length is zero (a general condition of <b>mechanical</b> <b>machining),</b> the cutting speed does not affect the variation of the critical forces or the quality of the machined pattern. Based on analysis of the experimental results, we suggest that the single-crystal silicon can be mechanically machined without brittle fracture at high cutting speed if the thrust force is smaller than the critical force of zero applied force per unit length. clos...|$|E
