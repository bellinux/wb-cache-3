25|$|The {{extrusion}} ratio {{is defined as}} the starting cross-sectional area divided by the cross-sectional area of the final extrusion. One of the <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> of the extrusion process is that this ratio can be very large while still producing quality parts.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} to using composite baseball bats. As has been chronicled in slow-pitch softball recently, composite bats have outperformed standard aluminum bats. There are five <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> for using composite bats: swing weight, trampoline effect, bending stiffness, bending vibrations, and sound.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the first}} power {{stations}} supplied direct current, {{the distribution of}} alternating current soon became the most favored option. The <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> of AC were {{that it could be}} transformed to high voltage to reduce transmission losses and that AC motors could easily run at constant speeds.|$|E

25|$|One of the <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> of {{hydrogen}} bond catalysis {{is the ability}} to construct catalysts that engage in multiple non-covalent interactions to promote the reaction. In addition to using hydrogen bond donors to activate or stabilize a reactive center during the reaction, it is possible to introduce other functional groups, such as Lewis bases, arenes, or addition hydrogen bonding sites to lend additional stabilization or to influence the other reactive partner.|$|E
25|$|Extrusion is {{a process}} used to create objects of a fixed {{cross-sectional}} profile. A material is pushed through a die of the desired cross-section. The two <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> of this process over other manufacturing processes are its ability to create very complex cross-sections, and to work materials that are brittle, because the material only encounters compressive and shear stresses. It also forms parts with an excellent surface finish.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> of the {{gravitational}} microlensing method {{are that it}} can detect low-mass planets (in principle down to Mars mass with future space projects such as WFIRST); it can detect planets in wide orbits comparable to Saturn and Uranus, which have orbital periods too long for the radial velocity or transit methods; and it can detect planets around very distant stars. When enough background stars can be observed with enough accuracy, then the method should eventually reveal how common Earth-like planets are in the galaxy.|$|E

25|$|One {{of these}} {{companies}} was the Bendix Corporation, who found the Dashaveyor concept and decided {{it would make the}} basis for a competitive AGT system. Its <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> in this role were its high speed and its ability to switch among a network of tracks. Most competing AGT systems operated at a fixed speed that was much lower than the Dashaveyor, and normally followed fixed routes. They purchased the company {{and turned it into a}} subsidiary, developing the AGT versions in Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Land-based and {{near-shore}} facilities offer three <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> {{over those}} located in deep water. Plants constructed {{on or near}} land do not require sophisticated mooring, lengthy power cables, or the more extensive maintenance associated with open-ocean environments. They can be installed in sheltered areas {{so that they are}} relatively safe from storms and heavy seas. Electricity, desalinated water, and cold, nutrient-rich seawater could be transmitted from near-shore facilities via trestle bridges or causeways. In addition, land-based or near-shore sites allow plants to operate with related industries such as mariculture or those that require desalinated water.|$|E
25|$|The {{total number}} of Serbian armed forces {{expected}} {{to take part in}} the military operation was about 60,000. King Milan I divided his force into two armies, the Nishava and Timok armies. The first took the main objective, i.e. to overcome the Bulgarian defences along the west border, to conquer Sofia and advance towards the Ihtiman heights. It was there that the army was supposed to encounter and crush the Bulgarian forces coming from the southeast. Serbia's <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> on paper were the better small arms and the highly educated commanders and soldiers, who had gained a great deal of experience from the last two wars against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

25|$|Bileaflet {{heart valves}} consist of two semicircular {{leaflets}} that rotate about struts {{attached to the}} valve housing. This design was introduced in 1979 and while {{they take care of}} {{some of the issues that}} were seen in the other models, bileaflets are vulnerable to backflow and so they cannot be considered as ideal. Bileaflet valves do, however, provide much more natural blood flow than caged-ball or tilting-disc implants. One of the <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> of these valves is that they are well tolerated by the body. Only a small amount of blood thinner is needed to be taken by the patient each day in order to prevent clotting of the blood when flowing through the valve.|$|E
25|$|Musculoskeletal imaging: PET {{has been}} shown to be a {{feasible}} technique for studying skeletal muscles during exercises like walking. One of the <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> of using PET is that it can also provide muscle activation data about deeper lying muscles such as the vastus intermedialis and the gluteus minimus, as compared to other muscle studying techniques like electromyography, which can be used only on superficial muscles (i.e., directly under the skin). A clear disadvantage, however, is that PET provides no timing information about muscle activation because it has to be measured after the exercise is completed. This is due to the time it takes for FDG to accumulate in the activated muscles.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} mini-mover procedure (3MP) is {{a technique}} used to correct pectus excavatum by using two magnets to realign the sternum {{with the rest of}} the chest and ribcage. One magnet is inserted 1cm into the patient's body on the lower end of the sternum, the other is placed externally onto a custom fitted brace. These two magnets generate around 0.04tesla (T) in order to slowly move the sternum outwards over a number of years. The maximum magnetic field that can be applied to the body safely is around 4T, making this technique safe from a magnetic viewpoint. The 3MP technique's <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> are that it is more cost-effective than major surgical approaches such as the Nuss procedure and it is considerably less painful postoperatively.|$|E

25|$|GPS {{compasses}} {{share the}} <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> of gyrocompasses. They determine true North, {{as opposed to}} magnetic North, and they are unaffected by perturbations of the Earth's magnetic field. Additionally, compared with gyrocompasses, they are much cheaper, they work better in polar regions, they are less prone {{to be affected by}} mechanical vibration, and they can be initialized far more quickly. However, they depend on the functioning of, and communication with, the GPS satellites, which might be disrupted by an electronic attack or by the effects of a severe solar storm. Gyrocompasses remain in use for military purposes (especially in submarines, where magnetic and GPS compasses are useless), but have been largely superseded by GPS compasses, with magnetic backups, in civilian contexts.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> {{that using}} microalgae as the {{feedstock}} {{when compared to}} more traditional crops {{is that it can}} be grown much more easily. Algae can be grown in land that would not be considered suitable for the growth of the regularly used crops. In addition to this, wastewater that would normally hinder plant growth {{has been shown to be}} very effective in growing algae. Because of this, algae can be grown without taking up arable land that would otherwise be used for producing food crops, and the better resources can be reserved for normal crop production. Microalgae also require fewer resources to grow and little attention is needed, allowing the growth and cultivation of algae to be a very passive process.|$|E
25|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) in Slovakia has increased dramatically. Cheap and skilled labor, a 19% flat tax rate for both businesses and individuals, no dividend taxes, a weak labor code, and a favorable geographical location are Slovakia's <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> for foreign investors. FDI inflow grew more than 600% from 2000 and cumulatively reached {{an all-time high}} of, $17.3 billion USD in 2006, or around $18,000 per capita {{by the end of}} 2006. The total inflow of FDI in 2006 was $2.54 billion. In October 2005 new investment stimuli introduced – more favorable conditions to IT and research centers, especially to be located in the east part of the country (where there is more unemployment), to bring more added value and not to be logistically demanding.|$|E

25|$|Although {{originally}} pioneered in the 1960s, dynamic linking did {{not reach}} operating systems used by consumers until the late 1980s. It was generally available in some form in most operating systems by the early 1990s. During this same period, object-oriented programming (OOP) was becoming {{a significant part of}} the programming landscape. OOP with runtime binding requires additional information that traditional libraries don't supply. In addition to the names and entry points of the code located within, they also require a list of the objects they depend on. This is a side-effect of one of OOP's <b>main</b> <b>advantages,</b> inheritance, which means that parts of the complete definition of any method may be in different places. This is more than simply listing that one library requires the services of another: in a true OOP system, the libraries themselves may not be known at compile time, and vary from system to system.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> of {{the grid}} plan was that it allowed the rapid {{subdivision}} and auction of a large parcel of land. For example, when the legislature of the Republic of Texas decided in 1839 to move the capital to a new site along the Colorado River, {{the functioning of the}} government required the rapid population of the town, which was named Austin. Charged with the task, Edwin Waller designed a fourteen-block grid that fronted the river on 640 acres (exactly 1 square mile; about 2.6 km²). After surveying the land, Waller organized the almost immediate sale of 306 lots, {{and by the end of}} the year the entire Texas government had arrived by oxcart at the new site. Apart from the speed of surveying advantage, the rationale at the time {{of the grid}}'s adoption in this and other cities remains obscure.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 {{the state}} was the 13th largest {{producer}} of natural gas in the United States, with a total annual production of 248 billion cu feet of gas. Today natural gas {{is the second most}} widely used energy source in California. About 45% is now burned in gas-fired plants for electricity generation; the proportion increases as coal-burning plants are phased out and nearly all new plants are powered by natural gas. One of the <b>main</b> <b>advantages</b> of natural gas is that it only produces about 55% as much CO2 as coal for the same amount of electricity produced. About 9% of the natural gas is used in facilitating the extraction of more oil and gas. Another 21% is used for residential space and water heating, cooking, clothes drying, etc.; 9% is used for commercial building and water heating, and 15% is used in industrial use. California imports about 85% of its natural gas, using six large gas pipelines from Texas, New Mexico and Canada.|$|E
