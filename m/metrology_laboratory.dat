According to the ISO 9001 standard all the certified companies should calibrate their measuring equipment.

However, a <b>metrology</b> <b>laboratory</b> is not required to hold an ISO 9001 certification or ISO 17025 accreditation. In this moment, there are companies that have metrology laboratories to conduct an internal check of their measuring equipment. These companies have their quality management systems (QMS) certified according to the ISO 9001 standard and so all its departments and sub-departments must also comply with the requirements of this standard. On the other hand there are companies with ISO 17025 accredited laboratories. Usually these companies are independent and his <b>metrology</b> <b>laboratory</b> is essentially to perform the calibration service to national companies who use their services to make the calibration of its measuring devices.
