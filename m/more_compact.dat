5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or <b>more</b> <b>compact</b> plants.|$|E

Before it began, production designer Anthony Ainsworth partly reconstructed the Grid set {{to give it}} more of a concrete, underground bunker, feel. Though more television series in the UK are adopting high-definition cameras, the Spooks producers decided to continue using hand held standard-definition ones, which were <b>more</b> <b>compact</b> and flexible; the producers felt that using high-definition cameras would sacrifice the filming style of the series. For instance, a hand held camera would allow the crew to film one long take following cast members through tight spaces, like an average London flat. High-definition cameras would lose that ability.|$|E

5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and <b>more</b> <b>compact</b> {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E

40|$|Reduced tillage is {{technically}} a challenging task in organic arable farming due to weeds but also concerning {{the destruction of}} grass-clover leys.

Nitrous oxide and methane fluxes were therefore monitored in a two-year period including a grass-clover ley, its destruction and winter wheat. Results are presented...|$|R

Corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured.

Considering that environmental temperature decreases as latitude increases and previous data has shown variation in thermal and feeding in this species, we specifically attempted to test the hypotheses that the shape of the head varies latitudinally including more extended shape in the north for your diet and <b>more</b> <b>compacted</b> shape the south.|$|R
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A <b>more</b> <b>compact</b> form {{can be obtained by}} pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, <b>more</b> <b>compact</b> size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|E
5|$|The main {{improvement}} in engine performance during the pre-dreadnought period {{came from the}} adoption of increasingly higher pressure steam from the boiler. Scotch marine boilers were superseded by <b>more</b> <b>compact</b> water-tube boilers, allowing higher-pressure steam to be produced with less fuel consumption. Water-tube boilers were also safer, with less risk of explosion, and more flexible than fire-tube types. The Belleville-type water-tube boiler had been introduced in the French fleet as early as 1879, but it took until 1894 for the Royal Navy to adopt it for armoured cruisers and pre-dreadnoughts; other water-tube boilers followed in navies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The planets were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} formed in or near their current orbits. However, this view underwent radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) is a promising tool that yields data useful {{for understanding the}} fine-scale density structure of partly lithified and tectonically deformed sediments. We conducted 21 CT scans of ODP Leg 131 sediments, including whole-round cores and thin-section chips, obtained from the toe of the Nankai accretionary prism. The samples range from highly deformed pieces from the frontal thrust and décollement to homogeneous and essentially undeformed sediments above the frontal thrust and beneath the décollement. In the CT images, kink-like deformation bands and faults are recognized as obvious bright seams, bands, or stripes with relatively high linear attenuation coefficients. The differences in linear attenuation coefficients relative to the matrix range from 0. 021 cm 2 /g (kink-like deformation band) to 0. 038 cm 2 /g (fault). These data suggest a 0. 10 g/cm 3 to 0. 18 g/cm 3 increase in bulk density within the deformation structures, and {{they appear to be}} 13 % and 33 % <b>more</b> <b>compacted</b> than the nondeformed matrix, respectively. In contrast to the samples from the frontal thrust zone, CT images of the décollement sample exhibit relatively homogeneous textures. The attenuation coefficient of the sample of the décollement indicates bulk density and porosity values of 2. 45 g/cm 3 and 18 %, respectively. The sample, hence, is approximately 50 % <b>more</b> <b>compacted</b> than the sediment outside the décollement zone...|$|R

5|$|A {{laboratory}} observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings (thirty-five and three, respectively) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds. Notable milestones included the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, begging, and preening began {{within the first}} six days of life. Variation in begging and <b>more</b> <b>compact</b> movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, and leaving the nest happened within seventeen days (nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days). Improvements of flight, walking and self-feeding took place within forty days. Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages, {{to the extent of}} one of two siblings living in the same area was likely killed by the other.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was <b>more</b> <b>compact</b> boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a <b>more</b> <b>compact</b> volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E
