40|$|In {{microscopic}} dimensions {{the soil}} {{is not just a}} mass, but a whole world. We are able {{to get an idea of}} what we know of this world if we think of it in terms of our world translated down to microscopic dimensions. ” Walter Kubiena, <b>Micropedology</b> (1938 : 6) “Micromorphological data…can provide inter-pretive material for the archaeologist…thereby adding a new breadth to the archaeological interpretation of a site. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Micropedology</b> {{contributes}} {{to provide a}} better understanding of soil processes. Technosol micromorphology may so improve the knowledge about the evolution and future management of such soils (Adderley et al., 2010). Large sources of technogenic substrates and diversity of soil processes justify the importance to identify anthropogenic microstructures and to specify their formation and evolution in terms of mineral weathering, organic matter degradation or aggregate formation. Such qualitative information may also be correlated to porosity quantification by images analysis of thin sections (Jangorzo et al., 2013). Here, we studied two contrasted Technosols: (1) a 10 - year constructed one for which we characterized the parent materials (paper mill sludge, green waste compost and thermally treated material) and the micromorphology at several different times after the set up of the soil (Séré et al. 2010) and (2) a 60 -year Technosol developing on iron industry deposits where a forest has established (Huot et al., 2014) for which thin sections of the different layers were morphologically characterized and some analysed by SEM-EDS. Regarding the specificity of the Technosol constituents (e. g. hydrophobicity, coarse texture), the preparation of soil thin sections has been adapted. Such various anthropogenic features as paper-mill sludge, thermally treated material, droplets or laminar structures of iron industry deposits were identified as specific microstructures. Biological activity was underlined by evidences of the progressive degradation of the organic matter brought by the constructed Technosol’s parent materials, but also by new associations formed with organic constituents coming from the spontaneous colonising plants. Organo-mineral associations were also described showing the aggregation genesis due to the impact of pedological factors. <b>Micropedology</b> has to be developed in the study of Technosol pedogenesis. It can so be considered as a relevant tool to study the evolution of man-made soils, as it is well-adapted to consider the diversity of the Technosol constituents, their large heterogeneous spatial localization and the specific intensity of soil processes...|$|E
30|$|Another {{unanswered}} {{question in}} soil biochemistry is {{the origin and}} location of enzyme activity in soil. It is generally accepted that the soil enzyme activity is predominantly extracellular, and therefore {{not directly related to}} the microbial metabolic activity; however, the induction and repression of the soil enzymatic activity upon the availability of organic substrates and end products, respectively has been often reported in the rhizosphere and bulk soil (e.g. [106, 107]). The increasing knowledge on the regulation of functional genes of soil-borne microorganisms may lead to construct whole-cell biosensors indicating the expression of gene coding for enzyme activities. For example, Schreiter et al. [111] inserted the lux gene under the control of promoter sequences of gene coding for the alkaline phosphatase into the two strains of the blue–green algae Synechococcus PCC 7942, expressing the enzyme under P-deficiency (M 1415) and under N-deficiency conditions (NblA- 2000). Whole-cell biosensors may also provide new evidences on the topological localization of microorganisms in the soil habitat, in relation to the availability of specific compounds. This may be achieved following the approaches of Møller et al. [88] and Leveau and Lindow [70] for the study of bacterial biofilms and epiphytic bacteria, respectively, coupled with <b>micropedology</b> based on the use of soil thin sections coupled with the use of biosensors expressing fluorescent proteins.|$|E
40|$|On Faial and Pico islands (Azores), {{we studied}} two {{profiles}} on basaltic pyroclasts that contain buried horizons, and we focussed on petrography, <b>micropedology</b> and mineralogy. Emphasis {{was given to}} weathering of the lapilli and ashes, and the neoformation of allophane. A combination of optical studies, in situ chemical analyses, X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy of clay fractions revealed that allophane is present both in the micromass of the groundmass, in alteromorphs after lapilli or pumice, and in clay coatings. Whereas most studies describe allophane as a colloidal fraction formed by the congruent and total dissolution of the ashes, this study shows evidence {{for the formation of}} allophane alteromorphs, due to leaching of Si and cations, with preservation of the original shapes of the tephra. The allophane alteromorphs often display optical characteristics that resemble those of palagonite. Increasing alteration is observed through three steps: (i) hydration of the glass associated with strong cation and Si leaching, (ii) allophane hypocoatings, and (iii) allophane alteromorphs with development of intragrain bridges. The chemical signature of the alteromorphs varies from a pure alumino-silicate at one extreme to an Fe(Ti) enriched alumino-silicate at the other. Between those two extremes, the colour grades from yellow to dark orange, with microzonations. An Al-rich allophane composition is associated with gibbsite in the EUR 6 -Pico profile, whereas {{at the base of the}} EUR 5 -Faial profile, Si-rich allophane is associated with halloysite. Some variations of the palaeo-environment are also suggested by strong iron segregation observed with various secondary phases (ferrihydrite, haematite, iddingsite) ...|$|E
40|$|Manipulative experiments-characterized by the {{comparing}} {{treatments to}} controls-are widespread in scientific investigations. This study uses experimental <b>micropedology</b> {{to investigate whether}} soil microbes precipitate carbonate if a liquid growth-medium is applied to soil in situ. This was undertaken using apparatuses designed to (1) obtain micromorphological images of biogenic carbonate on microscope slides, (2) to quantify carbonate formation in fiberglass cloths, and (3) to measure associated carbon-isotope fractionations. The apparatuses were buried and harvested at monthly intervals from December 2010 to June 2011. The study was conducted along an ecological transect in New Mexico, USA, at three sites: a low-elevation desert (C 3 shrubs), an intermediate-elevation steppe (C 4 grasses), and a high-elevation forest (C 3 conifers). In addition to comparing bioclimatic zones, the effect of parent material was also tested using paired limestone and igneous soils at each site. Microscope slides were analyzed with binocular, petrographic, and scanning electron microscopy equipped with an x-ray microanalyser (EDS), and the fiberglass traps were analyzed with x-ray diffraction and a mass spectrometer for carbon concentrations and isotope ratios. Naturally occurring calcified microbes were found at each site {{in the form of}} calcified hyphae, needle fiber, and calcified root hairs, {{with the exception of the}} forest site on igneous parent material. Liquid growth medium induced microbial calcification regardless of whether the vegetation was desert shrubs, grassland, or forest, and regardless of whether the parent material was igneous or limestone. Thus, the ability of soil microorganisms to biomineralize carbonate when supplied with liquid growth medium in situ is a phenomenon that crosses biomes and is not limited to microbes endemic to either limestone or igneous parent material...|$|E
40|$|Photography {{has been}} a welcome tool in documenting and {{conveying}} qualitative soil information. When coupled with image analysis software, the usefulness of digital cameras can be increased to advance the field of <b>micropedology.</b> The determination of a representative elementary area (REA) still remains a critical information need for soil scientists so that field measurements are independent of sample size and account for spatial heterogeneity. An objective {{of this study was}} to define and determine an REA for Low Chroma and High Chroma soil redoximorphic features (SRFs) present in claypan soils of northeastern Missouri, USA using a digital camera and image classification techniques. An additional objective was to examine REA differences between these two SRF types, soil depths, and landscape positions to highlight sampling considerations when quantifying SRFs in the field. Three metrics were chosen to quantify SRF heterogeneity, including percent occurrence, mean Euclidean distance, and the Interspersion/Juxtaposition Index. The relative change in these metrics was determined for 16 image sizes ranging from 2. 5 cm 2 to 40 cm 2 and used to identify an REA. Results showed REAs (mean±SE) for Low Chroma (17. 7 cm 2 ± 0. 4) and High Chroma (25. 4 cm 2 ± 0. 7) were significantly different (α= 0. 05). Further review of REAs indicated large sampling diameters (3 ̆e 8 cm) are necessary to simultaneously capture REAs of Low Chroma and High Chroma SRFs. When SRFs were considered separately, a ≥ 5 cm diameter core is recommended to reach an REA for Low Chroma, allowing accurate quantification for soil classification purposes and hydric soil determinations. Federal and state agencies requiring quantifiable SRF measures for land management decisions may greatly benefit from determining these minimum measurement scales, ensuring appropriate data collection methods in the future...|$|E
