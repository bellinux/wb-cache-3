25|$|Desktop video <b>magnifiers</b> are {{electronic}} devices that use {{a camera and}} a display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials. They enlarge printed pages for those with low vision. A camera connects to a monitor that displays real-time images, and the user can control settings such as magnification, focus, contrast, underlining, highlighting, and other screen preferences. They {{come in a variety}} of sizes and styles; some are small and portable with handheld cameras, while others are much larger and mounted on a fixed stand.|$|E

Prior to Windows Vista, <b>Magnifier</b> could be used to magnify the screen up to 9 times its normal size. Windows Vista and later allow up to 16Ã— magnification.|$|R

2500|$|A screen {{magnifier}} is {{software that}} interfaces with a computer's graphical output to present enlarged screen content.

After the user loads the software into their computer's memory, {{it serves as a}} kind of [...] "computer magnifying glass." [...] Wherever the computer cursor moves, it enlarges the area around it. This allows greater computer accessibility {{for a wide range of}} visual abilities.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} an evidence-based <b>magnifier</b> training on viewing behavior in visually impaired children aged 3 to 6 (1 / 2) years. METHODS: Effects of a training with a stand <b>magnifier</b> were evaluated by analyzing recordings of 21 visually impaired children, obtained from a miniature camera mounted in the <b>magnifier.</b> In a pre-test, post-test design, 11 of the children trained without <b>magnifier</b> and 10 children trained with <b>magnifier.</b> Three measures were compared from pre- to post-test assessment: 1) observation time in seconds through the <b>magnifier</b> during task performance; 2) the eye that was used during task performance with the <b>magnifier</b> (right eye/left eye as recorded by the camera); and 3) the self-chosen eye-to-chart distance (in cm) in near visual acuity measurement. RESULTS: Three important changes were found by analyzing the eye-camera recordings: (1) There was a significant shift in average observation time (i. e., the duration of looking through the <b>magnifier</b> in a single glance), before and after training. In the pre-test children used less than 10 s for a glance through the <b>magnifier,</b> whereas in the post-test this was 10 - 30 s. (2) In 5 children there was no preference {{with respect to the}} number of glances through the <b>magnifier</b> with right or left eye during pre-test measurement. However, such a task-specific dominance was clearly observed in this subgroup after training (post-test measurement). (3) The eye-to-chart distance, as measured during near-vision testing with LH-single and LH-line test, decreased significantly over the training period (from 9. 5 cm to 7. 9 cm, pre- to post-test). There were no differences in the outcome measures between the with-magnifier and without-magnifier training groups. We can conclude that (1) the <b>magnifier</b> training had a positive effect on viewing behavior and the development of dominance, and (2) camera observations provide valuable data on children's viewing behavior...|$|R

60|$|I have no {{intention}} of taking the reader with me through college, where I remained the usual term of four years. These four years were not idled away, as sometimes happens, but were fairly improved. I read all of the New Testament, in Greek; several of Cicero's Orations; every line of Horace, Satires and Odes; four books of the Iliad; Tully de Oratore, throughout; besides paying proper attention to geography, mathematics, and other of the usual branches. Moral philosophy, in particular, was closely attended to, senior year, as well as Astronomy. We had a telescope that showed us all four of Jupiter's moons. In other respects, Nassau might be called the seat of learning. One of our class purchased a second-hand copy of Euripides, in town, and we had it in college all of six months; though it was never my good fortune to see it, as the young man who owned it, was not much disposed to let profane eyes view his treasure. Nevertheless, I am certain the copy of the work was in college; and we took good care to let the Yale men hear of it more than once. I do not believe they ever saw even the outside of an Euripides. As for the telescope, I can testify of my own knowledge; having seen the moons of Jupiter as often as ten times, with my own eyes, aided by its <b>magnifiers.</b> We had a tutor who was expert among the stars, and who, it was generally believed, {{would have been able to}} see the ring of Saturn, could be have found the planet; which, as it turned out, he was unable to do.|$|E

60|$|There is scarcely, perhaps, a {{spectacle}} {{on the surface}} of the globe more remarkable, either in a geological or picturesque point of view than that presented by the petrified forest, near Cairo. The traveller, having passed the tombs of the caliphs, just beyond the gates of the city, proceeds to the southward, nearly at right angles to the road across the desert to Suez, and after having travelled some ten miles up a low barren valley, covered with sand, gravel, and sea shells, fresh as if the tide had retired but yesterday, crosses a low range of sandhills, which has for some distance run parallel to his path. The scene now presented to him is beyond conception singular and desolate. A mass of fragments of trees, all converted into stone, and when struck by his horse's hoof ringing like cast iron, is seen to extend itself for miles and miles around him, in the form of a decayed and prostrate forest. The wood is of a dark brown hue, but retains its form in perfection, the pieces being from one to fifteen feet in length, and from half a foot to three feet in thickness, strewed so closely together, as far as the eye can reach, that an Egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way through amongst them, and so natural that, were it in Scotland or Ireland, it might pass without remark for some enormous drained bog, on which the exhumed trees lay rotting in the sun. The roots and rudiments of the branches are, in many cases, nearly perfect, and in some the worm-holes eaten under the bark are readily recognizable. The most delicate of the sap vessels, and all the finer portions of the centre of the wood, are perfectly entire, and bear to be examined with the strongest <b>magnifiers.</b> The whole are so thoroughly silicified as to scratch glass and are capable of receiving the highest polish.-- Asiatic Magazine.|$|E
