Khatana is now his manager, but fails to control him, and Jordan is constantly involved in fights with the media and fans. Inspite of all this, he remains a highly popular artist.|$|E

Kaylor refuses, but is killed by the Bearded <b>Man.</b> <b>After</b> hearing of Kaylor's disappearance, Reyes theorizes that Fassl's piety and his unwillingness to acknowledge his darker half has given him the unwanted ability to physically change into another, more violent person.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the fall {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note. Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another <b>man</b> <b>after</b> Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying.|$|E
5|$|Australia batted {{and passed}} England's total {{on the first}} afternoon. Tallon came in to bat {{on the second day}} with the score at 7/332, joining opener Morris, who had already passed 150. It took a run out to remove Morris; he {{attempted}} a quick run to third <b>man</b> <b>after</b> being called through by Tallon but was not quick enough for the substitute fielder's arm, leaving Australia at 8/359. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Doug Ring, before both were out on 389, ending Australia's innings. In the second innings, Tallon caught Hutton from Miller and conceded nine byes as England were dismissed for 188 and lost by an innings, sealing a 40 series victory for Australia.|$|E

5|$|Hsin {{wins the}} lottery, but selects the tile {{representing}} his heart. Chao {{comes in and}} tries to persuade one of the game's organisers to let Hsin live but to no avail, causing Chao to knock over {{the table with the}} vases, which reveals the lottery to be fixed. Chao then storms in the room where the surgery on Hsin is about to be carried out and fires at the Hard Faced <b>Man,</b> <b>after</b> which the agents come in and arrest them all, including Chao for covering the existence of the game. They interrogate the Hard Faced Man, but because no one who participated will testify against him, it is unlikely he will be prosecuted. Hsin is brought to the hospital and his daughter is placed on an organ donor list. Chao mysteriously disappears, awakening in a crematorium oven before he is burned alive.|$|E
