On January 23, 2012, Hill announced that filming had concluded. Multiple scene takes were made, allowing the cast to follow the script as written and inject their own improvisations. Special effects company Legacy Effects provided creature designs and effects for the aliens. The alien costume featured an animatronic head, remotely controlled by three people. The suit was hot even in cold areas, and had to be unzipped to let Doug Jones cool off between takes. The costume was enhanced with CGI in a number of ways, including replacing arms and dilating pupils (which Schaffer thought made the creature seem <b>more</b> <b>alive).</b>|$|E

The chasm between Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers.

500|$|Other reviews echoed {{complaints}} about the similarity of Blue Shift to previous games. GameSpy's reviewer Jamie Madigan stated that [...] "what really pulls the game down is the 'more of the same' factor". Although writing that the game [...] "feels like {{just a few more}} levels for the original game", he noted that this is what Blue Shift was designed to be, given its origins as an add-on for a Dreamcast version of Half-Life. Madigan described the single-player campaign as [...] "decent" [...] and commented that the High Definition pack made the game [...] "worthy of consideration". Eurogamer echoed criticism on the game's length; reviewer Tom Bradwell commented that [...] "although I'm hard pressed to criticize what you get, the complete absence of everything we've learnt from the likes of Counter-Strike and everything since is frankly bizarre". Bradwell did, however, criticize the game's artificial intelligence and the occasional bug that caused a player to get stuck on a wall. PC Zones Mark Hill was more lenient in his comments, praising the game's artificial intelligence as [...] "intelligent as you could hope an AI enemy to be". In addition, Hill praised the game for showing more activity in the base, noting that [...] "a whole world goes on around you, with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry. The complex is <b>more</b> <b>alive</b> than ever before". Hill also praised the focus [...] "on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than the two or three models that were cloned throughout the facility who kept repeating the same phrases", describing this as Blue Shifts [...] "greatest achievement". PC Zones review closed by commenting that [...] "as a Dreamcast extra it works perfectly, but as a standalone PC title there's not nearly enough to it." ...|$|E

[...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Cars made me want to hop in my jalopy and to head out to Route 66, bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the Mother Road redundant." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie's young audience -- Cars finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Cars might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it." [...] Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it's a Pixar film, right? And they're always worth a gander no matter what anyone says." ...|$|E

500|$|Keats's {{use of the}} odal hymn in his six odes, {{along with}} {{his use of the}} odal hymn with a responsal voice in [...] "Ode to a Grecian Urn" [...] and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale", created, {{according}} to Walter Jackson Bate, [...] "a new tone for the English lyric." [...] Bate, when speaking about the 1819 odes, wrote: [...] "The productivity of the three and a half weeks that begins on April 21 is difficult to parallel in the career of any modern writer. Yet to Keats it was not even a new beginning. It was rather a matter of becoming <b>more</b> <b>alive</b> in preparation for the next beginning." [...] In addition to this, Bate argued that [...] "It is because [...] "To Autumn" [...] is so uniquely a distillation, and at many different levels, that each generation has found {{it one of the most}} nearly perfect poems in English. We need not be afraid of continuing to use the adjective [...] The 'Ode to a Nightingale,' for example, is a less 'perfect' though a greater poem." [...] Charles Patterson argued the relationship of [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] as the greatest 1819 ode of Keats, [...] "The meaningfulness and range of the poem, along with its controlled execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats's great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of [...] "To Autumn" [...] but is much superior in these qualities to the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom." [...] Later, Ayumi Mizukoshi argued that early audiences did not support [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] because it [...] "turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] drew neither attention nor admiration. Herbert Grierson believed [...] "Nightingale" [...] to be superior to the other odes because it and [...] "To Autumn" [...] were more logical and contained stronger arguments. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richard Bailey {{wrote that}} Summerhill {{received}} {{most of its}} public attention in the 1920s to 1930s and in the 1960s to 1970s, which were milieux of social change (progressivism and the counterculture, respectively). Neill was known in British education circles by the 1920s and was [...] "probably Britain's first educational celebrity" [...] in the 1930s, though he was not driven by his reception. Journal reviews called Neill [...] "the most popular writer on education today" [...] and said of his works, [...] "Nearly all the <b>more</b> <b>alive</b> and up-to-date teachers in Britain have read and argued about his notions". He was known via his books as a figure in the new psychoanalysis. The accessible 1960 Summerhill crowned Neill {{the leader of a}} new avant-garde education and he became symbolic of the rebel decade.|$|E
2500|$|After {{these three}} novels, Beckett {{struggled}} {{for many years}} to produce a sustained work of prose, a struggle evidenced by the brief [...] "stories" [...] later collected as Texts for Nothing. In the late 1950s, however, he created one of his most radical prose works, Comment c'est (1961; How It Is. An early variant version of Comment c'est, L'Image, was published in the British arts review, [...] (1959), and is the first appearance of the novel in any form.). This work relates the adventures of an unnamed narrator crawling through the mud while dragging a sack of canned food. It was written as a sequence of unpunctuated paragraphs in a style approaching telegraphese: [...] "You are there somewhere alive somewhere vast stretch of time then it's over you are there no <b>more</b> <b>alive</b> no more than again you are there again alive again it wasn't over an error you begin again all over more or less in the same place or in another as when another image above in the light you come to in hospital in the dark" [...] Following this work, it was almost another decade before Beckett produced a work of non-dramatic prose. How It Is is generally considered to mark the end of his middle period as a writer.|$|E

2500|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{noted in}} his {{autobiography}} that his first encounter {{with the idea of}} nonviolent resistance was reading [...] "On Civil Disobedience" [...] in 1944 while attending Morehouse College. He wrote in his autobiography that it was, Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are <b>more</b> <b>alive</b> than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.|$|E
