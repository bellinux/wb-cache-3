According to him, they intentionally gave him one point less than the eventual winner at the Madras Nationals, and this ruled {{him out of the}} Olympics. He did not bow down to corrupt officialdom and appealed to Maharaja of Patiala seeking justice. Fortunately the Maharaja of Patiala loved sports, saw his point, and arranged his entry in Olympic trials where he floored his opponent and won an entry in the Olympics. For the 1952 Games he and his family went around the village begging for contributions to enable him to flirt with destiny.Barrister Balasaheb Khardekar, principal of the Rajaram College, where Jadhav studied, mortgaged his home for Rs 7,000 with the Maratha Bank in Kolhapur, to send his former student to the Olympics. Despite repeated requests to Morarji Desai, the then Chief Minister of Mumbai State for a financial aid of only Rs 4000, there was no help forthcoming from any quarter."He would have easily won the gold at Helsinki," [...] said Sampatrao Jadhav, his cousin who was with Khashababhau when he left for Helsinki to compete in the bantamweight category."It was difficult for him to adjust to the <b>mat</b> <b>surface.</b> After two rolling fouls he missed out on the gold medal which was his for the taking. (The gold was won by Japan's Ishii Shobachi while Russia's Rashid Mamedekov clinched the silver.) Moreover, there was no interval between the two bouts and to fight with two world class wrestlers without appropriate rest was more than a Herculean effort," [...] added Sampatrao. But an Olympic medal is an Olympic medal. And a first is always special. The victory procession at the Karad railway station was a see-it-to-believe scene recalls Sampatrao." [...] A 151 bullock cart procession accompanied by deafening beats of 'dhols'- (drums) right from the outskirts of Goleshwar to the Mahadeva temple which is normally a 15 minute walk took seven long hours that day and no one was complaining.

40|$|Algae require {{dissolved}} {{nutrients to}} grow, but nutrient concentrations are often {{very low in}} unpolluted streams and rivers. The supply of dissolved nutrients to benthic (bottom-dwelling) algae increases with increasing river flow, but higher flows also produce drag forces that can damage the algae. To persist under high-flow, low-nutrient conditions, benthic algae must balance the conflicting requirements of minimal drag (to minimize detachment risks) and maximal exposure to turbulent flow (to maximize nutrient supplies). We explored flow-algae interactions using the freshwater alga Didymosphenia geminata. D. geminata forms dense mats in swift, nutrient-poor rivers, and {{is of particular interest}} because it is a highly invasive species in North American and New Zealand. To identify the properties that help D. geminata grow rapidly and resist detachment, we transplanted cobbles with attached D. geminata mats from a river to a laboratory flow chamber and measured flow properties above and within the mats. We then removed the mats from the cobbles and repeated the measurements. We found that water flow near the streambed is strongly altered in the presence of D. geminata mats. The dense, interwoven D. geminata stalks produce high friction and reduce flow fluctuations around and within the mats. The reduction in flow fluctuations around mats may reduce the risk of detachment and help retain dissolved nutrients within mats. We also found that D. geminata mats increase the roughness of riverbeds relative to bare cobbles, which may increase the rate of nutrient supply from the water to <b>mat</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Benthic autotrophs in oligotrophic rivers must adapt to and modify their hydrodynamic environment to balance the conflicting requirements of minimal drag (to minimize detachment risks) and maximal exposure to turbulent flow (to maximize nutrient acquisition). We explored flow–organism interactions using the benthic, freshwater alga Didymosphenia geminata. D. geminata forms large mats in swift, oligotrophic alluvial rivers. The physical properties that allow D. geminata to resist detachment and proliferate under these harsh conditions are unknown. We transplanted cobbles with attached D. geminata mats from a riverbed to a flume and used velocimetry and microelectrode profiling to measure hydrodynamic and transport conditions above and within the mats over a wide range of flows. We then removed the mats from the cobbles and repeated the velocimetry measurements. Experiment results indicated that D. geminata mats reduce form-induced stresses and near-bed turbulent velocity fluctuations, which may reduce the risk of detachment. D. geminata mats also increase turbulent shear stress just above <b>mat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which may enhance water column–mat solute exchange. High friction associated with flow at <b>mat</b> <b>surfaces</b> leads to very low velocities and predominantly diffusive transport within mats, which may in turn favor the retention of solutes derived from organic matter within and below mats. Enhanced mass transfer at <b>mat</b> <b>surfaces</b> and effective solute retention in mat matrices suggest a mechanism by which D. geminata cells acquire nutrients from different sources: advection-dominated transport of water-column nutrients to cells at <b>mat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and diffusion-dominated transport from decomposing organic matter within mats, with minimal advective losses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{stretch of}} the modern hypersaline coastal plain of the Gulf of Cambay was chosen to examine the {{distribution}} of the microbial mat-related structures (MRS) on siliciclastic sediments in the intertidal and supratidal zones. The abundance of MRS increases from the lower intertidal zone to the upper supratidal zone while the type of MRS records a systematic change. While the lower intertidal zone exhibits wrinkle structures, sieve-like surfaces and patchy ripples in places, the upper intertidal zone exhibits diverse MRS related to reduced current activity on the mat layer and intermittent exposure. MRS in the upper intertidal zone include wrinkle structures, sieve-like surfaces, gas domes, reticulated surfaces, multi-directional ripples, patchy ripples, rolled-up mat fragments, setulfs and occasional petee ridges and cracked <b>mat</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The lower supratidal zone is characterized by increased occurrence of petee ridges, gas domes and cracked <b>mat</b> <b>surfaces</b> compared to the upper intertidal zone. The upper supratidal zone is distinguished by the presence of abundant cracked <b>mat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> petee ridges, gas domes and wrinkle structures. The presence of cm-scale, disc-shaped microbial colonies (DMC) with a variety of internal structures is a unique feature of the Gulf of Cambay study area. While wrinkle structures occur in all the coastal zones, setulfs occur close to the boundary between the upper intertidal and lower supratidal zones. An attempt has been made to compare the distribution of MRS in this modern environment with those in the ~ 1. 6 Ga Chorhat Sandstone of the Vindhyan Supergroup for high-resolution palaeoenvironmental interpretation. The upper part of the intertidal segment of the Chorhat Sandstone is distinguished from its lower part by the presence of abundant cracked <b>mat</b> <b>surfaces,</b> petee ridges and gas domes in the former, while wrinkle structures, Kinneyia, rolled-up mat fragments, patchy ripples and multi-directional ripples are equally abundant in both parts. The lower part of the intertidal segment of the Chorhat Sandstone is thus analogous to the upper intertidal zone of the modern Gulf of Cambay environment, while {{the upper part of the}} Chorhat intertidal segment reflects prolonged exposure close to the high tide line. The bottom-most part of the intertidal segment of the Chorhat Sandstone with fewer MRS corresponds to the lower intertidal zone at Cambay. Inferred disc-shaped microbial fossils within Vindhyan sandstones are analogous to the DMC found in the modern environment and these features do not have any biostratigraphic implication...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCoastal {{photosynthetic}} microbial mats {{are highly}} structured microbial communities that populate {{a variety of}} shallow environments such as estuaries, sheltered sandy beaches, intertidal flats, salt marshes and hypersaline salterns. In soft sediments, most of these microbial mats are formed of vertically stratified, multicolored cohesive thin layers, of several functional groups of microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria, colorless sulfur bacteria, purple sulfur bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria, distributed along vertical microgradients of oxygen, sulfide and light. These microbial communities are highly productive and significant contributors to carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycles and to sediment stability in shallow-water habitats. Many examples of these communities have been cited in the past, but comparatively few microbial mats have been presented for which mass developments of anoxygenic purple bacteria have been observed. Yet, application of molecular approaches has provided fresh insight into the ecology, diversity and evolution of microbial mats. In situ measurements using electrochemical and optical microprobes led to detailed characterization of their physical and chemical environment, whereas reflectance measurements revealed the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of microbial <b>mat</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We hereby report the main discoveries due to introduction of these powerful techniques and we point out the potential insight {{to be gained from}} the study of anoxygenic purple bacterial mats...|$|R

Active precipitations of minerals often occur around these spatially arranged communities, forming rough, conical or domal surfaces.

Despite decades of investigation, the formation mechanisms of these shapes remain vaguely explained.

Short-term variations and depth distribution were investigated for carbohydrates (water-soluble and water-insoluble carbohydrates), beta-glucosidase activity and heterotrophic bacterial production and abundance. The major differences between mat patches and eroded patches were confined to the upper 6 mm, From 6 to 20 mm depth variables in mat patches and eroded patches were roughly comparable, with the exception of the bacterial abundance and beta-glucosidase activity. Distinct increases in carbohydrates, bacterial production and abundance during tidal flat exposure were most pronounced in the <b>mat</b> <b>surface</b> layer, but were still detectable in the eroded patches for the different carbohydrate fractions. Concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrates were substantially higher in mars than in eroded patches, This concurred with a much higher bacterial production and abundance in mats than in eroded patches. The beta-glucosidase activity in the <b>mat</b> <b>surface</b> was low compared to this activity in eroded patches. In diatom mats, beta-glucosidase showed highest activities between 6 and 12 mm, while in eroded patches this maximum occurred at 0 - 2 mm, Patterns suggest inhibition of the beta-glucosidase activity at high concentrations of water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations and a release of inhibition with declining carbohydrate concentrations. Interestingly, concentrations of water-insoluble carbohydrates (EDTA-extracted carbohydrates) did neither clearly differ between mat patches and eroded patches, nor changed substantially with depth. The observation that water-insoluble carbohydrate-to-chl-a ratios were higher outside the mat layer than in the mat, which has a larger stability than eroded patches, indicates that it is a poor index for sediment erodibility. The same holds true for water- soluble carbohydrate concentrations. [KEYWORDS: Deep-sea sediments; cohesive sediments; epipelic diatoms; chlorophyll; erodibility; rates...|$|E
