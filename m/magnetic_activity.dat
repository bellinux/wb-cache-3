5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{classified}} as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> that move {{into and out of}} the line of sight as it rotates. Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2days, which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity.</b> Photometry has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing differential rotation i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high latitude. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a variable star, but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle. This is an 11-year oscillation in sunspot number. Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the center}} of the Sun is the core region, a volume of {{sufficient}} temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> that generates sunspots.|$|E
40|$|Results of {{statistical}} studies so far made hitherto on the auroral ovals {{in the northern}} and southern hemispheres are reviewed. Then, a same analysis method is applied on both northern and southern optical auroras to identify the auroral ovals as a function of <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities.</b> The result shows that a good geomagnetically conjugate relationship of the auroral oval is established. In the end, the configurations of the northern auroral oval at different universal times for different <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities</b> are projected along the real magnetic field lines onto the southern hemisphere surface...|$|R
30|$|The Kp {{index and}} the Dst index are stable and quiet on days 225 and 226 before the earthquake, which {{suggests}} that the anomalous TEC enhancement around the epicenter 3 days before the earthquake is unlikely to be related to space weather changes and/or <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities.</b> However, it is difficult to confirm that the chance of the anomaly on day 226 not associated with the 17 August, 1999, earthquake. Kp index and Dst index are not stable and quiet on day 227 and later before the earthquake, {{which suggests that}} the anomalous TEC enhancement around the epicenter a day before the earthquake {{is more likely to be}} related to space weather changes and or <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|R
40|$|The light {{curves of}} solar-type stars present both {{periodic}} fluctuation and flare spikes. The gradual periodic fluctuation is {{interpreted as the}} rotational modulation of magnetic features on the stellar surface and is used to deduce <b>magnetic</b> feature <b>activity</b> properties. The flare spikes in light curves are used to derive flare activity properties. In this paper, we analyze the light-curve data of three solar-type stars (KIC 6034120, KIC 3118883, and KIC 10528093) observed with Kepler space telescope and investigate the relationship between their <b>magnetic</b> feature <b>activities</b> and flare activities. The analysis shows that: (1) Both the <b>magnetic</b> feature <b>activity</b> and the flare activity exhibit long-term variations as the Sun does; (2) Unlike the Sun, the long-term variations of <b>magnetic</b> feature <b>activity</b> and flare activity are not in phase with each other; (3) The analysis of star KIC 6034120 shows that the long-term variations of <b>magnetic</b> feature <b>activity</b> and flare activity has a similar cycle length. Our analysis and {{results indicate that the}} magnetic features that dominate the rotational modulation and flares possibly have different source regions, although they may be influenced by the magnetic field generated through a same dynamo process.

5|$|In 1987, the {{detection}} of an orbiting planetary object was announced by Bruce Campbell, Gordon Walker and Stephenson Yang. From 1980 to 2000, a team of astronomers led by Artie P. Hatzes made radial velocity observations of Epsilon Eridani, measuring the Doppler shift of the star {{along the line of}} sight. They found evidence of a planet orbiting the star with a period of about seven years. Although there is a high level of noise in the radial velocity data due to <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> in its photosphere, any periodicity caused by this <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> is expected to show a strong correlation with variations in emission lines of ionized calcium (the Ca II H and K lines). Because no such correlation was found, a planetary companion was deemed the most likely cause. This discovery was supported by astrometric measurements of Epsilon Eridani made between 2001 and 2003 with the Hubble Space Telescope, which showed evidence for gravitational perturbation of Epsilon Eridani by a planet.|$|E
5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the rotation rate of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, astronomers using {{computer}} simulations speculated {{that even if}} Betelgeuse is not rotating it might exhibit large-scale <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> in its extended atmosphere, a factor where even moderately strong fields could have a meaningful influence over the star's dust, wind and mass-loss properties. A series of spectropolarimetric observations obtained in 2010 with the Bernard Lyot Telescope at Pic du Midi Observatory revealed {{the presence of a}} weak magnetic field at the surface of Betelgeuse, suggesting that the giant convective motions of supergiant stars are able to trigger the onset of a small-scale dynamo effect.|$|E

40|$|Magnetars {{and many}} of the magnetar-related objects are {{summarized}} together and discussed. It is shown that there is an abuse of language in the use of "magnetar". Anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma-ray repeaters are well-known magnetar candidates. The current so called anti-magnetar (for central compact objects), accreting magnetar (for superslow X-ray pulsars in high mass X-ray binaries), and millisecond magnetar (for the central engine of some gamma-ray bursts), they may not be real magnetars in present understandings. Their observational behaviors are not caused by the magnetic energy. Many of them are just neutron stars with strong surface dipole field. A neutron star plus strong dipole field is not a magnetar. The characteristic parameters of the neutron stars for the central engine of some gamma-ray bursts are atypical from the neutron stars in the Galaxy. Possible signature of <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities</b> in accreting systems are discussed, including repeated bursts and a hard X-ray tail. China's future hard X-ray modulation telescope may contribute to finding some <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities</b> in accreting neutron star systems. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures.

5|$|The {{source of}} the long {{secondary}} periods is unknown, but they certainly aren't due to radial pulsations. Interferometric observations of Betelgeuse have shown hotspots that {{are thought to be}} created by massive convection cells, a significant fraction of the diameter of the star and each emitting 5–10% of the total light of the star. One theory to explain long secondary periods is that they are caused by the evolution of such cells combined with the rotation of the star. Other theories include close binary interactions, chromospheric <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> influencing mass loss, or non-radial pulsations such as g-modes.|$|E
5|$|The star is {{estimated}} to be less than a billion years old. Because of its relative youth, Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> than the present-day Sun, with a stellar wind 30 times as strong. Its rotation period is 11.2days at the equator. Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a comparatively lower level of elements heavier than helium. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about , giving it an orange hue.|$|E
5|$|The {{chromosphere}} of Tau Ceti—the {{portion of}} a star's atmosphere just above the light-emitting photosphere—currently displays little or no <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity,</b> indicating a stable star. One nine-year study of temperature, granulation, and the chromosphere showed no systematic variations; Ca II emissions around the H and K infrared bands show a possible 11-year cycle, but this is weak relative to the Sun. Alternatively {{it has been suggested}} that the star could be in a low-activity state analogous to a Maunder minimum—a historical period, associated with the Little Ice Age in Europe, when sunspots became exceedingly rare on the Sun's surface. Spectral line profiles of Tau Ceti are extremely narrow, indicating low turbulence and observed rotation. The amplitude of the star's oscillations are about half those of the Sun, and have a lower mode lifetime.|$|E
40|$|A {{sample of}} the LAMOST spectra of the early type M 0 -M 3 dwarfs is {{compared}} with the Kepler observations. It is found that M dwarfs with strong chromospheric emission in H_α have large flare activity in general. The rotational periods derived from the Kepler measurements have close correlations with the sizes of the flares, the power-law distribution index and the equivalent widths of the H_α emission. A clear trend exists for higher <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities</b> being detected in faster rotating M dwarfs (rotation periods < 20 day). Comment: 18 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|For the {{intrusion}} of the solar wind energy into the magnetosphere the polar cusp has been {{believed to be the}} most important region in the magnetosphere. By using magnetometer data obtained in November 1989 at Godhavn (Inv. Lat. = 76 °) in Greenland located in the polar cusp the dayside enhancement of ULF wave activity is studied in relation to both variations of the ground magnetic field and the interplanetary magnetic field. The important results are as follows; 1) Godhavn is found to be one of the appropriate stations for studying magnetic field variations and ULF waves in the polar cusp, i. e., the normal-run magnetograms show negative H component excursion during the daytime, sometimes sporadically and in the other times gradually. The ULF waves enhance their activity closely associated with these negative field variations. These field variations might be considered to occur when the station passes under the westward current flowing in the cusp ionosphere. 2) By comparing the ground <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities</b> with the interplanetary magnetic field the ground <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities</b> occur in association with high frequency fluctuations of the IMF. 3) A comparison of spectral power of the ULF waves at Godhavn (cusp latitude) with those at Syowa (auroral latitude) shows more enhanced magnetic power and more resonance-like oscillation of ULF waves at the auroral latitude. Thus, the cusp might be a source region of magnetic energy penetrating into the magnetosphere, and resonant oscillations of ULF waves are clearly observed at the auroral latitude...|$|R

Within the tidal disruption scenario, we show that the periastron distance is considerably smaller than the disruption radius and the outflow should be launched mainly via <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities</b> (e. g., Blandford-Znajek process) otherwise the observed long-lasting X-ray afterglow emission satisfying the relation L_X∝Ṁ can not be reproduced, where L_X is the X-ray luminosity and Ṁ is the accretion rate.

5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} is generated within regions of the interior where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a dynamo, wherein the movement of electrical charges induce {{magnetic field}}s, as does a mechanical dynamo. Those magnetic fields have a great range that extend throughout and beyond the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, {{and the amount of}} magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic field flux lines that rise from a star's surface into the star's outer atmosphere, its corona. The coronal loops can be seen due to the plasma they conduct along their length. Stellar flares are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wolf 359 {{is one of}} {{the faintest}} and lowest-mass stars known. At the {{light-emitting}} layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of about 2,800 K, which is low enough for chemical compounds to form and survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide have been observed in the spectrum. The surface has a magnetic field that is stronger than the average magnetic field on the Sun. As a result of <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> caused by convection, Wolf 359 is a flare star that can undergo sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares emit strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation that have been observed by space telescopes. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years. No companions or disks of debris have been detected in orbit around it.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of specific biorhythms {{and the role}} of geomagnetic and/or solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities</b> are well-established by appropriate correlations in chronobiology. From a physical viewpoint, there are two different accesses to biorhythms to set up connections to molecular processes: 1. Diffusion of charged molecules in magnetic fields. 2. Quantum mechanical perturbation theoretical methods and their resonance dominators to characterize specific interactions between constituents. The methods of point 2 permit the treatment of molecular processes by circuits with characteristic resonances and 'beat-frequencies', which result from the primarily fast physical processes.

30|$|In {{this paper}} I focus on quasi-steady-state solar wind from open {{magnetic}} flux regions, {{and do not}} consider CMEs. While the quasi-steady-state component dominantly contributes to the total mass loss from the present-day sun than CMEs, at early times CMEs might play a more important role because of stronger <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities.</b> From the fossil record on the lunar surface, it is inferred that the speed of solar wind was faster in the past (Newkirk, 1980; Ray and Heymann, 1980). I infer that the fossil record comprises effects of both quasi-steady state component and CMEs. If strong CMEs dominantly contribute to the mass loss, the bulk speed of plasma flow from the sun would be recognized as higher. I speculate that the fossil inprint on the moon is connected with high CME activities at early epochs.|$|R

25|$|Starspots are {{regions of}} intense <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> {{on the surface}} of a star. (On the Sun they are termed sunspots.) These form a visible {{component}} of magnetic flux tubes that are formed within a star's convection zone. Due to the differential rotation of the star, the tube becomes curled up and stretched, inhibiting convection and producing zones of lower than normal temperature. Coronal loops often form above starspots, forming from magnetic field lines that stretch out into the corona. These in turn serve to heat the corona to temperatures over a million kelvins.|$|E
25|$|Both {{stars were}} {{considered}} unusual {{because they were}} thought {{to have had a}} lower luminosity than is normal for main sequence stars of their age and surface temperature. That is, they lie below the main sequence curve on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for newly formed stars. However, this was challenged, after using the much more accurate parallaxes from the Hipparcos catalogue (ESA, 1997), it was calculated that the stars actually have higher luminosities and so are shifted upwards, crossing them into the main sequence. Most stars will evolve above this curve as they age. ζ1 has an intermediate level of <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> in its chromosphere. Although the kinematics of this system suggest that they belong to a population of older stars, the properties of their stellar chromospheres suggests that they are only about 2 billion years old.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the Solar System, {{the region}} around another main-sequence star that could support Earth-like life on an Earth-like planet {{is known as}} the {{habitable}} zone. The inner and outer radii of this zone vary with the luminosity of the star, as does the time interval during which the zone survives. Stars more massive than the Sun have a larger habitable zone, but remain on the main sequence for a shorter time interval. Small red dwarfs have the opposite problem, with a smaller habitable zone that is subject to higher levels of <b>magnetic</b> <b>activity</b> and the effects of tidal locking from close orbits. Hence, stars in the intermediate mass range such as the Sun may have a greater likelihood for Earth-like life to develop. The location of the star within a galaxy may also affect the likelihood of life forming. Stars in regions with a greater abundance of heavier elements that can form planets, in combination with a low rate of potentially habitat-damaging supernova events, are predicted to have a higher probability of hosting planets with complex life. The variables of the Drake equation are used to discuss the conditions in planetary systems where civilization is most likely to exist. Use of the equation to predict the amount of extraterrestrial life, however, is difficult; because many of the variables are unknown, the equation functions as more of a mirror to what its user already thinks. As a result, the number of civilizations in the galaxy can be estimated as low as 9.1 x 10^-11 or as high as 156 million; for the calculations, see Drake equation.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of large-scale dynamos in rigidly rotating stratified convection is explored by direct numerical simulations (DNS) in Cartesian geometry. A mean-field dynamo model is also constructed using turbulent velocity profiles consistently {{extracted from the}} corresponding DNS results.

40|$|Abstract. Stellar <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities</b> {{such as the}} 11 -year {{sunspot cycle}} are the manifestation of {{magnetohydrodynamic}} dynamo processes {{taking place in the}} deep interiors of stars. This paper is concerned with the mathematical theory and finite element approximation of mean-field spherical dynamos and their astrophysical application. We first investigate the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the dynamo system governed by a set of nonlinear PDEs with discontinuous physical coefficients in spherical geometry, and characterize the system by a saddle-point type variational form. Then we propose a fully discrete finite element approximation to the dynamo system and study its convergence and stability. For the astrophysical application, we perform some fully threedimensional numerical simulations of a solar interface dynamo using the proposed algorithm, which successfully generates the equatorially propagating dynamo wave with a period of about 11 years {{similar to that of the}} Sun...|$|R
30|$|Young solar-type {{stars are}} {{generally}} very active: X-ray flux {{is up to}} ~ 1000 {{times larger than the}} present-day sun (Güdel et al., 1997; Güdel, 2004), and the X-ray temperature is also higher (Ribas et al., 2005; Telleschi et al., 2005). Observations of young main sequence stars show very strong magnetic field strengths with an order of kG or even larger (Donati and Collier Cameron, 1997; Saar and Brandenburg, 1999; Saar, 2001; see also Donati and Landstreet, 2009 for recent review), which are much stronger than the average strength of 1 – 10 G of the current sun. Young stars are generally fast rotators and strong magnetic fields are generated by strong differential rotation through dynamo activities of magnetoconvection (e.g., Brun et al., 2004). As time goes on, a star loses its angular momentum through magnetic stellar wind (Weber and Davis, 1967) and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>activities</b> become weak (e.g., Ayres, 1997).|$|R
