40|$|AbstractPolymer {{concrete}} (PC) displays superb {{vibration dampening}} qualities and is dimensionally and thermally stable, dense, rigid, {{resistant to water}} and chemicals and will not twist or bend in reaction to stress. Therefore PC has become the preferred base to ensure rigidity in a machine tool. Hybrid polymer concrete beds composed of steel structures and polymer concrete are challenging for the grinding process, due to the completely different material properties of steel and PC. Which complicates the selection of suitable grinding tool and limits the achievable <b>material</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rates.</b> A promising technique to overcome these technological constraints {{is the use of}} High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG), where high cutting speeds and <b>material</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> are utilized.

50|$|Whether melting or {{vaporization}} is {{more dominant}} in a laser drilling process depends on many factors, with laser pulse duration and energy playing an important role. Generally speaking, ablation dominates when a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is used. On the other hand, melt expulsion, {{the means by}} which a hole is created through melting the material, dominates when a flashtube pumped Nd:YAG laser is used. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser normally has pulse duration in the order of nanoseconds, peak power on the order of ten to hundreds of MW/cm2, and a <b>material</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> of a few micrometres per pulse. A flash lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser normally has a pulse duration on the order of hundreds of microseconds to a millisecond, peak power in the order of sub MW/cm2, and <b>material</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> of ten to hundreds of micrometers per pulse.

50|$|Because {{ultrasonic}} vibration machining {{is driven}} by microchipping or erosion mechanisms, the <b>material</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> of metals can be slow and the sonotrode tip can wear down quickly from the constant impact of abrasive particles on the tool. Moreover, drilling deep holes in parts can prove difficult as the abrasive slurry will not effectively reach {{the bottom of the}} hole.

In addition, ultrasonic vibration machining can only be used on materials with a hardness value of at least 45 HRC.|$|E
50|$|Abrasive flow {{machining}} (AFM), {{also known}} as abrasive flow deburring or extrude honing, is an interior surface finishing process characterized by flowing an abrasive-laden fluid through a workpiece.

While time spent machining and surface roughness decrease with CUSM, the entrance profile diameter is slightly larger than normal due to the additional chemical reactivity of the new slurry choice.

50|$|In {{abrasive}} flow machining, the {{abrasive fluid}} {{flows through the}} workpiece, effectively performing erosion. Abrasive particles in the fluid contact raised features {{on the surface of}} the workpiece and remove them. The fluid is forced through the workpiece by a hydraulic ram, where it acts as a flexible file, or slug, molding itself precisely to the shape of the workpiece. The highest amount of material removal occurs in areas where the flow of the fluid is restricted; according to Bernoulli's Principle, the flow speed and pressure of the fluid increase in these areas, facilitating a higher <b>material</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> (MRR). The pressure exerted by the fluid on all contacting surfaces also results in a very uniform finish.|$|E
50|$|Roughing {{cuts are}} used to remove large amount of {{material}} from the starting workpart as rapidly as possible, i.e. with a large <b>Material</b> <b>Removal</b> <b>Rate</b> (MRR), {{in order to produce}} a shape close to the desired form, but leaving some material on the piece for a subsequent finishing operation.Finishing cuts {{are used to}} complete the part and achieve the final dimension, tolerances, and surface finish. In production machining jobs, one or more roughing cuts are usually performed on the work, followed by one or two finishing cuts. Roughing operations are done at high feeds and depths - feeds of 0.4-1.25 mm/rev (0.015-0.050 in/rev) and depths of 2.5-20 mm (0.100-0.750 in) are typical, but actual values depend on the workpiece materials. Finishing operations are carried out at low feeds and depths - feeds of 0.0125-0.04 mm/rev (0.0005-0.0015 in/rev) and depths of 0.75-2.0 mm (0.030-0.075 in) are typical.
