5|$|The {{objects to}} be {{transformed}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> else than ordinary physical objects extending in three spatial dimensions (and time, unless the frame is the rest frame). It is for these objects that representation theory is needed for the mathematical description of transformations induced by ordinary Lorentz transformations of spacetime. For instance, the electromagnetic field is often (naively) envisaged by the assignment to each point in spacetime of a three-dimensional vector representing the electric field and another three-dimensional vector representing the magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, emotions and consciousness in general, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E

25|$|During his career, Houston {{was known}} for his three-point {{shooting}} prowess. Despite the on-court accolades, though, Houston's lasting legacy <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that happened off the court: In 2001, Houston signed a six-year, $100.4 million contract extension with the Knicks. Houston's yearly salary of over $20 million made him virtually untradeable, and his injury problems would burden the Knicks. Houston missed 32 games in 2003-04 due to a knee injury, and despite claims in the summer of 2004 that he would be ready to play the next season (he even refused to have surgery on his knee that summer), he played in only 20 games that season because his injury had not completely healed. Knee injuries would eventually force Houston to announce his retirement on October 17, 2005.|$|E
25|$|Although E4 {{proteins}} {{are expressed}} at low levels {{during the early}} phase of viral infection, expression of E4 increases dramatically during the late phase of infection. In other words, its “E” appellation <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> of a misnomer. In the case of HPV-1, E4 can account for up to 30% of the total protein at {{the surface of a}} wart. The E4 protein of many papillomavirus types is thought to facilitate virion release into the environment by disrupting intermediate filaments of the keratinocyte cytoskeleton. Viral mutants incapable of expressing E4 do not support high-level replication of the viral DNA, but it is not yet clear how E4 facilitates DNA replication. E4 has also been shown to participate in arresting cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventions}} {{for professional}} artists working in private {{are much less}} defined, especially as the models are often friends or family. However, artists who regularly hire strangers tend to observe art school standards {{in order to make}} models feel more comfortable, and to avoid possible legal issues. Professional artists often hire the same models on a regular basis. When a comfortable working relationship is established, many artists relax their standards and models do the same. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> as simple as not undressing in another room, or not wearing a robe during breaks. In addition, silence is no longer necessary if the artist is comfortable working and conversing with the model. A more collegial relationship may develop where artist and model feel that they are collaborating. However, in a private studio environment, with an artist on a deadline or with commission guidelines, stricter work standards may apply regarding punctuality and holding longer, more demanding poses, but also require higher rates of pay.|$|E

500|$|Technologically, the Covenant are {{described}} in [...] and [...] to be imitative rather than innovative—most of the Covenant's sophisticated weaponry and propulsion systems are based on Forerunner artifacts, rather than the Covenant's own research. Covenant weapons are generally based on Forerunner technology and utilize plasma. These weapons are built around a battery that generates plasma and discharges it at a target. Frank O'Connor, Bungie's former public relations head, hinted that there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> more to the Covenant's weaponry, saying [...] "the actual technology is not plasma as we know it, but something far more dangerous, arcane, and destructive." [...] A few of the Covenant's weapons are not plasma-based, including the Needler, which fires razor-sharp pink needles capable of [...] "homing in" [...] on organic foes and exploding. A weapons expert noted parallels between the Needler and ancient Greek Amazons painting their daggers pink as a psychological weapon in an issue of gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E

500|$|Donal Lynch, of Irish {{newspaper}} the Sunday Independent, suggested that, {{like the}} previous work of Pemberton and Shearsmith, Inside No. 9 <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> of [...] "a cult hit/acquired taste". Barry Didcock, of The Herald, expressed a similar sentiment, calling Inside No. 9 [...] "probably the most Marmitey programme on television". The Times published {{a response to}} a complaint received from a viewer, who was unhappy with Chater's positive reviews of Inside No. 9, suggesting that [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] was more traumatic than humorous. Sam Wollaston, television critic for The Guardian, noted that humour is extremely personal, and though he could appreciate much about Inside No. 9, he had never liked Pemberton and Shearsmith's work: [...] "I'm sure I'll be crucified – probably quite rightly – but I don't love Inside No 9." [...] Some tabloid columnists also expressed dissatisfaction with the programme. Virginia Blackburn, of the Daily Express, wrote a highly critical review of [...] "Last Gasp". Blackburn considered Inside No. 9 an example of the weakness of contemporary television comedy, saying that the episode is [...] "not funny, it's not clever and is so utterly, irredeemably, naffly silly that it ends up being incredibly irritating and nothing else". Another journalist unimpressed was the Daily Mirror columnist Kevin O'Sullivan, who dismissed the programme by saying simply [...] "BBC2's alleged comedy Inside No. 9: didn't even smile".|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} {{of what is}} said and depicted in the game is open to interpretation, leading fans to develop and discuss theories {{about the nature of}} the events that occur in the game. Let's Players Voidburger and Bob from the video-game related podcast The Grate Debate opined that the open-ended nature of the game is one of its greatest aspects. They also said that there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> in the game that has not been discovered yet. They noted the colored lights as something they still had not figured out, and they felt that the game hinted that the radio may be the main culprit behind the father's killing. The game also contained a Swedish line in the radio describing a radio drama from 1938 being true, which gamers suggested may be a nod to Orson Welles's radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds. This possible reference to alien invasions was noted as a continuation of a Silent Hill tradition of having secret endings that included aliens. Another theory commonly discussed is deciphering the identity of the player character. The fetus talking to the player character about his remembering moments [...] "ten months back" [...] seems to imply that he is the father who killed Lisa and the kids, although Voidburger and Bob believe that the player character may be the protagonist that was to be in Silent Hills, as shown in the trailer following the ending of P.T.|$|E

[...] In contrast, Darryl Sterdan of The Winnipeg Sun gave it a 3 out of 5 rating, saying, [...] "This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something,</b> but it's not 'It'... On the whole, it's a sweet little number -- but it doesn't live up to its authoritative title." [...] Todd Martens, of the Los Angeles Timess Pop & Hiss music blog, called [...] "This Is It" [...] a [...] "trifle" [...] and while the track [...] "certainly won't embarrass Jackson's legacy or break the hearts of fans eager to hear Jackson's voice again" [...] it does [...] "bring the fallen pop icon a little back down to earth." [...] Jessica Robertson, an AOL music editor, said, [...] "It's a safe, mid-tempo pop ballad that features what his fans love: his trademark breathy vocals and confident delivery. I don't think it will set the world on fire, because it's missing what fans and critics love most about his songs, which is a strong and powerful groove to carry it." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{its opening}} weekend, After Earth took in $27.5 million in box office {{receipts}} in North America and $2.5M in South Korea. Sony Pictures projected a launch of around $38 million, but the actual number was 17% lower than the lowest pre-release expectation of $33 million. It finished in third place behind Fast & Furious 6, an action film, and Now You See Me, a caper film. Taking into account the popularity of principal actor Will Smith, the disappointing finish led The Wall Street Journal {{to call it a}} [...] "flop". Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo noted the $27 million weekend placed it between two sci-fi flops of 2012 films with 200 million-plus budgets, Battleship ($25.5 million) and John Carter ($30.2 million), and also drew half of the co-stars' previous openings, Will Smith's Men in Black 3 ($54.6 million) and Jaden Smith's The Karate Kid ($55.7 million). Scott Mendelson from Forbes argued that Sony made a mistake of hiding M.

2500|$|To {{understand}} {{the role of the}} medical director in what North Americans call EMS, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of precisely how EMS systems (or ambulance service, SAMU, SMURD, etc.) operate in various locales. [...] There is little about what we call EMS that is universally applicable. [...] Instead, communities and medical practitioners tend to develop systemic arrangements that are based on an assessment of local need. In the delivery of what we commonly refer to as EMS in various countries, there are two major service delivery models, with a number of minor models or variations from the main models. [...] The first model, and arguably the oldest, is generally described as the Franco-German model. This model is physician-led, and places those operating ambulances into what are in many cases, minor, supporting roles. While this model is generally referred to as Franco-German, this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> of a misnomer, since there is ample evidence and documentation indicating that {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, many North American hospital-based ambulances in larger centres were actually staffed by ambulance surgeons; physicians who actually responded in the ambulance and provided care in a manner which very much resembles the current Franco-German model. [...] In the French version of the model, only physicians and nurses perform advanced care, and drivers have only minimal medical training.|$|E
