5000|$|In 1966, {{he joined}} a new group called [...] "Les Tigres Sauvages" [...] Tigers and won the [...] "Microsillon d'Argent" [...] <b>Microgroove</b> <b>Record</b> at the Festival of Châtelet in Belgium - a prize that {{included}} the recording of a single. He recorded two titles: “Petite fille” Girl and [...] "”Ne pleure pas" [...] cry, under the pseudonym of François Bara. His father bought the 500 records that were pressed and managed to sell them for jukeboxes.

5000|$|This form of coding is also {{sometimes}} known as matrix stereo {{and is used}} in many different forms of audio processing and recording equipment.

One example of the use of M/S stereo is in FM stereo broadcasting, where [...] modulates the carrier wave and [...] modulates a subcarrier. Another example of M/S stereo is the stereophonic <b>microgroove</b> <b>record.</b> Lateral motions of a stylus represent the sum of two channels and the vertical motion represents the difference between the channels.|$|E
5000|$|Daniels {{recordings}} {{cover the}} period of transition from 78-rpm to the dawn of <b>microgroove</b> <b>recording.</b> Remembered mostly for his charismatic live performances, he made an album at Abbey Road, The Magic of Billy Daniels (1978), which contained a disco version of [...] "That Old Black Magic".

5000|$|A {{small number}} of 78 RPM {{microgroove}} vinyl recordings have been issued by smaller and underground performers, mainly as novelty items, from the 1970s to the present. In 2006, the Belfast singer Duke Special released a number of ten inch EPs in 78 RPM. [...] A series of 78 RPM <b>microgroove</b> <b>records</b> was issued by the [...] "Audiophile" [...] label during the early LP era. They were supposed to provide higher quality sound than 33 rpm {{by virtue of their}} faster rotation speed combined while also providing significantly longer playing time than standard groove 78 RPM records.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, a {{regulation}} of the National Assembly expanded legal deposit to original prints, posters, art work reproductions, postcards, sound recordings (<b>microgroove</b> vinyl <b>records,</b> compact discs, and more), software, electronic documents (Internet files for instance) and desktop publishing.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the era of}} the {{gramophone}} record, {{all music}} arrived in the marketplace as what is now termed a single, one potential hit song backed by an additional song of generally less commercial appeal on a single ten-inch 78 rpm shellac record. After the launch of the long-playing <b>microgroove</b> <b>record</b> in 1948 and the arrival of the 45 rpm single the following year, singles continued to appear separately from albums into the 1960s. For instance, the early rock and roll market of the 1950s and early 1960s was very much focused on singles rather than albums. Songs such as [...] "Heartbreak Hotel", [...] "Johnny B. Goode", and [...] "Tutti Frutti" [...] only appeared later on album compilations of singles. Even through the 1960s, leading rock artists such as The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones issued songs such as [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", [...] "Penny Lane," [...] "Good Vibrations", [...] "Positively 4th Street", and [...] "Honky Tonk Women" [...] as singles apart from any contemporary albums.|$|E

The 45 rpm player included a changing mechanism that allowed multiple disks to be stacked, much as a conventional changer handled 78s. The short playing time of a single 45 rpm side meant that long works, such as symphonies, had to be released on multiple 45s instead of a single LP, but RCA claimed that the new high-speed changer rendered side breaks so brief as to be inaudible or inconsequential. Early 45 rpm records were made from either vinyl or polystyrene. They had a playing time of eight minutes.|$|E
40|$|The {{computation}} ofthe {{shape of}} a sessile or pendant drop at restis a classical problem of Fluid Mechanics. The problem possesses relevant experimental interest to deduce the interfacial tension and the contact angle from the geometrical properties of the drop. The exact knowledge of both quantities is required by many mathematical models of two-phase flow. However the compu tation usually assumes the solid plane to be perfectly smooth an d chemically homo geneous, w hile actual surfaces are always rough and often smeared by contaminants. Recent researches on oil-water flow have shown that sometimes the flow regime depends critically upon th e roughness and wettability of the in ner pipe surface. Even assuming the chemical homogen eity of the solid, roughness may influence heavily the drop shape and size, wettability and contact angle, {{but it is difficult}} to classify because it involves various parameters (average roughness, root mean square, texture, etc.). A case of peculiar interest is periodic roughness having a parallel rectilinear texture because such surfaces are already available as industrial products, suitable for experiments. The key idea of the ongoing research, not found in any other paper known to the author, is that diffraction gratings u sed in optics possess this kin d of texture, whic h is accurate to a small fraction of the wavelength of visible light. Moreover they are made of high-quality glass with carefully controlled composition, hence they guarantee good chemical homogeneity. Another promising surface which possesses a regular roughness is the old <b>microgroove</b> <b>record.</b> An original mathematical model, not previously found in the literature, is constructed according to the Wenzel equation (1936) and a numerical algorithm to solve the model is described which adapts general ideas taken from the rapidly growing field of Computational Fluid Dynamics. This mathematical model p romises to improve the con tact angle measuremen t on the above mentio ned artificial surfaces, as a first stage before dealing with actual surfaces. This improvement will benefit in turn the mathematical modelling of oil-water flow inside pipes having a rough surface...|$|E
5000|$|With {{these factors}} {{applied to the}} 10-inch format, songwriters and {{performers}} increasingly tailored their output to fit the new medium. The 3-minute single remained the standard into the 1960s, when the availability of <b>microgroove</b> <b>recording</b> and improved mastering techniques enabled recording artists to increase the duration of their recorded songs. The breakthrough came with Bob Dylan's [...] "Like a Rolling Stone". Although CBS {{tried to make the}} record more [...] "radio friendly" [...] by cutting the performance into halves, and separating them between {{the two sides of the}} vinyl disc, both Dylan and his fans demanded that the full six-minute take be placed on one side, and that radio stations play the song in its entirety.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of <b>microgroove</b> <b>records</b> (1940-1960), nickel plating was only brief, just an hour or less. This was {{followed}} by copper plating, which was both quicker and simpler to manage at that time. Later with advent of nickel sulfamate plating solutions, all matrices were plated with solid nickel. Most factories transferred the master matrix after an initial flash of nickel from a slow warm nickel electroplating bath at around 15 amperes to a hot 130 degree nickel plating bath. In this, the current would be raised at regular intervals until it reached between 110 A and 200 A, depending on the standard of the equipment and the skill of the operators. This and all subsequent metal copies were known as matrices.|$|R

2500|$|For {{collectible}} or nostalgia purposes, or for {{the benefit}} of higher-quality audio playback provided by the 78rpm speed with newer vinyl records and their lightweight stylus pickups, a small number of 78rpm records have been released since the major labels ceased production. The most notable attempt at this was in 1951, when inventor Ewing Dunbar Nunn founded the label Audiophile Records, which released a series of 78rpm-mastered albums that were microgroove and pressed on vinyl (as opposed to traditional 78s, with their shellac composition and wider 3-mil sized grooves). This series came in heavy manilla envelopes and began with a jazz album AP-1 and was soon followed by other AP numbers up through about AP-19. Around 1953 the standard LP had proven itself to Nunn and he switched to rpm and began using art slicks on a more standard cardboard sleeve. The Audiophile numbers can be found into the hundreds today but the most collectable ones are the early 78rpm releases, especially the first, AP-1. The 78rpm speed was mainly {{to take advantage of the}} wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78rpm can provide for vinyl <b>microgroove</b> <b>records,</b> hence the label's name (obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s [...] "hi-fi" [...] era, when stereo gear could provide a much wider range of audio than before). Also around 1953, Bell Records released a series of budget-priced plastic 7-inch 78rpm pop music singles.|$|R

5000|$|The LP record (long play), or [...] rpm <b>microgroove</b> vinyl <b>record,</b> is a {{gramophone}} record format introduced by Columbia Records in 1948. It {{was adopted by}} the record industry as a standard format for the [...] "album". Apart from relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound capability, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. The term [...] "album" [...] had been carried forward from the early nineteenth century when it had been used for collections of short pieces of music. Later, collections of related 78rpm records were bundled in book-like albums. When long-playing records were introduced, a collection of pieces on a single record was called an album; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, Compact audio cassette, and digital albums, as they were introduced. As part of a trend of shifting sales in the music industry, some commenters have declared that the early 21st century experienced the death of the album.|$|R
5000|$|The long-playing 33 rpm <b>microgroove</b> vinyl <b>record,</b> or [...] "LP", was {{developed}} at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948.

In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs {{by the end of}} the 1950s, but in some corners of the world the [...] "78" [...] lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact [...] "45" [...] format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good diamond stylus mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting. If protected from dust, scuffs and scratches there was very little noise. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as [...] "unbreakable". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as [...] "unbreakable" [...] compared to wax cylinders.|$|R
