5|$|Freight {{trains to}} the various {{industrial}} companies along the line remained until the 1980s, when traffic sank drastically. From 1988, the line was closed from Foss-Eigeland, although the line from there to Ganddal was kept for use for a cement factory. Until 2001 only the three first kilometers (two first <b>miles)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line were used, for transport of concrete structures, but then the Norwegian National Rail Administration stopped all traffic on the line.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, A 121-day Maine to Georgia veteran's group {{funded and}} {{supported}} thru-hike {{was reported to}} have been completed, with all but three <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new trail cleared and blazed, by six Boy Scouts from New York City and their guides. The completed thru-hike was much later recorded and accepted by the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association.|$|E

5|$|Learning of the {{annihilation}} of his patrol, Ichiki quickly sent forward {{a company to}} bury the bodies and followed {{with the rest of}} his troops, marching throughout the night of August 19 and finally halting at 04:30 on August 20 within a few <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Marine positions on the east side of Lunga Point. At this location, he prepared his troops to attack the Allied positions that night.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the walls}} {{a series of}} semicircular defense lines were {{constructed}} {{in the path of}} the Japanese advance, most notably an outer one about sixteen kilometers (10 miles) from the city and an inner one directly outside the city known as the Fukuo Line, or multiple positions line. The Fukuo Line, a sprawling network of trenches, moats, barbed wire, mine fields, gun emplacements, and pillboxes, was to be the final defense line outside Nanking's city walls. There were also two key high points of land on the Fukuo Line, the peaks of Zijinshan to the northeast and the plateau of Yuhuatai to the south, where fortification was especially dense. In order to deny the Japanese invaders any shelter or supplies in this area, Tang adopted a strategy of scorched earth on December 7, ordering all homes and structures {{in the path of the}} Japanese within one to two kilometers (1.2 <b>miles)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city to be incinerated, as well as all homes and structures near roadways within sixteen kilometers (10 <b>miles)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequently}} encountered bioluminescent organisms {{may be the}} dinoflagellates present in the surface layers of the sea, which {{are responsible for the}} sparkling phosphorescence sometimes seen at night in disturbed water. At least eighteen genera exhibit luminosity. A different effect is the thousands of square <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria, known as mareel or the milky seas effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{objections}} {{were particularly}} {{raised by the}} Merchant Maiden Hospital, which owned the land {{on the south side}} of the Ugie. Despite being advised to take out an interdict to prevent the work, in January 1797 the Hospital did not feel it had a strong enough case. However, four months later when two <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal had been dug up to where the north and south Ugie joined, the Hospital did apply for an interdict, and this was granted in July 1797.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{name comes}} from a natural spring located along a trail on {{the south end of}} the park. The spring's name is derived from the effect of {{sunlight}} on its surface, which makes the pool appear to shimmer like silver. Even through the winter, the bubbling spring never freezes, and plants often poke through snow surrounding the watercress-bordered pool in the coldest months. Three <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fox River, which Silver Springs empties into, flows through the park's north end.|$|E

Many U.S. defensive industry suppliers are based in Newport News, and these and nearby military bases employ many residents, in addition to those working at the shipyard and in other harbor-related vocations.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{graduation}} year, 1965, was {{the last}} year that the NBA's territorial rule was in effect, which gave professional teams first rights to draft players who attended college within 50 <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team. The New York Knicks—one mile closer to Princeton than the Philadelphia 76ers—drafted Bradley as a territorial pick in the 1965 draft, {{but he did not}} sign a contract with the team immediately. While studying Politics, Philosophy, and Economics at Oxford, he commuted to Italy to play professional basketball for Olimpia Milano during the 1965–66 season, where the team won a European Champions Cup (predecessor to the modern EuroLeague).|$|E
5|$|Dr. Paul Steiner (Bryant Haliday) and Dr. Christopher Mitchell (Ronald Allen) {{work on a}} {{projection}} device {{that enables them to}} transmit any object within a few <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine. While they find the device works with inanimate objects, the living creatures they use it on always seem to die. When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think the problem has been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to notification from Air Traffic Control, three ambulances from Perth were despatched {{in the direction}} of the crash site, known to be somewhere between Chidlow and York. The crash site was several miles from the road so the ambulance crews travelled eastwards all the way to York without sighting a fire. The crews were eventually guided back along the main road and then along a dirt road that enabled them to drive to within three or four <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash site. The crews then took their first-aid boxes and set out on foot.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the ATC made {{progress}} toward protecting the trail from development, thanks to efforts {{of politicians and}} officials. The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail as the first national scenic trails and {{paved the way for}} a series of National Scenic Trails within the National Park and National Forest systems. Trail volunteers worked with the National Park Service to map a permanent route for the trail, and by 1971 a permanent route had been marked (though minor changes continue to this day). By the close of the 20th century, the Park Service had completed the purchase of all but a few <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trail's span.|$|E

Biggin Hill soon took the same precaution of ordering all fighters into the air by order of Group Captain Richard Grice. At 13:10 the German bombers were within 40 <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BBC high-power transmitter at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. In accordance with policy, it was shut down to deny the Germans the opportunity {{to use it as}} direction-finding beacon and the BBC Home Service was kicked off air in the process.

5|$|Spring Brook is {{the second-largest}} {{tributary}} of the Lackawanna River, after Roaring Brook. It is a third-order stream. A {{significant portion of the}} watershed is forested. However, some residential areas, such as Yostville, Maple Lake, and Spring Brook Village are in the stream's vicinity. The stream also flows through an urban area in Moosic. Its headwaters are near Yostville. However, only a few square <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed is urban. Approximately 60 percent of the stream's watershed is owned by the Theta Company as of 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Western Canal was {{conceived}} {{as one of}} several competing schemes to alleviate the hazards and delays of coastal sailing ships making a passage around Land's End to get between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. A canal {{from the mouth of}} the River Exe to Exeter had been opened in 1566; and eight <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Tone had been made navigable in 1638. Navigation of the River Tone had been extended to Taunton in 1717, by the construction of locks on the upper section.|$|E
