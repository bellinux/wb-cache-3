50|$|MISTRAM was a multistatic long {{baseline}} radar interferometer developed for precision measurements of missile trajectories at the US Air Force Eastern Test Range. Multistatic radar systems {{have a higher}} complexity with <b>multiple</b> <b>transmitter</b> and receiver subsystems employed in a coordinated manner at more than two sites. All of the geographically dispersed units contribute to the collective target acquisition, detection, position finding and resolution, with simultaneous reception at the receiver sites. In a simpler sense, multistatic radars are systems which have two or more receiving sites with a common spatial coverage area, and data from these coverage areas are combined and processed at a central location. These systems {{are considered to be}} multiple bistatic pairs. Multistatic radar systems have various uses, including prevention of jamming and anti-radar munitions.|$|E

Advanced forms of thermographic cameras such as those that incorporate QWIPs would be able to optically see a Stealth aircraft regardless of the aircraft's RCS. In addition, Side looking radars, High-powered optical satellites, and sky-scanning, high-aperture, high sensitivity radars such as radio telescopes, would all be able to narrow down the location of a stealth aircraft under certain parameters. The newest SAM's have a claimed ability to be able to detect and engage stealth targets, with the most notable being the S-400, which is claimed to be able to detect a target with a 0.05-metre squared RCS from 90 km away.|$|E
50|$|While {{the idea}} of a single-frequency network of {{multiple}} transmitters broadcasting the same programming on the same channel from <b>multiple</b> <b>transmitter</b> sites is not a new concept, the ATSC digital television standard in use in North America was not designed for this mode of operation and was poorly adapted to these applications. The restrictive timing requirements and poor multipath interference handling of early ATSC implementations would have precluded multiple synchronous transmitters on the same frequency {{at the time of the}} first wide-scale commercial ATSC deployment in 1998; these restrictions eased somewhat as receiver design advanced in subsequent years. By 2004, technology existed to provide digital television receivers with the means to detect static (not mobile or changing) multipath interference (subject to certain timing constraints) and compensate for its effects on the digital signal.|$|E

5000|$|Space diversity: The {{signal is}} {{transmitted}} over several different propagation paths. In {{the case of}} wired transmission, this {{can be achieved by}} transmitting via multiple wires. In the case of wireless transmission, it can be achieved by antenna diversity using <b>multiple</b> <b>transmitter</b> antennas (transmit diversity) and/or multiple receiving antennas (reception diversity). In the latter case, a diversity combining technique is applied before further signal processing takes place. If the antennas are far apart, for example at different cellular base station sites or WLAN access points, this is called macrodiversity or site diversity. If the antennas are at a distance in the order of one wavelength, this is called microdiversity. A special case is phased antenna arrays, which also can be used for beamforming, MIMO channels and space-time coding (STC).|$|E

30|$|Over {{the past}} decade, space-time block codes (STBCs) have been firmly {{established}} {{as an effective}} technique for achieving reliable transmission in <b>multiple</b> <b>transmitter</b> wireless communication systems [1 – 3]. The blind recognition of communication parameters of these systems is an important research topic in the non-cooperative scenario, which has attracted more and more attention recently. Most researches are focused on blind channel estimation [4 – 8]. These blind channel estimation algorithms {{are based on the}} assumption that the space-time code is known at the receiver side. However, this is not practical since the space-time code is not known at the receiver side in the non-cooperative scenario. Therefore, one essential step in the signal interception process is to blindly recognize the STBCs used in <b>multiple</b> <b>transmitter</b> communications.|$|E

These connectors produce lower inter-modulation distortion products and thus are specified at busy RF sites and in almost all trunking systems where <b>multiple</b> <b>transmitters</b> share a common antenna. Note that an antenna rated for low passive inter-modulation (PIM) performance must be used along with these connectors. It defeats the purpose of designing a low PIM antenna system if regular N connectors or a non-PIM rated antenna are used.|$|R

40|$|For 3 G and 4 G mobile {{communication}} systems {{the application of}} multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver site is considered to enhance the channel capacity [2]. The design of such systems requires profound knowledge of the wideband double-directional radio channel, in this context especially its time-variant characteristic in various radio environments is of interest. One promising {{way to get the}} time-variant complex multipleinput-multiple-output (MIMO) channel impulse responses for realistic link- and system-level simulations is to measure various real mobile radio scenarios. These measured complex MIMO impulse responses can than be used in link-level simulations directly [3], or parametric channel models can be derived from them. For the measurement of the MIMO impulse responses a MIMO channel sounder is required. The most obvious but expensive concept to realize such a sounder is to use <b>multiple</b> <b>transmitter</b> and receiver chains at both link ends. But except of the high costs, this concept has furthermore the drawback that the multiple analog transmitter and receiver chains will inevitably have different frequency responses, non-linear distortions, and so on.
