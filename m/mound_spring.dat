50|$|One of {{the main}} threats to the <b>mound</b> <b>springs</b> comes from the {{extraction}} {{of water from the}} Great Artesian Basin for pastoral use.

50|$|Most {{of these}} {{communities}} were destroyed by land clearing in the period following colonisation.

The mound springs are critically endangered and the three remaining communities are reserved by either the state government or urban development reserve systems. All of the cohabiting species share the threat of extinction from altered environmental conditions. Altered fire regimes, involving blazes of higher intensity and the exploitation of the associated aquifers directly threaten the remaining tumulus spring assemblages. Grazing by cattle caused direct damage to species and their trampling and dung also facilitated invasion by wetland weed species. These introduced plant species, such as Isolepis prolifera and Pennisetum clandestinum, affect these ecological communities by displacing endemic species. Grassy weed species {{increase the risk of}} fire and woody ones draw heavily on the water of the spring. The interaction of these threats reduce biodiversity and continue to impel the extinction of these eco-communities.

40|$|Plants {{and aquatic}} {{invertebrates}} endemic to mound springs of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) of Australia are of national biodiversity significance. Springs occur in groups, and current survey {{data suggest that}} local extinction and recolonisation within a group does occur naturally. <b>Mound</b> <b>spring</b> fauna are therefore good examples of true metapopulations, and any study of the environmental impacts on these systems must take this into account. Use of GAB water leads to drawdown of the pressure in the aquifer. This can potentially impact <b>mound</b> <b>spring</b> flora and fauna in two ways. First, as pressure decreases, so does flow from spring vents, and this causes the area {{of each of the}} patches in the spring group to shrink. If local extinction probability of a patch increases with decreasing area, this will increase the likelihood of extinction of a species in the whole group. Second, when pressure drops far enough, entire vents may cease to flow, decreasing the number of patches in the system. This change can lead to increases in extinction risk of a species, because the nature of the patch system is changing qualitatively. We model this system as a I 2 ̆ 2 order Markov chain, and predict the risk of quasi-extinction under two different scenarios for modeling the effect of draw down on wetland areas...|$|E
40|$|The arid inland of Australia {{contains}} {{a diversity of}} landscapes and landscape processes, often of great antiquity, extending back to the Mesozoic and Paleozoic. The potential of this landscape {{as a source of}} Mars analogs has, however, been little explored. The few examples studied so far include radiation-tolerant microbes in thermal springs and hematite-silica hydrothermal alteration near Arkaroola in the Finders Ranges, and aeolian landforms at Gurra Gurra water hole the north east of Arkaroola. Further Australian Mars analog studies were provided by the studies of Bourke and Zimbelman of the paleoflood record of the Todd and Hale Rivers in central Australia. To facilitate study of such analogues, Mars Society Australia has embarked on a project to construct a Mars Analog Research Station near Arkaroola. The international scientific community will soon have the opportunity to participate in Mars analog studies in central Australia utilizing this facility. An area of considerable Mars analog potential is the <b>mound</b> <b>spring</b> complexes that occur at the margins of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) which underlies 22 % of the Australian continent and covers 1. 7 million km 2. The mound springs are formed when ground water flows to a topographic low, and subsurface strata dips up causing a hydrological head at the surface. Minerals precipitated at the spring discharge zone form low mesas or "mounds", the height of which are controlled by the hydrological head. This paper describes the Dalhousie <b>Mound</b> <b>Spring</b> Complex (DMC) {{in the northern part of}} South Australia (Figure 1), and its potential as a Mars analog. Hydrogeology: The DMC consists of a cluster of more than 60 active springs formed by natural discharge from the GAB). Total measured discharge from the GAB is 1. 74 GL per day, estimated unfocussed natural leakage through the aquaclude is thought be approximately equal to this figure. Some 54 ML per day are currently discharged by the DMC, 3 % of the measured total. The discharged artesian waters are of low to moderate salinity (700 - 9400 ppm), near neutral pH (6. 8 - 7. 3) and warm (20 - 46 C). The elevated temperatures are due to passage of the groundwater through deeply buried (up to 3 km) aquifers in an region of high heat flow, rather than magmatic heating. The waters also contain high levels of dissolved iron and H 2 S and less than 1 ppm dissolved oxygen. The water is carried in the Late Jurassic Algebuckina Sandstone beneath the aquaclude of the Bulldog Shale. It is brought near the surface by the mid-Cenozoic Dalhousie anticline and the ground water flow focused along a series of faults that breach the anticline's crest...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>mounds</b> on Earth and on Mars could {{represent}} optimal niches of life development. If life ever occurred on Mars, ancient spring deposits would be excellent localities {{to search for}} morphological or chemical remnants of an ancient biosphere. In this work, we investigate models of formation and activity of well-exposed <b>spring</b> <b>mounds</b> in the Mechertate-Chrita-Sidi El Hani (MCSH) system, eastern Tunisia. We then use these models to explore possible <b>spring</b> <b>mound</b> formation on Mars. In the MCSH system, {{the genesis of the}} <b>spring</b> <b>mounds</b> is a direct consequence of groundwater upwelling, triggered by tectonics and/or hydraulics. As they are oriented preferentially along faults, they can be considered as fault <b>spring</b> <b>mounds,</b> implying a tectonic influence in their formation process. However, the hydraulic pressure generated by the convergence of aquifers towards the surface of the system also allows consideration of an origin as artesian <b>spring</b> <b>mounds.</b> In the case of the MCSH system, our geologic data presented here show that both models are valid, and we propose a combined hydro-tectonic model as the likely formation mechanism of artesian-fault <b>spring</b> <b>mounds.</b> During their evolution from the embryonic (early) to the islet (“island”) stages, <b>spring</b> <b>mounds</b> are also shaped by eolian accumulations and induration processes. Similarly, <b>spring</b> <b>mounds</b> have been suggested to be relatively common in certain provinces on the Martian surface, but their mode of formation is still a matter of debate. We propose that the tectonic, hydraulic, and combined hydro-tectonic models describing the <b>spring</b> <b>mounds</b> at MCSH could be relevant as Martian analogs because: (i) the Martian subsurface may be over pressured, potentially expelling mineral-enriched waters as <b>spring</b> <b>mounds</b> on the surface; (ii) the Martian subsurface may be fractured, causing alignment of the <b>spring</b> <b>mounds</b> in preferential orientations; and (iii) indurated eolian sedimentation and erosional remnants are common features on Mars. The <b>spring</b> <b>mounds</b> further bear diagnostic mineralogic and magnetic properties, in comparison with their immediate surroundings. Consequently, remote sensing techniques can be very useful to identify similar <b>spring</b> <b>mounds</b> on Mars. The mechanisms (tectonic and/or hydraulic) of formation and evolution of <b>spring</b> <b>mounds</b> at the MCSH system are suitable for the proliferation and protection of life respectively.

40|$|Naturally patchy {{ecosystems}} are models for other systems currently undergoing anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. Understanding patterns of gene flow in these model systems {{can help us}} manage species and ecosystems threatened by human impacts. The mound springs of central Australia represent such a natural model ecosystem, supporting a unique aquatic fauna distributed within an inhospitable arid landscape. Moreover, these springs are being impacted by over extraction of groundwater, providing {{a unique opportunity to}} look at dispersal in a patchy habitat that is changing. The present study represents the first fine scale analysis of gene flow under different scenarios of habitat connectivity for the endangered <b>mound</b> <b>spring</b> snail, Fonscochlea accepta. Within a single spring group pairwise estimates of F-ST between springs were very low (ave 0. 015) with no association found between genetic distance and a series of geographical distance matrices based on the degree of habitat connectivity among the springs: results implying unstructured dispersal and limited population isolation. However, results from Bayesian assignment tests showed that on average approximately 97 % of snails were assigned to their spring of origin. In a preliminary analysis at broader geographic scales (among spring groups) the results from F-ST estimates, Mantel correlation analyses and assignment tests all suggest much stronger and geographically correlated population structuring. While varying results from F-statistics and Bayesian analyses stem from the different information they utilise, together they provide data on contemporary and historical estimates of gene flow and the influence of landscape dynamics on the spatial genetic patterning of the springs...|$|E
40|$|Artesian springs, {{which form}} {{carbonate}} mounds at the surface, occur in groups along the southwestern {{edge of the}} Great Artesian Basin (GAB), in northern South Australia. Their underground structure and relationship to faulting are not well understood. This study investigated four <b>mound</b> <b>spring</b> groups (Beresford Spring, Warburton Spring, the Bubbler Spring group, and Freeling Springs), which have different geological settings, using a range of geophysical techniques: self-potential (SP), magnetotellurics (MT) and time-domain electromagnetics (TEM). The results confirmed that despite generally similar mound morphologies at the surface, spring vents in different groups have different mechanisms for sourcing water from the GAB aquifer. SP measurements effectively showed {{where most of the}} vertical flow occurs at all groups, while MT and TEM models identified the location of faults, other geological structures and the thickness of the Bulldog Shale aquitard. Beresford and Warburton springs are similar in that the spring locations at both are directly related to points on a regional-scale fault, which appears to provide a low permeability pathway to the surface. At the Bubbler Springs group, a regionally aligned fault identified in MT data seems to be bounding an area where the aquifer is much closer to the surface (and the overlying aquitard has been thinned) where the spring abundance is highest. SP responses indicate that shallow flow paths feeding individual vents are unrelated to the fault. At Freeling Springs, the SP suggests that groundwater is flowing up within shallow aquifers, and that spring location is offset from this upward flow, instead located on range-front faults that provide the final conduit to the surface.

40|$|Artesian mound springs occur {{along the}} {{south-western}} {{edge of the}} Great Artesian Basin, in northern South Australia, but their underground structure and relationship to faulting is not well understood. This work aims to address this shortcoming with geophysical surveys over three <b>mound</b> <b>spring</b> systems (Beresford and Warburton Springs, the Bubbler Spring complex, and Freeling Springs), using a range of techniques: self-potential, magnetotellurics, and time-domain electromagnetics. The self-potential data contain elevated local responses to spring vents and seeps. Spatial correlation suggests that these responses are caused by flow related to springs. Similar responses also occur underneath ‘extinct’ springs, suggesting shallow subsurface discharge of aquifer water is still occurring. Little evidence was found for significant downward infiltration from spring tails. Modelling of time-domain electromagnetic and magnetotelluric data show that the confining Bulldog Shale, which is generally very conductive, contains slightly more resistive areas underneath springs and spring complexes, which {{may be related to}} a combination of carbonate buildup in the subsurface and more resistive aquifer water flowing to the surface. Magnetotelluric data and anisotropic 1 D modelling suggests that fault zones exist under many of the mound springs, particularly at Beresford and Warburton Springs and the Bubbler Spring complex, with data consistent with models containing parallel vertical fault planes striking NW/SE. The models contain fault zones in the aquifer and the immediately underlying basement, suggesting that fluids may be sourced from the aquifer and deeper layers, and that faults may be acting as conduits through the aquitard. However, neither the faults nor the conduits to specific springs have been successfully imaged using the techniques employed here, suggesting that the conduits are narrow and present only a slight contrast in fluid resistivities.

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. There {{is a lack}} of understanding about the mechanisms that control characteristics about the mound springs of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB). There is question about the origins of water that feed the springs. There is the possibility of local infiltration providing a shallow source of fluid and a deeper source on a more regional scale. How the springs are structurally controlled by faults and to what extent local recharge feeds back into the springs are all areas of active research. Beresford Spring is a <b>mound</b> <b>spring</b> located in the southwest of the Great Artesian Basin, approximately 50 km west of Lake Eyre South. It is one of over 600 springs that are spread throughout the GAB of which over 40 % are no longer active. The geology is poorly constrained {{due to the lack of}} significant outcrop as a result high weathering and sedimentary cover. Geophysical techniques are cheap and effective method of looking through this cover. This study involves the use of magnetotellurics (MT), which is a low impact, cheap technique that can be used to image the subsurface resistivity without causing significant damage to the local ecosystem, unlike seismic surveys for example. It is used to measure the resistivity of the Earth at varying depths and resolutions. The survey consisted of a north-south line and an east-west line that were used to generate 2 D inversion models with the goal of being able to differentiate between the spring and the surrounding confining beds and to delineate fluid flow paths feeding the springs. The results show that Beresford Spring is marked by a resistive high, a 10 fold increase compared to its immediate surroundings. Phase tensor plots reveal that at depth, the preferential direction of electrical current flow is in a northeast-southwest orientation over the entire Beresford region. At shallow depths, the region becomes homogeneous and loses any preferential orientation in conductivity. Beresford Spring maintains its northeast-southwest tensor which is an indication of the fluid pathways that feed the spring.  Thesis (B. Sc.
