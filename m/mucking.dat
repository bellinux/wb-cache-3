5|$|After {{completing}} the excavations at <b>Mucking</b> in 1978, the Joneses retired from field archaeology {{and returned to}} their cottage in Hereford. Margaret became the patron of the Thurrock Local History Society (the source of many volunteers to the <b>Mucking</b> excavation) and sat on many other archaeology committees in Essex. In this role she regularly gave lectures, guided tours and talks to schoolchildren across the county.|$|E
5|$|Born in Birkenhead, Jones {{first became}} {{involved}} in archaeology while studying at the University of Liverpool, where she volunteered on W. J. Varley's excavations. After graduating {{she worked as a}} wartime postal censor and freelance photojournalist, whilst continuing to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain. In 1956, Jones began working for the Ministry of Works as a freelance archaeologist in the burgeoning field of rescue archaeology. She worked at a number of sites, but is best known for her excavations at <b>Mucking,</b> a major Anglo-Saxon settlement and associated cemetery, with finds ranging from the Stone Age to the Medieval period. The <b>Mucking</b> excavation, which Jones directed from 1965 to 1978, became Britain's largest ever archaeological excavation. It produced an unprecedented volume of material, although some academic archaeologists have criticised the fact that the results did not appear in print until decades after the excavation had ended. Jones' work at <b>Mucking,</b> as well as her role in founding the campaign group Rescue, was influential in the establishment of modern commercial archaeology in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones {{to conduct}} an {{excavation}} at Linford, a gravel pit {{near the village of}} <b>Mucking</b> on the Thames Estuary. The site had been discovered in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. These initial investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by gravel extraction, prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory excavation. Jones quickly concluded that the crop marks at <b>Mucking</b> represented an extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On that basis, the Ministry extended her contract and initiated a full excavation of the site.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Mucking</b> {{excavation}} was {{to become}} the largest ever carried out in Britain. To keep ahead of its destruction by the gravel company that owned it, Jones, assisted by her husband Tom, directed work at the site continuously for 13 years. Unusually, they excavated all year round, living in a small caravan and employing a shifting workforce of freelance archaeologists and volunteers from around the world. When it finally completed in 1978, the excavation covered 44 acres and had recorded 44,000 archaeological features, including Beaker burials; a Bronze Age hillfort; an Iron Age settlement and cemetery; a Roman villa and cemetery; {{one of the most}} significant Anglo-Saxon settlements in Britain; two large Anglo-Saxon cemeteries; and a Medieval field system. It involved 5000 archaeologists and volunteers and recovered 1.7 million finds.|$|E

25|$|While the finds {{from other}} periods are of some interest, {{it is as}} an Anglo-Saxon site that <b>Mucking</b> is most significant.

25|$|Philip Rahtz {{asserted}} that buildings seen in West Stow and <b>Mucking</b> had late Roman origins. Archaeologist Philip Dixon noted the striking similarity between Anglo-Saxon timber halls and Romano-British rural houses. The Anglo-Saxons did not import the 'long-house', the traditional dwelling {{of the continental}} Germanic peoples, to Britain. Instead they upheld a local vernacular British building tradition {{dating back to the}} late first century. This has been interpreted as evidence of the endurance of kinship and household structures from the Roman into the Anglo-Saxon period.|$|E
25|$|The medieval Baldrick was {{probably}} the only Baldrick of the four who could really be described as clever. Baldrick, an ex-dung shoveller (a respected position, which he had {{worked very hard to}} get – earlier jobs include milking pigs and <b>mucking</b> out lepers) and Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer, first met Prince Edmund at the feast before the Battle of Bosworth Field and using flattery became his Squire. The two, along with Lord Percy, toasted their new friendship, unaware that from that point onwards, their descendants' lives would be eternally entwined.|$|E
25|$|Confirmation {{of the use}} of Anglo-Saxons as foederati or {{federate}} troops {{has been}} seen as coming from burials of Anglo-Saxons wearing military equipment of a type issued to late Roman forces, which have been found both in late Roman contexts, such as the Roman cemeteries of Winchester and Colchester, and in purely 'Anglo-Saxon' rural cemeteries like <b>Mucking</b> (Essex), though this was at a settlement used by the Romano-British. The distribution of the earliest Anglo-Saxon sites and place names in close proximity to Roman settlements and roads has been interpreted as showing that initial Anglo-Saxon settlements were being controlled by the Romano-British.|$|E

50|$|At {{that time}} the {{official}} punishment for stealing royal property was death. However, Little <b>Muck</b> could save his life by telling the king more about the magic power of the slippers and the walking stick. Thereupon the king tried on the slippers, but as <b>Muck</b> did not show the king how to stop the slippers, the latter ran and ran until he passed out. He was very angry, confiscated the magic items and chased <b>Muck</b> away. After an eight-hour march, Little <b>Muck</b> finally reached the border of a small country.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{exploratory}} dig, and of the earlier investigations, Jones' contract was extended and she was appointed director of the full scale excavations. She was joined by her husband Tom and in 1965 (after the crops had been harvested) they began the mammoth task that was to last for the next 14years on the <b>Mucking</b> hill top. The excavation was unusual in that it continued through the winter, unlike most excavations which only took place in the summer. The need to stay ahead of the gravel extraction sometimes meant softening the frozen ground with a blow torch to enable a find to be lifted in time.|$|E
25|$|Loch Vennachar {{suffered}} another {{serious accident}} on 12 November 1901, after {{a collision with}} the SS Cato, in the Thames Estuary. After arriving in the Thames, she anchored off the <b>Mucking</b> Light. Just before dawn, she was cut down and holed on the starboard bow by Cato, with one hand being seriously injured. She rapidly sank in 40 feet of water, but all hands, along with the parrot and cat, got clear safely. She rested {{on the bottom of}} the Thames for a month before being raised and repaired at considerable cost, and again put back into service in the Adelaide and Melbourne trade.|$|E
25|$|Evidence across {{southern}} and central England increasingly shows {{the persistence of}} prehistoric and Roman field layouts into and, in some cases throughout, the Anglo-Saxon period, whether or not such fields were continuously ploughed. Landscapes at Yarnton, Oxfordshire, and <b>Mucking,</b> Essex, remained unchanged throughout the 5th century, while at Barton Court, Oxfordshire, the 'grid of ditched paddocks or closes' of a Roman villa estate formed a general framework for the Anglo-Saxon settlement there. Similar evidence has been found at Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire. The Romano-British fields at Church Down in Chalton and Catherington, both in Hampshire, Bow Brickhill, Buckinghamshire, and Havering, Essex, were all ploughed {{as late as the}} 7th century.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} a recent trend in public cardroom rules to limit the ability of players to request to see <b>mucked</b> losing hands at the showdown.
