5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxation</b> and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorylation: cTnI was {{the first}} sarcomeric protein {{identified}} to be a substrate of PKA. Phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/Ser24 under adrenergic stimulation enhances relaxation of cardiac muscle, which is critical to cardiac function especially at fast heart rate. Whereas PKA phosphorylation of Ser23/Ser24 decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and increases relaxation, phosphorylation of Ser42/Ser44 by PKC increases Ca2+ sensitivity and decreases cardiac <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxation.</b> Ser5/Ser6, Tyr26, Thr31, Ser39, Thr51, Ser77, Thr78, Thr129, Thr143 and Ser150 are also phosphorylation sites in human cTnI.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin {{has a single}} blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxation</b> and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The {{bottlenose dolphin}} typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole {{two to three times}} per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} (DM) is a {{neuromuscular disorder}} inherited autosomal dominantly. It affects multiple organs including skeletal muscle, heart, brain, eye, endocrine, and gastrointestinal systems (1). It {{is characterized by}} progressive muscle weakness and wasting and difficulty in <b>muscles</b> <b>relaxation</b> after contraction (myotonia). It is a rare disease and has an incidence of 1 / 8000 and a prevalence of 2. 1 to 14. 3 / 100, 000 worldwide (1). The onset commonly occurs during young adulthood; however, it can occur at any age and its clinic presentation shows extreme variability in degree of severity (2).

5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxation</b> and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is a short-acting {{benzodiazepine}} {{in adults}} with an elimination half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours. In the elderly, {{as well as}} young children and adolescents, the elimination half-life is longer. Midazolam is metabolised into an active metabolite alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Age-related deficits, renal and liver status affect the pharmacokinetic factors of midazolam {{as well as its}} active metabolite. However, the active metabolite of midazolam is minor and contributes to only 10 percent of biological activity of midazolam. Midazolam is poorly absorbed orally, with only 50 percent of the drug reaching the bloodstream. Midazolam is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation. The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of midazolam are due to its effects on the GABAA receptors; midazolam does not activate GABAA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptors (↑ frequency of Cl− channel opening) resulting in neural inhibition. Almost all of the properties {{can be explained by the}} actions of benzodiazepines on GABAA receptors. This results in the following pharmacological properties being produced: sedation, induction of sleep, reduction in anxiety, anterograde amnesia, <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxation</b> and anticonvulsant effects.|$|E

40|$|Squat and stoop lifting {{have been}} {{examined}} in some detail, but limited data exist regarding the sudden release of load during such lifting. Ten participants performed squat and stoop lifting trials with loads of 20, 40, 60 and 80 N, and sudden release was randomly included {{in one of the}} lifting cycles. Postural perturbation was recorded via centre of pressure displacement using a force platform and the electromyographic response of trunk and lower limb muscles was recorded. Results indicated that irrespective of lifting posture, an 'ankle' response strategy to sudden release was elicited, where the anterior muscles of the lower limb contracted first, followed by the anterior trunk <b>muscles,</b> <b>relaxation</b> of the posterior trunk <b>muscles</b> and, finally, <b>relaxation</b> of the posterior lower limb muscles. The latency of muscles responding by contraction tended to decrease slightly with increasing load for both postures, while the latency of <b>muscles</b> responding by <b>relaxation</b> increased, resulting in increased trunk muscle co-contraction durations. The postural disturbance appeared to be greater for squat lifting than stoop lifting at the higher loads of 60 and 80 N, as the centre of pressure moves significantly closer to the posterior limit of static stability (the line joining the heels). In terms of stability and muscular response, squat lifting {{may not be the most}} appropriate strategy if a sudden release of loads greater than approximately 50 N is likely.

25|$|Sildenafil protects cyclic {{guanosine}} monophosphate (cGMP) from degradation by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to guanylate cyclase receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxation</b> (vasodilation) of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries. This smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxation</b> leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection. Robert F.

50|$|The rectum ampulla (anatomically also: ampulla recti) {{temporarily}} stores fecal waste. As {{the waste}} fills the rectum and expands the rectal walls, nervous system stretch receptors in the rectal walls stimulate {{the desire to}} defecate. This urge to defecate arises from the reflex contraction of rectal <b>muscles,</b> <b>relaxation</b> of the internal anal sphincter, and an initial contraction of the skeletal muscle of the external anal sphincter. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the colon by reverse peristalsis, where more water is absorbed and the faeces is stored until the next mass peristaltic movement of the transverse and descending colon. If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period the fecal matter may harden, resulting in constipation. If defecation occurs too fast, before excess liquid is absorbed, diarrhea may occur.|$|R

40|$|Controversy abounds in {{the cardiac}} muscle {{literature}} over the rate-limiting steps of cardiac <b>muscle</b> con-traction and <b>relaxation.</b> However, {{the idea of}} a single biochemical mechanism being the all-inclusive rate-limiting step for cardiac <b>muscle</b> contraction and <b>relaxation</b> may be oversimplified. There is ample evidence that Ca 2 þ concentration and dynamics, intrinsic cross-bridge properties, and even troponin C (TnC) Ca 2 þ binding and dissociation can all modulate the mechanical events of cardiac <b>muscle</b> contraction and <b>relaxation.</b> However, TnC has generally been thought to play no role in influen-cing cardiac muscle dynamics due to the idea that Ca 2 þ exchange with TnC is very rapid. This definitely is the case for isolated TnC, but not for the more sophisticated biochemical systems of reconstituted thin filaments and myofibrils. This review will discuss the biochemical influences on Ca 2 þ exchange with TnC and their physiological implications...|$|R
40|$|Relaxin is {{involved}} in a variety of functions. Among them, relaxin influences gastrointesti-nal motility in mice mainly regulating the biosynthesis of nitric oxide, considered as the main substance causing smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>relaxations.</b> Relaxin is able to regulate the different nitric oxide synthase expression depending on the gut region considered. Relaxin also counteracts the hypermotility state, related to a defective nitric oxide production, observed in the gut of dystrophic (mdx) mice. From the above considerations, it appears that relaxin, in addition to its physiological roles, may be regarded as a therapeutic tool in gastrointestinal diseases characterized pathogenically by an altered nitric oxide production. Key words Relaxin, nitric oxide; gastrointestinal motility The possibility that relaxin (RLX) might be involved in the control of gastrointes-tinal motility by regulating nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis, as it does in other smooth muscle target organs (3), was investigated.

NO generation from NO gas aqueous solution or acidified nitrite was not affected, but that from S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) was attenuated by ebselen, and the attenuation was reserved by glutathione. Both glutathione and cupric sulphate altered the ultraviolet spectrum of ebselen. These {{findings suggest that}} ebselen at high concentrations nonselectively inhibited NO-mediated responses, possibly through inhibiting soluble guanylate cyclase. Ebselen {{does not appear to}} directly interact with NO, but it may inhibit NO release from nitrosothiols by a thiol- and/or copper-dependent mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Some {{reports have}} {{suggested}} occurrence of expiratory upper airway narrowing {{in patients with}} obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during sleep and in awake humans during respiratory <b>muscles</b> <b>relaxation.</b> This {{is compatible with the}} hypothesis that upper airway muscles are activated during expiration. We studied five healthy volunteers and four patients with OSA in a tank respirator (Emerson; Cambridge, Mass). Supraglottic pressure (Psg) was measured with a catheter with the tip at the retroepiglottic level, tidal volume with an inductance plethysmograph and airflow with a pneumotachograph at the mouth. Diaphragmatic electromyogram was recorded with an esophageal bipolar electrode. Measurements were done at - 30 cm H 2 O. Subjects were asked to breathe in phase with the respirator and then to relax their <b>muscles.</b> During muscular <b>relaxation,</b> there was supraglottic obstruction and now limitation. This was observed during both inspiration and expiration. Upper airway obstruction was more severe in patients with OSA than in healthy subjects. In two healthy volunteers, fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed a wide-open oropharyngeal isthmus during active breathing that narrowed during muscular relaxation. This was true during both inspiration and expiration. We conclude that muscular relaxation is associated with upper airway narrowing and flow limitation occurring during both inspiration and expiration. We suggest that to preserve an open upper airway, airway muscles have to be activated during both inspiration and expiration...|$|R
