60|$|He {{went to one}} of {{the doors}} that was on the {{right-hand}} side of this room, and opened it a little way; but the wind and rain came in so violently that he thought he would go to the opposite side and try that door. This idea proved a very fortunate one, for, being now on the sheltered side of the ship, he could open the door and look out without exposing himself to the fury of the storm. He gazed for a time at the raging fury of the sea with a sentiment of profound admiration and awe. The surface of the ocean was covered with foam, and the waves were tossing themselves up in prodigious heaps; the crests, as fast as they were formed, being seized and hurled away by the wind in a <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> spray, which went scudding over the water like drifting snow in a wintry storm on land.|$|R
50|$|The <b>driving</b> wheels <b>of</b> the S6 had {{the rather}} unusual {{diameter}} of 2,100 mm {{in order to}} keep the rpm down and to guarantee the smooth running <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> gear. Originally a diameter of 2,200 mm had been planned, but in the end it was reduced by 100 mm. The heavy balancing <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> gear were badly affected by weight savings. That resulted in serious jerkiness when running. A remedy was achieved by coupling the tender closer to the locomotive and thus raising the compression of the buffer springs.|$|R

40|$|Using the ASTE 10 m {{submillimeter}} {{telescope and}} the 1. 4 m Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF), we performed an extensive outflow survey in the Orion Molecular Cloud - 2 and - 3 region. Our survey, which includes 41 potential star-forming sites, has been newly compiled using multi-wavelength data based on millimeter- and submillimeter-continuum observations {{as well as}} radio continuum observations. From the CO (3 - 2) observations performed with the ASTE 10 m telescope, we detected 14 CO molecular outflows, seven of which were newly identified. This higher detection rate, as compared to previous CO (1 - 0) results in the same region, suggests that CO (3 - 2) {{may be a better}} outflow tracer. Physical properties of these outflows and their possible driving sources were derived. Derived parameters were compared with those of CO outflows in low- and high-mass starforming regions. We show that the CO outflow momentum correlates with the bolometric luminosity <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> source and with the envelope <b>mass,</b> regardless <b>of</b> the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> sources.

He could make out only a blurred <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> climbing trees on one side and a strip of foam cutting through the black level, which he supposed was water, in front of him. His trained ears, however, gave him a little information, for the clamor of the flood was broken by a sharp snapping and crashing which he knew was made by a <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> driftwood <b>driving</b> furiously against the boulders. In that region, the river banks are encumbered here and there with great logs, partly burned by forest fires, reaped by gales or brought down from the hillsides by falls of frost-loosened soil. A flood higher than usual sets them floating, and on subsiding sometimes leaves them packed in a gorge or stranded in a shallow to wait for the next big rise. Now they were driving down and, as Salter had said, jamming at the head of the rapid.|$|R

60|$|This {{proposal}} was readily agreed {{to on the}} part of the boys, and the compact was accordingly made. They engaged the boat and the man, and after dinner they all three embarked. The rain had ceased, but the sky was covered with clouds, and heavy <b>masses</b> <b>of</b> mist were <b>driving</b> along the sides and over the summits of the mountains. The weather, however, remained tolerably favorable until the boat had nearly reached the opposite shore of the lake; but then a dense <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> clouds came down from the mountains on the eastern side, and the whole shore was soon concealed from view by the driving scuds and the falling rain. The boatman pulled hard to reach the shore before the shower should come on. The gust overtook them, however, when they were about a quarter of a mile from the landing. Fortunately the wind, though very violent, was fair, and it drove them on towards the shore. Mr. George and the boys sat down in the bottom of the boat, at the stern, and spreading a large umbrella behind them, they sheltered themselves as well as they could from the wind and the rain. The poor boatman got very wet.|$|R

40|$|Plug-in Electric Vehicles (EV) offer a {{clean and}} cost {{effective}} means {{in the long run}} <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> short to <b>medium</b> distances within the city, even with the current high purchase cost. In Australia EV may be attractive as a second car in the multicar household. The acceptance of EV requires a change in behaviour – instead of re-fuelling, this vehicle requires battery charging each 140 - 160 km, either at home or at specialised charging stations. A limited number of EVs are being driven in Perth as part of the Western Australia Electric Vehicle trial (WA EV trial). The trial monitors the performance, benefits, infrastructure and practical implications of EV fleet. This paper explores the opinions and experiences of 43 of the participants. Factor analysis and multiple regression are applied to identify the main motivators and barriers in purchasing and using an EV. Ninety per cent of respondents are confident about driving the EV; more than 45 % take trips of more than 30 km. While zero tailpipe emissions is the most desirable feature of EV, followed closely by home charging, the limited range of the vehicle is regarded as the most serious barrier to EV uptake. The overall satisfaction with the EV performance is high (an average score of 3. 96 out of 5), although 13 participants experienced at least one technical difficulty, when driving the EVs in the trial. Two latent constructs reflecting environmental concerns, and technology learning, along with EV benefits and technical difficulties experienced while driving an EV explain 59. 2 % of the variability of the willingness to purchase an EV as the next vehicle...|$|R

An attempt was also made to analyze the mixing flow mathematically by integration of the equation of motion, {{with the aid of}} conventional formulas for the turbulent shearing stress, but this succeeded only approximately for the very simplified case that a driving jet is introduced in an unlimited parallel flow, while the pressure over the whole mixing field is assumed to be constant. In spite of these dissimilar assumptions for the theory and the experiment, the form of the measured and the computed velocity profiles indicates a very high degree of approximation.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} energy dissipation rate in sinusoidally driven boxes which are partly filled by granular material {{under conditions of}} weightlessness.

Both regimes correspond to different dissipation mechanisms, leading to different scaling with amplitude and frequency of the excitation and with the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the granulate. For the collect-and-collide regime, we explain the dependence on frequency and amplitude of the excitation by means of an effective one-particle model. For both regimes, the results may be collapsed to a single curve characterizing the physics of granular dampers. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Due to high {{efficiency}} in helping breaking rocks, positive displacement motor has a widespread application {{in the field}} of oil and gas drilling engineering. However, service life of positive displacement motor becomes shorter resulting from failure <b>of</b> the <b>driving</b> shaft thread.

40|$|Gear {{rattle of}} {{multi-step}} helical gear system is treated. Mesh stiffness variations and higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque are {{considered in the}} system. The effects of higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque are studied by numerical analysis. As a result, the followings were made clear. (1) In the resonance region of lower mode, when the frequency <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque is nearly equal to the one which is the natural frequency of higher mode divided by some integer, the response contains the higher mode and its amplitude of acceleration becomes large. However this phenomenon is not so affected by the higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque. (2) First harmonic <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque generates higher harmonic resonance and higher harmonic <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque generates the main resonance, hence the interaction of these two resonances makes the amplitude of the resonance large. (3) Because of interaction of higher harmonics <b>of</b> <b>driving</b> torque and mesh stiffness variation, resonances like gear noise occur with many side-bands in low frequency region, and {{the region of the}} rattles becomes wide.
