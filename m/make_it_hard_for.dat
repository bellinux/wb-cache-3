25|$|For {{many years}} from the 1950s onwards, vast dams and {{irrigation}} schemes were constructed, causing a massive rise in water-borne infections from schistosomiasis. The detailed specifications laid out in various UN documents since the 1950s could have minimized this problem. Irrigation schemes can be designed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the snails to colonize the water and to reduce the contact with the local population. Even though guidelines on how to design these schemes to minimise {{the spread of the}} disease had been published years before, the designers were unaware of them. The dams appear to have reduced the population of the large migratory prawn Macrobrachium. After the construction of fourteen large dams, greater increases in schistosomiasis occurred in the historical habitats of native prawns than in other areas. Further, at the 1986 Diama Dam on the Senegal River, restoring prawns upstream of the dam reduced both snail density and the human schistosomiasis reinfection rate.|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and control structure is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E
500|$|Several {{lines in}} the episode were re-recorded. During post-production, editors feared that Rich's mumbly voice would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> viewers to {{understand}} what he was saying, so he was brought back in to re-record his dialogue, which was then dubbed over the footage. In addition, during the scene wherein Mulder tells Scully Bobby's nickname at school, the original version featured Mulder saying [...] "Dickweed". Fox's standards and practices department made the show change the name to [...] "Dorkweed", which required David Duchovny to re-dub his line.|$|E

500|$|The {{constitution}} {{was to be}} ratified by state conventions, with nine approvals necessary for it to come into force. In practice, opposition by large states such as New York or Virginia would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the new government to function. Mason remained {{a member of the}} House of Delegates, and in late October 1787, the legislature called a convention for June 1788; in language crafted by John Marshall, it decreed that the Virginia Ratifying Convention would be allowed [...] "free and ample discussion". Mason was less influential in his final session in the House of Delegates because of his strong opposition to ratification, and his age (61) may also have caused him to be less effective.|$|E
500|$|On {{his first}} day for filming series three, Penry-Jones participated in a fight scene {{in the middle of}} the first episode. He felt a little wary {{replacing}} Matthew Macfadyen. After two months of filming, Penry-Jones began to feel more at ease with the role. He felt especially so after he started working for the fourth series. He returned to the fourth series because he thought his character took off by the end of the last series, and wanted to see which direction he would go to next. The crew wanted Adam to go from a [...] "happy-go-lucky" [...] figure to wanting him to deal with things that would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Adam to be jokey towards the end of the fourth series; this involved Fiona's death.|$|E

[...] "It's huge in soap terms... She's a {{character}} people love to hate—you just assumed she would be there forever." [...] When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit {{would have on the}} soap, Murphy had this to say: [...] "characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [...] has very few of those now." [...] Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added [...] " [...] an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of EastEnders for so many years." [...] However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting [...] "How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [...] Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago".|$|E

500|$|The track list, while well {{received}} {{for the most}} part, {{was found to be}} one of the weaker features. While Helgeson and others noted that the track list was [...] "extremely diverse and for the most part well selected", this diversity was found to work against the game as well. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com noted that with the diverse track list, there would be a good chance players would find songs they liked, but at the same time, would also find songs they loathed. Brudvig noted that while [...] "the goal was to include a bit of everything", the diversity of the track list ensures [...] "that nobody will like everything on the disc". Gies noted that while the guitar difficulty progression in the Career mode was strong and better than in previous games, it leaves the vocals and drummer progression [...] "all over the place", while Schiesel considered the vocals parts [...] "somewhat rough" [...] in comparison to [...] Haywald noted that the singing portions of the game were still weak, with poor indicators to help the player's performance, and with the possibility of multiple vocalists performing at the same time, would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> a player to keep track of his pitch. While reviews appreciated Activision's efforts to allow the importing of songs from previous games, the small amount of tracks that were available at launch felt at odds with the impression that Activision had made of the process prior to the game's release. The improvements made in GHTunes were seen as [...] "leaps and bounds" [...] above the original offering in World Tour, though was still considered to be too unwieldy for average players.|$|E

The defender marking the thrower essentially tries to force them to throw in a particular direction (to the [...] "force side" [...] or [...] "open side"), whilst making {{it difficult for them to}} throw in the opposite direction (the [...] "break side"). Downfield defenders <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the receiving players to get free on the open/force side, knowing throws to the break side are less likely to be accurate. The space is divided in this way because it is very hard for the player marking the disc to stop every throw, and very hard for the downfield defenders to cover every space.|$|E

2500|$|FFL uses [...] "pro-women" [...] {{arguments}} {{in order to}} convince women that abortion is [...] "immoral". Goltz argued that the legalization of abortion allowed sexually exploitative men to avoid responsibilities, like paying for child support, and run away from their actions. FFL argues that abortion comes from gender inequality. In response to Roe v. Wade, Callaghan made several claims, including that abortion causes bodily injury to women [...] "in a third to a half of the cases", and that the Supreme Court legalized abortion because they [...] "hate poor and unwed mothers". This claim is called [...] "unsubstantiated" [...] by professor Kelsy Kretschmer. However, Kretschmer does explain {{that the goal of}} these arguments were to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> men and women to consider abortion a [...] "feminist" [...] victory.|$|E
2500|$|Spill {{occurs when}} sound is {{detected}} by a microphone {{not intended to}} pick it up (for example, the vocals being detected by the microphone for the guitar). [...] Spill is often undesirable in popular music recording, as the combined signals during the mix process can cause phase cancellation and may cause difficulty in processing individual tracks. It also causes difficulty in overdubbing, where the spill from the sound being replaced may still be audible on other channels. For sound reinforcement in live shows, mic bleed can <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the sound engineer to control the levels of the different instruments and vocals onstage. For example, if an electric guitarist's loud amplifier is bleeding into the drum and vocal mics, it may be hard for the sound engineer to reduce the volume of the guitar in the onstage mix.|$|E

She admitted that she loved the journey the couple had been on as they try to start a family, although she thought Sonya might go over the top with the situation, which would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> those around her. She also believed that Sonya and Toadie would make [...] "wonderful parents" [...] because of the amount of thought they had put into the decision. She added that Toadie has always wanted a child of his own, while Sonya wanted to make up for her past problems. After failing to fall pregnant, Sonya gave up hope that she and Toadie would naturally conceive a child and she went through a [...] "mourning process", before trying to move on. During a blood drive, Sonya was asked to take a pregnancy test and it came back positive. Both Sonya and Toadie were shocked, but delighted to learn that they were expecting a baby.|$|E

Doctor Doom also attempts to use the Hulk as his slave during two issues of The Incredible Hulk. The character also made several appearances in the story arcs of Super-Villain Team-Up, starting in 1975, as well as appearances in Marvel Team-Up, beginning with issue #42 (February 1976). In August 1981, Doom also made an appearance in Iron Man when the two traveled to Camelot, where Stark thwarted Doom 's attempt to solicit the aide of Morgan le Fay; Doom swore deadly vengeance for that interference, which stranded him in the past - this vengeance had to be indefinitely delayed in the interest of returning to the present day. A particularly detailed plan saw Doom ally with the Puppet Master to trap the Fantastic Four within the miniature artificial city of [...] "Liddleville", their minds trapped inside tiny cybernetic, part-organic copies of their original bodies. However, Doom perverts what had been intended by the Puppet Master as a chance to give Alicia and Ben a normal life into a trap, deliberately disrupting Reed's connection to his copy to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> him to concentrate while [...] "Vincent Vaughn"- Doom's alias as he monitors the project- belittles him, and the Puppet Master eventually helps the FF learn the truth and escape Liddleville while trapping Doom in the android body he had used to monitor the FF.|$|E
