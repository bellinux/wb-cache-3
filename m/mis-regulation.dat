40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs of 20 - 24 nt in length. They {{are bound}} {{by members of the}} Argonaute protein family and play {{important}} roles in various processes including development, cellular homeostasis or response to external stimuli. <b>Mis-regulations</b> of miRNAs cause diseases such as cancers. In several chapters, this thesis describes miRNA profiles, miRNA and Argonaute protein characteristics as well as the de novo description of miRNAs and small RNAs in different cellular and organismal systems. The four human Argonaute (Ago) proteins are highly similar proteins. One distinct difference is the enzymatic activity of Ago 2 (Meister et al., 2004), however, detailed studies on the relationship between Ago proteins have been few. This work shows that Ago 2 is the most abundant Ago protein in the human cell lines HEK 293 T and HeLa (Petri et al., 2011). Ago 1 and Ago 3 are expressed only to a minor amount, whereas Ago 4 expression is hardly detectable. Re-analysis of their enzymatic activity showed that Ago 2 remains the only Ago protein capable of cleaving RNA targets (Hauptmann et al., 2013). Following this lead, it could also be demonstrated that not only do Ago 1 and Ago 3 have difficulties in replacing the passenger strand (the strand of a small RNA duplex that usually gets degraded), but that by increasing the stability of the duplex, on-target effects of an siRNA could be elevated and off-target effects could be alleviated (Petri et al., 2011). To investigate the potential differences of the four Ago proteins with respect to their miRNA-binding properties, the distribution and the characteristics of miRNAs bound to endogenous Ago proteins were analyzed. By isolating Ago proteins using specific immunoprecipitation, cloning and sequencing of bound miRNAs, it could be shown that Ago proteins bind very similar sets of miRNAs. These miRNAs have in 10 to 20...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a live organism is a tightly regulated process. During {{the first phase of}} development, two specialized cells (the gametes) undergo a dramatic re-arrangement of their genetic material in order to form the zygote. The zygotic genome is considered totipotent, that is, totally unrestricted in its developmental potential. Such a peculiar state is attained through a process called epigenetic reprogramming. The epigenetic settings of the parental genome are remodeled to acquire totipotency. Epigenetic reprogramming is achieved by means of covalent chemical modification at the chromatin level, including histone tail modifications and DNA methylation. Another method by which epigenetic reprogramming is accomplished includes non covalent remodeling of the chromatin architecture. The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome; the nucleosome is constituted by 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. Eukaryotic cells possess a family of remodeling complexes that are able to actively reassemble the nucleosome onto the DNA template; these are called the SNF 2 -type ATP dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. These ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes contain an ATPase subunit that belongs to the SNF 2 superfamily. Relatively {{little is known about the}} role of these complexes during early embryonic development. The objective of this dissertation was to investigate the role played by SNF 2 -type ATP dependent chromatin remodeling complexes in nuclear reprogramming during porcine cleavage development. The purpose of this dissertation was also to test the hypothesis that <b>mis-regulation</b> of ATP dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes may be detrimental for correct embryogenesis. We tested our hypothesis via <b>mis-regulation</b> of SNF 2 -type chromatin remodeling ATPases brahma and Brg 1. We showed that altering the transcript levels of brahma and Brg 1 resulted in impaired embryonic development. Moreover we characterized how <b>mis-regulation</b> of brahma and Brg 1 has a deep impact on the expression pattern of key developmental genes. We also linked SNF 2 -type chromatin remodeling to epigenetic reprogramming following somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Our results showed possible beneficial applications for manipulation of the SNF 2 -type chromatin remodeling repertoire prior to SCNT. ...|$|E

40|$|Mitosis is {{a tightly}} {{regulated}} fundamental process and its <b>mis-regulation</b> is {{commonly associated with}} tumourigenesis. IQ-domain GTPase-activating Protein- 1 (IQGAP 1) is a scaffold protein that interacts with many proteins implicated in mitosis. IQGAP 1 is essential for successful completion of cytokinesis in yeast but its role in mammalian mitosis remains unknown. The novel mitotic functions of IQGAP 1 in mammalian cells were examined in this thesis. During mitosis, IQGAP 1 phosphorylation at Ser- 86, Ser- 330 and Thr- 1434 are significantly up-regulated. Thr- 1434 is identified as a substrate of cyclin A-CDK 2 and cyclin A/B-CDK 1 complexes in vitro. Depletion of IQGAP 1 results in numerical centrosome abnormality, chromosome misalignment, and <b>mis-regulation</b> of astral microtubule activities. These functions are dependent on the three mitotic phosphorylation sites identified. IQGAP 1 also regulates the expression levels and localisation of dynein and the Gαi/LGN/NuMA complex, which explains the atypical distribution of astral microtubules at the cell cortex in IQGAP 1 -depleted cells. IQGAP 1 is not required for recruitment and contractility of the actinomyosin contractile ring for ingression. Instead, phosphorylation at Ser- 330 coordinates efficient reassembly of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) for abscission completion. This thesis revealed the diverse roles of IQGAP 1 in regulating mitosis, which may ultimately lead {{to the discovery of}} new anti-cancer therapeutic targets.

40|$|The {{activation}} of several transcription factors {{is required for}} the elimination of infectious pathogens via the innate immune response. The transcription factors NF-jB, AP- 1, and STAT play major roles in the synthesis of immune effector molecules during innate immune responses. However, the fact that these immune responses can have cytotoxic effects requires their tight regulation to achieve restricted and transient activation, and <b>mis-regulation</b> of the damping process has pathological consequences. Here we show that AP- 1 and STAT are themselves the major inhibitors responsible for damping NF-jB–mediated transcriptional activation during the innate immune response in Drosophila. As the levels of dAP- 1 and Stat 92 E increase due to continuous immune signaling, they play a repressive role by forming a repressosome complex with the Drosophila HMG protein, Dsp 1. The dAP- 1 –, Stat 92 E-, and Dsp 1 -containing complexes replace Relish at the promoters of diverse immune effector genes by binding to evolutionarily conserved cis-elements, and they recruit histone deacetylase to inhibit transcription. Reduction by mutation of dAP- 1, Stat 92 E, or Dsp 1 results in hyper{{activation of}} Relish target genes and reduces the viability of bacterially infected flies despite more efficient pathogen clearance. These defects are rescued by reducing the Relish copy number, thus confirming that <b>mis-regulation</b> of Relish, not inadequate activation of dAP- 1, Stat 92 E, or Dsp 1 target genes, is responsible for the reduced survival of the mutants. We conclude that an inhibitory effect of AP- 1 and STAT on NF-jB is required for properly balanced immune responses and appears to be evolutionarily conserved...|$|E

We identify a chromatin-modifying network, which regulates this lifespan extension. We further show that this trans-generational lifespan extension is dependent on a hormonal signaling pathway involving the steroid dafachronic acid, an activator of the nuclear receptor DAF- 12. These findings suggest that loss of the demethylase SPR- 5 causes H 3 K 4 me 2 <b>mis-regulation</b> and activation of a known lifespan-regulating signaling pathway, leading to trans-generational lifespan extension...|$|E

Second, we find that association between TDP- 43 {{and many of its}} TE targets is reduced in FTLD patients.

40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} type 1 (DM 1) is a multi-systemic disorder {{caused by}} a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion (CTG(exp)) in the DMPK gene. In skeletal muscle, nuclear sequestration of the alternative splicing factor muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL 1) explains {{the majority of the}} alternative splicing defects observed in the HSA(LR) transgenic mouse model which expresses a pathogenic range CTG(exp). In the present study, we addressed the possibility that MBNL 1 sequestration by CUG(exp) RNA also contributes to splicing defects in the mammalian brain. We examined RNA from the brains of homozygous Mbnl 1 (ΔE 3 /ΔE 3) knockout mice using splicing-sensitive microarrays. We used RT-PCR to validate a subset of alternative cassette exons identified by microarray analysis with brain tissues from Mbnl 1 (ΔE 3 /ΔE 3) knockout mice and post-mortem DM 1 patients. Surprisingly, splicing-sensitive microarray analysis of Mbnl 1 (ΔE 3 /ΔE 3) brains yielded only 14 candidates for mis-spliced exons. While we confirmed that several of these splicing events are perturbed in both Mbnl 1 knockout and DM 1 brains, the extent of splicing <b>mis-regulation</b> in the mouse model was significantly less than observed in DM 1. Additionally, several alternative exons, including Grin 1 exon 4, App exon 7 and Mapt exons 3 and 9, which have previously been reported to be aberrantly spliced in human DM 1 brain, were spliced normally in the Mbnl 1 knockout brain. The sequestration of MBNL 1 by CUG(exp) RNA results in some of the aberrant splicing events in the DM 1 brain. However, we conclude that other factors, possibly other MBNL proteins, likely contribute to splicing <b>mis-regulation</b> in the DM 1 brain...|$|E

We have identified Dicer and the RNA interference pathway as having an essential role in the nucleolus of quiescent Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells, distinct from pericentromeric silencing, by controlling RNA polymerase I release.

In particular, downregulation of gene expression by induction of G-quadruplex DNA structures at promotorial level is an attractive anticancer strategy. In humans, two guanine-rich sequences (h_kit 1 and h_kit 2) were identified in the promotorial region of the proto-oncogene KIT. Their stabilization into G-quadruplex structures can find applications {{in the treatment of}} leukemias, mastocytosis, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, lung carcinomas, which are often associated to c-kit <b>mis-regulation.</b> Here we screeneed libraries of G-quadruplex binders to identify novel hits highly selective for the G-quadruplexes of KIT promoter. To provide the biological rationale for the molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of this novel therapeutic approach, a full characterization of target selectivity, DNA complex formation and cellular effects has been performed. To ultimately provide the required knowledge to convert the identified hits into new species-specific targeted drugs, we searched for a robust translational model too. Interestingly, the most common skin cancer in domestic dog, mast cell tumor, is also linked to a mutation and/or to an over-expression of c-kit. Moreover, a general conserved promotorial sequence between the two species has been confirmed, thus supporting dog as an excellent animal model. In particular, the conformational features of the canine kit 1 sequence are substantially shared with the human one. Conversely, two isoforms of the kit 2 sequences were identified and, in comparison with the human counterpart, both of them showed an altered distribution among several folded conformations.

In this study, we present evidence that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway might be activated in prostate cancer cells after androgen-deprivation to promote androgen-independent growth, partly through enhanced interaction of β-catenin with TCF 4. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cells were more prone to activate a Wnt-reporter, and inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway increased sensitivity of these cells to the second-generation antiandrogen, enzalutamide.

In the develop-ing Drosophila wing and eye, loss of apical Spectrins (alpha/beta-heavy dimers) produces tissue overgrowth and <b>mis-regulation</b> of Hippo target genes, similar to loss of Crumbs (Crb) or the FERM-domain protein Expanded (Ex). Apical beta-heavy Spectrin binds to Ex and co-localises with it at the apical membrane to antagonise Yki activity. Interestingly, in both the ovarian follicular epithelium and intestinal epithelium of Drosophila, apical Spectrins and Crb are dispensable for repression of Yki, while basolateral Spectrins (alpha/beta dimers) are essential. Finally, the Spectrin cytoskeleton is required to regulate the localisation of the Hippo pathway effec-tor YAP in response to cell density human epithelial cells.

Like Mba 1 and Oxa 1, Mdm 38 is an inner membrane protein that interacts with ribosomes and is involved in respiratory chain biogenesis. We find that simultaneous loss of Mba 1 and Mdm 38 causes severe synthetic defects in the biogenesis of cytochrome reductase and cytochrome oxidase. These defects are not due to a compromised membrane binding of ribosomes but the consequence of a <b>mis-regulation</b> in the synthesis of Cox 1 and cytochrome b.

Hyperthermic seizures are independent from dystrophic muscle degeneration and rely on neurotransmission, which suggests involvement of the DGC in muscle-neuron communication. Additionally, reduction of the Ca 2 + regulator, Calmodulin or Ca 2 + channel blockage rescues the seizing phenotype, pointing to Ca 2 + <b>mis-regulation</b> in dystrophic muscles. Also, Dys and Dg mutants have antagonistically abnormal cellular levels of ROS, suggesting that the DGC has a function in regulation of muscle cell homeostasis.

In mammals, meiosis onset is before birth in females, or at puberty in males, and {{recent studies have}} uncovered several regulatory steps involved in initiating meiosis in each sex. Evidence suggests that retinoic acid (RA) induces expression of the critical pre-meiosis gene Stra 8 in germ cells of the fetal ovary, pubertal testis and adult testis. In the fetal testis, CYP 26 B 1 degrades RA, while FGF 9 further antagonises RA signalling to suppress meiosis. Failsafe mechanisms involving Nanos 2 may further suppress meiosis in the fetal testis. Here, we draw together the growing knowledge relating to these meiotic control mechanisms, and present evidence that they are co-ordinately regulated and that additional factors remain to be identified. Understanding this regulatory network will illuminate not only how the foundations of mammalian reproduction are laid, but also how <b>mis-regulation</b> of these steps can result in infertility or germline tumours.

40|$|Dysregulation of {{alternative}} splicing (AS) {{is one of}} the molecular hallmarks of cancer, with splicing alteration of numerous genes in cancer patients. However, studying splicing <b>mis-regulation</b> in cancer is complicated by the large noise generated from tissue-specific splicing. To obtain a global picture of cancer-specific splicing, we analyzed transcriptome sequencing data from 1149 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas project, producing a core set of AS events significantly altered across multiple cancer types. These cancer-specific AS events are highly conserved, are more likely to maintain protein reading frame, and mainly function in cell cycle, cell adhesion/migration, and insulin signaling pathways. Furthermore, these events can serve as new molecular biomarkers to distinguish cancer from normal tissues, to separate cancer subtypes, and to predict patient survival. We also found that most genes whose expression is closely associated with cancer-specific splicing are key regulators of the cell cycle. This study uncovers a common set of cancer-specific AS events altered across multiple cancers, providing mechanistic insight into how splicing is mis-regulated in cancers...|$|E

Most of the copper ions in our bodies exist as the protein-bound form and function as active sites for enzymatic reactions. Also, the level of copper ions in our bodies is strictly controlled, and even slight deviation of the copper ions in physiological conditions will lead to pathological conditions and sometimes fatal diseases. Here, we investigated the mechanism regulating the acquisition of copper ions by intracellular proteins and also examined the molecular pathomechanism of the disease caused by the <b>mis-regulation</b> of copper metabolism in the cell. More precisely, we have noted the activation mechanism of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD 1), which requires a copper ion for its enzymatic activity. Also, conformational changes of SOD 1 upon dissociation of metal ions have been examined and discussed {{in relation to the}} pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in {{the human}} LMNA gene {{encoding}} A-type lamins cause a collection of diseases termed laminopathies, including several types of muscular dystrophy. Lamins are intermediate filaments, which line the inner membrane of nuclear envelope. Lamins maintain the nuclear shape and regulate gene expression through interactions with chromatin. Heterozygous mutations LMNA, which result in single amino acid substitutions within the C-terminal Ig-fold domain, were identified in patients with muscular dystrophy. These substitutions were modeled in Drosophila and found to cause muscle defects. We have taken a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding the molecular basis of these muscle defects. Using Nuclear Magentic Resonance (NMR) and Circular Dischroism (CD) we determined that the amino acid substitutions cause perturbations of the tertiary, but not secondary, structure of the Ig-fold. Microarray analysis of RNA isolated from muscle revealed that mutant lamins cause cause <b>mis-regulation</b> of genes involved oxidative stress and neuromuscular junction function. Collectively, these data demonstrate that perturbations within the lamin Ig-fold cause changes in gene expression, providing insights on pathways involved in pathogenesis and identifying new potential therapeutic targets...|$|E
