5|$|Insect <b>mouthparts</b> show many {{examples}} of convergent evolution. The <b>mouthparts</b> of different insect groups consist {{of a set of}} homologous organs, specialised for the dietary intake of that insect group. Convergent evolution of many groups of insects led from original biting-chewing <b>mouthparts</b> to different, more specialised, derived function types. These include, for example, the proboscis of flower-visiting insects such as bees and flower beetles, or the biting-sucking <b>mouthparts</b> of blood-sucking insects such as fleas and mosquitos.|$|E
5|$|While mandibles or 'jaws' (chewing <b>mouthparts)</b> {{are only}} {{present in the}} {{caterpillar}} stage, the <b>mouthparts</b> of most adult Lepidoptera mainly consist of the sucking kind; this part {{is known as the}} proboscis or 'haustellum'. A few Lepidoptera species have reduced <b>mouthparts</b> and therefore do not feed in the adult state. Others, such as the basal family Micropterigidae, have <b>mouthparts</b> of the chewing kind.|$|E
5|$|Head: Prognathous. Antennae are segmented. Biting-type <b>mouthparts.</b> Ocelli absent. Compound eyes in most species, {{reduced or}} absent in some taxa.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to improve the cause-effect {{relationship}} between toxicant exposure and chironomid <b>mouthpart</b> deformities, by linking induction of <b>mouthpart</b> deformities to contaminated field sediments, metal mixtures and a mutagenic polycyclic aromatic compound metabolite (acridone). <b>Mouthpart</b> deformities in Chironomus riparius larvae were induced by both the heavy metal mixture and by acridone. A clear correlation between metal concentrations in the sediment and deformities incidence was only observed when the contaminated field sediments were left out of the analysis, probably because these natural sediments contained other toxic compounds, which could be responsible for a higher incidence of deformities than predicted by the measured metal concentrations only. The present study clearly improved the cause-effect relationship between toxicant exposure and the induction of <b>mouthpart</b> deformities. It is concluded that the incidence of <b>mouthpart</b> deformities may better reflect the potential toxicity of contaminated sediments than chemical analysis...|$|R
40|$|An in situ {{bioassay}} using <b>mouthpart</b> deformities in Chironomus riparius larvae {{was developed}} to monitor sediment toxicity, Second-instar larvae, along with a standardized amount of food and sediment taken from the study locations, were enclosed in cages that {{were placed on the}} sediment surface of rivers, <b>Mouthpart</b> deformities were screened after larval molting to the fourth instar (exposure time: 7 - 10 days). <b>Mouthpart</b> deformities of caged and field larvae (when present) were related to the estimated sediment toxicity, By summing toxicant concentrations and normalizing them to the organic matter and clay contents, a significant relationship between toxicity levels and <b>mouthpart</b> deformities in the mentum was revealed. Results suggest that the pattern of observed deformities was indicative of site toxicity rather than a characteristic of the laboratory larval population used. The main advantage of the proposed in situ bioassay is the possibility to assess the incidence of deformities at sites where C, riparius does not occur naturally.

5000|$|Omnidens, meaning [...] "all tooth", is a genus of Cambrian priapulids {{originally}} {{mistaken for}} a Parapeytoia <b>mouthpart.</b>|$|R
5|$|Head: The {{head has}} large {{compound}} eyes and if <b>mouthparts</b> are present, {{they are almost}} always a drinking straw-like proboscis.|$|E
5|$|The body becomes wider {{towards the}} head, {{which has a}} {{conspicuous}} mandibular groove. It also bears a pair of stalked compound eyes, {{as well as a}} sessile median eye, two pairs of antennae, and the <b>mouthparts.</b> The <b>mouthparts</b> comprise a labrum, directed backwards over the mouth and pairs of mandibles, paragnatha, maxillules and vestigial maxillae.|$|E
5|$|The head bears {{two pairs}} of antennae, {{the first of which}} is often biramous (branching into two parts) and the second pair bear exopods (outer branches) which are often {{flattened}} into antennal scales known as scaphocerites. The <b>mouthparts</b> consist of pairs each of mandibles, maxillules (second pair of <b>mouthparts)</b> and maxillae. Usually a pair of stalked compound eyes is present, although in some taxa the eyes are unstalked, reduced or lost.|$|E
25|$|Like all hemipterans, {{instead of}} mandibles for chewing, tesseratomids possess a piercing-sucking <b>mouthpart</b> for feeding (known as the rostrum). In tesseratomids, the rostrum has 4 segments.|$|R

5|$|Cicada nymphs drink sap {{from the}} xylem of various species of trees, {{including}} oak, cypress, willow, ash, and maple. While {{it is common}} folklore that adults do not eat, they actually do drink plant sap utilizing their sucking <b>mouthparts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flies are {{adapted for}} aerial {{movement}} and typically have short and streamlined bodies. The first tagma of the fly, the head, bears the eyes, the antennae, and the <b>mouthparts</b> (the labrum, labium, mandible, and maxilla {{make up the}} <b>mouthparts).</b> The second tagma, the thorax, bears the wings and contains the flight muscles on the second segment, which is greatly enlarged; {{the first and third}} segments have been reduced to collar-like structures, and the third segment bears the halteres, which help to balance the insect during flight. The third tagma is the abdomen consisting of 11 segments, some of which may be fused, and with the 3 hindermost segments modified for reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Our {{understanding}} of herbivory in geological time comes from three sources: fossilized plants, which may preserve evidence of defense (such as spines), or herbivory-related damage; {{the observation of}} plant debris in fossilised animal faeces; {{and the construction of}} herbivore <b>mouthparts.</b>|$|E
40|$|Chironomid <b>mouthpart</b> {{deformities}} and aberrations {{of their}} polytenic chromosomes are sublethal responses to toxic stress. These endpoints {{have been used}} in several cases as bioindications for sediment pollution. In the present study we aimed to establish whether there was an association between <b>mouthpart</b> deformities and nucleolus activity in the polytenic chromosomes. Such information could be useful to gain insight into the mechanisms involved in the occurrence of <b>mouthpart</b> deformities and their consequences on the larvae. Third-instar larvae of Chironomus riparius were collected at a site downstream of a sewage treatment plant mostly contaminated by pesticides. Larvae were then raised in the laboratory in aquaria containing sediment and water from the study location. During a 16 -day period, larvae ready to molt to the fourth instar were reared individually. Within a few hours of their molt, the larvae were preserved. The presence of <b>mouthpart</b> deformities (mentum. mandibles, and pecten epipharyngis) and the percentage of active nucleoli were assessed. Those larvae presenting mentum deformities had a significantly higher incidence of active nucleoli in their polytenic chromosomes than nondeformed larvae. Because a high number of active nucleoli generally indicates increased rRNA synthesis, deformed larvae seemed to exhibit a higher protein synthesis than normal individuals. The synthesis of additional proteins may increase deformed larva tolerance to toxicants. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Chironomid <b>mouthpart</b> {{deformities}} {{have often}} been associated with sediment contamination and are, therefore, currently used to assess sediment quality. Deformities were only occasionally induced in laboratory bioassays. <b>Mouthpart</b> deformities result from a physiological disturbance during larval molting. In {{the past few years}} {{it has been shown that}} some chemicals can exert negative effects on both vertebrates and invertebrates at the level of endocrine regulation. As insect molting is hormonally regulated, we wanted to test the hypothesis that deformities are induced due to a hormonal disruption in the developmental process. The aim of the present study was to test whether the endocrine disrupter, Cn-nonylphenol (4 NP), induces <b>mouthpart</b> deformities in chironomids. A laboratory bioassay was performed exposing Chironomus riparius larvae to 10, 50 and 100 mug l(- 1) 4 NP. Survival of the larvae was not affected by the tested concentrations, but the frequency of mentum deformities increased significantly (P < 0. 01) after exposure to 4 NP.

50|$|Pactolinus gigas has a black body, {{flat and}} ovoid. Elytra are {{shortened}} and antennae are elbowed with clubbed ends. The mandible <b>mouthpart</b> is well developed. These beetles feed on dung beetle larvae {{of the genus}} Ontophagus.|$|R
5|$|The adult {{lifespan}} of {{the double}} drummer is {{about four or five}} weeks. During this time, they mate and reproduce, and feed exclusively on sap of living trees, sucking it out through specialised <b>mouthparts.</b> Female cicadas die after laying their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Thrips have {{asymmetrical}} <b>mouthparts</b> {{unique to}} the group. Unlike the Hemiptera (true bugs), the right mandible of thrips is reduced and vestigial – and in some species completely absent.|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} particularly hard exoskeleton and hard forewings (elytra) not usable for flying. Almost all beetles have mandibulate <b>mouthparts</b> with the mandibles mobile in a horizontal plane. The <b>mouthparts</b> are rarely suctorial and are sometimes reduced and the maxillae always bear palps. The antennae usually have 11 or fewer segments except in some groups like the Rhipiceridae and Cerambycidae. The coxae of the legs are usually located recessed within a coxal cavity. The genitalic structures are telescoped into the last abdominal segment in all extant beetles. Unlike the adults, beetle larvae can often be confused with larvae of other endopterygote groups. The beetle's exoskeleton {{is made up of}} numerous plates, called sclerites, separated by thin sutures. This design provides armored defenses while maintaining flexibility. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and appendages vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Because there are so many species, identification is quite difficult, and relies on attributes including the shape of the antennae, the tarsal formulae and shapes of these small segments on the legs, the <b>mouthparts,</b> and the ventral plates (sterna, pleura, coxae). In many species accurate identification can only be made by examination of the unique male genitalic structures.|$|E
50|$|Larvae are {{presumed to}} eat the {{decaying}} logs in which they build galleries. Adults of this species have not been recorded feeding, but other Geodorcus species are known to feed on the sap of trees from their <b>mouthpart</b> anatomy.|$|R
40|$|The species {{diversity}} of Copepoda Harpacticoida at several sampling {{locations in the}} Southern Atlantic has been investigated. From the obtained multicorer samples, a new taxon of Paranannopinae Por, 1986, Nyxis rostrocularis gen. nov., sp. nov., has been collected, which is {{described in the present}} paper. Specimens of the taxon have been encountered in the Angola Basin (DIVA 1 stations 325 and 346), in the Weddell Sea (ANDEEP station 138) and the Cape Basin (DIVA 1 I station 36). Nyxis gen. nov. belongs to the group of paranannopid taxa bearing <b>mouthpart</b> aesthetascs. It can be characterised by several autapomorphies discussed in this paper, but takes up a quite isolated position within the Paranannopinae bearing <b>mouthpart</b> aethetascs...|$|R
40|$|The <b>mouthpart</b> {{structures}} and gut {{contents of the}} following five neritic calanoid copepods collected from the Chukchi and northern Bering Seas during the daytime in October 1988 were examined with scanning electron and light microscopes: Acartia longiremis; Centropages abdominalis; Epilabidocera longipedata; Eurytemora herdmani; Tortanus discaudatus. The sharpness of the mandibular ventralmost tooth and the fine structures of maxillary setae are evidently indicative of feeding habits. The <b>mouthpart</b> of E. herdmani with the lowest ventralmost tooth and regularly spinulose setae on all maxillary endites and endopod mainly suits suspension-feeding, whereas that of T. discaudatus with the sharpest ventralmost tooth and hooked, serrate setae only on the basal endite and endopod is specialized for raptorial feeding. Gut content analyses revealed that A. longiremis, C. abdominalis, E. herdmani and E. longipedata fed on various phytoplankter particles while E. longipedata and T. discaudatus preyed on zooplankters such as copepodids, appendicularians and polychaetes. Although A. longiremis, C. abdominalis and E. longipedata possibly employ both feeding modes, there were some differences in the <b>mouthpart</b> {{structures and}} food items. The feeding ecology of the five families containing these five species is briefly reviewed...|$|R
5|$|From the front, the {{antennae}} and antennules are visible. Beside these {{there are}} the orbits in which the eyes are situated. The <b>mouthparts</b> comprise three pairs of maxillipeds, behind which there are a pair of maxillae, a pair of maxillules, and finally the mandibles.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically arranged in a triangle just forward of the vertex of the head. Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, like those of many other insects, such as grasshoppers, but their other <b>mouthparts</b> are formed into a suctorial proboscis, which enables them to drink nectar.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the <b>mouthparts.</b> The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and <b>mouthparts.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chewing insects {{have two}} mandibles, {{one on each}} side of the head. They are {{typically}} the largest <b>mouthpart</b> of chewing insects, being used to masticate (cut, shred, tear, crush, chew) food items. They open outwards (to the sides of the head) and come together medially.|$|R
40|$|Insects show a {{great variety}} of <b>mouthpart</b> and muscle configurations; however, {{knowledge}} of their <b>mouthpart</b> kinematics and muscle activation patterns is fragmentary. Understanding the role of muscle groups during movement and comparing them between insect groups could yield insights into evolutionary patterns and functional constraints. Here, we developed a mathematical inverse dynamic model including distinct muscles for an insect head–mandible–muscle complex based on micro-computed tomography (µCT) data and bite force measurements. With the advent of µCT, it is now possible to obtain precise spatial information about muscle attachment areas and head capsule construction in insects. Our model shows a distinct activation pattern for certain fibre groups potentially related to a geometry-dependent optimization. Muscle activation patterns suggest that intramandibular muscles play a minor role in bite force generation, which is a potential reason for their loss in several lineages of higher insects. Our model is in agreement with previous studies investigating fast and slow muscle fibres and is able to resolve the spatio-temporal activation patterns of these different muscle types in insects. The model used here has a high potential for large-scale comparative analyses on the role of different muscle setups and head capsule designs in the megadiverse insects in order to aid our understanding of insect head capsule and <b>mouthpart</b> evolution under mechanical constraints...|$|R

5|$|Insects possess {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the <b>mouthparts.</b> The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax {{and one or two}} pairs of wings. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems. There is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and <b>mouthparts.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{is evident}} that the mandibles were highly specialized. Like other Cretaceous ants, Zigrasimecia {{provides}} further evidence that the extinct ant fauna exhibited a great diversity of feeding behavior. The unusual <b>mouthparts</b> of Zigrasimecia are consistent with other extinct species found in Burmese, French, New Jersey and Canadian deposits, which also show morphologies not seen in extant ants.|$|E
5|$|The Archostemata have {{an exposed}} plate called the metatrochantin {{in front of}} the basal segment or coxa of the hind leg. Myxophaga {{contains}} about 65 described species in four families, mostly very small, including Hydroscaphidae and the genus Sphaerius. The myxophagan beetles are small and mostly alga-feeders. Their <b>mouthparts</b> are characteristic in lacking galeae and having a mobile tooth on their left mandible.|$|E
50|$|The hypostome is {{the hard}} <b>mouthpart</b> of trilobites found on the ventral side of the cephalon (head).
