WPC in a sandwich-structured composite form allow for {{combination of the}} benefits of traditional wood polymer composites with the lightness of a sandwich panel technology.

WPC sandwich boards are used mainly in automotive, transportation and building applications, but furniture applications are also being developed. New efficient and often in-line integrated production processes allow to produce stronger and stiffer WPC sandwich boards at lower costs compared to traditional plastic sheets or monolithic WPC panels.|$|E

40|$|Metallic {{shape memory}} alloys (SMA) such as nitinol have unique shape {{recovery}} behavior and mechanical properties {{associated with a}} material phase change {{that have been used}} in a variety of sensing and actuation applications. Recent studies have shown that integrating nitinol-SMA actuators into composite materials increases the composite material's functionality. Hybrid composites of conventional graphite/epoxy or glass/epoxy and nitinol-SMA elements can perform functions in applications where <b>monolithic</b> <b>composites</b> perform inadequately. One such application is the use of hybrid composites to function both in load bearing and armor capacities. While <b>monolithic</b> <b>composites</b> with high strength-to-weight ratios function efficiently as loadbearing structures, because of their brittle nature, impact loading can cause significant catastrophic damage. Initial composite failure modes such as delamination and matrix cracking dissipate some impact energy, but when stress exceeds the composite's ultimate strength, fiber fracture and material perforation become dominant. One of the few methods that has been developed to reduce material perforation is hybridizing polymer matrix composites with tough kevlar or high modulus polyethynylene plies. The tough fibers increase the impact resistance and the stiffer and stronger graphite fibers carry the majority of the load. Similarly, by adding nitinol-SMA elements that absorb impact energy through the stress-induced martensitic phase transformation, the composites' impact perforation resistance can be greatly enhanced. The results of drop-weight and high velocity gas-gun impact testing of various composite materials will be presented. The results demonstrate that hybridizing composites with nitinol-SMA elements significantly increases perforation resistance compared to other traditional toughening elements. Inspection of the composite specimens at various stages of perforation by optical microscope illustrates the mechanisms by which perforation is initiated. Results suggest that the out-of-plane transverse shear properties of the composite and nitinol elements {{have a significant effect on}} the perforation resistance. Applications that can utilize the hybrid composites effectively will also be presented with the experimental studies...|$|R

The contact of both particle-free and composite monoliths with blood serum caused a slight increase in the C 5 a concentration in the serum, which was mainly due to the interaction of complement components with cryogelated PVA and agarose.
