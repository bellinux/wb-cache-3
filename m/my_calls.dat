6000|$|Thus I {{talked to}} myself, mad with the {{thoughts}} of the joy that would soon be mine; and at intervals I stood still and made the forest echo with <b>my</b> <b>calls.</b> [...] "Rima! Rima!" [...] I called again and again, and waited for some response; and heard only the familiar night-sounds--voices of insect and bird and tinkling tree-frog, and a low murmur in the topmost foliage, moved by some light breath of wind unfelt below. I was drenched with dew, bruised and bleeding from falls in the dark, and from rocks and thorns and rough branches, but had felt nothing; gradually the excitement burnt itself out; I was hoarse with shouting and ready to drop down with fatigue, and hope was dead: and at length I crept back to my hut, to cast myself on my grass bed and sink into a dull, miserable, desponding stupor.|$|E

Nevertheless I started out to get Nimmie Amee, because the Witch had been absent for some time, and we meant to elope before she got back. As I {{traveled}} the forest paths the rain wetted my joints, but I paid no attention to this because my thoughts were all on my wedding with beautiful Nimmie Amee and I could think of nothing else until suddenly my legs stopped moving. Then my arms rusted at the joints and I became frightened and cried for help, for now I was unable to oil myself. No one heard <b>my</b> <b>calls</b> and before long my jaws rusted, and I was unable to utter another sound. So I stood helpless in this spot, hoping some wanderer would come my way and save me. But this forest path is seldom used, and I have been standing here so long that I have lost all track of time. In my mind I composed poetry and sang songs, but not a sound have I been able to utter. But this desperate condition has now been relieved by your coming my way and I must thank you for my rescue." ...|$|E

"I saw a light {{moving about}} the house, and being nearly {{blinded by the}} sleet, and half frozen besides, drove in at the gate and put up my horse in the old rail stable, where it is now. I then rapped at the door, and getting no {{invitation}} went in without one. The room was dark, but having matches I found a candle and lit it. I tried to enter the adjoining room, but the door was fast, and although I heard the old man's heavy footsteps in there he made no response to <b>my</b> <b>calls.</b> There was no fire on the hearth, so I made one and laying [sic] down before it with my overcoat under my head, prepared myself for sleep. Pretty soon the door that I had tried silently opened {{and the old man}} came in, carrying a candle. I spoke to him pleasantly, apologizing for my intrusion, but he took no notice of me. He seemed to be searching for something, though his eyes were unmoved in their sockets. I wonder if he ever walks in his sleep. He took a circuit a part of the way round the room, and went out the same way he had come in. Twice more before I slept he came back into the room, acting precisely the same way, and departing as at first. In the intervals I heard him tramping all over the house, his footsteps distinctly audible in the pauses of the storm. When I woke in the morning he had already gone out." ...|$|E

40|$|Melanie (Research participant), “I {{definitely}} {{think it needs}} to be put out there a bit more and people shouldn‟t be scared of it, but it is being scared of the unknown, isn‟t it?” This sentiment of there being something that others perhaps do not understand, a ‗mysticism ‘ that makes some people fearful was one of <b>my</b> <b>calls</b> to this research.

40|$|This diploma work is {{intended}} {{on the progress}} of singing skills in children's choirs at primary schools, it means what kind of exercises are used within the framework of voice culture. It is divided in several parts: History of children's choirs in the Czech Republic - here is brief information about development of this type of choirs in our republic. There is only general information about children's choirs until 1918 and the next years do more into details. Singing skills - here you can find several possibilities of classification (by Hana Váňová and Ladislav Daniel) and some of skills are described and explained more in detail. Games and motivations for children - it is here to bring a theory near to children. It is good to take advantage of games or another activities to progress of concrete skills. There are some ideas in this part. School choirs - here is brief information about types of children's choirs, importance and aims of choral singing or optional subject Choral singing at primary and secondary schools. Exercises before singing - this part is introduced with some information about exercises before singing, but here are main observations and exercises, which I have got from <b>my</b> <b>calls</b> on choice and also not choice children's choirs.

40|$|Unlike prior {{research}} that has confined customer rage to a single point in time, this article explores the unfolding of rage over three time periods, at the initial service failure (Episode 1) and two ineffective service recovery attempts (Episodes 2 and 3). In each episode, we examine the association between loss, or a threat of loss, of personal resources (e. g., self-esteem, sense of jus-tice, sense of control, and economic resources such as time and money) and negative emotions. We empirically demonstrate {{for the first time}} that although rage may sometimes take place at the initial service failure (Episode 1), rage does not tend to be an immediate reaction. Rather, it is when service failures remain unresolved that residual negative emotions are carried forward into the next episode, so that rage is dominant in Episodes 2 and 3. This carryover of negative emotion spirals with more resources being threatened, propelling the customer into rage. The authors offer a methodological contribution demonstrating the dynamic nature of appraisals and emotions in a sequence of related episodes in the elicitation of rage. Finally, differences between U. S. and Thai responses are discussed with important theoretical and managerial implications.
