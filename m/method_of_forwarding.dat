50|$|A {{firewall}} {{may allow}} this if a host {{on the internal}} network first requests {{a connection to the}} host within the DMZ. The DMZ host provides none of the security advantages that a subnet provides and is often used as an easy <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>forwarding</b> all ports to another firewall / NAT device. This tactic (establishing a DMZ host) is also used with systems which do not interact properly with normal firewalling rules or NAT. This can be because no forwarding rule can be formulated ahead of time (varying TCP or UDP port numbers for example, as opposed to a fixed number or fixed range). This is also used for network protocols for which the router has no programming to handle (6in4 or GRE tunnels are prototypical examples).|$|E
50|$|This <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>forwarding</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} with the Supervisor 2 engine. When used in combination with a switch fabric module, each line card has an 8Gbit/s connection to the switch fabric and additionally {{a connection to the}} classic bus. In this mode, assuming all line cards have a switch fabric connection, an ingress packet is queued as before and its headers are sent along the dBus to the supervisor. They are looked up in the PFC (including ACLs etc.) and then the result is placed on the rBus. The initial egress line card takes this information and forwards the data to the correct line card along the switch fabric. The main advantage here {{is that there is a}} dedicated 8 Gbit/s connection between the line cards. The receiving line card queues the egress packet before sending it from the desired port.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) is an {{emerging}} technology {{that aims to}} address many of the existing issues associated with packet forwarding in today’s Internetworking environment. It provides a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>forwarding</b> packets at {{a high rate of}} speed by combining the speed and performance of Layer 2 with the scalability and IP intelligence of Layer 3. In a traditional IP (Internet Protocol) routing network, a router analyzes the destination IP address contained in the packet header. The router independently determines the next hop for the packet using the destination IP address and the interior gateway protocol. This process is repeated at each hop to deliver the packet to its final destination. In contrast, in the MPLS forwarding paradigm routers {{on the edge of the}} network (label edge routers) attach labels to packets based on the forwarding Equivalence class (FEC). Packets are then forwarded through the MPLS domain, based on their associated FECs, through swappin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For many {{applications}} in mobile wireless ad hoc networks (MANETs), forming an end-to-end data path {{is not always}} necessary; instead, the primary routing goal is often data collection or dissemination where only a data source is known. Routing algorithms must be carefully chosen in order to suit the needs of applications employing them. Our focus is on data collection applications in MANETs where limited mobility information is required to route data in a scalable manner. To address this goal, we employ the concepts of delaytolerant networking (DTN) in which data makes progress toward a destination with high latency expectations and little knowledge of routing topology. Specifically, we present time-to-network (TTN) forwarding, a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>forwarding</b> data generated by mobile nodes to a network endpoint {{in such a way}} that delivery latency is lowered without high networking cost. By segmenting mobility patterns into trips, we are able to apply TTN to a vehicular network using only an estimated destination arrival time for each vehicle. We evaluate TTN using mobility data from the TRANSIMS simulator for a real road network. Results show that our algorithm produces collection-to-network latencies similar to more generic algorithms but at a lower cost and with higher efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for delivery latency in our experiments and compare it to TTN. This also helps normalize the interpretation of results specific to our mobility model. I...|$|E

The development of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and OpenFlow has provided an efficient <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>forwarding</b> plane and control plane separation. The Path Computation Element (PCE) is an entity capable of computing complex multiple-constraint paths for a single or set of services. By combining these technologies Communication Service Providers (CSPs) can achieve an unprecedented level of control and optimization of data center network resources and deployment of services. This new architecture will provide a significant evolutionary step in data center design and operation. This presentation proposes a flexible architecture for control and operation of data center resources and services, underpinned with SDN and PCE technologies. OpenFlow will provide forwarding control for services and the PCE provides path optimization based on application constraints and SLA requirements. The presenter will outline how the transport layer (optical) is driven from the application layer (IP network) with bandwidth flexibility and grooming capabilities being provided in real-time and responding to application-layer demands.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we studied}} methods for {{improving}} efficiency {{and effectiveness of}} multipath routing in computer networks. We showed that multipath routing can improve network performance for failure recovery, load balancing, Quality of Service (QoS), and energy consumption. We presented a method for reducing the overhead of computing dynamic path metrics, one of the obstacles for implementing dynamic multipath routing in real world networks. In the first part, we proposed a method for building disjoint multipaths {{that could be used}} for local failure recovery as well as for multipath routing. Proactive failure recovery schemes have been recently proposed for continuous service of delay-sensitive applications during failure transients at the cost of extra infrastructural support in the form of routing table entries, extra addresses, etc. These extra infrastructure supports could be exploited to build alternative disjoint paths in those frameworks, while keeping the lengths of the alternative paths close to those of the primary paths. The evaluations showed that it was possible to extend the proactive failure recovery schemes to provide support for nearly-disjoint paths which could be employed in multipath routing for load balancing and QoS. In the second part, we proposed a method for reducing overhead of measuring dynamic link state information for multipath routing, specifically path delays used in Wardrop routing. Even when dynamic routing could be shown to offer convergence properties without oscillations, it has not been widely adopted. One of reasons was that the expected cost of keeping the link metrics updated at various nodes in the network. We proposed threshold-based updates to propagate the link state only when the currently measured link state differs from the last updated state consider- ably. Threshold-based updates were shown through analysis and simulations to offer bounded guarantees on path quality while significantly reducing the cost of propagating the dynamic link metric information. The simulation studies indicated that threshold based updates can reduce the number of link updates by up to 90 - 95 % in some cases. In the third part, we proposed methods of using multipath routing for reducing energy consumption in computer networks. Two different approaches have been advocated earlier, from traffic engineering and topology control to hardware-based approaches. We proposed solutions at two different time scales. On a finer time granularity, we employed a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>forwarding</b> through alternate paths to enable longer sleep schedules of links. The proposed schemes achieved more energy saving by increasing the usage of active links and the down time of sleeping links as well as avoiding too frequent link state changes. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first technique combining a routing scheme with hardware scheme to save energy consumption in networks. In our evaluation, alternative forwarding reduced energy consumption by 10 % on top of a hardware-based sleeping scheme. On a longer time granularity, we proposed a technique that combined multipath routing with topology control. The proposed scheme achieved increased energy savings by maximizing the link utilization on a reduced topology where the number of active nodes and links are minimized. The proposed technique reduced energy consumption by an additional 17 % over previous schemes with single/shortest path routing...|$|E
