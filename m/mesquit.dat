60|$|How {{a member}} of the most dauntless border police force carried law into the <b>mesquit,</b> saved the life of an {{innocent}} man after a series of thrilling adventures, followed a fugitive to Wyoming, and then passed through deadly peril to ultimate happiness.|$|E
60|$|Later on, a {{deputation}} {{waited on}} Bud. They stood on one leg, chewed <b>mesquit</b> twigs and circumlocuted, for they hated to hurt his feelings. Bud foresaw their business, {{and made it}} easy for them. Bigger risks and larger profits was what they wanted.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{come down}} on his head on a chunk of <b>mesquit</b> wood, and he didn't show any designs toward getting up again. We laid him out in a tent, and he begun to look pretty dead. So Gideon Pease saddles up and burns the wind for old Doc Sleeper's {{residence}} in Dogtown, thirty miles away.|$|E
60|$|Near {{the station}} was a store; and near the store, {{scattered}} among the <b>mesquits</b> and elms, stood the saddled horses of the customers. Most of them waited, half asleep, with sagging limbs and drooping heads. But one, a long-legged roan with a curved neck, snorted and pawed the turf. Him the Kid mounted, gripped with his knees, and slapped gently with the owner's own quirt.|$|R
60|$|But in {{this affair}} the Kid had not felt the grim thirst for {{encounter}} that usually urged him on to battle. It {{had been a}} purely chance row, born of the cards and certain epithets impossible for a gentleman to brook that had passed between the two. The Kid had rather liked the slim, haughty, brown-faced young chap whom his bullet had cut off in the first pride of manhood. And now he wanted no more blood. He {{wanted to get away}} and have a good long sleep somewhere in the sun on the <b>mesquit</b> grass with his handkerchief over his face. Even a Mexican might have crossed his path in safety while he was in this mood.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{through the}} intense silence, {{he heard the}} whicker of a horse. The sound came {{from the side of}} the track toward the east, and Chicken began to explore timorously in that direction. He stepped high along the mat of curly <b>mesquit</b> grass, for he was afraid of {{everything}} there might be in this wilderness--snakes, rats, brigands, centipedes, mirages, cowboys, fandangoes, tarantulas, tamales--he had read of them in the story papers. Rounding a clump of prickly pear that reared high its fantastic and menacing array of rounded heads, he was struck to shivering terror by a snort and a thunderous plunge, as the horse, himself startled, bounded away some fifty yards, and then resumed his grazing. But here was the one thing in the desert that Chicken did not fear. He had been reared on a farm; he had handled horses, understood them, and could ride.|$|E
60|$|The painting--one might almost say panorama--was {{designed}} to portray a typical Western scene, interest {{culminating in a}} central animal figure, that of a stampeding steer, life-size, wild-eyed, fiery, breaking away in a mad rush from the herd that, close-ridden by a typical cowpuncher, occupied a position somewhat in the right background of the picture. The landscape presented fitting and faithful accessories. Chaparral, <b>mesquit,</b> and pear were distributed in just proportions. A Spanish dagger-plant, with its waxen blossoms in a creamy aggregation {{as large as a}} water-bucket, contributed floral beauty and variety. The distance was undulating prairie, bisected by stretches of the intermittent streams peculiar to the region lined with the rich green of live-oak and water-elm. A richly mottled rattlesnake lay coiled beneath a pale green clump of prickly pear in the foreground. A third of the canvas was ultramarine and lake white--the typical Western sky and the flying clouds, rainless and feathery.|$|E
50|$|Hali Murk is a {{populated}} place {{situated in}} Pima County, Arizona. The name became official in 1941 through a {{decision of the}} Board on Geographic Names. It has also been known by Haal-Muihedak, Hardimui, Harle Muheta, Harlemuheta, Mesqual, and <b>Mesquit.</b> It has an estimated elevation of 1867 ft above sea level.|$|E
50|$|Joseph Smeaton Chase {{has become}} an {{integral}} part of California literature: revered for his poignant descriptions of California landscapes. An Englishman who toured the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto mountains in 1915 with his burro, <b>Mesquit,</b> Chase published poetic diary entries detailing his escapades through the Sierra Nevada mountains and California desert.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mesquit,</b> Prosopis farcta (Banks and Sol.) Macbride, {{has become}} a serious weed problem in {{cultivated}} and non-cultivated areas in the Mediterranean and Southeast Anatolian Regions of Turkey. Caryedon palaestinicus Southgate (Coleoptera, Bruchidae; Pachymerinae), a seed feeding insect, has been determined in <b>mesquit</b> growing areas. In this study, C. palaestinicus infected seed rates of P. farcta were investigated. A thousand pods of P. farcta were collected separately from Antakya, Hassa and Kirikhan districts in 2000 and Altinozu, Kumlu and Reyhanli districts in 2001. Collected pods were placed individually: polyethylene bags and kept to the following July. Numbers of damaged seeds and healthy ones were recorded in July. Damaged seed rates for Antakya, Hassa and Kirikhan were 35. 4, 34. 9, 37. 8 %, respectively and for Altinozu, Kumlu and Reyhanli were 27. 9, 37. 2 and 38. 0 %, respectively. In addition Rhaconatus major Tobias (Hymoneptera, Braconidae) a larval parasitoid of C. palaestinicus was determined in the survey areas. It is concluded that C. palaestinicus was not a promising biological agent for controlling <b>mesquit</b> under field conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{mesquite}} (Prosopis juliflora), jucá (Caesalpinia ferrea), white popinac (Leucaena leucocephala) and tamar ind (Tamarindus indica) {{are useful}} species for the Brazilian semi-arid region because are sources of wood, f i rewood, fruits, forage and others products. Measuring plant height (y) i n t rees {{may not be}} an easy task, but canopy (x) and stem diameter (z) can be more eas ily evaluated. This work¿s object ive was two-fold: evaluate the growth of related species, in the f i r s t two years of age, and obtain l inear equations to est imate y from x or z, and x from z, in those species. A randomized complete block design with four t reatments (trees) and eight replications was used. The values for x, z, and y were measured biannually from October/ 2003 to March/ 2005. The species had different growth in te rms of plant height and stem and canopy diameters. Twenty-four months after the transplantation, the highest growth regarding these t rai t s was observed i n the <b>mesquit</b> e (as wel l as jucá, as the plant height). The bes t equations (based on the R 2 value) to est imate y in mesquite, jucá, white popinac and tamarind are: y = 0, 33 + 0, 05 z, y = 0, 70 + 0, 06 z, y = 0, 64 + 0, 04 z and y = 0, 06 z, respectively. The equations to estimate x from z are: x = 1, 47 + 0, 03 z, x = 0, 55 + 0, 05 z, x = 0, 04 z e x = 0, 05 z, respectively, for the same species...|$|E
