40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{findings show}} that when orthotropic sheet metal samples are subjected to uniaxial tensile loading {{at an angle to}} the orthotropic axes, a drastic re-orientation of the axes takes place at moderate tensile strain levels, while orthotropic symmetries are preserved. This phenomenon is explained and simulated within a simple theory of plasticity, which combines Hill's quadratic yield criterion for orthotropy with the concept of plastic spin as a necessary constitutive ingredient for the orientational evolution of anisotropic tensorial internal variables. Detailed analytical investigation, corroborated by the experimental data, shows a trend of anisotropic axes rotation towards alignment of a pertinent <b>minimum</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> with the stretching direction. This-imposes a constitutive coupling relation between the anisotropic parameters and the plastic spin coefficient. Similarities and differences with other works as well as unresolved questions are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional FEM models {{concerned}} with the transient response and relevant strength analysis of buried structures due to blast explosions were proven extremely costly using conventional FEM codes. This {{is due to the}} required small time-step as well as the considerable extension of the problem domain that has to be chosen so long that no reflection is allowed from the artificial infinite soil boundaries before the maximum displacement (or Von Mises stress) amplitude of the structure is reached. In case of buried pipelines, the complexity increases because the length of the model should at least include the unknown wave length along the pipeline. To overcome this problem, a reduced model taking into consideration the decoupled incident P- SH- and SV-waves, has been developed. The new theory achieves a manageable conservative relationship between the strength of the buried pipeline and the allowable peak particle velocity. The proposed relationship is based on the criterion of either the hoop or Von-Mises stresses and it is given in terms of the allowable stress {{as a percentage of the}} Specified <b>Minimum</b> <b>Yield</b> <b>Stress</b> (SMYS) of the pipeline.

40|$|The {{production}} of high performance concrete requires {{the development of}} new superplasticizers with increased efficiencies. The knowledge of the mechanisms by which these admixtures act is of primary importance for the design of new polymers. They are believed to be linked to the dispersion cement agglomerates by electrostatic, steric or entropic repulsion, or improved wetting (capillary effect). The two first are directly linked to adsorbed polymers. The third is linked to both adsorbed and solvated polymers, while the last is mainly linked to polymers remaining in solution. To elucidate the effects of the superplasticizers, two approaches were used. On one hand, adsorption isotherms of polymers were measured by solution depletion. On the other hand, rheological testing leading to the determination of the amount of superplasticizer needed to reach a <b>minimum</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> A comparison of both results reveals the relative importance of the possible mechanisms contributing to superplasticizer efficiency.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to provide}} {{an understanding of the}} behaviour of co-disposed coarse (sand) and fine (clay and silt) tailings when discharged into an onshore dredge pond, and the dependence of that behaviour on the sediment composition. This understanding contributes to the ultimate goal of finding a method by which fine tailings can be discharged back into the original dredge pond, while preventing these fines from recirculating through the production process. This would eliminate any need for external tailings dams, thus avoiding the risks traditionally associated with these dams. This study is part of an effort by Royal IHC to make dredge mining a competitive method for mining a wide variety of mineral deposits. To describe the behaviour of co-disposed coarse and fine tailings, an analogue is found in debris flows. From this analogue, four key behavioural aspects of mud in water are defined: erosion of sediment or entrainment of water, hydroplaning, segregation of coarse and fines particles in a slurry, and the strength increase of the material after deposition. Literature on debris flows suggested that the cohesion of the material, in the description of debris flows usually captured in a <b>yield</b> <b>stress,</b> is instrumental in determining if any of the first three behaviours are to be expected. The fourth characteristic, strength increase, depends mainly on material specific relations between void ratio on one hand, and permeability and effective stress supporting capacity of the material on the other. The concept of <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> shows many similarities with that of the undrained shear strength. Therefore it is investigated if the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> can be calculated as a function of a material’s Atterberg limits – as is possible with the undrained shear strength – and thus provide a method of predicting the slurry flow behaviour. This removes the need for relationships between the less easily captured quantities as particle size distribution and clay mineralogy, and the <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> Experiments are performed on modelling clay and three mixtures of this modelling clay with a silica flour to determine the relationships of both undrained shear strength and <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> with the liquidity index. Testing is done on soils with different Atterberg limits to confirm dependence on liquidity index only. The undrained shear strength is measured using a fall cone test. The <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> is measured using a viscometer. To determine the <b>yield</b> <b>stress,</b> a full rheogram is measured for each sample. A Bingham type rheological model, of which the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> is a parameter, is then fitted to this rheogram. The <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and the undrained shear strength are plotted together as a function of liquidity index and proved to fit to the same curve, which thus describes the strength of a soil from a liquidity index of 0 up to 4. The relationship between the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and clay content of the tested samples is also investigated. It is found that the concentration of the clay-sized fraction in water correlated well to both the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and undrained shear strength. Hence it is concluded that <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> is primarily determined by the clay content, and that any other size fraction has negligible effect on the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of slurries. This changes when sand is added to diluted soil, as is suggested with the co-disposal method. At low sand concentrations, the effect of sand on the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> is still minor or even negligible. At higher concentration however, the sand noticeably increases the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the overall fluid. At a certain sand concentration, the sand grains form a network throughout the material, at which point it can no longer be considered a fluid. Silt is found to have a similar influence as sand on the slurry <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> The <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the modelling clay in the experiments is plotted as a function of both the fines concentration in water and the sand concentration in the overall mixture. An optimum mixture range is identified based on earlier identified limits: As a <b>minimum,</b> the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> should be 35 Pa for a slurry to remain coherent at low slope angles. As a maximum, the pumpability with a centrifugal pump is used. This can be guaranteed up to a value of 200 Pa. However, for different pumps different values apply. It is concluded that the clay fraction of a sediment is the critical mixture component for providing <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> in when the material is slurried. Sand and silt sized material only have noticeable effects when their concentrations reach such levels that they form the main structure of the mixture. However, as the relationship between the carrier fluid’s clay content and <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> is heavily dependent on the clay mineralogy, a more convenient method of estimating a slurry’s <b>yield</b> <b>stress,</b> and thus suitability for deposition, uses the liquidity index of the fines fraction.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} creep rupture limit {{is an important}} issue for industrial components under combined action of cyclic thermal and mechanical loading. This paper proposes a new creep rupture assessment method under the Linear Matching Method framework, where the creep rupture limit is evaluated through an extended shakedown analysis using the revised <b>yield</b> <b>stress,</b> which is determined by the <b>minimum</b> of the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the material and the individual creep rupture stress at each integration point. Various numerical strategies have been investigated to calculate these creep rupture stresses associated with given temperatures and allowable creep rupture time. Three distinct methods: a) linear interpolation method, b) logarithm based polynomial relationship and c) the Larson–Miller parameter, are introduced to interpolate and extrapolate an accurate creep rupture stress, on the basis of discrete experimental creep rupture data. Comparisons between these methods are carried out to determine the most appropriate approach leading to the accurate solution to the creep rupture stresses for the creep rupture analysis. Two numerical examples including a classical holed plate problem and a two-pipe structure are provided to verify the applicability and efficiency of this new approach. Detailed step-by-step analyses are also performed to further confirm the accuracy of the obtained creep rupture limits, and to investigate the interaction between the different failure mechanisms.

40|$|The {{stabilisation}} of titania pigment in dry {{water-based paint}} films with anionic polymeric dispersants containing carboxylate groups was investigated. The results {{were compared to}} those obtained from rheological analysis of titania pigment suspensions. The polymeric dispersants chosen were polyacrylic acid and polyacrylamides copolymer modified with carboxylate groups. AFM and TEM {{were used to assess}} the distribution of the titania pigment particles in the surface and bulk, respectively, of the paint films which were then compared to the gloss and surface roughness of these films. In the absence of a dispersant, the pigment distribution in the paint films was not uniform and relatively large pigment aggregates appeared at the surface, resulting in a rough surface and low gloss. However, anionic polymeric dispersants decreased surface roughness and increased the gloss of the dry paint films, with the dispersant concentration considerably enhancing pigment distribution in the paint films. An inverse correlation of paint film gloss with surface roughness was observed. The optimum pigment distribution in the dry state was found at dispersant concentrations much higher than those needed to obtain <b>minimum</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> in aqueous suspensions. This suggests that in the dry state, electrostatic stabilisation is substantially reduced or possibly absent, therefore a higher dispersant concentration is needed to achieve pigment stabilisation...|$|E

40|$|In this master’s thesis {{robustness}} in welding {{has been}} investigated by means of simulations. A simple welding case has been simulated with the FE program MSC. Marc. If stability can be discovered during a simulation, then the welding process can be redesigned. However, instability in the simulation must not be due to instability in the real welding process. It can be due to pure numerical and modelling causes also and therefore care must be exercised when evaluating robustness. The study also includes a review part {{about the meaning of}} robustness and different approaches for evaluating this. In this work, a parametric study was used to investigate the robustness for an existing model. The material used in the simulations is called Greek Ascoloy, a martensitic stainless steel and the geometry consists of two plates which are welded together without additional filler material. The aim was to investigate which of the chosen parameters has the largest influence on the model, i. e. how sensitive or robust the model is when it is subject to disturbances. The chosen parameters to investigate were Poisson’s ratio, Young’s modulus, thermal expansion, initial yield stress, <b>minimum</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress,</b> welding power, and the heat source geometrical parameters. To evaluate the results and determine whether or not the model is robust for a given set of parameters, the responses of the residual stresses in the sheet plane as well as gap and out of plane deformations were studied. The study was performed by using a factor screening method and each investigated parameter {{has been investigated}} at three levels. The methodology has been to change one parameter at a time while keeping the other parameters constant. The results have shown that the simulation model is quite sensitive to changes in welding power which resulted in increased deformations when the power was set to a high level. This will of course also occur in a real welding operation since the welding power has a big influence on the deformations of the welded component. The mechanical activation and thermal expansion, both resulting in large differences of stresses and deformations between the different levels, have also shown to have a negative influence on the robustness of the model. The heat source geometrical parameters have not influenced the model to large extent, although reducing the cr parameter showed an increased gap deformation. The model has also shown to be robust regarding changes in Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and yield stress since very small changes in stresses and deformations occurred when changing these parameters. One possible continuation of this work could be to study the influence of interaction between the different parameters on the robustness of the model. Also, an in-depth investigation to explain why the model is more sensitive to changes in certain parameters would also be of interest. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

Six different configurations of stress distribution in the plastic enclaves were considered with various values of the ratio σmax/σ 0. For each stress configuration and for various loading steps the shape of the respective caustic corresponding to the singularity created at the plastic zone near the crack tip was computed by modifying appropriately Dugdale's theory to each of the six configurations in the plastic enclave. The caustic was formed by reflections of a parallel coherent light beam at the vicinity of the crack-tip. Three different types of steel were examined with different stress-strain relations and different amounts of strain-hardening. By comparing the shapes of the theoretically derived caustics by using each of the stress configurations of the modified DB-model with the shapes of the experimentally obtained caustics for the corresponding loading step it was possible to adapt the DB-model to each case of material, to disclose the influence of strain-hardening on the fracture mode of the material and to indicate the most probable profile of stress distribution in the plastic zone as the loading is increased and further plastic deformation is established in the specimen.

40|$|The common {{profiled}} {{steel cladding}} systems used in Australia and its neighboring countries {{are made of}} very thin (0. 42 mm) high strength steel (G 550 with a <b>minimum</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of 550 MPa) and are crest-fixed. However, these claddings often suffer from local pull-through failures at their screw connections during high wind events such as storms and cyclones. Past experience and researches {{have shown that the}} loss of steel roofs has often occurred due to local pull-through failures of their screw connections under uplift or suction loading. Loss of claddings always led to a progressive collapse of the entire building. This situation is continuing because of the lower priority given to the design of roof and wall cladding systems. At present, steel design codes do not provide guidelines for the design of crest-fixed steel roof or wall claddings. Past research has shown that European and American recommendations for steel claddings cannot be used for Australian crest-fixed cladding systems as they were developed mainly for valley-fixed claddings subjected to gravity loading instead of crest-fixed claddings subjected to wind uplift/suction loading. Therefore at present the design of thin steel cladding systems is based on laboratory tests and is expensive. These situations inhibit the innovative design and advances in the steel cladding industry. Since the local pull-through failures in the less ductile G 550 steel claddings are initiated by transverse splitting at the fastener hole, analytical studies {{have not been able to}} determine the pull-through failure loads accurately. Therefore in the first stage of this research an appropriate fracture/splitting criterion was developed using a series of large scale and small scale experiments of crest-fixed steel claddings. A shell finite element model of crest-fixed steel cladding was then developed that included the new fracture/splitting criterion and advanced features such as hyperelastic material modelling, contact simulations, residual stresses and geometric imperfections. The improved finite element analyses were able to model the pull-through failures associated with splitting as evident from the comparison of their results with the corresponding full-scale experimental results. An extensive series of parametric studies considering the effects of material properties and geometric parameters of the two commonly used trapezoidal cladding profiles was undertaken using finite element analysis. Appropriate design formulae for the pull-through and dimpling failure load of trapezoidal profiles were then derived for optimization purposes and to simplify the current design method. This will then lead to modification and optimisation of cladding profiles to satisfy the requirements of both strength (safety during cyclones and storms) and economy. This thesis presents the details of large scale experimental studies undertaken and the results including the criterion for the splitting/fracture failure of high strength steel cladding systems. It describes the many advances made in the finite element modelling of crest-fixed steel cladding systems including the effects of localised pull-through and dimpling failures. Finally, it presents a simple design method for trapezoidal steel cladding systems under wind uplift or suction loading...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} {{rheological}} behaviour of fine-grained slurries {{in the laboratory}} using two types of rheometric measuring systems: the vane rheometer and the ball measuring system (BMS). The main purpose is to study how changes in clay/sand ratio, sand grain size, and salinity influence the rheological behaviour of the slurries, and which rheological models best fit the experimental data. There is a discussion of whether the applied rheometric measuring systems can produce reliable rheological data. The slurries (clay-sand-water mixtures) {{used in this study}} have been applied by the researchers at the International Centre for Geohazards (ICG) to investigate the flow dynamics of both subaerial and subaqueous debris flows. Therefore, this study on the rheological properties of the slurries is of significance for their present and future research work. The investigations reveal that: (1) All the slurries are non-Newtonian yield stress fluids, which exhibit a shear-thinning behaviour at the shear rates less than 10 s- 1, but a Newtonian behaviour in the shear-rate range of 10 - 50 s- 1. (2) All the slurries display a rheopectic behaviour at the shear-rate range under consideration. (3) The slurry behaviour is very sensitive to clay/sand ratio, and the yield stress exponentially increases with the increase in clay content. The slurry behaviour is mainly governed by the clay-water matrix, but sand fraction can play a significant role as the clay/sand ratio is very low. The transition from granular to viscoplastic behaviour occurs at a clay content of about 10 - 15 %. (4) The slurry behaviour is also sensitive to sand grain size, and the shear stress level of the flow curve increases with the decrease in sand size. (5) Salinity influences the rheological behaviour of the slurries. There exists a critical low salt concentration that gives a <b>minimum</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and apparent viscosity for a slurry. (6) The Herschel-Bulkley model is a good model for fine-grained slurries. (7) Both the vane rheometer and the BMS can produce reliable rheological data for the fine-grained slurries. The BMS may be used at higher shear rates, but it seems to give more reliable results for shear rates lower than 50 s- 1. Some numerical simulations of the downslope slurry movements were also carried out in this study, using the one-dimensional model BING. The simulation results reveal that: (1) The parameters release volume, slope angle, yield stress and viscosity affect the simulation results of the BING code. Runout distance has positive relationship with release volume and slope angle, but negative relationship with yield stress and viscosity. Final deposit thickness has positive relationship with release volume, yield stress and viscosity, but negative relationship with slope angle. (2) The model BING can be used for numerical simulations of muddy debris flows, but the BING code should be modified for the specific cases such as hydroplaning and shear-wetting. Furthermore, the BING code must be modified and extended to model the behaviour of more granular flows. In further work, the following experiments should be carried out: (1) experiments to determine the pH-values of the slurries and the pHPZC, edge of kaolin mineral in order to better explain the salinity effects and rheopectic behaviour of the slurries; (2) cylinder strength meter tests and inclined plane tests to directly determine the yield stresses of the slurries so that the obtained results from different methods can be compared and evaluated; (3) slurry runout experiments in the laboratory to calibrate the numerical model. In addition, it is of interest to study how the experimental process causes the minimum point in a flow curve in further work...|$|E
40|$|Sandwich panels {{comprise}} a thick, light-weight plastic foam such as polyurethane, polystyrene or mineral wool sandwiched between two relatively thin steel faces. One or both steel faces may be flat, lightly profiled or fully profiled. Until recently sandwich panel construction in Australia {{has been limited}} to cold-storage buildings {{due to the lack}} of design methods and data. However, in recent times, its use has increased significantly due to their widespread structural applications in building systems. Structural sandwich panels generally used in Australia comprise of polystyrene foam core and thinner (0. 42 mm) and high strength (<b>minimum</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of 550 MPa and reduced ductility) steel faces bonded together using separate adhesives. Sandwich panels exhibit various types of buckling behaviour depending on the types of faces used. Three types of buckling modes can be observed which are local buckling of plate elements of fully profiled faces, flexural wrinkling of flat and lightly profiled faces and mixed mode buckling of lightly profiled faces due to the interaction of local buckling and flexural wrinkling. To study the structural performance and develop appropriate design rules for sandwich panels, all these buckling failure modes have to be investigated thoroughly. A well established analytical solution exists for the design of flat faced sandwich panels, however, the design solutions for local buckling of fully profiled sandwich panels and mixed mode buckling of lightly profiled sandwich panels are not adequate. Therefore an extensive research program was undertaken to investigate the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels and the mixed mode buckling behaviour of lightly profiled sandwich panels. The first phase of this research was based on a series of laboratory experiments and numerical analyses of 50 foam-supported steel plate elements to study the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels made of thin steel faces and polystyrene foam core covering a wide range of b/t ratios. The current European design standard recommends the use of a modified effective width approach to include the local buckling effects in design. However, the experimental and numerical results revealed that this design method can predict reasonable strength for sandwich panels with low b/t ratios (< 100), but it predicts unconservative strengths for panels with slender plates (high b/t ratios). The use of sandwich panels with high b/t ratios is very common in practical design due to the increasing use of thinner and high strength steel plates. Therefore an improved design rule was developed based on the numerical results that can be used for fully profiled sandwich panels with any practical b/t ratio up to 600. The new improved design rule was validated using six full-scale experiments of profiled sandwich panels and hence can be used to develop safe and economical design solutions. The second phase of this research was based on a series of laboratory experiments and numerical analyses on lightly profiled sandwich panels to study the mixed mode buckling behaviour due to the interaction of local buckling and flexural wrinkling. The current wrinkling formula, which is a simple modification of the methods utilized for flat panels, does not consider the possible interaction between these two buckling modes. As the rib depth and width of flat plates between the ribs increase, flat plate buckling can occur leading to the failure of the entire panel due to the interaction between local buckling and wrinkling modes. Experimental and numerical results from this research confirmed that the current wrinkling formula for lightly profiled sandwich panels based on the elastic half-space method is inadequate in its present form. Hence an improved equation was developed based on validated finite element analysis results to take into account the interaction of the two buckling modes. This new interactive buckling formula can be used to determine the true value of interactive buckling stress for safe and economical design of lightly profiled sandwich panels. This thesis presents the details of experimental investigations and finite element analyses conducted to study the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels and the mixed mode buckling behaviour of lightly profiled sandwich panels. It includes development and validation of suitable numerical and experimental models, and the results. Current design rules are reviewed and new improved design rules are developed based on the results from this research...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen induced cold {{cracking}} in weldments {{is the most}} serious problem limiting the use of high strength low alloy steel in the structural industry. Improvement of the weldability of structural steel has significantly reduced the risk of {{cold cracking}} in the heat affected zone. Consequently, the avoidance of weld metal cold cracking becomes a major task since the risk of hydrogen induced cold cracking in the HAZ is greatly diminished in modem low carbon steels. Hydrogen induced cold cracking in weld metal is caused by the complex interaction of the diffusible hydrogen content, residual stress and susceptible microstructure. Depending on the joint geometry which induces stresses, cold cracking in weld metal can be of two types with respect to the welding direction: longitudinal cracking which is parallel to the welding direction, and transverse cracking which is perpendicular to the welding direction. Weld deposits for high strength low alloy steels can be susceptible to transverse cold cracking. The investigation described in this thesis involved the use of the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test to examine the effect of shielding gas mixture and preheat temperature on weld metal transverse cold cracking behaviour in a flux cored arc welded BIS 812 EMA quenched and tempered steel. The <b>minimum</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of BIS 812 EMA steel 1 s 690 MPa. The consumable used in welding was a low hydrogen flux cored wire. Literature relevant to the characteristics of weld metal cold cracking has been reviewed, with emphasis on the factors affecting hydrogen induced cold cracking. The process of flux cored arc welding, the weld thermal cycle and the properties of weld metal have been examined. The main types of cold cracking and relevant weldability tests have been discussed. Two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures (Ar- 5 %C 02 and Ar- 20 %C 02) and five different preheat temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C) were used at an aim heat input of 1. 7 kJ/mm to investigate the effect of welding conditions on the transverse cold cracking behaviour of the weld metal deposited on BIS 812 EMA steel. The microstructures, hardness values and fracture surfaces of the weld metals, have been examined in detail using optical and electron microscopy and microhardness testing. The characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in the weld metals have been determined using scanning electron microscopy and automatic image analysis. The continuous cooling transformation diagrams of the base metal and the weld metals have been developed using dilatometry and microstructural observation. Additionally, precipitation hardening by alloy carbides has been studied by tempering of weld metals. It was found that, below a critical preheat temperature, weld metal transverse cracks developed in the self restrained G-BOP test at least five minutes after welding and initiated below 150 °C, confirming that the weld metal transverse cracking was cold cracking. Shielding with Ar- 20 %C 02 mixture resulted in significantly lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking than shielding with Ar- 5 %C 02 mixture. However, the microstructures of the weld metals deposited with the two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures were similar and mainly consisted of acicular ferrite and bainitic ferrite. Comparing the two weld metals, the higher oxygen potential of the Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture caused reduction of hardenability elements such as carbon, boron, manganese and silicon in the weld metal; and the higher oxygen absorption during welding resulted in a higher non-metallic inclusion volume fraction and a slightly larger mean particle size and number of particles per unit volume. These factors led to phase transformation during cooling at higher temperature in weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02, a slightly coarser microstructure with more bainitic ferrite, and a significantly lower hardness than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02. In addition, the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture had a lower diffusible hydrogen level and less nitrogen in solid solution. These characteristics combined with the lower hardness value of the weld metal are considered to be the main factors contributing to the lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 compared with Ar- 5 %C 02 under the same welding conditions. Three types of fracture morphologies were found {{to be associated with the}} weld metal transverse cold cracking: microvoid coalescence (MVC) fracture, quasi-cleavage (QC) fracture and intergranular (IG) fracture. IG was more prevalent in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture while MVC dominated in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02. These trends are consistent with the difference in weld metal hardness (strength). The susceptibility to weld metal transverse cold cracking, based on the G-BOP test, decreased with increasing preheat temperature for both shielding gas mixtures. No cracking was observed for the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture for a preheat of 40 °C, but a preheat of 100 °C was required for crack-free welding using Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture. However, it is concluded that the finer microstructure of the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 is capable of both higher strength and lower cold cracking susceptibility than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 provided the hardnesses are similar and below a critical level of about 290 HV...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} rheological {{characterization of}} mine tailings and paste materials as saturated solid-liquid or homogenous mixtures. Thickened tailings and paste fill {{can be classified}} as viscoplastic or time-independent non-Newtonian fluid material. Viscoplastic fluids deform plastically when the applied shear stress {{is less than a}} critical stress, which is known as "yield stress". When the shear <b>stress</b> exceeds the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> this type of fluid flows like a viscous material with finite viscosity. In terms of pipeline design for transportation of mine tailings or paste material, {{one of the most important}} rheological parameters that must be measured would be <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> There are numerous techniques and equipment that can be used for rheological characterization and specifically for <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> measurements. Literature review shows that the vane method is one of the best rheometery techniques for determining the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of homogeneous fluids directly. There is also a method for calculating the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> from slump height. Any geometry of slump moulds, cone or cylinder, with different dimensions can be applied in this method. The standard conical slump test is basically used for controlling the workability of fresh concrete. This method was then modified for <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and viscosity calculation of cemented mixtures. These slump tests can be categorized as in-situ methods of <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> measurements. Several rheometery and in-situ experiments were carried out to measure the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of two mine tailings samples in this study. A rheometer was used in controlled shear rate and controlled shear <b>stress</b> modes for <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> measurements with the vane method. The results were satisfactory for cemented and non-cemented mixtures. The effect of mixing time on the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of material combined with cement was also assessed using the vane method. No significant difference emerged between increased <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the mixtures after 4 minutes and 12 minutes of mixing. The accuracy of calculated <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> values using in-situ methods was also determined by drawing comparisons between these series of data and actual <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> measured using a rheometer.
