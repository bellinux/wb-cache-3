2500|$|Smith's {{major new}} car program {{prior to the}} 1984 reorganization, GM10 (also known as W-body), has been called [...] "The biggest {{catastrophe}} in American industrial history." [...] Beginning in 1982, and costing $7 billion, {{the plan was to}} replace all midsize cars produced by Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick. The plan was huge in scope, calling for seven plants that would each assemble 250,000 of the cars, or 21% of the total U.S. car market. It was badly executed from the start, but the 1984 reorganization wrought havoc on the program and it never recovered. By 1989, the year before the last of the original GM10s were launched, GM was losing $2000 on every one of the cars it produced. When asked by Fortune why GM10 was such a catastrophe, Smith replied, “I don't know. It's a mysterious thing. I've said I'll take <b>my</b> <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the blame on all those things. I was part of the team.” Nonetheless, the W-body platform that sprouted from the GM10 program lasted in production in some form until 2016.|$|E
