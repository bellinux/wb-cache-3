5000|$|The binding {{between a}} public key and its [...] "owner" [...] must be correct, {{or else the}} {{algorithm}} may function perfectly and yet be entirely insecure in practice. As with most cryptography applications, the protocols used to establish and verify this binding are critically important. Associating a public key with its owner is typically done by protocols implementing a public key infrastructure - these allow {{the validity of the}} association to be formally verified by reference to a trusted third party in the form of either a hierarchical certificate authority (e.g., X.509), a local trust model (e.g., SPKI), or a web of trust scheme, like that originally built into PGP and GPG, and still to some extent usable with them. Whatever the cryptographic assurance of the protocols themselves, the association between a public key and its owner is ultimately a matter of subjective judgment {{on the part of the}} trusted third party, since the key is a mathematical entity, while the owner - and the connection between owner and key - are not. For this reason, the formalism of a public key infrastructure must provide for explicit statements of the policy followed when making this judgment. For example, the complex and never fully implemented X.509 standard allows a certificate authority to identify its policy by means of an object identifier, which functions as an index into a catalog of registered policies. Policies may exist for many different purposes, ranging from anonymity to <b>military</b> <b>classifications.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Mazhabis, whom {{historian}} Stephen Cohen says [...] "had strong caste {{traditions of}} violence and aggressiveness and were classed as a criminal caste by the British", lost their military employment following {{the defeat of the}} Sikhs in the Anglo-Sikh Wars. Some eventually found employment as pioneers in the army of Gulab Singh, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. In 1857, the British turned to them for help during the Indian Rebellion, apparently to counteract the rebellious sepoys of the Bengal Army. The First Pioneer Sikh Regiment soon found itself helping to break the Siege of Delhi, a second regiment was raised in 1858 and a third followed soon after. This military employment contributed to a gradual improvement in their social status and in 1911 their official classification in Gujranwala and Lyallpur was uplifted to that of [...] "agricultural caste" [...] by the British authorities.

40|$|This thesis will assess {{influential}} guerrilla doctrine advising optimal insurgent (1) operational environment, (2) organizational structure, (3) logistical capacity, and (4) dependent tactics - {{items of}} consistent, yet incomplete analysis in counter-insurgency (COIN) analytics {{and civil war}} scholarship. Following a review of five of the most infamously disseminated guerrilla doctrine and training manuals, this thesis derives a model of advised guerrilla war production. The derived model illustrating the strategic and operational principles of reviewed doctrine presents an organizational hybrid between guerrilla hierarchies and networks, positing optimal organizational structure {{as a function of}} operational environment. Logistical capacity, tactics, target set, and <b>military</b> <b>classification</b> are in turn best determined by organizational structure. An otherwise unobserved operational dynamic relating each of the above four enumerated strategic considerations is thereby illustrated, with implications for COIN theory and praxis. To present a more systematic evaluation of reviewed guerrilla doctrine, the derived model is evaluated against a qualitative case-study of Peru's Shining Path insurgency. Case-study empirics are drawn from the Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conflicts Dataset (ACD) on dyadic conflict (Cederman, Min, Wimmer 2010), Arc Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial analysis software, declassified Peruvian intelligence reports, and captured Shining Path documents and directives from the Peruvian insurrection between 1969 - 1989. This study finds that evaluated guerrilla doctrine accurately reflects the material conditions of insurgency. There is one caveat: The global trends of increasing urbanization, dissolution of state power, and decline in politically motivated insurgency, may contribute to an observed shift in non-state actor war production from rural to increasingly urban and civilian-centric economies of violence.

40|$|In historiography, {{the terms}} military/coercive {{missions}} and Crusades are evaluated as synonyms, although in their definitional senses these concepts are different and vary in degrees. The so-called military/ coercive missions {{are not part}} of the history of war, which cannot be said of the Crusades. The Crusades were carried out by the crusaders who were often called the pilgrims. However, such labeling is part of war rhetoric which attempted to elevate them to the level of Christ. The fact that from the beginning of the 12 th century to the 14 th century missions and conquests on the Eastern shore of the Baltic sea were contemporaneous, allowed many researchers to speak of military/coercive missions, although as it became clear, there were also certain coercive elements in the earlier missions, which till then were labeled as peaceful. (These coercive elements are mentioned by the chroniclers Thietmar of Merseburg (beginning of the 11 th century), Helmold of Bosau (middle of the 12 th century), Henry of Livonia (Henricus de Lettis) (beginning of the 13 th century), the historiographies of St. Brunon of Querfurt (beginning of the 11 th century), st. Otton of Bamberg (12 th century)). With this consideration it becomes clearer that war was one of many means of coercion against pagan Balts (and also against the pagan Slavs of Palabis); thus the coercion itself does not determine the nature of military missions. Therefore a question can be raised: is it fruitful to distinguish wars from missions? Missions were not wars and their use of coercion does not determine their nature but their method. The use of coercion in missions does not signal the loss of their “militaryness” nor their “peacefulness”: coercion was also applied in peaceful contexts in absence of conquerors or subjugators (as it occurred in Poland, Hungary, Czechia or Scandinavian countries). On the other hand, the Crusades, not being part of missions but part of <b>military</b> <b>classification,</b> cannot be equated with missions, if we consider the complete term “military/coercive missions”. However, even if we recognize this, there still remains the problem of relation between missions and Crusades. First, there remains the questions as to which pagans (pagans or pagan-apostates) the Crusades were directed against, (and with the subsequent arrival of the German order), the conquests. Second, considering the schema of peaceful missions becoming military ones, it remains unclear how during the period of the Crusades, simultaneously with the conquests of pagan Balts, Christian missions could function. Neither is it completely clear, whether war was part of the mission’s form of coercion, as “punishment” of the apostates...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{military}} dependent and civilian students with respect to academic aptitude and the number of problems they perceive in several areas of their personal lives. It also included a survey of participation in extracurricular activities in school and in activity participation in their respective communities. Sex comparisons were also analyzed for differences within and between the military dependent and civilian student groups. The following specific null hypotheses were tested: Hypothesis 1. There are no differences in aptitude for scholastic achievement between civilian and military adolescents. Hypothesis 2. There is no relation between civilian and <b>military</b> <b>classification</b> and the number of personal problems reported by adolescents. The subjects were 209 students enrolled in Grade 10 at Glasgow High School, Glasgow, Montana during the school year 1967 - 68. The final groups consisted of 177 students tested for academic aptitude and 199 were investigated for self-perceived problems. A total of 207 students were surveyed for extracurricular participation. In order to test Hypothesis 1, the analysis of variance and discriminate score analysis were applied to the scores of military dependent and civilian students on the Differential Aptitude Test. This test consists of eight subscales: 1) verbal reasoning, 2) numerical ability, 3) abstract reasoning, 4) clerical speed and accuracy, 5) mechanical reasoning, 6) space relations, 7) spelling and 8) grammar. The results of these analyses indicated that the null hypothesis could be rejected for the male-female comparison by the analysis of variance. This was caused primarily by the extremes of the mean scores of the military females who were highest in clerical speed and accuracy, spelling and grammar subscales and lowest in the mechanical reasoning subscale. The results of the discriminate score analysis indicated that the greatest clustering for self-group was found for the military females and the least self-clustering existed for civilian females. These findings indicated a higher degree of sex differentiation between male and female military dependent students than that exhibited by their civilian counterparts. To test Hypothesis 2, X² analysis was applied to the various tabulations of data of the Mooney Problems Check List, High School Form, which is divided into eleven subscales: 1) health and physical development, 2) finances, living, 3) courtship-sex and marriage, 4) social recreational, 5) social psychological, 6) personal psychological, 7) morals and religion, 8) home and family, 9) future, vocational, 10) adjustment to school work and 11) curriculum and teacher procedures. The results of the X² analyses indicated rejection of Hypothesis 2 for the social recreational subscale of the MPCL. The courtship-sex and marriage subscale indicated rejection for females only, which was further supported by the X² values found in comparing the military and civilian females. Upon further examination, the significance of the home and family subscale was found to be related to male-female differences. Results of the survey of participation in extracurricular activities showed that civilian females had the highest participation in school activities. Civilian females and military males had the highest participation in community activities. Military students in general exhibited a very low rate of participation in school activities. The possible reasons for these results were discussed. Also included were sections discussing the value of this study, limitations and suggestions for further research...|$|E
