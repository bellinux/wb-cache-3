5000|$|The P227 {{is similar}} in many ways to the P220 in [...]45 ACP that SIG Sauer {{introduced}} in 1975. It uses the same SIG Sauer designed short recoil locking system with their Single/Double Action trigger. The P220 is a full sized large pistol. The P227 uses a double row magazine for increased ammunition capacity and is very slightly larger {{to the point that}} it is not very noticeable. [...] The action is automatically propped open after the firing of the last round in the magazine. The hammer, can be safely lowered by the decocking lever. Takedown is accomplished by removing the <b>magazine,</b> <b>locking</b> the slide open, and then turning down the takedown lever. The slide, barrel, and recoil spring will then slide forward off of the frame.|$|R
50|$|Editors of the <b>magazine</b> {{included}} Robert <b>Lock,</b> Richard Mansfield, Charles Brannon, and Tom R. Halfhill. Noted columnists included Jim Butterfield, educator Fred D'Ignazio {{and science}} fiction author Orson Scott Card.|$|R
50|$|As the {{recoil spring}} returns to its {{uncompressed}} state, it pushes the bolt body backward with sufficient force to cycle the action. The bolt body unlocks and retracts the bolt head, extracts and ejects the cartridge, cocks the hammer, and compresses the return spring. Once the bolt reaches {{the end of}} its travel, the return spring provides the force to chamber the next round from the <b>magazine,</b> and <b>lock</b> the bolt closed.|$|R
50|$|Smith & Wesson 410, part of Smith & Wesson's American Pride Series of pistols, was {{designed}} as an affordable handgun for the American market. The SA/DA semi-automatic pistol's controls include an external hammer, trigger, slide-release, magazine-release, and a safety located on the slide. Engagement of the safety also de-cocks the hammer. As an additional safety, the pistol will only fire if the <b>magazine</b> is <b>locked</b> in place. Factory sights and grip are plastic.|$|R
50|$|Magazines are {{designed}} to be light-tight in and of themselves. However, usually this is buffered by additional precautions made to maintain light-tightness, against both fault of equipment and humans. The latches used to open the <b>magazine</b> usually <b>lock</b> when closed and require non-casual fiddling to trip their locks. They are then furthermore protected by being taped up when loaded. Sometimes the entire edge of the magazine door is taped as an extra measure of light-tightness, although for newer properly maintained magazines this is not strictly necessary.|$|R
5000|$|This {{style of}} rifle {{is made by}} {{combining}} an AR-15 upper receiver with an AR-15 lower receiver {{which has not been}} banned by specific name, and which has a fixed, non-detachable 10-round (maximum, anything above 10 is a felony) magazine. In such a configuration, otherwise prohibited features such as a telescoping stock, pistol grip, and flash hider may be present. While formerly prohibited under the now-expired federal assault weapon ban of 1994-2004, the presence of a bayonet lug is not prohibited by California state law and can be present on firearms without violation. However, the magazine cannot be detachable, so to load the rifle the shooter must either [...] "top load" [...] or use a tool to release the <b>magazine</b> <b>lock</b> (such as the tip of a bullet in [...] "bullet button" [...] equipped rifles). To top-load, the shooter pulls the rear takedown pin, hinges the upper receiver on the front pivot pin, and loads the now exposed magazine. Alternatively, several [...] "magazine lock" [...] devices are available which replace the magazine release button with an inset pin that requires the use of a special tool to release the magazine, thereby, disallowing a readily [...] "detachable magazine", to be compliant with California state firearms law.|$|R
50|$|The barrel for the Canadian C3A1 is a heavy, fully free {{floating}} barrel chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO round. It has a weight of 2.04 kg/4.5 lbs and {{a length of}} 60 cm. Rifling follows a 1:12 turn ratio with 4 right hand twists. The action is a Mauser-style rotating bolt type. It has 3 stainless steel locking lugs at {{the front and rear}} of the bolt. The C3 safety is a thumb activated lever above the <b>magazine</b> which <b>locks</b> the trigger, bolt and sear giving ultimate protection against an accidental discharge.|$|R

"Lock N Load" [...] {{was also}} played in {{football}} stadiums, including at Wembley Stadium during the sold out NFL American football {{game between the}} Jacksonville Jaguars and the San Francisco 49ers on 27 October. Coinciding with the tour of the UK, Britains Classic Rock magazine included a feature of The Dead Daisies in its November 2013 issue. The band was also Novembers spotlight artist for both Metal Hammer and Classic Rocks websites.

50|$|In late September 2014 the IZ109T was {{released}} in the USA. This model featured a shortened barrel with a permanently attached brake. Barrel length was 18 inches including the brake. The IZ109T also had military style features including a rear pistol grip and 6 position stock. Various modifications {{were made to the}} trigger group, bolt, and bolt carrier that allowed loaded <b>magazine</b> insertion without <b>locking</b> the bolt back. The IZ109T also featured a fully parkerized military finish.|$|R
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the <b>magazine</b> firmly <b>locked.</b> German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|R

50|$|The new rifle {{features}} a heavy-taper stainless steel barrel, a detachable 10-round double-stack box magazine, custom iron sights calibrated from 100-600 meters, a laminated wooden stock, stainless steel construction with extra corrosion resistant coatings, and enlarged trigger guards and bolt handles {{so they can}} be used by rangers without requiring them to remove their gloves. The barrel, bolt and receiver will be made by Colt Canada under licence from SAKO. In addition to the rifle, the accessories package will include a custom-molded Pelican hard transport case, plus a soft transport case (outfitted with sling, extra <b>magazines,</b> a trigger <b>lock</b> and custom cleaning kit). Both hard case and soft case and rifle butt stock feature the Canadian Ranger badge.|$|R
50|$|Today, St. David's Battery is intact, but derelict. The two 9 {{inch and}} the two 6 inch guns remain emplaced, but {{have been allowed to}} suffer {{considerable}} corrosion damage. The two 6 inch guns, which had originally been emplaced without any kind of gun shield, had been retrofitted later with box-shaped armour shields, providing protection from the front, the sides, and above. Intact in the early 1990s, these barbettes had subsequently suffered such damage that they were removed. The area is currently public parkland (Great Head Park), and the Park Service has made some repairs, and painted the guns to protect them from further corrosion. The breech blocks of the two 9.2 inch guns have been replaced with newly manufactured ones. The barracks and other buildings {{to the rear of the}} battery are currently used by a kindergarten school and for private accommodation. A number of apartment buildings have been built around them, and on the hillside dropping down to the North of the battery. Although the <b>magazines</b> are <b>locked,</b> the guns of the battery can be visited by the general public without restriction or cost.|$|R
5000|$|The saiga most resembles an AK-74 and the AK-100 {{series of}} rifles. It {{includes}} a stamped receiver, and 90-degree gas block unlike the AK-47 {{which has a}} milled receiver and 45-degree gas block. The use of a third trunnion rivet gives it resemblance to the AK-100 series of rifles Russia is currently exporting. This rivet is not present on the AK-47, AKM, and AK-74, the bullet guide in these designs incorporate an extra appendage which allows the bolt to lock while this Saiga and AK-100's use a single rivet design. Most {{of the components of}} the Saiga are similar if not identical to an AK-101, but there are many cosmetic and functional differences between a Saiga and an AK series rifle. On the Saiga there is a pin that is used to secure the front hand guard on to the front barrel assembly and a screw that is used to secure the hand guard in towards the rear. The 7.62×39 version Saiga is unable to accept standard AK-47 (7.62×39, 5.45×39, 5.56×45) magazines; physically the magazine catch will not allow a <b>magazine</b> to <b>lock</b> into place inside of the receiver. The Saiga's magazine catch has a smaller clearance between the receiver than a [...] "normal" [...] AK. This does not allow the larger lug of a non-Saiga <b>magazine</b> to <b>lock</b> in. The AK type magazines can be modified to lock in place, but cartridges may not feed because the Saiga's receiver lacks a bullet guide. The bullet guide allows a round to be pulled from a magazine and then fed into the chamber without being caught on the front trunnion; this bullet guide is specifically built on the lip of the Saiga magazine. Any magazine used that does not have this feature may not feed reliably in the rifle.Another difference of some later model Saigas is that they have a bolt hold open button. The Saiga bolt hold open is engaged by manually pressing a lever near the trigger guard and pulling the charging handle rearward although this feature does not automatically hold the rifle's action open after the last round is fired as seen on the AR-15. Most versions of the rifle lack a pistol grip and don't have a threaded front sight block, making it unable to accept muzzle devices. The trigger and trigger guard of most of the US versions are placed farther back on the receiver than on a typical AK series rifle, and a transfer bar type system is used to release the hammer. This results in the Saiga to have a considerably heavier and grittier trigger pull than that of other Kalashnikov-made firearms.|$|R
2500|$|When fired, {{a portion}} of the {{propellant}} gases are evacuated into the gas cylinder through a [...] port, drilled at a 30° angle in the barrel, and a channel in the gas block. The high-pressure gases drive the piston rod (which is attached to the bolt carrier) rearward. During this rearward movement, a cam slot machined into the bolt carrier engages a cam pin on the bolt and rotates the bolt, unlocking the action. The arrangement of parts on the bolt carrier assembly provides for a degree of free travel, allowing gas pressure in the barrel to drop to a safe level before unlocking. To the immediate rear of the chrome-plated piston head is a notched ring which provides a reduced bearing surface and alleviates excess gas build-up.

5000|$|As post-script to the vz. 24 story, the {{production}} of the Czech Kar 98k Mauser continued {{after the end of the}} war. Under Czechoslovak Army designation vz. 98N (vz. being an abbreviation for vzor, or model year, and the suffix '"N"' denoted německá - the word '"German"' in Czech (language), this designation being used on many weapons of German origin kept in the post-World War II Czechoslovak armed forces), it served until around 1952 as the service rifle for the post-war Czechoslovak forces, and was extensively exported. Early post-war specimens were identical with wartime versions, and the use of existing stocks of wartime parts continued until exhausted. The receiver marking reverted to a pre-war style Czech rampant lion symbol, although a specimen using a German style receiver code of 'tgf' and the date '1950' has been observed. The left side of the receiver was marked [...] "ČESKOSLOVENSKÁ ZBROJOVKA, A.S., BRNO". The standard settled on was distinguished by a new magazine assembly made from steel stampings, with an oversized trigger guard for use with thick winter gloves. The new stamping, unlike late-war German stamped trigger guard/magazine assemblies, did not have a detachable magazine floorplate, meaning whole trigger guard/magazine must be unscrewed and removed entirely to clean the <b>magazine.</b> The <b>locking</b> screws, which stopped movement of the bolts securing the action and trigger guard to the stock, were deleted. Stocks were mostly solid (not laminated) beech with the German Kar 98k side sling attachments but no cleaning rod recess, and a German [...] "Kriegsmodell" [...] type late-war buttplate with firing pin dismantling hole in the side. Examples produced after the Communist takeover in 1948 were marked Národní podnik ("National Corporation").|$|R
5000|$|The P22 is {{equipped}} with a magazine disconnect that prevents the trigger from operating on the sear mechanism unless a magazine is actually inserted and locked into the weapon. [...] The magazine disconnect on a P22 works by using a strong spring to apply downward force against the trigger bar, such force being sufficient to overcome the action of the relatively weaker trigger spring which interacts with upward force on the same bar. When a <b>magazine</b> is not <b>locked</b> into the weapon, the downward force of the stronger magazine disconnect spring causes the trigger bar to pass beneath the internal lockwork of the weapon when the trigger is pressed. Once a magazine is fully inserted, however, an actuator surface {{on the front of the}} magazine pushes against the magazine safety. This overcomes the magazine safety's strong spring, and thereby serves to allow the trigger bar to spring upward under the force of the less powerful trigger spring. When this occurs, the trigger bar is in a position where it engages the lockwork when the trigger is actuated.|$|R
5000|$|General Thomas Gage, who {{had become}} the {{military}} governor of Massachusetts in May 1774, was charged with enforcement of the highly unpopular Intolerable Acts, which British Parliament had passed {{in response to the}} Boston Tea Party.

Uz navođenje podataka iz provedenih konzervatorsko-restauratorskih radova, raspravljeni su mogući uzroci rušenja Medvedgrada: potres, požar i eksplozija baruta. Razmatra se i postojanje istočne kule čiji je prostor do sada uglavnom bio smatran stambenim dijelom istočnog palasa. To se temelji na prikazima više očuvanih fotografija i crteža iz prijašnjih razdoblja, te prema današnjem stanju, obliku i funkciji koju je ta kula imala u prvoj etapi gradnje sjevernog dijela utvrde. U zaključku se raspravlja o mogućnostima budućih konzervatorskih radova na Medvedgradu. Medvedgrad, {{a medieval}} burg near Zagreb, was {{abandoned}} in the 17 th century. Literature has so far mentioned a severe earthquake that demolished the burg in 1590. The author, based on his observations and mineralogical-petrographic analyses conducted, argues that {{the deterioration of the}} structure was in large part due not only to the earthquake, but also to a fire accompanied by an explosion of stored gunpowder. Even nowadays that Medvedgrad has been renovated, charred portions can be spotted on the stone walls of Sts. Phillip and Jacob’s chapel and the staircase leading up to the chapel, while during the course of archaeological excavations, the traces of fire were clearly visible on the stone frontispiece between the old centre of the burg and a more recent courtyard with the southern tower. The original frontispiece was dilapidated and had to be fully renovated with new stone, so this portion no longer has visible traces of fire. All the portions that were exposed to the fire are discernible by a red tone over the originally yellowish variety of lithothamnium limestone from the Miocene period. When exposed to heightened temperature caused by fire, the original yellowish-ochre colour of stone, which comes from the limonite mineral, turns red, as the mineral changes into hematite. Apart from the fire, there was also an explosion of gunpowder that was stored in small wooden barrels. The hoops of the barrels went flying across the <b>magazine,</b> and <b>locked</b> padlocks with hasps were found further away from the door openings, indicating that they were blasted off from the slots by the force of the explosion. The paper also argues for the existence of an eastern tower, whose space was thus far usually interpreted as the residential area of the eastern palas. The author bases his arguments on several existing photographs and drawings from earlier periods, as well as the present-day state, the shape and the function that the tower had in the first phase of construction of the northern portion of the fortress. As a conclusion, the possibilities for further conservation work on Medvedgrad are discussed...|$|R
