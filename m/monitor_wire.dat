The increase of contact voltage, followed by rapidfluctuations generated by wear particles, has been analysed. A test bench designed to <b>monitor</b> <b>wire</b> vibrations was used while the transferred amplitude was measured by a high sensitivity displacement sensor. The contact interface was made of copper alloy and tin coated. The connector was connected to a resistive power supplytransmitting different currents and voltage values.

The appearance of contact fluctuations observed during the fretting generated by cable vibrations, and depending upon the wear effect, is attributed toelectromechanical phenomena. Some slow fluctuations are well correlated to the vibration period while the rapid ones are linked to an electrical conduction perturbation in the granular interface caused by the connector movement...|$|E

40|$|During stable-beams {{operations}} of the LHC, the ATLAS High Level Trigger (HLT) offers the fastest and most precise online measurement available of the position, size and orientation of the luminous region at the interaction point. Taking advantage of {{the high rate of}} triggered events, a dedicated algorithm is executed on the HLT processor farm of several hundred nodes that uses tracks registered in the silicon detectors to reconstruct event vertices. The distribution of these vertices is aggregated across the farm and its shape is extracted through fits every 60 seconds. A correction is applied online to adjust for the intrinsic vertex resolution by examining the displacement of split vertices. The location, widths and tilts of the luminosity distribution are fed back to the LHC operators in real time. The transverse luminous centroid mirrors variations in the IP orbit, while its position along the beam axis is sensitive to the relative RF phase of the two beams.

METHODSTwenty patients with CAD and NIDDM (diabetics), and 20 patients with only CAD (nondiabetics) were evaluated. Intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS) imaging with simultaneous intracoronary pressure (P 2) recordings were performed at the imaging site with 0. 014 in fiber-optic high fidelity pressure <b>monitoring</b> <b>wire.</b> The same wire was used as guide wire for the ICUS catheter. Sites with less than 50 % luminal stenosis by ICUS were studied. Recordings were done before and after 300 μg of intracoronary nitroglycerin (IC-NTG). Electrocardiographic tracings recorded simultaneously with ICUS images were used for timing. Systolic and diastolic cross-sectional lumen area (CSLA) and coronary artery distensibility (C-DIST) were measured, C-DIST = {(systolic CSLA-diastolic CSLA) /[(intracoronary pulse pressure) × (diastolic CSLA) ]} × 1, 000. RESULTSDiabetics had smaller CSLA (diabetics = 8. 6 ± 0. 6 mm 2, nondiabetics = 11. 5 ± 0. 5 mm 2, p < 0. 01). Although C-DIST was similar before IC-NTG in the two groups, it became significantly lower in diabetics after IC-NTG (diabetics C-DIST = 3. 02 ± 0. 14 mm Hg− 1, nondiabetics C-DIST = 4. 21 ± 0. 15 mm Hg− 1, p < 0. 01).

40|$|Aging wiring {{has become}} a {{critical}} issue to DoD, NASA, FAA, and Industry. The problem is that insulation on environmentally aged wire becomes brittle and cracks. This exposes the underlying conductive wire to the potential for short circuits and fire. The difficulty is that techniques to <b>monitor</b> aging <b>wire</b> problems focus on applying electrical sensing techniques that are not very sensitive to the wire insulation. Thus, the development of methods to quantify and <b>monitor</b> aging <b>wire</b> insulation is highly warranted. Measurement of wire insulation stiffness by ultrasonic guided waves is being examined. Initial laboratory tests were performed on a simple model consisting of a solid cylinder and then a solid cylinder with a polymer coating. Experimental measurements showed that the lowest order axisymmetric mode may be sensitive to stiffness changes in the wire insulation. To test this theory, mil-spec wire samples MIL-W- 81381, MIL-W- 22759 / 34, and MIL-W- 22759 / 87 (typically found in aircraft) were heat-damaged in an oven, {{in a range of}} heating conditions. The samples were 12, 16, and 20 gauge and the heat-damage introduced material changes in the wire-insulation that made the originally flexible insulation brittle and darker in color. Axisymmetric mode phase velocity increased for the samples that were exposed to heat for longer duration. For example, the phase velocity in the 20 -gauge MIL-W- 22759 / 34 wire changed from a baseline value of 2790 m/s to 3280 m/s and 3530 m/s for one-hour exposures to 3490 C and 3990 C, respectively. Although the heat-damage conditions {{are not the same as}} environmental aging, we believe that with further development and refinements, the ultrasonic guided waves can be used to inspect wire-insulation for detrimental environmental aging conditions...|$|R
