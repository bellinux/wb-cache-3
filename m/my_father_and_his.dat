[...] The name of the ship was not recorded, nor has it been identified since.

2500|$|Hughes had a {{very poor}} {{relationship}} with his father, with whom he lived in Mexico {{for a brief period}} in 1919. Upon graduating from high school in June 1920, Hughes returned to Mexico to live with his father, hoping to convince him to support his plan to attend Columbia University. Hughes later said that, prior to arriving in Mexico, [...] "I had been thinking about <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> strange dislike of his own people. I didn't understand it, because I was a Negro, and I liked Negroes very much." [...] Initially, his father had hoped for Hughes to attend a university abroad, and to study for a career in engineering. On these grounds, he was willing to provide financial assistance to his son but did not support his desire to be a writer. Eventually, Hughes and his father came to a compromise: Hughes would study engineering, so long as he could attend Columbia. His tuition provided; Hughes left his father after more than a year. While at Columbia in 1921, Hughes managed to maintain a B+ grade average. He left in 1922 because of racial prejudice. He was attracted more to the people and the neighborhood of Harlem than his studies, though he continued writing poetry.|$|E

60|$|To be brief, then, I {{lived on}} in my usual {{miscellaneous}} manner, gradually getting a knowledge of good and evil, until I had attained my twenty-first year.

6000|$|... "All very true, my friend; but, as {{that sort}} of {{measurement}} will not answer to keep farms separate, we are obliged to survey the whole off into lots of smaller size.
