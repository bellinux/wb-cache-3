50|$|On 9 November 2013, Kotov {{performed}} {{his fourth}} spacewalk outside the ISS with Sergey Ryazansky.They took the Olympic torch for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games outside ISS. They also continued {{work on an}} extravehicular activity workstation and biaxial pointing platform by removing launch brackets and bolts, as well as retrieving an experimental package. The planned installation of a foot restraint on the <b>mounting</b> <b>seat</b> of the workstation was deferred to a future spacewalk after the spacewalkers noticed some issues with its alignment. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours 50 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The Colt {{closely resembles}} the Tri-Pacer {{and uses the}} same landing gear, engine <b>mounts,</b> <b>seats,</b> windshield, door, tail surfaces, struts and the same {{instrument}} panel as well.

5000|$|Within the auditorium, one patron, {{sitting on}} the aisle, is {{continually}} annoyed by other patrons wishing to pass him {{and sit in the}} same row. Frustrated enough, he rips his <b>mounted</b> <b>seat</b> out of the ground and moves into the aisle. Before the main feature (a picture starring Cookie & titled [...] "The Chinchilla"), we see a newsreel. In Italy, Prime Minister [...] "Mausoleum" [...] (Benito Mussolini) has lowered the mandatory age for military service, and so several toddlers in uniform stride past him for review. In [...] "Yodel", Switzerland, the Swiss navy launches the nation's newest battle cruiser, which sinks into the sea not a moment after her first embarkation. The Swiss officials present show a pleasant apathy for the situation! ...|$|R
50|$|The vehicle's {{ballistic}} armour {{is designed}} to protect the Lynx from anti-tank weapons, medium-calibre ammunition, artillery shrapnel, and bomblets.

50|$|Hagansport is an unincorporated {{community}} in Franklin County, Texas, United States. It {{is located at}} the junction of State Highway 37 and Farm Road 71, eleven miles northwest of the county <b>seat,</b> <b>Mount</b> Vernon.|$|R
5000|$|Electric-assist {{and other}} [...] "motorized bicycles" [...] {{do not need}} to be inspected, do not require a license, and do not require registration. The vehicle must meet all of the {{following}} criteria: a post <b>mounted</b> <b>seat</b> for each person it is designed to carry, two or three wheels which contact the ground, fully operative pedals, wheels at least 16 inches in diameter and a motor not capable of propelling the device at more than 20 mph on level ground. The driver does not need a license, but must be at least 16 years old. DC law prohibits motorized bicycles from traveling anywhere on the sidewalk or in the bike lanes. DC Regulation 18-1201.18 provides: [...] "Except as otherwise permitted for a motor vehicle, no person shall operate a motorized bicycle on any sidewalk or any off-street bikepath or bicycle route within the District. This prohibition shall apply even though the motorized bicycle is being operated solely by human power." [...] So, if cars are prohibited in a particular place, motor-assisted bikes are also prohibited.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the low}} floor is accommodating the bus's own wheels. With the low floor, the wheels protrude into the passenger cabin, {{and need to be}} contained in wheel pockets of waist height, and this occupies space which would otherwise be used for seating. To allow space for technical equipment, many low-floor buses have the <b>seats</b> <b>mounted</b> on podiums, making a small step up from the floor, while others are able to <b>mount</b> the <b>seats</b> directly to the floor, avoiding the step. Seating layout for a low-floor bus therefore requires careful design. Low floor configuration is also known to have poor side to side dead load distribution within the chassis due to the asymmetrical off-centre placement of driveline components - mainly engine and transmission. As a result, many of such buses require electronically controlled air suspension to compensate the lopsided configuration.|$|R
5000|$|Because the shifter {{and parking}} brake cannot be <b>mounted</b> between the <b>seats,</b> the {{transmission}} selector or shifter is {{moved to the}} steering column, and the emergency brake is activated by a pedal in the driver's footwell.|$|R
