5|$|As of 2016, {{the genus}} {{contains}} nine accepted species. There are seven species of crested newts: Anatolian crested newt (Triturus anatolicus), Balkan crested newt (T. ivanbureschi), Danube crested newt (T. dobrogicus), Italian crested newt (T. carnifex), Macedonian crested newt (T. macedonicus), northern crested newt (T. cristatus), and southern crested newt (T. karelinii). Marbled newts have two species, the <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> (T. marmoratus) {{and the southern}} <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> (T. pygmaeus).|$|E
5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In {{a case study in}} the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} southern <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> where that species had historically replaced the <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the Quaternary glacial cycles, around 2.6 mya, the extant Triturus species had already emerged. They were thus {{affected}} by the cycles of expansion and retreat of cold, inhospitable regions, which shaped their distribution. A study using environmental niche modelling and phylogeography showed that during the Last Glacial Maximum, around 21,000 years ago, crested and marbled newts likely survived in warmer refugia mainly in southern Europe. From there, they recolonised the northern parts after glacial retreat. The study also showed that species range boundaries shifted, with some species replacing others during recolonisation, for example the southern <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> which expanded northwards and replaced the <b>marbled</b> <b>newt.</b> Today's most widespread species, the northern crested newt, was likely confined to a small refugial region in the Carpathian Basin during the last glaciation, and from there expanded its range north-, east- and westwards when the climate rewarmed.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious colour {{differences}} between crested and <b>marbled</b> <b>newts,</b> {{species in the}} genus also have different body forms. They range from stocky with sturdy limbs in the Anatolian, Balkan and the southern crested newt {{as well as the}} <b>marbled</b> <b>newts,</b> to very slender with short legs in the Danube crested newt. These types were first noted by herpetologist Willy Wolterstorff, who used the ratio of forelimb length to distance between fore- and hindlimbs to distinguish subspecies of the crested newt (now full species); this index however sometimes leads to misidentifications. The number of rib-bearing vertebrae in the skeleton was shown to be a better species indicator. It ranges from 12 in the <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> to 16–17 in the Danube crested newt and is usually observed through radiography on dead or sedated specimens.|$|R
500|$|Triturus is a genus of newts {{comprising}} the crested and the <b>marbled</b> <b>newts,</b> which are found from Great Britain {{through most of}} continental Europe to westernmost Siberia, Anatolia, and the Caspian Sea region. [...] Their English names refer to their appearance: <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> have a green–black colour pattern, while the males of crested newts, which are dark brown with a yellow or orange underside, develop a conspicuous jagged seam on their back and tail during their breeding phase.|$|R
5|$|In European Salamandridae, {{albinism}} {{has been}} recorded in the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica), Italian crested newt (Triturus carnifex), <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> (Triturus marmoratus), Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and two sub-species of the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris vulgaris and Lissotriton vulgaris meridionalis).|$|E
5|$|Marbled newts {{owe their}} name to their green–black, marbled colour pattern. In females, an orange-red line runs down back and tail. The crest of male marbled newts is smaller and fleshier {{than that of}} the crested newts and not indented, but <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> males also have a whitish tail band at {{breeding}} time.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{crested newt}} and the <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> {{are the only}} species in the genus with a considerable range overlap (in western France). In that area, they have patchy, mosaic-like distributions and in general prefer different habitats. When they do occur in the same breeding ponds, they can form hybrids, which have intermediate characteristics. Individuals resulting from the cross of a crested newt male with a <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> female had mistakenly been described as distinct species Triton blasii de l'Isle 1862, and the reverse hybrids as Triton trouessarti Peracca 1886. The first type is much rarer due to increased mortality of the larvae and consists only of males, while in the second, males have lower survival rates than females. Overall, viability is reduced in these hybrids and they rarely backcross with their parent species. Hybrids made up 3–7% of the adult populations in different studies.|$|E
50|$|Celestial orientation, {{navigation}} {{using the}} stars, {{is commonly used}} for homing. Displaced <b>marbled</b> <b>newts,</b> for example, can only home when stars are visible.|$|R
50|$|In Season 3, episode 8 ("Rear Bus Window") Newton proclaims {{that he is}} {{a member}} of the genus Triturus, which are crested or <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> native to Europe. Newton also {{mentions}} the species name vittercensis, which is not a catalogued member of the genus.|$|R
5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and <b>marbled</b> <b>newts.</b> Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|R
5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{are found}} in Eurasia, from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula {{in the west to}} West Siberia and the {{southern}} Caspian Sea region in the east, and reach north to central Fennoscandia. Overall, the species have contiguous, parapatric ranges; only the northern crested newt and the <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> occur sympatrically in western France, and the southern crested newt has a disjunct, allopatric distribution in Crimea, the Caucasus, and south of the Caspian Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{crested newt}} {{is the most}} widespread species, while the others are confined to smaller regions, e.g. the southwestern Iberian Peninsula in the southern <b>marbled</b> <b>newt,</b> and the Danube basin {{and some of its}} tributaries in the Danube crested newt. The Italian crested newt (T. carnifex) has been introduced outside its native range in some European countries and the Azores. In the northern Balkans, four species of crested newt occur in close vicinity, and may sometimes even co-exist.|$|E
5|$|A 24-million-year-old fossil {{belonging}} to Triturus, perhaps a <b>marbled</b> <b>newt,</b> {{shows that the}} genus already existed {{at that time and}} contradicts the earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (mya) for the split between the crested and marbled newts and their sister genus, the European brook newts (Calotriton). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the Eocene, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors have investigated diversification within the genus and related it to paleogeography: The crested and marbled newts split between 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of marbled newts have been separated for 4.7–6.8 million years.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{immediately}} threatened, crested and <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> suffer from population declines, caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation. Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover-rich, natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected. All species are legally protected in Europe, {{and some of}} their habitats have been designated as special reserves.|$|R
500|$|Adult newts begin {{moving to}} their {{breeding}} sites in spring when temperatures stay above [...] This usually occurs in March for most species, {{but can be}} much earlier in the southern parts of the distribution range. Southern <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> mainly breed from January to early March and may already enter ponds in autumn. The time adults spend in water differs among species and correlates with body shape: while it is only about three months in the <b>marbled</b> <b>newts,</b> it is six months in the Danube crested newt, whose slender body is best adapted to swimming. Triturus newts in their aquatic phase are mostly nocturnal and, compared to the smaller newts of Lissotriton and Ichthyosaura, usually prefer the deeper parts of a water body, where they hide under vegetation. As with other newts, they occasionally {{have to move to}} the surface to breathe air. The aquatic phase serves not only for reproduction, but also offers the animals more abundant prey, and immature crested newts frequently return to the water in spring even if they do not breed.|$|R
5|$|Historically, most European newts were {{included}} in the genus, but taxonomists have split off the alpine newts (Ichthyosaura), the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton) and the banded newts (Ommatotriton) as separate genera. The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts (Calotriton). Two species of <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> and seven species of crested newts are accepted, of which the Anatolian crested newt was only described in 2016. Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap, hybridisation may take place.|$|R
5|$|During their {{terrestrial}} phase, crested and marbled newts {{depend on}} a landscape that offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts are {{much more difficult to}} detect and observe on land. Deciduous woodlands or groves are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The southern <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, the quality of the surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised.|$|E
5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the oviduct. The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, {{such as water}} cress or floating sweetgrass, usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic bags. In the northern crested newt, a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested {{when they do not}} possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E
25|$|Most {{amphibians}} of the Loire {{are found}} in the slow flow areas near the delta, especially in the floodplain, marshes and oxbows. They are dominated by the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), frogs and toads. The toads include Bufo bufo, Alytes obstetricans, Bombina variegata, Bufo calamita, Pelobates fuscus and Pelobates cultripes. The frogs are represented by the Parsley frog (Pelodites punctatus), European tree frog (Hyla arborea), Common Frog (Rana temporaria), Agile Frog (R. dalmatina), Edible Frog (R. esculenta), Perez's Frog (R. perezi), marsh frog (R. ridubunda) and Pool Frog (R. lessonae). Newts of the Loire include the <b>Marbled</b> <b>Newt</b> (Triturus marmoratus), Smooth Newt (T. vulgaris), Alpine Newt (T. alpestris) and Palmate Newt (T. helveticus).|$|E
5|$|The two <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> {{are readily}} {{distinguished}} by size and colouration. In contrast, separating crested newt species based on appearance is not straightforward, but most {{can be determined}} {{by a combination of}} body form, coloration, and male crest shape. The Anatolian, Balkan, and southern crested newt however are cryptic, morphologically indistinguishable species. Triturus newts occupy distinct geographical regions (see Distribution), but hybrid forms occur at range borders between some species and have intermediate characteristics (see Hybridisation and introgression).|$|R

500|$|Triturus species usually live at low elevation; the Danube {{crested newt}} for example is {{confined}} to lowlands up to [...] above sea level. However, they do occur at higher altitudes towards the south of their range: the Italian crested newt is found up to [...] in the Apennine Mountains, the southern crested newt up to [...] in the southern Caucausus, and the <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> up to around [...] in central Spain.|$|E
500|$|Most of the crested and marbled newts {{are listed}} as species of [...] "least concern" [...] by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, but {{population}} declines have been registered in all assessed species. The Danube crested newt and the southern <b>marbled</b> <b>newt</b> are considered [...] "near threatened" [...] because populations have declined significantly. Populations have been affected more heavily in some countries and species are listed in some national red lists. The Anatolian, Balkan and the Macedonian crested newt, recognised only recently, {{have not yet been}} evaluated separately for conservation status.|$|E
500|$|Juveniles often {{disperse}} to new breeding sites, {{while the}} adults in general {{move back to the}} same breeding sites each year. The newts do not migrate very far: they may cover around [...] in one night and rarely disperse much farther than [...] For orientation, the newts likely use a combination of cues including odour and the calls of other amphibians, and orientation by the night sky has been demonstrated in the <b>marbled</b> <b>newt.</b> Activity is highest on wet nights; the newts usually stay hidden during daytime. There is often an increase in activity in late summer and autumn, when the newts likely move closer to their breeding sites. Over most of their range, they hibernate in winter, using mainly subterranean hiding places, where many individuals will often congregate. In their southern range, they may instead sometimes aestivate during the dry months of summer.|$|E
5|$|Crested and <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> {{live and}} breed in vegetation-rich ponds or similar aquatic {{habitats}} {{for two to}} six months and usually {{spend the rest of}} the year in shady, protection-rich land habitats close to their breeding sites. Males court females with a ritualised display, ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female. After fertilisation, a female lays 200–400 eggs, folding them individually into leaves of water plants. Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land-dwelling juveniles.|$|R
500|$|Both the crested and the <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> {{were long}} {{considered}} as single species, Triturus cristatus and T. marmoratus, respectively. Substantial genetic differences between subspecies were, however, noted and {{eventually led to}} their recognition as full species, with the crested newts often collectively referred to as [...] "T. cristatus superspecies". The Balkan and the Anatolian crested newt, the most recent species formally described (2013 and 2016, respectively), were only recognised through genetic data; together with the Southern crested newt, they form a cryptic species complex with no morphological differences known.|$|R
50|$|Marbled newts have {{dark brown}} or black bodies with {{irregular}} patterns of green. They have black bellies with off-white specks. Adult females have an orange stripe {{running down the}} back from the head {{to the tip of}} the tail. Juveniles also have this stripe, but it fades on males at about 9 months. Breeding males have a large wavy crest that runs from its neck down to the tip of its tail, but is a little bit shorter where the tail meets the body. The crest is striped yellowish-white with black. Adult <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> are from 5 in to 6.5 in long.|$|R
500|$|Courtship display {{serves to}} emphasise the male's body and crest size and to waft pheromones towards the female. A {{position}} characteristic {{for the large}} Triturus species is the [...] "cat buckle", where the male's body is kinked and often rests only on the forelegs ("hand stand"). He will also lean towards the female ("lean-in"), rock his body, and flap his tail towards her, sometimes lashing it violently ("whiplash"). If the female shows interest, the ritual enters the third phase, where the male creeps away from her, his tail quivering. When the female touches his tail with her snout, he deposits a packet of sperm (a spermatophore) on the ground. The ritual ends with the male guiding the female over the spermatophore, which she then takes up with her cloaca. In the southern <b>marbled</b> <b>newt,</b> courtship is somewhat different from the larger species in {{that it does not}} seem to involve male [...] "cat buckles" [...] and [...] "whiplashes", but instead slower tail fanning and undulating of the tail tip (presumably to mimic a prey animal and lure the female).|$|E

5|$|Molecular phylogenetic data helped clarify {{relationships}} within the genus Triturus. A 2011 phylogeny based on complete mitochondrial DNA resolved all divergences with high statistical support. The crested and the <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> are sister groups, {{and within the}} crested newts, the Balkan–Asian group with T. anatolicus, T. karelinii and T. ivanbureschi is sister to the remaining species, results consistent with other studies. The mitochondrial analysis also supports the northern (T. cristatus) and the Danube crested newt (T. dobrogicus), {{as well as the}} Italian (T. carnifex) and the Macedonian crested newt (T. macedonicus), respectively, as sister species, but analysis of nuclear DNA gave some conflicting results regarding those divergences.|$|R
500|$|The crested newts {{are listed}} in Berne Convention Appendix II as [...] "strictly protected", and the <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> in Appendix III as [...] "protected". They are also {{included}} in Annex II (species requiring designation of special areas of conservation; crested newts) and IV (species in need of strict protection; all species) of the EU habitats and species directive. As required by these frameworks, their capture, disturbance, killing or trade, {{as well as the}} destruction of their habitats, are prohibited in most European countries. The EU habitats directive is also the basis for the Natura 2000 protected areas, several of which have been designated for the crested newts.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{in groups}} of both sexes of <b>marbled</b> <b>newts</b> (Triturus marmoratus) from Sintra, Portugal, kept {{for a few weeks}} in a large aquarium, is described. Behaviour patterns described for this species and for other species in this genus were recognised. The following behaviours are described for the first time: Walk-over, Land-over, Stand-on, Show, Erect-body, Yawn, Circle, and Dig. Females seem to have {{a more active role in}} courtship than is usually considered. The behaviour frequencies for each sex were analysed using simulation statistics. Some elements usually classified as male sexual behaviours occur in both sexes and are likely to play other social roles...|$|R
