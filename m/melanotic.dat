5000|$|Equine {{melanoma}} {{results from}} abnormal proliferation and accumulation of melanocytes, pigmented cells within the dermis. Gray horses over 6-years-old are especially prone to developing melanoma. The prevalence of melanoma in gray horses over 15 years old {{has been estimated}} at 80%. One survey of Camargue-type horses found an overall population prevalence of 31.4%, with prevalence increasing to 67% in horses over 15 years old. [...] Up to 66% of melanomas in gray horses are benign, [...] but <b>melanotic</b> tumors in horses with darker hair-coats may be more aggressive and are more often malignant. One retrospective study of cases sent to a referral hospital reported a 14% prevalence of metastatic melanoma within the study population. However, the actual prevalence of metastatic melanoma may be lower due to infrequent submission of <b>melanotic</b> tumors for diagnosis. Common sites for metastasis include lymph nodes, the liver, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, blood vessels and parotid salivary gland.|$|E

50|$|These were {{discovered}} in 1991 growing inside and around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine showed that three melanin-containing fungi—Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Wangiella dermatitidis, and Cryptococcus neoformans—increased in biomass and accumulated acetate faster in {{an environment in which}} the radiation level was 500 times higher than in the normal environment. Exposure of C. neoformans cells to these radiation levels rapidly (within 20-40 minutes of exposure) altered the chemical properties of its melanin, and increased melanin-mediated rates of electron transfer (measured as reduction of ferricyanide by NADH) three- to four-fold compared with unexposed cells. Similar effects on melanin electron-transport capability were observed by the authors after exposure to non-ionizing radiation, suggesting that <b>melanotic</b> fungi might also be able to use light or heat radiation for growth.|$|E
5000|$|Differently {{from the}} <b>melanotic</b> nevi and the {{verrucous}} nevi on the skin, age spots change with time {{in color and}} in shape. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory [...] proposes a hypothesis {{on the development of}} age spots. Firstly, the development of a flat spot is a result of accumulation of aged basal cells. When the skin is aged, some aged cells that contain lipofuscin bodies cannot be removed. An aged cell will affect the functionality of the local tissue and promote the aging of its neighbor cells. By a feedback loop, more and more neighbor cells become aged and lipofuscin-containing. They aggregate and form a spot with an irregular shape. Secondly, protruding of a flat spot {{is a result of the}} death of aged cells in the spot and release of lipofuscin bodies. Isolation of the un-digestible lipofuscin bodies in a fibrotic capsule is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the tissue. Successive encapsulation of dead cells and lipofuscin bodies results in the growth of a spot in three dimensions. The dense lipofuscin bodies in the capsule make a protruding spot soft and dark in color.|$|E

40|$|The schwannomas are benign tumors {{originating}} from Schwann cells which constitute the nerve sheath.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Melanotic</b> schwannoma is a {{pigmented}} nerve tumor {{that may}} {{be located in the}} skin and express local aggressivity. This tumor may occur singly. It may also be part of the Carney complex which consists of various, but specific, tumors. OBJECTIVE: We report two cases of subcutaneous <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma localized on the trunk in two men aged 37 and 45 years. METHODS: Conventional histology and immunohistochemistry were performed. RESULTS: One <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma was associated with a cutaneous atypical myxoma and multiple melanocytic lesions, all being part of the Carney complex. The other case had no associated signs. In both cases, the <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma was completely excised and did not recur. CONCLUSION: <b>Melanotic</b> schwannoma is rare and curable by surgery. It must not be confused with malignant melanoma and other pigmented neoplasms. The Carney complex should be carefully ruled out. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{histological}} {{differential diagnosis}} between <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma, primary leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions and cellular blue nevus can be challenging. Correct diagnosis of <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma {{is important to}} select patients who need clinical evaluation for possible association with Carney complex. Recently, we described the presence of activating codon 209 mutations in the GNAQ gene in primary leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions. Identical codon 209 mutations have been described in blue nevi. The aims {{of the present study}} were to (1) perform a histological review of a series of lesions (initially) diagnosed as <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma and analyze them for GNAQ mutations, and (2) test the diagnostic value of GNAQ mutational analysis in the differential diagnosis with leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions. We retrieved 25 cases that were initially diagnosed as <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma. All cases were reviewed using established criteria and analyzed for GNAQ codon 209 mutations. After review, nine cases were classified as <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma. GNAQ mutations were absent in these nine cases. The remaining cases were reclassified as conventional schwannoma (n = 9), melanocytoma (n = 4), blue nevus (n = 1) and lesions that could not be classified with certainty as <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma or melanocytoma (n = 2). GNAQ codon 209 mutations were present in 3 / 4 melanocytomas and the blue nevus. Including results from our previous study in leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions, GNAQ mutations were highly specific (100 %) for leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions compared to <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma (sensitivity 43 %). We conclude that a detailed analysis of morphology combined with GNAQ mutational analysis can aid in the differential diagnosis of <b>melanotic</b> schwannoma with leptomeningeal melanocytic lesions...|$|E
