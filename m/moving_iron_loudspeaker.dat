50|$|The moving iron {{speaker was}} the {{earliest}} type of electric loudspeaker. They are still used today in some miniature speakers where small size and low cost {{are more important}} than sound quality. A moving iron speaker consists of a ferrous-metal diaphragm or reed, a permanent magnet and a coil of insulated wire. The coil is wound around the permanent magnet to form a solenoid. When an audio signal is applied to the coil, the strength of the magnetic field varies, and the springy diaphragm or reed moves in response to the varying force on it. The <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> Bell telephone receiver was of this form. Large units had a paper cone attached to a ferrous metal reed.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> transducer, the {{telephone}} receiver or earphone, evolved {{with the first}} telephone systems in the 1870s. Moving <b>iron</b> horn <b>loudspeakers</b> developed from earphones after the first amplifying device which could drive a speaker, the triode vacuum tube, was perfected around 1913. They were used in radio receivers and the first public address systems. Moving <b>iron</b> cone <b>loudspeakers</b> appeared around 1920. Around 1930 they were replaced by the moving coil cone loudspeaker developed in 1925 by Edward Kellogg and Chester Rice. Today the <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> driver mechanism is still used in some earphones.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> speaker. Old undamped <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> {{speakers}} have a characteristic sound, with probably the worst sound quality of any known type of speaker usable for speech. Modern damped <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> mechanisms can provide respectable sound quality, and are used in headphones.|$|R

5000|$|Inductor dynamic speaker: These enjoyed brief {{success in}} the 1920s but were quickly eclipsed by moving coil speakers. The {{inductor}} dynamic speaker solved the nonlinearity problem of earlier <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> types, providing a more pleasant listening experience. The main defect of ID speakers was very poor treble response, giving them a characteristic dull drone. Inductor dynamic <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> speakers are now rare. Moving coil mechanisms provide better sound quality without the assorted downsides of <b>moving</b> <b>iron,</b> and eclipsed the inductor dynamic shortly after its introduction.|$|R

50|$|The {{sound of}} <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> {{speakers}} {{has a strong}} unmistakable character.|$|R
50|$|A lot of <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> {{speakers}} have no damping. This {{means the}} moving member resonates freely in the audio band. This {{is bad news}} for sound quality, but introducing damping heavily reduces sensitivity. This was impractical in pre-war times when amplification was very expensive, so <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> has a history of being used with no damping.|$|R
5000|$|Tendency of the <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> {{to stick}} to the pole piece, {{resulting}} in a 'whack' sound followed by very little sound output.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{design is}} the <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> variation on <b>moving</b> magnet used by ADC, Grado, Stanton/Pickering 681 series, Ortofon OM and VMS series, and the MMC cartridge of Bang & Olufsen. In these units, the magnet itself sits behind the four coils and magnetises the cores {{of all four}} coils. The <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> cross {{at the other end}} of the coils varies the gaps between itself and each of these cores, according to its movements. These variations lead to voltage variations as described above.|$|R

The Inductor Dynamic Speaker solved the worst {{problems}} of earlier <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> types, {{and provided a}} relatively pleasant listening experience. The main defect of ID speakers was poor treble response, giving them a charactistic dull drone.|$|R

50|$|Balanced {{armature}} drivers (a type of <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> driver) use an armature {{that moves}} like a see-saw or diving board. Since {{they are not}} damped, they are highly efficient, but they also produce strong resonances. They are still used today for high end earphones and hearing aids, where small size and high efficiency are important.|$|R
5000|$|Balanced {{armature}}: Balanced armature <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> speakers {{were developed}} {{in an attempt to}} reduce the high distortion levels of single ended drive speakers. Their success was mixed, as although they did reduce the percentage of distortion, they changed that distortion from even harmonic distortion to odd, making the distortion more unpleasant in some respects.|$|R

50|$|In {{the iron}} vane type, the {{magnetic}} flux {{in the core}} directly affects a <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> vane, allowing both AC and DC to be measured, and gives a true root mean square (RMS) value for non-sinusoidal AC waveforms. Due to its physical size it is generally limited to power transmission frequencies up to around 100 Hz.|$|R
5000|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, an armature generally {{refers to}} one of the two principal electrical components of an electromechanical or electrical machine [...] - [...] generally in a motor or generator [...] - [...] but it may also mean the pole piece of a permanent magnet or electromagnet, or the <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> part of a solenoid or relay.|$|R
5000|$|Cone: Cone loading {{is more or}} less {{always used}} with sprung mechanisms. The {{combination}} of these 2 permits a less rigid fixing of the driven member, permitting more movement. The cone is also better able to handle lower frequencies compared to a table-top sized horn. Consequently these speakers have better bass response than small horn speakers. Spring force restrains the <b>moving</b> <b>iron.</b> The downside of greater movement is greater non-linearity, thus higher distortion. Paper cone loaded <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> speakers were in use pre-war. These suffered some noticeable issues: The magnetic gap was usually manually adjustable to give good sensitivity at any given output volume. Misadjustment was thus common. The iron sometimes stuck to the magnet if overdriven or misadjusted. The result was a loud 'whack' followed by near silence. Loud bass notes caused end-stopping. Unlike modern speakers, which are designed to produce soft end-stopping, the iron in these hitting the pole piece made a noisy resonant chattering sound.|$|R

5000|$|Homemade pre-war sets usually {{used some}} form of <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> speaker, usually horn or cone loaded, and {{occasionally}} disc loaded. The sound quality of such radios is generally unimportant, since almost any defect in the audio signal will be masked by the butchery visited upon it by the loudspeaker. The question of sound quality is heavily dominated by the speaker in these cases. Moving iron speakers suffer the following defects: ...|$|R
50|$|Shapur II (r. 309-379) further {{reformed}} {{the army}} by adopting heavier {{and more effective}} cavalry. These mounted units were clad in thick iron plates which covered their entire body. This made them look very much like <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> statues. Some were armed with a lance and some with a sword and/or mace. Depictions of aforementioned cavalry still survive, {{with one of the}} best preserved ones being a rock relief at Taq-e Bostan where Khosrau II is seen riding his favourite horse, Shabdiz.|$|R
5000|$|In the <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> instrument, an iron vane {{is mounted}} on a shaft along with the pointer. The field winding is a {{three-phase}} winding, with the phases connected to both the running and incoming sources through a phase-shifting [...] "impedor" [...] network containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. In this instrument, conceptually the field winding produces two rotating magnetic fields due to the running and incoming sources. The iron vane moves {{in response to the}} resultant sum of the two fields.|$|R
5000|$|In most generators, {{the field}} magnet is rotating, and {{is part of}} the rotor, while the {{armature}} is stationary, and {{is part of the}} stator. [...] Both motors and generators can be built either with a stationary armature and a rotating field or a rotating armature and a stationary field. The pole piece of a permanent magnet or electromagnet and the <b>moving,</b> <b>iron</b> part of a solenoid, especially if the latter acts as a switch or relay, may also be referred to as armatures.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> {{speaker was}} the first type of speaker that was invented. Unlike the newer dynamic (moving coil) design, a moving-iron speaker uses a {{stationary}} coil to vibrate a magnetized piece of metal (called the iron, reed, or armature). [...] The metal is either attached to the diaphragm or is the diaphragm itself. [...] This design was the original loudspeaker design, {{dating back to the}} early telephone. [...] Moving iron drivers are inefficient and can only produce a small band of sound. [...] They require large magnets and coils to increase force.|$|R
5000|$|Polarity: Polarity matters when dc {{is present}} in the speaker. Wrong {{polarity}} weakens the magnetic field, and can sometimes demagnetise the permanent magnet, leaving the speaker non-functional. When powered with ac only, polarity is a non-issue. Nearly all modern amplifiers feed only ac to the speakers. However when using a <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> speaker on an early radio, dc is usually present, and either the polarity marked on the speaker should be observed, or means used to remove the dc component from the speaker. This was often done with a choke and capacitor.|$|R
5000|$|Impedance: Early <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> {{speakers}} were normally high impedance, being {{designed to}} be connected directly to the output triode with no transformer or dc blocking. Quality and output level can be significantly improved by removing most bass from the electrical input signal. This is simply achieved by using a capacitor in series with the speaker. Table-top horns can only reproduce the highest of bass frequencies, so no noticeable bass is lost by removing most of the bass input. This reduces diaphragm or reed excursion, reducing harmonic and intermodulation distortion.|$|R
50|$|Crystal earpieces {{are usually}} {{monaural}} devices with very low sound fidelity, but high sensitivity and impedance. Their peak use was probably with 1960s era transistor radios and hearing aids. They {{are not used}} with modern portable media players due to unacceptable sound quality. The main causes of poor performance with these earpieces are low diaphragm excursion, nonlinearity, in-band resonance and the very short horn shape of the earpiece casing. The resulting sound is very tinny and lacking in bass. Modern headphones use electromagnetic drivers that work similarly to speakers, with moving coils or <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> cores in a magnetic field.|$|R
5000|$|Rather {{than using}} a D'Arsonval {{movement}} or digital electronics, the solenoid voltmeter simply uses a spring-loaded solenoid carrying a pointer (it {{might also be}} described as a form of <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> meter). Greater voltage creates more magnetism pulling the solenoid's core in further against the spring loading, moving the pointer. A short scale converts the pointer's movement into the voltage reading. Solenoid voltmeters usually have a scale {{on each side of the}} pointer; one is calibrated for alternating current and one is calibrated for direct current. Only one [...] "range" [...] is provided and it usually extends from zero to about 600 volts.|$|R
50|$|Smaller earbud type earpieces, which {{plugged into}} the user's ear canal, were first {{developed}} for hearing aids but became widely used with transistor radios, the first truly portable radios, which were developed around 1960. The most popular audio device in history, the transistor radio changed listening habits, allowing people to listen to radio anywhere. The earbud uses either a <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> type driver or a piezoelectric crystal to produce sound.

50|$|The player {{controls}} Tony Stark in his Iron Man armor, maneuvering {{him through}} the game's various locations. Swiping the touchscreen moves the character, while tapping on characters results in shooting projectiles at enemies. For later devices with an orientation gyro, the game was updated to include gyro sensitivity features for <b>moving</b> <b>Iron</b> Man across the screen. This freed up player screen tapping to focus solely on offensive maneuvers. Levels are randomly generated and play out infinitely, until the player suffers enough damage to KO the character. Damage is suffered from flying human and droid enemies, from running into buildings and other obstacles, from crashing into jets, or from missile fire.

5000|$|Escanaba in {{the early}} 1900s {{experienced}} an economic boom due to its central location in the Upper Peninsula, which created a natural transportation hub <b>moving</b> <b>iron</b> ore from railroad cars onto ships. [...] In fact, the city's population grew from 9,500 in 1900 to 14,500 in 1913. [...] At about that time, a stockholder's corporation, {{supported in part by}} local businessmen, formed to construct a new hotel in the city. The Delta Hotel opened in January, 1914, and served as Escanaba's best hotel for many years. In 1922 the hotel was sold to Clyde J. Burns, an Escanaba businessman and politician. [...] Burns and his wife managed the hotel until 1957, when Burns' widow sold it to her nephew, David W. Walch.|$|R
