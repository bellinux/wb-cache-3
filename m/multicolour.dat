5|$|Versions of Gill Sans {{were created}} {{in a wide range}} of styles such as {{condensed}} and shadowed weights. An ultra-light version slightly lighter than the normal light style was also not digitally available until the 2015 Nova release. Several shadowed designs were released, including a capitals-only regular shadowed design and a light-shadowed version with deep relief shadows. In the metal type era, a 'cameo ruled' design that placed white letters in boxes or against a stippled black background was available. The shadowed weights were intended to be used together with the regular, printing in different colours, to achieve a simple <b>multicolour</b> effect. Some of the decorative versions may predominantly have been designed by the Monotype office, with Gill examining, critiquing and approving the designs sent to him by post. The long series of extensions, redrawings and conversions into new formats of one of Monotype's most important designs (extending long beyond Gill's death) has left Gill Sans with a great range of alternative designs and releases. A book weight was created in 1993 in between the light and regular weight, suitable for body text, along with a heavy weight.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe IMPASSE {{class of}} local search {{algorithms}} have given good results on many vertex colouring benchmarks. Previous work enhanced IMPASSE {{by adding the}} constraint programming technique of forward checking, in order to prune colouration neighbourhoods during search. On several large graphs the algorithm found the best known colourings. This paper extends the work by improving the heuristics and generalising the approach to bandwidth <b>multicolouring.</b> It is shown to give better results than a related search algorithm on an integer programming model, and to be competitive with published results. Experiments indicate that stronger constraint propagation further improves search performance, but that a symmetry breaking technique has unpredictable effects...|$|R
25|$|The {{advantages}} {{possessed by}} roller printing over all other processes are mainly three: firstly, its high productivity, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being commonly printed {{in one day}} of ten hours by a single-colour machine; secondly, by its capacity of being applied to the reproduction of every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of copperplate engraving and the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of block printing and to patterns varying in repeat from I to 80 in.; and thirdly, the wonderful exactitude with which each portion of an elaborate <b>multicolour</b> pattern can be fitted into its proper place, and the entire absence of faulty joints at its points of repeat or repetition consideration {{of the utmost importance}} in fine delicate work, where such a blur would utterly destroy the effect.|$|E

500|$|An [...] "attribute" [...] {{consists}} of a foreground and a background colour, a brightness level (normal or bright) and a flashing [...] "flag" [...] which, when set, causes the two colours to swap at regular intervals. This scheme leads to what was dubbed colour clash or attribute clash, where a desired colour of a specific pixel could not necessarily be selected. This became a distinctive feature of the Spectrum, meaning programs, particularly games, had to be designed around this limitation. Other machines available around the same time, for example the Amstrad CPC or the Commodore 64, did not suffer from this limitation. The Commodore 64 used colour attributes in a similar way, but a special <b>multicolour</b> mode, hardware sprites and hardware scrolling were used to avoid attribute clash.|$|E
40|$|For many {{problems}} in Scheduling and Timetabling {{the choice of}} a mathematical programming formulation is determined by the formulation of the graph colouring component. This paper briefly surveys seven known integer programming formulations of vertex colouring and introduces a new formulation using “supernodes”. In the definition of George and McIntyre [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 15 (1978), no. 1, 90 – 112], a “supernode ” is a complete subgraph, within which every pair of vertices have the same neighbourhood outside of the subgraph. A polynomial-time algorithm for obtaining the best possible partition of an arbitrary graph into supernodes is given. This makes it possible to use any formulation of vertex <b>multicolouring</b> to encode vertex colouring. Results of empirical tests on benchmark instances in graph colouring (DIMACS) and timetabling (Udine Course Timetabling) are also provided and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Graphene {{has been}} one of the most {{extensively}} studied materials due to its unique band structure, the linear dispersion at the K point. It gives rise to novel phenomena, such as the anomalous quantum Hall effect, and has opened up a new category of “Fermi-Dirac” physics. Graphene has also attracted enormous attention for future electronics because of its exceptional high carrier mobility, high carrier saturation velocity, and large critical current density. However, graphene has zero intrinsic band gap, thus can not be used as the active channel material for logic transistors with sufficient on/off current ratio. Previous approaches to address this challenge include the induction of a transport gap in graphene nanostructures or bilayer graphene. However, these approaches have proved successful in improving the on– off ratio of the resulting devices, but often at a severe sacrifice of the deliverable current density. Alternatively, with a finite density of states, tunable work-function and optical transparency, graphene can function as a unique tunable contact material to create a new structure of electronic devices. In this thesis, I will present my effort toward on-off ratio of graphene based vertical thin film transistor. I will include the work form four of my first author publication. I will first present my research studies on the a dramatic enhancement of the overall quantum efficiency and spectral selectivity of graphene photodetector, by coupling with plasmonic nanostructures. It is observed that metallic plasmonic nanostructures can be integrated with graphene photodetectors to greatly enhance the photocurrent and external quantum efficiency by up to 1, 500 %. Plasmonic nanostructures of variable resonance frequencies selectively amplify the photoresponse of graphene to light of different wavelengths, enabling highly specific detection of <b>multicolours.</b> Then I will show a new design of highly flexible vertical TFTs (VTFTs) with superior electrical performance and mechanical robustness. By using the graphene as a work-function tunable contact for amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) thin film, the vertical current flow across the graphene-IGZO junction can be effectively modulated by an external gate potential to enable VTFTs with a highest on-off ratio exceeding 105. The unique vertical transistor architecture can readily enable ultrashort channel devices with very high delivering current and exceptional mechanical flexibility. Furthermore, I will, demonstrate a new design strategy for vertical OTFT with ultra-short channel length without using conventional high-resolution lithography process. They can deliver a high current density over 1. 8 A/ cm 2 and thus enable a high cutoff frequency devices (~ 0. 4 MHz) comparable with the ultra-short channel organic transistors. Importantly, with unique vertical architecture, the entire organic channel material is sandwiched between the source and drain electrodes and is thus naturally protected to ensure excellent air-stability. Finally I will present a new strategy by using graphene as the back electrodes to achieve Ohmic contact to MoS 2. With a finite density of states, the Fermi level of graphene can be readily tuned by a gate potential to enable a nearly perfect band alignment with MoS 2. For the first time, a transparent contact to MoS 2 is demonstrated with zero contact barrier and linear output behaviour at cryogenic temperatures (down to 1. 9 K) for both monolayer and multilayer MoS 2. Benefiting from the barrier-free transparent contacts, we show that a metal-insulator-transition (MIT) can be observed in a two-terminal MoS 2 device, a phenomenon that could be easily masked by Schottky barriers found in conventional metal-contacted MoS 2 devices. With further passivation by boron nitride (BN) encapsulation, we demonstrate a record-high extrinsic (two-terminal) field effect mobility up to 1300 cm 2 /V s in MoS 2 at low temperature. These findings can open up exciting new opportunities for atomically thin 2 D semiconductors as well as other conventional semiconductors in general...|$|R
