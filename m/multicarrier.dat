50|$|DECT {{operates}} as a <b>multicarrier</b> Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) / Time division multiple access (TDMA) system. This means that the radio spectrum is divided into physical carriers in two dimensions: frequency and time.

DECT uses Time division duplex (TDD), which means that down- and uplink use the same frequency but different time slots.
