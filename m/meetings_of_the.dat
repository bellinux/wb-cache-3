5|$|<b>Meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council are {{normally}} held once each month wherever the sovereign {{may be in}} residence at the time.

5|$|The Chancellor was {{effectively}} the first {{minister of the}} kingdom.

His key responsibility was to preside at <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> privy council, and on those rare occasions he attended, at <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court of session. The second most prestigious office was the Secretary, who was responsible for the records of the Privy council and for foreign policy, including the borders, despite which the post retained its importance after the Union of Crowns in 1603. The Treasurer was the last of the major posts and, with the Comptroller, dealt with the royal finances until the Comptroller's office was merged into the Treasurer's from 1610.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Cardiff Castle {{escaped the}} slighting, or {{deliberate}} damage and destruction, that affected many other castles. Probably {{because of the}} threat of a pro-Royalist invasion by the Presbyterian Scots, a Parliamentary garrison was installed instead and the castle remained intact. The Herberts continued to own the castle as the Earls of Pembroke, both during the interregnum and after the restoration of Charles II. The castle's constable continued to act as mayor of the town of Cardiff, controlling the <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town's burgesses, bailffs and aldermen; the Herberts usually appointed members of the more important local gentry to this position during the period.|$|E

The annual <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Economic Forum in Davos bring together top international {{business and political}} leaders from Switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important issues facing the world, including health and the environment.

5|$|As {{requested}} by Walpole, George revived the Order of the Bath in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain political supporters by offering them the honour. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers {{of his own}} choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet; most of his communications were in private, and he only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, he arranged for the ratification by Great Britain, France and Prussia of the Treaty of Hanover, {{which was designed to}} counterbalance the Austro-Spanish Treaty of Vienna and protect British trade.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{moved to}} a farm in modern the Buenos Aires {{neighborhood}} of Núñez. The farm had some agriculture fields and a small brick factory. He lived next to other influential people like Cornelio Saavedra, Juan Larrea, Miguel de Azcuénaga, and attorney José Darragueira. The <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secret society continued, unaffected by the departure of Burke. On June 2, 1806, Castelli's mother died, {{and he was still}} in mourning when the city learned of a British landing in Quilmes.|$|E
5|$|Church {{and state}} {{maintained}} close {{relations in the}} Anglo-Saxon period, both socially and politically. Churchmen attended royal feasts as well as <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Council. During Æthelstan's reign these relations became even closer, especially as the archbishopric of Canterbury had come under West Saxon jurisdiction since Edward the Elder annexed Mercia, and Æthelstan's conquests brought the northern church {{under the control of}} a southern king for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Committees {{have two}} types of members: full members and {{participating}} members. In the case of standing committees, full members are the six outlined above. In addition, however, any Senator may arrange for the Senate to agree to their being made a participating member of the committee. This gives them {{the same rights as}} full members, with the important exception of being unable to vote on motions in private <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> committees.|$|E
5|$|Few Privy Counsellors are {{required}} to attend regularly. The settled practice is that day-to-day <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council are attended by four Privy Counsellors, usually the relevant Minister to the matters pertaining. The Cabinet Minister holding the office of Lord President of the Council, currently the Rt Hon. Andrea Leadsom , invariably presides. Under Britain's modern conventions of parliamentary government and constitutional monarchy, every order made in Council is drafted by a Government Department and has already {{been approved by the}} Minister responsible—thus actions taken by the Queen-in-Council are formalities required for validation of each measure.|$|E
5|$|Full <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council {{are held}} {{only when the}} reigning {{sovereign}} announces {{his or her own}} engagement (which last happened on 23 November 1839, in the reign of Queen Victoria); or when there is a demise of the Crown, either by the death or abdication of the monarch. A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when George, Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council.|$|E
