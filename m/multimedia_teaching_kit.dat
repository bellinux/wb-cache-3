The students in various groups would experience the identical procedure in teaching and learning while there was a difference between the feature of <b>multimedia</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning materials. For instance, students in treatment groups would learn problem solving in mathematics by using <b>multimedia</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning material with emotional design. By contrast, the multimedia material in control groups was without adding emotional design. Before teaching intervention, we had pretest to find out the level of initial knowledge of problem solving skills of each students. After the lesson, posttest and post-questionnaire was set up so that we can study the variations of the tests and the effective features of application of emotional design in teaching and learning materials. After the course of data collection and data analysis, we would induce two main conclusions. At first, we cannot give any testimonies to claim that students in primary 1 or primary 2 or both have higher performance in learning problem solving skills using multimedia learning material by integrating emotional design. On the other hand, <b>multimedia</b> <b>teaching</b> and learning material in combination with the elements of emotional design, such as color and cartoon, brings the learning motivation to the students.
