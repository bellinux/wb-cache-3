5|$|After their victory, Alcibiades and Thrasybulus {{began the}} siege of Chalcedon in 409 BC with about 190 ships. Although unable to attain a decisive victory or induce the city to surrender, Alcibiades was able to win a small {{tactical}} land battle outside of the city gates and Theramenes concluded {{an agreement with the}} Chalcedonians. Afterwards they concluded a temporary alliance with Pharnabazus which secured some <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> immediate cash for the army, but despite this Alcibiades was still forced to depart in search for more booty to pay the soldiers and oarsmen of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their first season, going 8–4, their financial status was a different story. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. They were in dire financial straits until the eleventh game of the season, when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans. This gave the Giants a <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> influx of revenue, and perhaps altered {{the history of the}} franchise.|$|E

5|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based daily Suara Merdeka, found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray {{tolerance}} in Indonesia without making the subject seem cliché; however, he considered some scenes, such as Hendra's conversion, overdone. Frans Sartono, reviewing for the historically Catholic daily Kompas, considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately interesting, because its social commentary was <b>much</b> <b>needed,</b> considering Indonesia's religious turmoil. He {{also noted that the}} characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion.|$|E
5|$|Following the injury, McLeod {{stated that}} she was {{relieved}} because the injury gave her a <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> break from the national team. After the 2007 World Cup, she experienced a drop in confidence due to both her own negative thoughts about her performances as well as derogatory comments about her sexuality made by fellow national team players. It took her years to finally {{get back to the}} national team.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of the Meadowhall shopping centre {{on the site of}} a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> jobs but speeding the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started by the hosting of the 1991 World Student Games and the associated {{building of}} new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium and the Ponds Forge complex. Sheffield began construction of a tram system in 1992, with the first section opening in 1994.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{comes across}} a village {{which has been}} razed to the ground by Dutch forces, killing almost all of its inhabitants. Upon directions from the sole survivor, {{they go to a}} nearby village and are warmly received, being given <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> food. As the men settle for the night, Sudarto goes for a walk with Widya, raising the men's ire. That night the men sleep comfortably in beds while the villagers stand guard. In the morning, however, the villagers– who are revealed {{to be related to the}} Darul Islam militant group– turn on them. The men successfully fight back, though Sudarto is shot by the village chief.|$|E
5|$|The next day, September 16, {{there was}} further {{fighting}} when {{a clash of}} outposts escalated into a running battle below Washington's lines on Harlem Heights. After several hours exchange of musketry, the forces engaged returned to their start lines, and {{the position of the}} two armies on Manhattan remained relatively unchanged for the next two months. Having held their own against picked British troops, the American army received a <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> boost to their morale after the debâcle of the previous day, while the British acquired a renewed respect for the American ability to stand and fight.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} achieved {{surprise and}} much initial success. To counter the {{attack from the}} air, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) handed operational control of its XXIX Tactical Air Command and part of its Ninth Air Force, {{under the command of}} Major General Hoyt Vandenberg, to the RAF and Arthur Coningham. On 23 December, the RAF Second Tactical Air Force provided the American forces with <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> support, and helped prevent a German capture of Malmedy and Bastogne. This left the Germans with only the logistical bottleneck of St. Vith to support their operations. The German attack faltered.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} on the front was chaotic during the day September 1. The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the Kihang ferry, captured Agok, and scattered A Company, 9th Infantry at its positions from Agok northward. A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river. From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers {{on many of the}} ridges surrounding them, most of them moving east. After several hours, 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down the hill to Agok to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night, returning later with <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> water, rations, and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Vince {{developed}} from an extratropical system on 8 October, becoming a subtropical storm {{southeast of the}} Azores. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not officially name the storm until the next day, shortly before Vince became a hurricane. The storm weakened at sea and made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula as a tropical depression on 11 October. Vince was the first tropical system to do so since the 1842 Spanish hurricane. It dissipated over Spain, bringing <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> rain to the region, and its remnants passed into the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|When the town's ruffians vandalize the half-restored carousel, {{the captain}} redoubles his efforts.

Mike refuses {{to make good on}} a promise of a <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> part for the carousel, unless the soldier agrees to fight a dog. The veteran reluctantly agrees to the fight during which he kills the dog. After installing the last piece that completes the carousel's restoration, he lays the dog's body inside it, starts it up and walks away, while the townspeople look on.|$|E

50|$|The 1871 {{census of}} England & Wales showed that Middlesbrough had {{the second highest}} {{percentage}} of Irish born people in England after Liverpool. This equated to 9.2% of the overall population of the district at the time. Due to the rapid development {{of the town and}} its industrialisation there was <b>much</b> <b>need</b> for people to work in the many blast furnaces and steel works {{along the banks of the}} Tees. This attracted many people from Ireland, who were in <b>much</b> <b>need</b> of work. As well as people from Ireland, the Scottish, Welsh and overseas inhabitants made up 16% of Middlesbrough's population in 1871.|$|R
5|$|While {{accompanying}} Queen Victoria to Taymouth Castle in 1842, Lady Elizabeth met George Douglas Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, {{the eldest}} son of the 7th Duke of Argyll. They married at the Leveson-Gower estate Trentham Hall on 31 July 1844. The Archbishop of York, Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, presided over the wedding. The Argyll estate was in debt, so Elizabeth's wealth was <b>much</b> <b>needed.</b> Their union resulted in the further joining of two of Scotland's largest landowning families.|$|E
5|$|While minor, Moore {{managed to}} earn <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> media {{interest}} in the later part of the election mostly due to John McCain's red baiting against Barack Obama and making {{an appeal to the}} 5th US Circuit Court to get ballot access in the state of Louisiana. His media campaign included writing articles in several leading newspapers such as The New Republic and the National Journal and making appearances on television, most notably The Colbert Report.|$|E
5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined {{over the years and}} Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> financial stability.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{an air of}} defeatism {{among the}} leadership, the {{professional}} French troops and New French militia defenders focused preparations for the British attacks on the Beauport Shore. Montcalm and his staff, Major-General François de Gaston, Chevalier de Lévis, Colonel Louis Antoine de Bougainville, and Lieutenant-Colonel de Sennezergue, distributed some 12,000 troops in a nine-kilometre-long collection of fortified redoubts and batteries from the Saint-Charles River to the Montmorency Falls, along the shallows of the river in areas {{that had previously been}} targeted by British attempts to land. Prior to the arrival of the British, a small fleet of supply ships had arrived in Quebec with <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> supplies. Those supplies, along with 500 reinforcements, were likely behind the lengthened siege.|$|E
5|$|However, once {{he learned}} that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his {{relationship}} to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to Amélie of Leuchtenberg. He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children and provided a <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gracie {{was a major}} {{hurricane}} {{that formed}} in September 1959, the strongest during the 1959 Atlantic hurricane season and the most intense to strike the United States since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. The system was first noted as an area of thunderstorms east of the Lesser Antilles which moved {{just north of the}} Greater Antilles, quickly intensifying into a hurricane on September 22. Gracie was a storm that was very difficult to forecast, with its movement unpredictable. After five days of erratic motion, Gracie became a major hurricane which struck South Carolina, and weakened as it moved up the Appalachians, bringing <b>much</b> <b>needed</b> rain to a drought-plagued region. Much of the destruction related with Gracie was centered on Beaufort, South Carolina. Gracie became an extratropical cyclone on September 30 while moving through the Eastern United States.|$|E
