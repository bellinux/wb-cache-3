5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the <b>meal</b> <b>plan.</b> A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the <b>meal</b> <b>plan.</b> First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Meal</b> <b>planning</b> {{could be}} a {{potential}} tool to offset time scarcity and therefore encourage home meal preparation, which has been linked with an improved diet quality. However, to date, <b>meal</b> <b>planning</b> has received little attention in the scientific literature. The aim of our cross-sectional {{study was to investigate}} the association between <b>meal</b> <b>planning</b> and diet quality, including adherence to nutritional guidelines and food variety, as well as weight status. Methods: <b>Meal</b> <b>planning,</b> i. e. planning ahead the foods that will be eaten for the next few days, was assessed in 40, 554 participants of the web-based observational NutriNet-Sante study. Dietary measurements included intakes of energy, nutrients, food groups, and adherence to the French nutritional guidelines (mPNNS-GS) estimated through repeated 24 -h dietary records. A food variety score was also calculated using Food Frequency Questionnaire. Weight and height were self-reported. Association between <b>meal</b> <b>planning</b> and dietary intakes were assessed using ANCOVAs, while associations with quartiles of mPNNS-GS scores, quartiles of food variety score and weight status categories (overweight, obesity) were evaluated using logistic regression models. Results: A total of 57 % of the participants declared to <b>plan</b> <b>meals</b> at least occasionally. Meal planners {{were more likely to have}} a higher mPNNS-GS (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 1. 13, 95 % CI: [1. 07 - 1. 20]), higher overall food variety (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 1. 25, 95 % CI: [1. 18 - 1. 32]). In women, <b>meal</b> <b>planning</b> was associated with lower odds of being overweight (OR = 0. 92 [0. 87 - 0. 98]) and obese (OR = 0. 79 [0. 73 - 0. 86]). In men, the association was significant for obesity only (OR = 0. 81 [0. 69 - 0. 94]). Conclusions: <b>Meal</b> <b>planning</b> was associated with a healthier diet and less obesity. Although no causality can be inferred from the reported associations, these data suggest that <b>meal</b> <b>planning</b> could potentially be relevant for obesity prevention...|$|R

25|$|University {{housing is}} {{guaranteed}} to all undergraduates for all four years. More than 98 percent of students live on campus in dormitories. Freshmen and sophomores must live in residential colleges, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories.

Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a <b>meal</b> <b>plan</b> and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen {{have been given the}} option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational eating clubs, which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{that our}} food {{environment}} can affect meal size is often taken {{to indicate a}} failure of ‘conscious control’.
