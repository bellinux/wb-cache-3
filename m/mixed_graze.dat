Thus, the four treatments were cattle with gastrointestinalnematode-infected goats (MI), gastrointestinal nematode-infected goats alone (CI), cattle with non-infected goats (MnI) and non-infected goats (CnI). Average daily gain (ADG, g/day) and grass production were measured for the four groups of animals (six goats and two heifers treated with MI or MnI) grazing for 3 months on 4 subplots. Monthly measurements were performed over 5 -day periods. This pattern was replicated in space for a second set of four subplots and in time for six successive cohorts of animals (bands 1 to 6). The ADG of goats in <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing</b> conditions was higher than controls irrespective of the infection status (32. 6 v. 18. 4 g/day for MI v. CI; 44. 2 v. 33. 5 g/day for MnI v. CnI).

40|$|This thesis {{applies the}} use of {{economic}} valuation techniques for valuing biodiversity focusing on production function approach. Biodiversity provides economic benefits, protects human health and offers food, food safety, recreational and aesthetic enjoyment. Biodiversity contributes to the economy through the provision of many ecosystem goods and services. However, many of the services provided by biodiversity are not traded in the marketplace so {{do not have an}} actual price or commercial value. Economics provides valuation techniques to help the decision-making process make better informed choices over trade-offs between biodiversity protection and livestock production and contribute to the management of biodiversity. This research aims to identify impacts, trade-offs and influencing factors that affect biodiversity, livestock productivity and environmental efficiency relating to biodiversity. Various econometric estimation techniques are used to find appropriate management solutions for biodiversity and livestock production. In what follows a brief outline of each chapter is provided. Chapter 2 determines factors affecting land abandonment. It examines the effects of different livestock grazing management on land abandonment amongst farms that manage commonage in the west of Ireland. It has been suggested that off-farm employment has {{played an important role in}} maintaining farmers in the Republic of Ireland (RoI). However, this results in farmers having less time to devote to farming activities and environmental stewardship; traditional practices such as <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing,</b> haymaking and commonage that frequently yield important public good benefits such as the provision biodiversity and landscape amenity may be abandoned. An ordered probit model is used to explain the probability of land abandonment. The results show that on-farm labour, livestock income and agri-environment scheme payments are found to reduce land abandonment whereas off-farm income, livestock costs and farmer age increases land abandonment. The risk of land abandonment is more likely to occur in suckler beef enterprises and least likely with <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing.</b> Findings indicate that mixed livestock systems may play an important role in preventing abandonment of commonage lands or by restoring damaged commonage lands in the Irish uplands. Chapter 3 investigates the impact of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity and livestock productivity in the west of Ireland. This study uses a two-stage regression estimation procedure to estimate the relationship between biodiversity and livestock productivity. In the first stage, a Cob Douglas production function is used to investigate the impact of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. In the second stage, a livestock production function is used to analyse the effects of habitat fragmentation on livestock productivity. The results show that habitat fragmentation is negatively correlated with biodiversity and livestock productivity. A specialisation in livestock grazing management has accelerated habitat loss and reduced biodiversity. On commonage lands, subsidies have positively influenced biodiversity in sheep farming whereas subsidies have no impact on biodiversity in mixed farming. In private lands, the results indicate slightly different findings. Subsidies are significantly and positively correlated with biodiversity in suckler beef and mixed farming. Empirical evidence suggests that a <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing</b> method was found to be the best management practice to improve biodiversity and livestock productivity. <b>Mixed</b> <b>grazing</b> management is found to be less vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and provides the highest total returns to livestock production compared to specialized livestock grazing management. It is, therefore, recommended that <b>mixed</b> livestock <b>grazing</b> should be better integrated into agri-environmental schemes such as the Rural Environment protection scheme (REPs) to conserve biodiversity and maintain productivity particularly for commonage. Chapter 4 considers to what degree efforts to enhance farm profitability compromises biodiversity conservation goals amongst livestock farmers in the west of Ireland. This paper aims to deliver empirical evidence on the links between environmental efficiency, biodiversity, and livestock management by analysing commonage farms in Ireland. The relationship between profit efficiency and Environmental Efficiency (EE) is examined comparing specialised versus <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing</b> farms; private versus commonage farmers; and full time versus part time farmers. A three-stage estimation procedure is employed. First, a stochastic biodiversity frontier function is used to estimate environmental efficiency. Second, a fixed effect stochastic profit frontier model is used to estimate profit efficiency. Finally, a truncated model is applied to estimate factors affecting the variation in environmental efficiency. The findings indicate that there is an inverse relationship between EE and profit. On commonage, there is a positive relationship between EE and stocking rate. Profitability and family labour have a negative impact on EE on private farms. On mixed farms, purchased feed decreases EE. However, stocking rate and the number of plots (land fragmentation) plays a positive role on EE. On specialised farms, environmental efficiency is negatively correlated with livestock profit, stocking rate, family labour, and subsidies whereas in mixed livestock farms environmental efficiency is negatively correlated with only purchased feed. However, there is no significant difference in EE between full-time and part-time farming...|$|R

Sequential grazing systems, when different animal species graze an area in succession, also have the potential to improve productivity. This experiment directly compared these two approaches for integrating the grazing of cattle and sheep when pastured on improved permanent pasture. Four treatments were compared: 1) sheep only from May to October (S/S); 2) cattle only from May to July followed by sheep only from August to October (C/S); 3) cattle and sheep from May to July, sheep only for the rest of the growing season (C + S/S); and 4) cattle and sheep from May to October (C + S/C + S). Each treatment was replicated three times. From May until weaning at the end of July the plots were grazed by steers and ewes and lambs, and from weaning until October by steers and lambs. Sward heights were maintained at 6 cm using a ?put and take? stocking system. Animal performance and sward composition data were collected during three growing seasons, 2001 ? 2003. During the pre-weaning period lambs grazing plots which were grazed only by sheep had significantly poorer growth rates than those grazing plots where there was <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing.</b> Lambs grazing the sheep only plots also had lower liveweight gain during the post-weaning period, with the highest growth rates being recorded on the C + S/C + S treatment.

Our experimental treatments included two management systems (e. g., a traditional versus a mixed system) and seven levels of stocking (i. e., 0, 1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5, 6. 0, 7. 5, and 9. 0 sheep/ha). The traditional system was managed with grazing and haymaking on two different areas. The mixed system was managed with a yearly shift between grazing and haymaking on the same area. The results showed that, with increasing stocking rate, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) declined in both traditional and <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing</b> plots. At high stocking rates, ANPP in <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing</b> plots was significantly higher than that in the traditional grazing plots. Our results were partially in agreement with the grazing optimization hypothesis. Under the two management regimes, and using different methods for estimating the annual ANPP, we observed overcompensation, equal-compensation, and under-compensation in plantgrowth along a gradient of stocking rates. Equal-compensation was generally observed in the low stocking rate plots, while under-compensation was found in the high stocking rate plots. For most systems, compensatory growth could be simulated with linear or quadratic models when the percent biomass eaten by sheep was used as an index for estimating the relative stocking rate.

30|$|The {{figures for}} the south west uplands suggest that average farm {{business}} income is projected to fall by 34 % because of the SPS changes, possibly rising to a cut of 64 % for the larger ‘mixed grazing livestock’ farms between 2008 and 2012 (Turner et al. 2008). Under the worst case scenario the cut in income would be 43 % on average and 76 % for the <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing</b> livestock farm (the type of farm most likely to provide grazing on moorland). A recent Defra survey which drew responses from a large and statistically representative sample of over 1, 000 upland farms across England, has provided information on how farmers have been adapting their farm management to current economic and other conditions, since the implementation of full decoupling in 2005 (Defra ACEO 2009).|$|R

40|$|Permanent grasslands {{receiving}} low fertiliser inputs {{account for}} the largest area of land managed under the agri-environment schemes. However, it is likely they currently provide minimal benefits for biodiversity or ecosystem services. In 2008 a multi-factorial experiment was established to develop simple, low cost options to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services for grassland. Factors investigated were seed mixture composition (grass, grass+legume, grass+legume+forb), seed bed preparation (minimal cultivation vs conventional ploughing), and the type (cut vs grazed) and intensity (typical vs summer rested) of management. There were large differences {{in the composition of}} the plant community between different seed mixtures. Deep cultivation significantly increased cover of non-leguminous forbs. Cutting increased cover of legumes and non-legumes compared with grazing. Abundance and diversity of pollinators was lowest in the grass only seed <b>mix.</b> <b>Grazing</b> had a negative effect on pollinators compared with cutting.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} on 8 ha of Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania pastures, with rotational grazing consisting of 7 days of occupation and 21 days of rest. Four treatments were evaluated: cattle grazing alone (BOV), sheep grazing alone (OVI), cattle and sheep grazing simultaneously (SIM) and cattle grazing followed by sheep (alternate - ALT). Twenty heifers and 30 male Santa In&# 234;s lambs were used. Fecal egg count (FEC) and fecal cultures were carried out. Blood was also collected to examine red and white cell series, total plasma protein (TPP), albumin and hemoglobin. FEC and estimated nematode pathogenicity index in sheep were lower in the SIM treatment. The Haemonchus spp. proportion was higher in isolated grazing systems. For sheep, <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing</b> was shown to reduce endoparasite infection, and SIM was better than ALT. For cattle, no difference between grazing systems was seen. Therefore, simultaneous grazing (sheep and cattle) may be a tool for reducing the need for anthelmintic treatments in sheep...|$|R

Each of the 8 -ha grazing pasture was sub-divided into two replications and eight paddocks. Animals were moved to a new paddock twice a week (3. 5 d rotation). The initial stocking rate was based approximately upon 0. 8 ha per cow that would allow five cows per replication.

The results showed that grazing system significantly affected the amount of glomalin, and higher values of total glomalin (TG), total glomalin storage (TGs) and a higher ratio of (TGs) to soil organic carbon storage (TGs/SOCs) were found during the mixed system (MS), however, lower values of easily extractable glomalin (EEG) and soil organic carbon (SOCs) were achieved. In traditional system (TS), higher values of TG, TGs and TGs/SOCs were found in the control (S 0) and light grazing treatments (S 3). The obtained results indicate that light or moderate grazing would favorable to grassland and compared with TS, MS was a preferable grazing system to the maintenance of grassland ecosystem...|$|R

Our observations capture the development of a massive phytoplankton bloom and reveal striking variability in pCO₂ and biological oxygen saturation (ΔO₂/Ar) resulting from large shifts in community metabolism on time scales ranging from hours to weeks. Diel oscillations in surface gases are used to derive a high-resolution time series of net community production (NCP) that is consistent with ¹⁴C-based primary productivity estimates and with the observed seasonal evolution of phytoplankton biomass. A combination of physical <b>mixing,</b> <b>grazing,</b> and light availability appears to drive variability in coastal Antarctic NCP, leading to strong shifts between net autotrophy and heterotrophy on various time scales. Our approach provides insight into the metabolic responses of polar ocean ecosystems to environmental forcing and could be employed to autonomously detect climate-dependent changes in marine primary productivity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The use of {{anthelmintics}} {{is strongly}} limited in organic farming. This may induce {{a change in}} the intensity (no of worms) and diversity (proportions of species) of helminth infection. Helminths remain a major preoccupation in organic sheep farming: high levels of infection have been recorded on several farms and helminth diversity is always higher. The helminth infection in milk cattle of northern Europe is controlled and diversity is higher in organic farms, as recorded in sheep. The role of helminth diversity on intensity is still unclear. Grazing management is one of the means to control-ling helminths. The use of safe pastures for calves and sheep after weaning {{is one of the major}} compo-nents of control. The use of alternate or <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing</b> is common for cattle in northern countries but is uncommon for sheep in France. Grazing management is not sufficient to controlling infection in sheep and conventional anthelmintic treatments are performed. Additionally, alternative treatments are used. The alternative therapies based on phytotherapy or homeopathy are largely recommended in organic farming but do not have any demonstrated efficacy. More research is needed to evaluate such therapies...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} of sampling the leafhopper assemblages on a field experiment designed to examine the differential effects of rabbits and livestock (mainly sheep) on the vegetation of chalk heath in southern England. Experimental plots that excluded livestock either allowed entry by rabbits or excluded them. Results were compared with those from plots grazed by both livestock and rabbits. After 7 years, exclusion of grazing herbivores had resulted in predictable increases in vegetation height, but no major changes were detected in the species composition of the vegetation. As expected, ungrazed plots had higher species richness and greater abundances of several individual leafhopper species. However, plots grazed only by rabbits had a leafhopper assemblage that was distinct from either ungrazed or <b>mixed</b> <b>grazing</b> plots. It is suggested that rabbit grazing may have subtle effects on grassland invertebrate assemblages that are not necessarily predictable from {{an examination of the}} species composition of the vegetation. Chalk heath vegetation contains an unusual mixture of calcicole and calcifuge plant species, but the leafhopper assemblage included a restricted number of calcareous grassland specialist species and only one species strongly associated with acidic grasslands; most leafhoppers recorded were generalist grassland species...|$|R
