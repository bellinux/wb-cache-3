40|$|Users often wish to {{participate}} in online groups anonymously, but misbehaving users may abuse this anonymity to disrupt the group’s communication. Existing messaging protocols such as DC-nets leave groups vulnerable to denial-of-service and Sybil attacks, Mixnets are difficult to protect against traffic analysis, and accountable voting protocols are unsuited to general anonymous messaging. We present the first general messaging protocol that offers provable anonymity with accountability for moderate-size groups, and efficiently handles unbalanced loads where few members wish to transmit in a given round. The N group members first cooperatively shuffle an N × N matrix of pseudorandom seeds, then use these seeds in N “pre-planned” DC-nets protocol runs. Each DC-nets run transmits the variable-length bulk data comprising one member’s message, using the minimum number of bits required for anonymity under our attack model. The protocol preserves message integrity and one-to-one correspondence between members and messages, makes denial-of-service attacks by members traceable to the culprit, and efficiently handles large, unbalanced message loads. A working prototype demonstrates the protocol’s practicality for anonymous <b>messaging</b> <b>in</b> <b>groups</b> of 40 + members...|$|E

Key transfer protocols fully rely on trusted Key Generation Center (KGC) to compute group key and to transport the group keys to all communication parties in a secured and secret manner. In this paper, an efficient key generation and key transfer protocol has been proposed where KGC can broadcast group key information to all <b>group</b> members <b>in</b> a secure way. Hence, only authorized group members will be able to retrieve the secret key and unauthorized members cannot retrieve the secret key. Hence, inorder to maintain the forward and backward secrecy, the group keys are updated whenever a new member joins or leaves the communication group. The proposed algorithm is more efficient and relies on NP class. In addition, the keys are distributed to the <b>group</b> users <b>in</b> a safe and secure way.

Further, we expect that nationals of those countries living overseas will use these newsgroups to more openly discuss politics in those nations than they could otherwise do so. Before turning to our content analysis of the <b>messages</b> posted <b>in</b> non-United States USENET groups, we first quantify both the number of these groups {{and the level of}} political discussion in them.

After all, if the Internet is to become the vaunted “global village ” and source of “grassroots democracy ” that many pundits have imagined, one would expect and desire to find evidence of its positive political impact outside the United States.

40|$|Abstract. Group {{encryption}} (GE) schemes, {{introduced at}} Asiacrypt’ 07, are an encryption analogue of group signatures {{with a number}} of interesting applications. They allow a sender to encrypt a <b>message</b> (<b>in</b> the CCA 2 security sense) for some member of a PKI group concealing that member’s identity (in a CCA 2 security sense, as well); the sender is able to convince a verifier that, among other things, the ciphertext is valid and some anonymous certified group member will be able to decrypt the <b>message.</b> As <b>in</b> <b>group</b> signatures, an opening authority has the power of pinning down the receiver’s identity. The initial GE construction uses interactive proofs as part of the design (which can be made non-interactive using the random oracle model) and the design of a fully non-interactive group encryption system is still an open problem. In this paper, we give the first GE scheme, which is a pure encryption scheme in the standard model, i. e., a scheme where the ciphertext is a single message and proofs are noninteractive (and do not employ the random oracle heuristic). As a building block, we use a new public key certification scheme which incurs the smallest amount of interaction, as well...|$|R

This leader-participant model enhances the performance because every participant including the leader could execute the decoding algorithm (as a part of signing process) upon receiving the shared parameters from the leader. The time complexity of our scheme is close to Courtois et al. ’s (2001) scheme. The latter is often used as a basis to construct other types of code-based signature schemes.

The feature of group is if a group member propagates a <b>message</b> <b>in</b> a <b>group,</b> the other members <b>in</b> the same <b>group</b> {{will have a chance}} to receive this message.
