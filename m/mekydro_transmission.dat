50|$|The builder, Beyer Peacock (Hymek) Ltd, was a {{joint venture}} between Bristol Siddeley Engines (BSE) (licensed to build Maybach engines), Stone-Platt Industries (licensed to build <b>Mekydro</b> <b>transmissions),</b> and the {{locomotive}} manufacturer Beyer, Peacock and Company. At the time they were built, the Hymeks were the most powerful diesel-hydraulic locomotives operating with a single engine - the Maybach MD870. Unlike the higher-powered diesel-hydraulic Warship and Western locomotives in the Western Region fleet (with dual Maybach MD655 engines), the Hymeks were not based on an existing West German design.|$|R
5000|$|With the Hymeks and Warships {{already in}} service but proving underpowered for top-link services, BR Western Region needed a high-powered {{locomotive}} for these trains - the Western therefore needed two diesel engines {{to achieve the}} required power output. In keeping with their policy, a new locomotive with a hydraulic transmission was envisaged. Experience had shown that the Maybach engines in the Hymeks were superior to the earlier Maybach and MAN engines used in the Warships, particularly in power output. Also Maybach were able to offer their 12 MD engines rated at [...] allied to a Voith transmission; a <b>Mekydro</b> <b>transmission</b> designed to handle such power could not be fitted into the British loading gauge.|$|E

50|$|The Córas Iompair Éireann 401 Class {{locomotives}} {{were built}} in 1957-1958 and designed for use on branch line traffic and shunting. They were fitted with a Maybach MD220 engine of , with diesel hydraulic <b>transmission</b> via a <b>Mekydro</b> KL64 <b>transmission,</b> and were of C wheel arrangement.|$|R

They were of C wheel arrangement.|$|R
25|$|In Germany and Finland, diesel–hydraulic {{systems have}} {{achieved}} high reliability in operation. In the UK the diesel–hydraulic principle gained a poor reputation {{due to the}} poor durability and reliability of the Maybach <b>Mekydro</b> hydraulic <b>transmission.</b> Argument continues over the relative reliability of hydraulic systems, with questions over whether data has been manipulated to favour local suppliers over non-German ones.|$|R
50|$|In {{tests on}} the Black forest railway in October 1957 {{it was found that}} the maximum speed of the {{locomotives}} was not sufficient; this prompted Krauss-Maffei to set about the rebuilding of the locomotive. The rebuilding took place from October 1957 to May 1958, afterwards the locomotive received the designation ML 3000 CC. Specifically more powerful engines were installed of the type MD 12 V 538 TB 10 Maybach MD655 producing 1500 hp each. Because of the increase power output, a new transmission was also required, this was the Maybach <b>Mekydro</b> K184U <b>transmission.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The NBL-built D800s {{differed}} mechanically {{from the}} Swindon-built batch: the Swindon locomotives used Maybach engines connected to <b>Mekydro</b> hydraulic <b>transmissions</b> whereas the NBL-built examples used MAN engines and Voith transmissions. NBL had entered into an {{arrangement with the}} German company MAN AG in the early 1950s to market MAN's engine designs in the UK: NBL were anxious to enter the diesel locomotive market, especially once {{it became apparent that}} British Railways would be seeking large quantities of such locomotives when the [...] "Modernisation Plan" [...] was announced. MAN were equally keen to obtain a slice of the UK market for themselves. The first results of this collaboration were the D600-D604 locomotives which failed {{to take advantage of the}} weight-saving potential of light alloy stressed-skin construction allied to hydraulic transmissions.|$|R
5000|$|No further {{examples}} of this design were ordered but NBL then received an order for 33 locomotives to a more advanced design, the D800 design drawn up by Swindon Works in turn derived from the original German Krauss-Maffei V200 design. The prime mechanical components of these were two MAN L12V18/21B diesel engines, each rated at [...] at 1530 rpm and coupled to a Voith LT306r hydraulic transmission; each engine/transmission combination drove one bogie. Unlike the <b>Mekydro</b> four-speed <b>transmissions</b> in the Swindon-built locomotives, the Voith was only a three-speed design but was chosen because it kept compatibility with D600-4 and because NBL already had a licence to manufacture it. Whereas the Swindon-built locomotives had all their engines and transmissions supplied by the German manufacturers (albeit with ten engines and three transmissions supplied as kits of parts for the British licensee to re-assemble) the engines and transmissions required for D833-65 were all built by NBL.|$|R
50|$|The V 200 had two fast-running (1500 RPM) V12 diesel engines. The {{transmission}} was hydraulic, each engine drove one bogie set via {{a hydraulic}} torque converter. The maximum speed was 140 km/h. The prototypes had a maximum power of 1,471 kW, the V 200.0 had {{a power of}} 1,618 kW. Unlike some other diesel-hydraulic locomotives the V 200 was renowned for its high reliability. Maybach (type MD650), Mercedes-Benz (type MB820Bb) and MAN (type L 12 V 18/21) engines were used. The hydraulic transmissions fitted to the locomotives were supplied by Maybach (type Mekydro K104U) and Voith (type LT306r/rb). Although differing in several ways - for example the <b>Mekydro</b> K104 <b>transmission</b> had a single torque converter and four mechanicanical gear stages while the Voith L306 had three different-sized torque converters - the engines and transmissions were designed so that the various types were completely interchangeable, not just amongst V 200.0 but with other locomotive types (V80/V100) and diesel multiple units (VT11, VT08 & VT12) that DB ordered {{around the same time}} as the V 200.0. It was not uncommon to find a single locomotive with one Mercedes engine and one Maybach unit running together. The MAN engines were only fitted to five locomotives in 1959 as an experiment and these locomotives eventually had their engines replaced with the more common Maybach or Mercedes engines.|$|R
