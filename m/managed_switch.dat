Likewise [...] "web-managed" [...] switches are switches which fall into a market niche between unmanaged and managed.

50|$|LAN {{switching}} {{is a form}} of {{packet switching}} used in local area networks (LAN). Switching technologies are crucial to network design, as they allow traffic to be sent only where it is needed in most cases, using fast, hardware-based methods. LAN switching uses different kinds of network switches. A standard switch is known as a layer 2 switch and is commonly found in nearly any LAN. Layer 3 or layer 4 switches require advanced technology (see <b>managed</b> <b>switch)</b> and are more expensive, and thus are usually only found in larger LANs or in special network environments.|$|E

50|$|The {{network switch}} plays an {{integral}} role in most modern Ethernet local area networks (LANs). Mid-to-large sized LANs contain {{a number of}} linked <b>managed</b> <b>switches.</b> Small office/home office (SOHO) applications typically use a single switch, or an all-purpose converged device such as a residential gateway to access small office/home broadband services such as DSL or cable Internet.

User devices may also include a telephone interface for Voice over IP (VoIP) protocol.|$|R

Compared with smart switches, enterprise switches have more features that can be customized or optimized, and are generally more expensive than smart switches. Enterprise switches are typically found in networks with larger number of switches and connections, where centralized management is a significant savings in administrative time and effort. A stackable switch is a version of enterprise-managed switch.|$|R
