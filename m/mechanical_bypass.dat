This permits, for example, a door to be opened quickly without added resistance, but then to close slowly using the dashpot. For hydraulic dashpots this unrestricted motion is accomplished using a one-way check-valve that allows fluid to bypass the dashpot fluid constriction. Non-hydraulic dashpots may use a ratcheting gear to permit free motion in one direction.|$|E

5000|$|Lock {{manipulation}} is {{the famous}} safe cracking technique we've all seen in movies. It's a damage free combination recovery method, and a well known surreptitious bypass technique. Manipulation only requires fingers, eyes, and proper technique but it's a skill that takes years to develop and decades to master.

Similar damage free bypass can also be completed by a computerized auto-dialer. These auto-dialer machines are known to take 24 hours or more to reach the correct combination. In recent years faster devices have been engineered for lock bypass. These new devices use more advanced robotics and more advanced software. When used in cooperation with each other the two technologies closely mimic manual manipulation.

Compared with growth in forest topsoil, root lengths averaged over sand and gravelly sand media were 27 percent less, depth of penetration was 65 percent less, and primary seminal root diameter was 36 percent greater. Further, primary seminal roots were significantly shorter and shallower, and penetrometer resistance was greater with the higher proportions of gravel, the smaller sizes of gravel and sand, and the lower soil water tension. Penetration resistance increased nearly sixfold as the volumetric percentage of gravel increased from 0 to 45, with a corresponding reduction in depth of root penetration below the seed of 30 percent.

40|$|Abstract. Myocardial {{infarction}} is {{the leading}} cause of congestive heart failure and death in the industrialized world. Stem cell transplantation to failing myocardium appears to improve heart function following myocardial infarction, but further refinement of the delivery methodology is required. The HeartLander miniature mobile robot has the ability to adhere to the epicardium, travel to the operative site, and perform intramyocardial injections under direct control of the surgeon. This paradigm obviates sternotomy, cardiopulmonary <b>bypass,</b> <b>mechanical</b> stabilization and lung deflation, while granting improved access. To facilitate movement under the pericardium, a small prototype with a tapered front has been constructed that is 11 mm tall and fits through a 15 -mm cannula. This prototype was tested in beating-heart porcine trials via median sternotomy, but with the pericardium intact (N = 2). The HeartLander was able to maintain prehension and travel without being displaced by the overhead motion of the pericardium. Myocardial injections of tissue dye were performed successfully at several locations. These experiments show the feasibility of navigating under the pericardium and performing needle injections into the myocardium using video feedback. Future research will move toward minimally invasive testing without sternotomy, including bot...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{intracranial}} atherosclerosis {{has become}} a major cause of ischemic stroke, appearing more frequently in Koreans than Caucasians. Symptomatic or asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis is a disease that could recur readily even during the treatment with anti-platelet agents. When the symptoms develop, ischemic stroke can not be recovered readily. Therefore, aggressive treatments such as endovascular therapy and bypass surgery are required in addition to medical treatment for the intracranial artery stenosis. Recent intracranial stenting and drug eluting stenting have shown as very advanced effective therapeutic modalities. Nevertheless, until now, a randomized controlled study has not been conducted. Regarding bypass surgery, since the failed EC-IC bypass surgery study performed 20 years ago, extensive studies on its efficacy has not been conducted yet, and thus it has to be performed strictly only in hemodynamically compromised patients. Unless breakthrough drugs that suppress the progression of intracranial atherosclerosis and the formation of thrombi, and facilitate the regression of the arterial stenosis, the treatment concept of the recovery of the blood flow of stenotic arterial territory by <b>mechanical</b> recanalization or <b>bypass</b> surgery would be remained for the prevention as well as treatment of ischemic stroke caused by intracranial atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Long lasting {{mechanical}} vibrations {{applied to}} the skin induce a reversible decrease {{in the perception of}} vibration at the stimulated skin site. This phenomenon of vibrotactile adaptation has been studied extensively. Yet, there is still no clear consensus on the mechanisms leading to vibrotactile adaptation. In particular, the respective contribution of (i) changes affecting mechanical skin impedance, (ii) peripheral processes, and (iii) central processes is largely unknown. Here, we used direct electrical stimulation of nerve fibers to <b>bypass</b> <b>mechanical</b> transduction processes and, thereby, explore the possible contribution of central vs. peripheral processes to vibrotactile adaptation. Three experiments were conducted. In the first, adaptation was induced using mechanical vibration of the fingertip (51 or 251 Hz vibration delivered for 8 minutes, at 40 x the detection threshold). In the second, we attempted to induce adaptation using transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the median nerve (51 or 251 Hz constant-current pulses delivered for 8 minutes, at 1. 5 x the detection threshold). Vibrotactile detection thresholds were measured before and after adaptation. Mechanical stimulation induced a clear increase of vibrotactile detection thresholds. In contrast, thresholds were unaffected by electrical stimulation. In the third experiment, we assessed the effect of mechanical adaptation on the detection thresholds to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimuli, measured before and after adaptation. Electrical detection thresholds were unaffected by the mechanical adaptation. Taken together, our results suggest that vibrotactile adaptation is predominantly the consequence of peripheral mechanoreceptor processes and/or changes in biomechanical properties of the skin...|$|R

Dabigatran etexilate, a new oral direct thrombin inhibitor, is safe and effective in reducing risk of stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation. No data exist {{in the setting of}} mechanical heart valves. We tested the hypothesis that dabigatran etexilate is as effective as heparin for thromboprophylaxis of mechanical valves in a porcine heterotopic aortic valve model. MethodsThirty swine underwent implantation of modified bileaflet <b>mechanical</b> valved conduit <b>bypassing</b> the ligated, native descending thoracic aorta. Animals randomly received no anticoagulation (n =  10), enoxaparin 2  mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily (n =  10), or dabigatran etexilate 20 mg/kg orally twice daily. Primary end point was amount of valve thrombus at 30 days. Secondary end points included quantitative measurement of platelet deposition on valve prosthesis, thromboelastography, and hemorrhagic and embolic events. ResultsAt 30 days, we observed 638 ± 895 mg thrombus in no anticoagulation group, 121 ± 128 mg in enoxaparin group, and 19 ± 31 mg in dabigatran etexilate group (P =. 01 enoxaparin vs dabigatran etexilate). Fewer platelets were deposited on valves in dabigatran etexilate group (2. 7  ×  108) than in enoxaparin group (1. 8  ×  109, P = . 03). No major or occult hemorrhagic or embolic events were observed. By thromboelastographic analysis, dabigatran etexilate produced less prolongation of K value (P = . 01) and less decreases in angle (P = . 01) and maximum amplitude (P = . 001) than enoxaparin. ConclusionsDabigatran etexilate is as effective as enoxaparin for short-term thromboprophylaxis of mechanical valves. It prevents valve thrombus and platelet deposition at 30 days without increased adverse events. These promising results serve as a foundation for prospective clinical trials with dabigatran etexilate as an alternative to warfarin {{in patients with}} bileaflet mechanical aortic valves...|$|R

MethodsAdult swine underwent heterotopic implantation of a modified bileaflet <b>mechanical</b> valved conduit <b>bypassing</b> the ligated, native descending thoracic aorta. Animals were randomized to no anticoagulation (n = 7), 175 U/kg dalteparin administered subcutaneously twice daily (n = 9), 325 mg of aspirin (n = 6), 75 mg of clopidogrel (n = 6), or 325 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily (n = 6) and survived for 30 days. Additionally, 11 animals were randomized to no anticoagulation (n = 5) or 325 mg of oral aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily (n = 6) and survived for 150 days. ResultsAt 30 days, we observed 216 ± 270 mg of thrombus for the no anticoagulation group, 53 ± 91 mg for the dalteparin group, 33 ± 23 mg for the aspirin group, 25 ± 10 mg for the clopidogrel group, and 17 ± 9 mg for the combined aspirin and clopidogrel group, respectively (P <. 01 for clopidogrel and aspirin vs no anticoagulation). At 150 days, we observed 223 ± 200 mg of thrombus for the no anticoagulation group and 4 ± 4 mg for the aspirin and clopidogrel group (P =. 02). Mean platelet deposition on the valve was 4. 1 × 109 ± 3. 6 × 109 for the no anticoagulation and 6. 81 × 107 ± 1. 4 × 108 for the combined aspirin and clopidogrel groups, respectively (P =. 03). No major hemorrhagic events were observed.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Atrial {{fibrillation}} after cardiac {{operations is}} a source of morbidity and resource consumption. Various factors common to cardiac operations have been cited as causal. Comparison of the incidences of atrial fibrillation after conventional cardiac operations and minimally invasive cardiac operations may provide some insight into the mechanisms of this complication. Methods: All patients undergoing minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting from January 26, 1996, through September 17, 1997, were evaluated for the occurrence of in-hospital postoperative atrial fibrillation. Data from these 55 patients were compared with data from a control cohort of patients undergoing conventional, solitary coronary artery bypass grafting. Each patient undergoing minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting was matched by age (± 3 years) and date of operation (± 7 days) with a patient undergoing conventional coronary artery bypass grafting. Results: During the period since the advent of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting at our institution, the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation has been slightly lower among the patients undergoing this form of coronary artery bypass grafting (26 %) than among the total population of patients undergoing conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (34 %). Comparison of the age-matched groups, however, showed the incidence to be slightly but not significantly greater in the minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting cohort (13 / 55, 24 %) than in the conventional coronary artery bypass grafting cohort (11 / 55, 20 %; P =. 6). The minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting group was less likely to be discharged with antiarrhythmic therapy than was the conventional coronary artery bypass grafting group (6 versus 10; P =. 006). Conclusions: According to these data, mechanisms traditionally implicated in atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting, {{such as the use of}} cardiopulmonary <b>bypass,</b> <b>mechanical</b> manipulation of the atrium, and atrial ischemia, are not causal but may be related to the duration of the arrhythmic complication. Strategies directed toward management and reduction of the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation should be focused accordingly. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 117 : 298 - 301...|$|R
30|$|In {{accordance}} with earlier studies (Liu et al. 2004), {{we found that}} the time to extubation was significantly shorter in patients with TEA (Table  3). Early extubation in conjunction with effective analgesia and rapid mobilization constitutes a cornerstone of fast-tracking concept in anesthesia (Nanavati and Prabhakar 2014) and forms a necessary basis especially for prevention of postoperative respiratory complications. Postoperative pulmonary dysfunction (PPD) is common and significant after cardiac surgery, as it contributes to increased morbidity, mortality and prolongs hospitalization stay (Wynne and Botti 2004). Its clinical manifestations include pleural effusion, atelectasis, postoperative hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pathophysiology of PPD is complex and its mechanisms are not fully understood. However, the most significant factors include surgery related factors, effect of general anesthesia with <b>mechanical</b> ventilation, cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (Badenes et al. 2015). Additionally, postoperative pain and impairment of diaphragmatic function are also important determinants of such pulmonary dysfunction (Diehl et al. 1994). Nevertheless, in our study, better analgesia and shorter ventilation times in the TEA group did not result in reduced incidence of these respiratory complications, as they were equally frequent in both study groups (Table  3). That is in contrast to the latest meta-analysis that showed a lower risk of respiratory events for patients receiving TEA during surgery compared with those receiving GA alone (Svircevic et al. 2013). However, in a recent study, it was demonstrated that an early extubation (within 9  h after cardiac surgery) is associated with an improved outcome and was shown to be the best predictor of uncomplicated recovery (Camp et al. 2009). Even though our data show that time to extubation was shorter in the TEA group, this reduction was only of a mild degree (6.0  h in TEA group vs. 6.9  h in GA group). Thus, both study groups generally fulfilled early extubation criteria, as identified by the above mentioned study, possibly having a favorable impact on postoperative outcome in both groups. Similarly, pain relief was significantly better in the TEA group during the first postoperative day, however pain scores in both groups were generally low (average NRS at 24  h of 1.4  ±  1.5 in GA group vs. 1  ±  1.1 in TEA group, P <  0.05), representing also a mild degree of postoperative pain. These results show that morphine analgesia in the GA group provided sufficient pain relief and also enabled early extubation, resulting in similar incidence of PPD as in the TEA group.|$|R
