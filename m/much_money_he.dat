Konoe's father, Atsumaro, had been {{politically}} active, having organized the Anti-Russia Society in 1903. In 1904, Atsumaro's death left Konoe, {{at the age of}} 12, with the title of Prince, plenty of social standing but not <b>much</b> <b>money.</b> <b>He</b> studied Marxian economics at Kyoto Imperial University. In 1916, he automatically became a member of House of Peers according to his hereditary title.|$|E

[...] Polls swung in Bush's favor; by not accepting federal matching funds for his campaign, Bush was not limited in how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> could spend on advertisements, while McCain was near his limit. [...] With three days to go, McCain shut down his negative ads against Bush and tried to stress a positive image. [...] But McCain's unconstitutional campaign finance law, line item veto, suing HMO and McCain opposed tax cuts, did not appeal to core Republicans in the state.|$|E

Johnson confirmed that he would star in the new Jumanji movie via his Instagram page. In an interview, Johnson also discussed the possibility of an earlier release date than was originally announced for the DC Extended Universe film, Shazam. [...] Seven Bucks Production is named because that's how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> had in his wallet after he was cut from the CFL.

500|$|Conacher became {{embroiled in}} a bitter {{contract}} dispute with Detroit manager Jack Adams following the season. Adams offered $7,600 for the season, but Conacher refused to sign for less than $8,500. Refusing to bow to his demands, Adams traded Conacher to the New York Rangers on October 22, 1947, in exchange for Edward Slowinski and a player to be named later. Conacher, however, refused {{to report to the}} Rangers. He announced instead that he planned to retire from hockey, a decision he claimed to have been mulling over for a couple years. The trade to New York was nullified as a result of Conacher's failure to report. Bill Tobin of the Chicago Black Hawks received permission from Detroit to speak with Conacher and successfully negotiated a deal with the player. [...] Tobin claimed the negotiation was easy: [...] "It wasn't hard to sign Roy. I offered him so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> couldn't refuse." [...] Tobin did not reveal what he was paying Conacher, but admitted that he spent $25,000 combined on the contract and to purchase him from Detroit.|$|E
500|$|There {{were also}} a few {{positive}} reviews. One such review came from Fraser McAlpine of BBC, who opened, [...] "It's {{one of the fundamental}} laws of pop, anything which tips a nod to 'You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)' by Dead Or Alive is going to be worth a listen." [...] He continued, [...] "Even though this is just a song written {{from the perspective of a}} randy man watching a pole-dancer and bragging about how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> has [...] in a manner which would make Akon blush, there's just something kind of cute about the whole thing." [...] McAlpine attributed this to the song's [...] "Tigger-beat", explaining, [...] "How can anything too sordid be going on when everyone is bouncing around like they're on spacehoppers?" [...] Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "You will hear echoes of another pop classic, but the new song stands on its own feet." [...] However, he noted that while pop music fans would appreciate it, hip hop listeners would likely dismiss it, and he added that [...] "t's not groundbreaking by any means".|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} one of the first to use {{practical}} locations during shooting. According to Clarke, [...] "When we needed a scene in a bar, we went to Santa Monica and asked a guy how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> would charge to let us come in and shoot scenes in his bar". Because Clarke also acted in the film, editor and co-writer Tom Boutross served as co-director. Boutross later [...] The main character's home in the film was located on Lafayette Boulevard in Los Angeles, which is no longer standing. The four-story rooming house was rented for 5–6 weekend days for $25 per day. The exterior shots of the character's house were shot in a different location around Glendale Hill. A scene in the film where a transformed McKenna graphically crushes a rat with his bare hands was not in the script, and was improvised while on location. The effect was accomplished by placing ketchup on the rat; Clarke would then gently squeeze the rat, making the ketchup ooze from his fingers. This scene was removed from prints that were released on television, but was later restored.|$|E
500|$|A {{civil lawsuit}} was filed by Jordan Chandler {{and his parents}} on September 14, 1993. In late 1993, {{district}} attorneys in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties both convened grand juries to assess whether criminal charges should be filed against Jackson. By January 1, 1994, $2 million had been spent by prosecution departments in California and the grand juries had questioned 200 witnesses, but Jordan's allegations could not be corroborated. On January 4, 1994, Chandler's attorney, Larry Feldman, filed a motion for the photos from Jackson's December 1993 body search from investigators, saying Jackson's attorneys and the L.A. district attorney had refused to give him copies. A few weeks later, Feldman petitioned the court {{that he should be}} allowed access to Jackson's finances over concerns that the singer's wealth would give him an unfair advantage in court. One adviser to Jackson stated, [...] "You can take pictures of Michael's dick and he's not gonna like it, but once you start {{trying to figure out how}} <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> has, that's where he stops playing around." [...] Initially Jackson and his lawyers filed a motion for Superior Court Judge David M. Rothman to postpone the civil case until the criminal investigation was concluded. Feldman filed a counter-motion, saying the delay would hurt Jordan's chances for recovery and make it more difficult to gather evidence. It is legal to postpone a civil lawsuit past the criminal statute of limitations as a lawsuit can still be filed past that date, such as the case of Pacers, Inc. v. Superior Court. Also, the constitutional right to a [...] "speedy trial" [...] only applies to criminal cases according to the Sixth Amendment, not civil cases.|$|E

Bird said about his character, [...] "He doesn't really have love and yet he doesn't really have limitations, either. So he’s searching for both of those things.

2500|$|Before {{the use of}} paper, the Chinese used coins {{that were}} circular, with a {{rectangular}} hole in the middle. Several coins could be strung together on a rope. Merchants in China, if they became rich enough, found that their strings of coins were too heavy to carry around easily. To solve this problem, coins were often left with a trustworthy person, and the merchant was given {{a slip of paper}} recording how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> had with that person. If he showed the paper to that person he could regain his money. Eventually, the Song Dynasty paper money called [...] "jiaozi" [...] originated from these promissory notes.|$|E

He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: [...] "You can't buy that kind of empowerment. To just know that as far as you are aware, you have not got a price; that there is not an amount of money large enough to make you compromise even a tiny bit of principle that, as it turned out, would make no practical difference anyway. I'd advise everyone to do it, otherwise you're going to end up mastered by money and that's not a thing you want ruling your life." ...|$|E

Reviewing how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> was spending on customizing Ferraris, Carmack realized he could do significant work in rocketry and aerospace. He began by giving financial support to a few local amateur groups before starting Armadillo Aerospace. Carmack funded the company {{out of his own}} pocket, for “something north of a million dollars a year.” Carmack taught himself aerospace engineering and was the lead engineer of the company. The company made steady progress toward their goals of suborbital space flight and eventual orbital vehicles. In October 2008, Armadillo Aerospace competed in a NASA contest known as the Lunar Lander Challenge, winning first place in the Level 1 competition along with $350,000.

2500|$|Enfield {{first came}} to wide public {{attention}} when appearing on Channel 4's Saturday Live as several different characters created with Paul Whitehouse. These quickly entered the national consciousness. Among these characters were Stavros, a Greek kebab shop owner with fractured English; and Loadsamoney, an obnoxious, Cockney plasterer who constantly boasted about how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> earned. The Loadsamoney character was created {{in reaction to the}} policies of the Thatcher government of the day, and took {{on a life of its}} own, sampling the songs [...] "Money, Money" [...] from the musical Cabaret and Money, Money, Money by ABBA to spawn a hit single in 1988 and a sell-out live tour. In May 1988, Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock used the term loadsamoney to criticise the policies of the Conservative government and journalists began to refer to the [...] "loadsamoney mentality" [...] and the [...] "loadsamoney economy".|$|E

Although he didn't play in organized baseball until he reached the 11th grade, he learned much about the sport from listening to Cardinals radio broadcaster Harry Caray describe the way major league hitters stood at the plate. After attending high school in Mer Rouge, Louisiana, he received academic assistance to attend Southern University in Baton Rouge, but when a low grade in his first semester meant the possibility of losing his scholarship, he decided to try out for the school's baseball team in order to secure an athletic scholarship.|$|E
2500|$|Constantia {{was born}} to an impoverished rural family in County Kilkenny.

But soon her parents found that her abilities were far beyond her years. Constantia was tutored in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, English, and French by her local vicar, but was mostly self-educated. According to one editor she was [...] "a most excellent scholar, not only in Greek and Roman literature, but in history, divinity, philosophy, and mathematics: and what makes her character the more remarkable is, that she died so early as the age of 27, and that she acquired this great learning merely by the force of her own genius, and continual application."

Some liberal supporters of Al Gore argued that the media had a bias against Gore and in favor of Bush. Peter Hart and Jim Naureckas, two commentators for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), called the media [...] "serial exaggerators" [...] and alleged that several media outlets were constantly exaggerating criticism of Gore: they alleged that the media falsely claimed Gore lied when he claimed he spoke in an overcrowded science class in Sarasota, Florida, and also alleged the media gave Bush a pass on certain issues, such as Bush allegedly exaggerating how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>he</b> signed into the annual Texas state budget to help the uninsured during his second debate with Gore in October 2000. In the April 2000 issue of Washington Monthly, columnist Robert Parry also alleged that media outlets exaggerated Gore's supposed claim that he [...] "discovered" [...] the Love Canal neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York during a campaign speech in Concord, New Hampshire on November 30, 1999, when he had only claimed he [...] "found" [...] it after it was already evacuated in 1978 because of chemical contamination. Rolling Stone columnist Eric Boehlert also alleged media outlets exaggerated criticism of Gore as early as July 22, 1999, when Gore, known for being an environmentalist, had a friend release 500 million gallons of water into a drought stricken river to help keep his boat afloat for a photo shoot; Boehlert claimed that media outlets exaggerated the actual number of gallons that were released, as they claimed it was 4 billion.|$|E
