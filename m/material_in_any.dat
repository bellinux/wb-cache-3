25|$|The {{filming of}} each episode {{normally}} took ten working days, shooting {{about five minutes}} of edited screen time per day. Due to this, the number of different filming locations had to be restricted to 10, i.e. one location per day. At the Euston Films production office in Colet Court, there was a standing set of the Flying Squad offices, which provided an alternative option should the weather restrict a day's filming. Two days would normally be spent filming on the set, equalling 10 minutes of any episode being set in the offices. Shooting took place through the Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter months so, exterior night shooting was expensive and was limited to three minutes of external night <b>material</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> episode.|$|E

Also, section 9A of the Interpretation Act requires a purposive interpretation of written law, including the Constitution, to [...] "promote the purpose or object underlying the written law".

500|$|Section 9A(3)(d) {{allows the}} court to {{consider}} [...] "any relevant <b>material</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> official record of debates in Parliament". Under this provision, material relating to the original Act may be looked at in interpreting an amendment. However, {{it would not be}} wise to set a precedent for the unregulated use of original material in construing a subsequent amendment. After all, it is not a rule that Parliament must legislate consistently with past legislation. On the contrary, subsequent legislation must, where inconsistent with its predecessor, prevail over it. The objective of the court is not to construe all legislation as if Parliament was in some way bound by its intentions when it first passed the Act. It is to construe why Parliament has seen fit to amend that Act {{in the light of the}} inadequacies that the passage of time has revealed or new needs carried by the tide of progress.|$|E

After the Dean had left, the young man with a trembled voice started to lecture a course on the dynamics of material points, instead of a course on dynamical systems.

2500|$|While {{the bulk}} of <b>material</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> star is {{hydrogen}} and helium, {{there is a significant}} variation in the amount of heavier elements (metals). A high proportion of metals in a star correlates to the amount of heavy material initially available in the protoplanetary disk. A smaller amount of metal makes the formation of planets much less likely, under the solar nebula theory of planetary system formation. Any planets that did form around a metal-poor star would probably be low in mass, and thus unfavorable for life. Spectroscopic studies of systems where exoplanets have been found to date confirm the relationship between high metal content and planet formation: [...] "Stars with planets, or at least with planets similar to the ones we are finding today, are clearly more metal rich than stars without planetary companions." [...] This relationship between high metallicity and planet formation also means that habitable systems {{are more likely to be}} found around stars of younger generations, since stars that formed early in the universe's history have low metal content.|$|E
2500|$|When {{it comes}} to {{interpreting}} statutes, judges are expected {{to abide by the}} rules set out by the Legislature. On 26 February 1993, the Interpretation (Amendment) Act 1993 was passed to reform the law relating to statutory interpretation. The amending Act inserted section 9A into the Interpretation Act, which mandates that judges take a purposive approach to interpreting written law by requiring that an interpretation that promotes the purpose or object underlying the law be preferred to one that does not promote the purpose or object. In determining the meaning of a provision of written law, the court may consider extrinsic materials, that is, materials not forming part of the written law. Such materials include the speech made in Parliament by a minister during the Second Reading of a bill containing the provision, and other relevant <b>material</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> official record of Parliamentary debates. Through section 9A, Parliament requires judges to determine the meaning of written law by understanding the Parliamentary intention underlying the law and its purpose. Therefore, judges' freedom when {{it comes to}} statutory interpretation is somewhat restricted. However, it may be said that this deference to Parliament is [...] quintessential to uphold the certainty of law and to avoid defeating the Parliament's intention in enacting statutes.|$|E
