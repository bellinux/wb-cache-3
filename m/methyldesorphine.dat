50|$|Heroin is one {{of several}} semi-synthetic opioids derived from the morphine. Although {{sometimes}} not considered opiates, as they are not directly derived from natural opium, they are commonly referred to as opiates. Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is a morphine prodrug; it is metabolized by the liver into morphine after administration. One of the major metabolites of heroin, 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), is also a morphine prodrug. Nicomorphine (morphine dinicotinate), dipropanoylmorphine (morphine dipropionate), desomorphine (di-hydro-desoxy-morphine), <b>methyldesorphine,</b> acetylpropionylmorphine, dibenzoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and several others are also derived from morphine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Methyldesorphine</b> is an opioid analgesic. First {{synthesized}} in Germany in 1940 and patented in the USA in 1952, {{it has a}} {{high potential}} for abuse as with any potent opioid agonist, and is sometimes found along with desomorphine {{as a component of}} the home-made opioid mixture known as [...] "Krokodil" [...] used in Russia and the neighboring former Soviet republics. It is approximately 15 times more potent than morphine as an analgesic but if the 6-7 bond is saturated, the Î² isomer is some 50 times more potent than morphine.|$|E
