50|$|Looking {{through a}} mirror from {{different}} positions (but necessarily {{with the point}} of observation restricted to the halfspace {{on one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>mirror)</b> is like looking at <b>the</b> 3D <b>mirror</b> image of space; without further <b>mirrors</b> only <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image of <b>the</b> halfspace before <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is relevant; if there is another <b>mirror,</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image of <b>the</b> other halfspace is too.|$|R
25|$|A {{plane mirror}} forms a virtual image {{positioned}} behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Although <b>the</b> rays of light {{seem to come}} from behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> light from <b>the</b> source only exists in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> image in a plane mirror is not magnified (that is, the image is {{the same size as}} the object) and appears to be as far behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as <b>the</b> object is in front of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{third party}} sells an adapter that {{includes}} USB, SD, and microSD {{on a single}} unit. An adapter to VGA connectors allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors. Another adapter <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations. Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector. While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad, it also works with the first-generation iPad, the iPhone 4, and the fourth generation iPod Touch.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} {{on earth}} <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> symmetric perfection of heaven. The purpose {{of art at}} this time—in architecture, the visual arts, and music—was not to create something entirely new, but to reflect this divine perfection, {{and in this way}} to praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass. The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.|$|E

50|$|A mirror {{does not}} just produce {{an image of}} what would be there without it; it also changes the light {{distribution}} in the halfspace in front of and behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> A <b>mirror</b> hanging on <b>the</b> wall makes the room brighter because additional light sources appear in <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> image. However, <b>the</b> appearance of additional light does not violate the conservation of energy principle, because some light no longer reaches behind <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> simply re-directs <b>the</b> light energy. In terms of the light distribution, <b>the</b> virtual <b>mirror</b> image has <b>the</b> same appearance and the same effect as a real, symmetrically arranged half-space behind a window (instead of <b>the</b> <b>mirror).</b> Shadows may extend from <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> into <b>the</b> halfspace before it, and vice versa.|$|R
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{painting}} {{can be attributed to}} an antique sardonyx cameo and a 15th-century relief from the circle of Donatello, available to Michelangelo in the Palazzo Medici: the circular form, the masculinity of Mary, and the positioning of the Christ Child. The Virgin’s right arm <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> arm of the satyr in the cameo, and the cameo also depicts an infant located on the shoulders of the satyr, a position similar to the Christ Child on Mary’s shoulders.|$|E
5|$|To assess {{prospective}} {{wind power}} sites a {{probability distribution function}} is often fit to the observed wind speed data. Different locations will have different wind speed distributions. The Weibull model closely <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> actual distribution of hourly/ten-minute wind speeds at many locations. The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a Rayleigh distribution {{can be used as}} a less accurate, but simpler model.|$|E
5|$|Alien: Isolation {{received}} several year-end awards, including PC Gamers Game of the Year 2014, Audio Achievement at the 11th British Academy Games Awards, Best Audio at the 15th Game Developers Choice Awards, and four awards at the 14th National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers. The game also appeared on several year-end {{lists of the}} best games of 2014. It was ranked 1st in The Daily Telegraphs the 25 best video games of 2014, 2nd in Empires the 10 Best Games Of The Year, 2nd in Times Top 10 Video Games of 2014, 4th in The Guardians Top 25 Games of 2014, 3rd in Reader's top 50 games of 2014 by Eurogamer, and in Daily <b>Mirrors</b> <b>the</b> 10 best games of 2014.

50|$|Inkjet {{printers}} are {{not capable}} of printing white.

Inkjet transfer paper for dark garments is covered with transferable white ink. For dark garments, the image is printed without mirroring.|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts the}} young artist (then twenty one) {{in the middle}} of a room, distorted by the use of a convex <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> hand in the foreground is greatly elongated and distorted by <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> work was painted on a specially-prepared convex panel in order to mimic the curve of <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> used.|$|R

5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely {{from the point}} of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in <b>mirrors.</b> <b>The</b> Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Memento.|$|E
5|$|Cartman's {{involvement}} with the fried chicken black market closely <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> plot of the 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman {{in the role of}} Tony Montana, and Colonel Sanders in the role of Alejandro Sosa. In the episode, Cartman travels to a foreign land to meet a dealer, usurps the illegal operation from his local boss, and is ultimately brought down because he becomes addicted to his own product, plot points that mirror the plot of Scarface. Specific scenes patterned after ones in Scarface, include one in which Cartman watches Tommy being executed by being hanged from a helicopter, and the final scene in which Cartman's compound is attacked by gunmen. The episode also includes references to the 1991 crime film New Jack City.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} first floor and {{continuing}} to the third, black and white floor tiling is made of Vermont marble and limestone. The exception is {{the floor of the}} rotunda which is composed of 976 blocks of translucent glass. The blocks vary in size so that when viewed from the upper floors, they appear to form a bowl which <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> dome above. The doorknobs are mostly made of a brass and bronze alloy (most of the original brass doorknobs have disappeared over time). The present doorknobs and hinges, locked for protection, display the state coat of arms. Though the building appears to have walnut woodwork, the wood is Michigan white pine that has been wood-grained to give the appearance of walnut.|$|E
50|$|The Demon Sword of Rubis (Rubisu no Maken) is {{a device}} {{designed}} specifically for Makai to safely enter <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> <b>the</b> Horror Karma is housed in. When thrown at <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> <b>the</b> Demon Sword, initially just a bell-shaped hilt, splits open and produces a small blade, which impales <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and creates a temporary portal into Karma's realm.|$|R

5|$|The 1857 {{house is}} in Regency {{architectural}} style. It was {{oriented so that}} its long side, facing north-east, was roughly parallel to Linwood Avenue. Rectangular in floor plan, the Linwood Avenue frontage had five bays, with the central bay pedimented, which gave the house a symmetrical look. An 1871 photo by Alfred Charles Barker, held by the Canterbury Museum, shows a verandah on the north-west {{side of the building}} only. This verandah was later extended to cover the front as well, and it <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> pedimented central bay. A hipped roof was hidden behind a balustrade.|$|E
5|$|The table below {{details the}} {{population}} change since 1801, including the percentage change {{since the last}} census 10 years earlier. Although Trafford was formed as a Metropolitan Borough in 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and civil parishes that would later be constituent parts of Trafford. The greatest percentage change in the population occurred between 1851 and 1871, and {{was a result of}} the construction of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849. The decrease by 7.7% in Trafford's population since the 1971 census <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> trend for Greater Manchester, although on a smaller scale; this has been accounted for by the decline of Greater Manchester's industries, particularly those in Manchester and Salford but including those in Trafford, and residents leaving to seek new jobs.|$|E
5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
50|$|The {{observer}} sees <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> {{covered in}} a pattern of stripes that reveal the shape of <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> <b>The</b> pattern is compared to a mathematically generated diagram (usually done on a computer today) of what it should look like for a given figure. Inputs to the program are line frequency of the Ronchi grating, focal length and diameter of <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> and <b>the</b> figure required. If <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> is spherical, <b>the</b> pattern consists of straight lines.|$|R

5|$|The Nassers and Naify {{contracted}} with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger {{the design of}} the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade trimmed in neon accents, and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped <b>mirrors.</b> <b>The</b> $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and indirect lighting. Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation, a condition that required channelization and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted amber glass gem lit from within.|$|E
5|$|The {{red carpet}} premiere of Sense8 {{took place on}} May 27, 2015, in San Francisco's AMC Metreon, where the first three episodes were previewed. Starting {{in the middle of}} July 2015, Netflix Brazil {{released}} a series of documentary shorts called Sense8: Decoded. Inspired by Sense8 and directed by João Wainer, the shorts briefly touch upon subjects such as psychiatry, feminism, being transgender and buddhism. Later in the month, Netflix released a music track titled Brainwave Symphony on Spotify. To produce it they subjected eight strangers to a series of various stimuli and they recorded their individual brainwaves using EEG sensors. After extracting a melody from each of them they arranged them in a way to produce a track which <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> escalating action of the season. In early August 2015, Netflix made available Sense8: Creating the World, a half-hour web television documentary, shot around the world, about the making of season 1 of the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{regular season}} has been changed in almost every season that Asia League has been in operation. The first full season <b>mirrors</b> <b>the</b> two most recent seasons in which all teams play all other teams six times. With the number of teams {{changing}} from season to season {{in the first few}} years the league adjusted the schedule each year which often included an unbalanced schedule. Under the current schedule all teams make an away visit to each other team's home rink for a three-game series and also play a three-game series against that team at their own home rink. In order to minimize travel, teams traveling to other countries will stay there for two weeks and play two teams, except in the case of China who only has one team. Teams going to Japan will play against the Cranes and Eagles on the same trip as they are geographically close together, then in another trip play against the Free Blades and Ice Bucks.|$|E
