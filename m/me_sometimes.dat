500|$|Allen herself re-recorded {{the single}} in Simlish, the fictional {{language}} used in The Sims games, to help promotion. The Simlish version {{was used in}} the Sims expansion pack [...] soundtrack, and Allen also had her own character in the game. She declared: [...] "Recording 'Smile' was a great experience for <b>me.</b> <b>Sometimes</b> revenge can be fun. But getting to sing it again [...] came very naturally and it was hilarious to practice! The silly language and whimsy of The Sims games are a perfect fit for the song. I was laughing the entire time!" [...] Also, an animated music video was made for the Simlish version.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} stage of recording, Sly and Robbie focused {{primarily}} on constructing difficult grooves for songs. To record their rhythm tracks, Dunbar worked in the studio alone and cut a drum part without having a melody in mind. He recounted his approach for the album to Musician, saying that [...] "I just played what I felt, working {{from a sense of}} 'now I'll do 103 beats per minute.' And Robbie would come in the next night and lay a bass part." [...] Unlike most reggae or funk bassists, Shakespeare approached his playing as a jazz soloist and attempted numerous subtle variations to his riff. He said that his inspiration [...] "comes from God. Sometimes endless ideas just keep coming to <b>me.</b> <b>Sometimes</b> I'll change the drum pattern to a bass line and Sly will play the bass line on the drums." [...] Along with live percussion, Dunbar played Simmons drums, and the duo integrated contemporary electronic music technology such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer in the album's recording. Dunbar used his recorded live drums to trigger the synthesizer's sampled drum sounds.|$|E

He wrote that [...] "this wasn't the most riveting X-File I've ever seen and there wasn't {{a tremendous amount of}} heart-pounding tension from beginning to end [...] but that didn't bother <b>me.</b> <b>Sometimes,</b> just being entertained is enough." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris concluded that the episode was [...] "not the series' most exciting episode, but a solid story with interesting characters used well {{in the service of the}} plot" [...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, saying [...] "'Brand X' benefits from a certain unpredictability in its plot and characters. The menace is unusual, and imaginatively conceived. The tobacco company and its employees display a degree of complexity, rather than merely serving as one-dimensional villains in a public-health morality play." [...] Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating. Wigmore noted that a [...] "freshness surrounds the whole episode, presumably a result of the writing".|$|E

500|$|With {{his career}} on hold, Hunt {{continued}} recording new songs and demos, posting {{them on his}} MySpace page, while Popular gained exposure among listeners through online music sharing. In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to <b>me.</b> <b>Sometimes</b> I do get {{a chance to talk to}} them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen. Some of us are luckier than others. Some of us are more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E

Edmund Dell described him as “putty {{in the hands of the}} defence chiefs” and his promotion as [...] " [...] ludicrous appointment. No failure was ever great enough to persuade Attlee to deny one of his cohorts new opportunities to do damage … Shinwell never forgave Gaitskell, whom he blamed for his disgrace." [...] Gaitskell, promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer later in the year, recorded in his diary that Shinwell [...] "never loses an opportunity of picking a quarrel with <b>me,</b> <b>sometimes</b> on the most ridiculous grounds”.|$|E

2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He would look at <b>me</b> <b>sometimes</b> and say 'Boy, when I was your age I was fighting a war', {{but in the end}} he grinned and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'".|$|E
2500|$|Ratcliff {{has been}} {{critical}} of her character. In a 1987 interview she commented, [...] "Sue really annoys <b>me</b> <b>sometimes</b> because she's got no guts. I'd love to liven her up a bit, dress her in some of Angie's clothes, {{get her out of}} that cafe, set her up in a business of her own and allow her to make something of her life." [...] Ratcliff was also critical that Sue was not more of a feminist: [...] "I was under the impression she'd become more assertive. I had visions of a bunch of feminists walking into the cafe one day {{right in the middle of}} a typical Sue and Ali fight, and them asking her why she puts up with him. No doubt Sue would screw up her nose and ask: 'What do you mean?' But she'd think about it, want to hear more and gradually begin to change her ways to become stronger, more independent! I get cheesed off with Sue. She isn't me at all." ...|$|E

But as you move forward, it's only fair that you begin determining your own direction. People will make the change with you as long as you’re honest about your craft and display a comfort for what it is that you’re doing," [...] two years later Peniston actually confirmed her doubts, after being questioned by the magazine: [...] "I can speak about this firsthand, believe <b>me.</b> <b>Sometimes</b> doing what you feel isn’t always accepted by the public. You’ve got to choose {{where you want to go}} and be consistent," [...] (said by the artist at the 5th annual Billboard Dance Music Summit that urged members of the dance music community to work together toward greater credibility, visibility and sales for the genre, held July 8–10 in 1998).|$|E

[...] Cryer testified {{that he had a}} personal fortune of $160,000 when he took office in 1921 and left office in 1929 with a personal wealth of $450,000 which Cryer credited to [...] "realty deals absolutely uninfluenced by his political position." [...] Asked if he had ever taken a bribe, Cryer replied: [...] "No, sir; never at any time, directly or indirectly. [...] I never profited by my office. [...] In fact, I considered it a financial detriment. [...] It was the darndest job I ever had. [...] It took practically all of my time, Sundays and every other day, and most of the night. [...] I had to take the telephone out of my house so I could get a little sleep.

2500|$|A mid-tempo heartbreak song, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "The Root" [...] have the narrator lamenting a lost lover; [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". The final two minutes of [...] "The Root" [...] feature an {{emphatic}} refrain of the chorus line. Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson wrote that the chorus [...] "feeds back into itself over and over again, turning from a hook into a mantra into a gospel affirmation". In the promotional EPK for Voodoo, D'Angelo discussed the therapeutic nature of recording [...] "The Root", stating [...] "It was kinda therapeutic for me to do this song. It kinda help me get over, because I'm so pathetic in the song. You know what I mean? That's what 'The Root' is. She got it on me. And I'm just fucked up. It was good for me to get over that. It was hard for <b>me</b> <b>sometimes</b> to do that song. To record it, because when doing it I would have to put myself in that mode you know".|$|E
2500|$|R singer-songwriter Frank Ocean {{wrote the}} ballad [...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] for the album.

[...] "Scared of Beautiful" [...] was originally {{conceived as a}} duet between Norwood and Ocean, and features the duo exchanging lyrics about looking forwards and not backwards, with lines such as [...] "I wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more/ You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful". However the final version features just Norwood. Speaking on how the song came about Norwood said, [...] "Well, he had the song {{for a while and}} when I heard it, it really just spoke to <b>me.</b> <b>Sometimes</b> you get to a point in your life where you’re scared to be great, you’re scared to be beautiful, you’re scared to be the best version of you and you talk to yourself and you try to get yourself back on track.

[...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when I looked around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams.

O'Donnell commented that due to Trump's multiple marital affairs and questionable business bankruptcies, he was not a moral authority for young people in America. She stated, [...] "Left the first wife, had an affair. Left the second wife, had an affair – but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America." [...] In response, Trump began a [...] "vicious" [...] mass media blitz in which he appeared on various television shows, either in person or by phone, threatening to sue O'Donnell (he never did). He called her names, threatened to take away her partner Kelli, and claimed that Barbara Walters regretted hiring her. Walters was stuck in the middle as a social acquaintance of Trump's, and said O'Donnell didn't feel like Walters defended her enough, which led to what both women agreed was an unfortunate confrontation in one of the dressing rooms.
