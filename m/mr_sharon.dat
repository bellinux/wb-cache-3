40|$|The {{stakes are}} very high, {{not just for}} Mr. Yasser Arafat's {{political}} survival but, more important, {{for the future of}} the Palestinians. Mr. Arafat confronts daunting tasks in responding to Hamas' bloody methods and in seizing the political initiative from the seasoned and effective Islamists. In the final analysis and regardless of the brutality of the Israeli military occupation, Hamas and Islamic Jihad have done considerable damage to the legitimate Palestinian cause, internally and externally. Their strategy of establishing a 'balance of terror' with the right-wing government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been costly to Palestinians and Israelis alike and counterproductive as well. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Sharon</b> feels emboldened with a popular mandate to invade Palestinian-controlled territory and threatens to destroy the Palestinian Authority and the prospects for genuine peace. Despite his waning popularity, Mr. Arafat is still viewed as a powerful symbol of Palestinian nationalism and retains a deep residue of support within Palestinian society. He can be most effective by using the symbols of Palestinian nationalism to redefine the political debate less as a zero sum game, as Hamas and Islamic Jihad would like the Palestinians to believe, and more as a give-and-take bargaining process...|$|E
40|$|ALL THIS holiness about {{terrorism}} in the Middle East. No argument can or should diminish by one whit the tragedy and the iniquity {{of the murder of}} both Israeli civilians and Palestinian civilians, men, women and children. But if the mass media which portray this as some unique evil want to contribute to a more-or-less just solution, they really ought to look further. That would require at least an awareness, not now evident, of what has led up to the present excesses. And a dropping of any pretence that terrorism is practised by one side only. The Israeli terrorism is practised by the state. What do I mean by an “awareness”? Well, consider pictures of the bus bombing in southern Jerusalem on June 18. Nineteen of those aboard were killed, including some school students, and 50 passengers were injured. One large newspaper picture showed Ariel Sharon with a throng of police, inspecting the scene. The Prime Minister looks sombre. He is said to be looking towards a row of body bags by the road, the sight of which we are spared. One would hope that, across the mind of any editor who looked at that picture before publication, there floated the incongruity that here is Ariel Sharon, the old terrorist, upset now by the sight of terrorism. As an Israeli army commander in 1953, he controlled Unit 101, most notorious for the atrocity of Qibya village (66 Arab men, women and children slaughtered, many blown up with their houses). As Defence Minister in the early 1980 s, he was found, despite his denial, to be “indirectly responsible” for the massacre of some 800 refugees in the camps of Sabra and Shatila in Beirut, and lost his job. Now, as Prime Minister, he bears responsibility for the state terrorism. The eminent war crimes jurist Richard Goldstone has said, in effect, that there is enough evidence related to the Beirut massacre for him to be indicted as a war criminal. These things are well enough known for editors, foreign editors, leader writers and lesser beings to be aware of them. One hopes they would also be aware of something more of the modern history of strife between Arabs and Jews in Palestine, and some of their history back to and before the Arab conquest of 15 centuries ago. Why? Because it might reveal to them that the Palestinians are in all fairness entitled - let me emphasise, entitled - to a state of their own - not a state by grace and favour of Israel and the United States, not a ridiculous non-state of separated enclaves with Israel in charge of its borders, its air space and its water supply, and certainly not a state put on demeaning probation but a nation-state in the full meaning of the term. Israel’s security? Nuclear weapons, great conventional power, the might of America - not armaments are needed, but friends. With a genuine state, Palestinian leaders would soon put their irreconcilables out of business and avoid mischief to avoid destruction. The modern history of strife in Palestine is usually counted from the late nineteenth century, when Palestine was still ruled by Turkey. Arab leaders could see Jewish immigration as a danger to their native land and culture, and Arab bands sometimes attacked Jewish settlements. They recognised that the Zionists planned eventually to take over what they considered to be the land of their ancestors (though any ethnic link with 19 th century European Jewry is said to be mythical). From 1920, by when Britain ruled Palestine under a League of Nations mandate, there were serious outbreaks of Arab violence against the growing Jewish population and the British who permitted immigration. The Jewish policy was generally one of self-restraint, but before World War 2 Jewish extremists had begun meeting terrorism with terrorism and, with bombs in public places, outstripping Arab violence. Terrorism was the method that helped get rid of the British after World War 2. The pinnacle of Jewish achievement came in 1946, when Zionist genius succeeded in blowing up the British headquarters in Palestine, Jerusalem’s famous King David Hotel. Some 90 people died, at least 15 of them Jews. Whether they received any warning is a matter of dispute; the perpetrators told some workers in a cafe to run for their lives, but if - as the planner of this operation claimed - there was a general warning, there was none given in time. The planner was Menachem Begin, who as an old terrorist became prime minister, like <b>Mr</b> <b>Sharon</b> after him. The official Jewish leadership disowned the King David operation as a dissident outrage. In fact, they had approved of it beforehand, though they had not expected such carnage. According to David Hirst, in his work The Gun and the Olive Branch: The Roots of Violence in the Middle East (Faber & Faber), it had long been standard practice for the official leadership to dissociate themselves from operations which they had sponsored or approved. The official Zionist leader David Ben Gurion said his organisation, the Jewish Agency, was not capable of suppressing terrorism: “We cannot do it because, as I told you, it is futile, sir, it is futile. ” Richard Crossman, the influential British Zionist, said Mr Ben Gurion “seems to want to have it both ways, to remain within {{the letter of the law}} as chairman of the Agency, and to tolerate terror as a method of bringing pressure on the Administration [the British Administration in Palestine]”. There is a striking parallel here: David Ben Gurion, the Jewish hero, founding Prime Minister of Israel after he declared the nation 2 ̆ 7 s independence in 1948, and Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestine Authority, would-be president of an independent Palestine, now under unceasing attack from Israeli and American leaders for tolerating Palestinian terrorism; both men disclaiming any connection with terrorism and apparently unable to prevent it. The Jewish terror continued, now in its bloodiest form, after the United Nations resolved in November 1947 that Palestine should be partitioned, a decision rejected by the Arabs. The slaughter in April 1948 of some 250 men, women and children of the harmless Arab village of Deir Yassin is well known. Hardly known yet is the atrocity of Al-Tantura, a scarcely defended village where more than 200 inhabitants, mostly unarmed young men, were massacred in May 1948. Neither village now exists. Professor Ilan Pappe, an historian at Haifa University (if his threatened expulsion has not come about) says recent research into Al-Tantura is historically important for the further light it throws on Israel 2 ̆ 7 s expulsion, direct and indirect, of some 750, 000 Palestinians, the systematic destruction of more than 400 villages and scores of urban neighbourhoods, as well as the perpetration of some 40 massacres of unarmed Palestinians. It was, of course, ethnic cleansing. 		 WHY HAVE the mass media, with the odd honourable exception, failed to tell the real story of the Palestinians and be fair towards them? They will say it isn’t their business to teach history, but there is more to it than that. The very adjectives that the mass media use in their reporting reveal a mind-set that is bent towards Israel. Any or all of many reasons may play a part: say, ignorance, admiration for Israel 2 ̆ 7 s strength, sympathy in the outrage suffered by Jewry in World War 2, an inadequate sense of fairness, cowardice in the face of the pro-Israeli lobby, simple racism [...] . It is fair to say that there seem to have been some signs of improvement in recent times, but a real awakening, not yet. And then there is the case of Mr Sam Kiley, reported in the Age last September, which leaves one to ponder another possibility. Mr Kiley resigned as Middle East correspondent of the Murdoch-controlled London Times, saying his reports were regularly censored by editors who were aware of Mr Murdoch 2 ̆ 7 s friendship with Ariel Sharon and of his investments in Israel. They lived in “terror” of irritating Mr Murdoch and went to water “every time a pro-Israeli lobby group wrote in with a quibble or complaint”. Mr Kiley instanced his finding and interviewing the Israeli soldiers who had shot a 12 -year-old boy, who in death had become a powerful symbol of the intifada; he was instructed by the Times to send copy “without mentioning the dead kid”. The Times disputed his version of events. Conrad Black - Lord Black actually - who controls the London Daily Telegraph and its Sunday partner, was annoyed when three well known contributors to his papers wrote to another Black publication, the Spectator magazine, complaining that “under Black 2 ̆ 7 s proprietorship, serious, critical reporting of Israel is no longer tolerated in the Telegraph Group”. Lord Black controls the Jerusalem Post; his wife is a Zionist and a newspaper columnist. His response: the letter of complaint showed “the depths of the problem of anti-Semitism in the British media”. True or false, anti-Semitism can be a damaging charge. In March, the Australian Jewish News published prominently on page 3 a garbled report falsely suggesting that John Pilger was anti-Jewish, a racist. This related to a Pilger article in the New Stateman on Tony Blair 2 ̆ 7 s role as Ariel Sharon 2 ̆ 7 s closest ally in Europe. Later there appeared prominently on Page 3 of the Jewish News an apology, accompanied by a photo of Mr Pilger. The paper was “happy to fully retract [the offending statement] and apologise to John Pilger for publication of the error”. HISTORICAL truth is important. Israel, like Australia, has tried to whitewash the unsavoury bits of the past, and the denigration of the Palestinians has been part of that process. But the Palestinians are victims of an historic injustice, at the hands of the United Nations and America as well as of Israel. It is time to make what amends can be made. • David Bowman is a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald. This article is published by arrangement with the Adelaide Review...|$|E
40|$|YOUR correspondent, a {{dedicated}} student {{of letters to}} the papers, {{reached the end of}} his tether again recently, this time at yet another letter of abuse and factual error about the refugees. Racist certainly, and wrong; it should never have been published. It isn’t the first letter that a newspaper should not have published, nor will it be the last. But there is a question here that seems to have escaped notice: why don’t serious newspapers correct errors that appear in published letters? They correct errors that occur elsewhere in the paper. Are letters so unimportant? Of course not. Letter writers in the main are dealing with current affairs, and what they say has an influence. Why else would organisations and individuals try so hard, and sometimes by trickery, to have their letters published? The publicity staff of Sir Robert Askin had more than a thousand letters published by various stratagems while he was premier of New South Wales, according to his then press secretary, Mr Geoffrey Reading. The papers have tightened up since then, but no system is foolproof. The problem about letters is not opinion. The problem is the facts. Any factual errors in a mass-circulation newspaper are horribly magnified by the circulation figures. But I can think of only one notable exception to this special charter that would seem to tolerate errors in published letters, and that is where the risk of a libel writ crops up. Then there may be action. Thus, last March The Sydney Morning Herald acknowledged that some very nasty statements about Mr Chris Corrigan in a letter were untrue, and apologised for publishing it. Well and good. But there are sometimes errors of much greater public consequence that go uncorrected. Yes, on occasion another correspondent will take up the mistake, but that can’t be relied upon to happen, and in any case such a letter may simply be seen by readers as disputatious rather than authoritatively corrective. TO ILLUSTRATE the significance of such errors, here is a particular case. It requires some explanation. It concerns letters about the Israel–Palestine confrontation. These have filled many columns since the meeting at Camp David in July 2000, attended by the (then) Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Barak, and the Palestinian president, Mr Arafat, with President Clinton in America’s usual irreconcilable roles of mediator and supporter of Israel. Camp David of course failed, and this failure to reach agreement has been widely dumped on Mr Arafat. Last December, 18 months after Camp David, the Australian was still describing him as the man who “spurned” a peace agreement at Camp David. As recently as March the Australian, was still pursuing him. But was Mr Arafat the villain? That is how he has been painted by unrelenting Israeli propaganda: a man who rejected an amazingly generous peace offer because his real objective is not a peace treaty between two nations but the destruction of Israel. If the American media had been up to the task, it would have ferreted out the facts at the time. As it is, it has taken a long time for something informed and reliable to register in parts of the mainstream media here. Long enough, it seems, for a myth to have been created, which some people will stick with, regardless. The letters pages have in my view played a significant part in the establishing of this myth. Here is its succinct expression by a correspondent in the Adelaide Advertiser, who referred to Mr Arafat’s “refusal to accept Barak’s offer giving him 98 per cent of what Arafat demanded”. Nonsense, of course, but it was published. A correspondent in the Age says that “Barak’s ‘peace for land’ proposal offered the Palestinians 97 per cent of their land claims [...] including half of the Old City of Jerusalem”. To this a correspondent in the Australian adds as part of the Israeli offer a “limited ‘right of return’ to Palestinian refugees”. A correspondent in the Sydney Morning Herald shakes his head sadly, but seems unaware of the facts: “The Palestinians were offered a state by the UN in 1947 and again by Israel in 2000. It is a great tragedy for the Palestinian people that their leaders were not prepared to accept either. ” The letter writers were hardly alone. In early April, in a public statement, Australia’s Prime Minister left no room for doubt: I remain mortified that a couple of years ago, the offer [of Mr Barak], which was about 80 or 90 per cent of what the Palestinians wanted, was not accepted. The biggest error, mistake [...] the greatest area of condemnation [...] of Arafat was his failure back in the year 2000 to accept the offer Barak was making then. With all the resources available to him, how could Mr Howard be so wrong? AS FAR back as August 8, 2001, Robert Malley, writing in the New York Times under the heading “Fictions About the Failure at Camp David”, exploded what he described as the three most dangerous myths about that failure. As President Clinton’s special assistant for Arab-Israeli Affairs (1998 - 2001), Mr Malley was at Camp David, a member of the small American team. What follows now is a summarised version of his article. Myth One says Camp David was an ideal test of Mr Arafat’s intentions. Not so at all. Mr Arafat believed Camp David premature [...] Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had not sufficiently narrowed the gaps beforehand [...] and he felt isolated from the Arab world and alienated by the close Israeli-American partnership. He believed that Mr Barak was trying to avoid commitments, including a long-postponed Israeli withdrawal from parts of the West Bank and the transfer to Palestinian control of villages adjacent to Jerusalem. Mr Malley himself doubted that a conflict with roots so ancient could ever have been resolved, in the fortnight set aside, without the core issues of territory, refugees, and the future of Jerusalem ever having been discussed previously by the leaders. Myth Two says Israel’s offer met most if not all of the Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations. Well, Mr Barak did go further than any of his predecessors had gone. But to the Palestinians it was no dream offer. Israel was to annex 9 per cent of the West Bank for the settlers; in return, the Palestinians would get land from Israel equivalent to only one-ninth of the territory lost. In Jerusalem, Palestine would have gained sovereignty over many Arab districts of the eastern half, and over the Muslim and Christian quarters of the Old City. But Israel would have sovereignty over some Arab sections of East Jerusalem, and over what Jews know as the Temple Mount and the Arabs as Haram al Sharif, the site of Islam’s third-holiest shrine for the past 1300 years. The Arabs would have only the custody of Haram al Sharif, something impossible for them to accept. 	 For all the importance to Palestinians of the future of the refugees, Israel’s offer spoke only vaguely of a “satisfactory solution”, which led Mr Arafat to fear that he would be asked to swallow an unacceptable last-minute proposal. Myth Three says the Palestinians made no concession of their own. This was quite untrue. They wanted a state based on the 1967 borders, but nevertheless agreed to give up West Bank territory to the settlement blocks. In East Jerusalem, there are Jewish areas that became Israeli-ruled only by conquest in the Six-day War of 1967, and these areas the Palestinians agreed to forgo. They insisted on the refugees’ right of return, but accepted that numbers would be limited in a way that ensured Israel’s demographic and security interests. Mr Malley: “No other Arab party that has negotiated with Israel [...] not Anwar el-Sadat’s Egypt, not King Hussein’s Jordan, let alone Hafez al-Assad’s Syria [...] ever came close to even considering such compromises. ” The measure of Israel’s concessions ought not, Mr Malley wrote, to be how far it has moved from its own starting point; it must be how far it has moved toward a fair solution. In the Malley view, neither Mr Arafat nor Mr Barak met their historic responsibilities at the summit, and Mr Arafat missed some chances. But clearly Mr Malley rejects the propaganda that Mr Arafat any more than Mr Barak was to blame for the outcome. The Malley account is a limited one; {{but the point is that}} he was there. To this one can add something from Palestinian sources. They calculate that Mr Barak’s offer would have left them at the best with 15 per cent of pre-Israel Palestine. At present, the West Bank and Gaza total 22 per cent of the original territory. A generous offer? The notion is absurd. The proposed state of Palestine would have comprised four enclaves, cut up by settlements and by roads for Jews only. Palestine would have been a fragmented state, one in name only, without control over its borders, its air space and its water resources. A generous offer? A new intifada was the desperate sequel. Nevertheless, attempts to reach a settlement did not end with Camp David; some progress seems to have been made later, but no deal was reached before the advent of <b>Mr</b> <b>Sharon</b> brought a sledgehammer to the Palestinian anvil. WHAT has all this to do with letters to the papers? A good deal, really. Letters have been published with false or at best misleading statements about something of high importance. Propaganda has been given a kick along. Should such letters be published? Some people may look on the letters pages as a special case, where readers don’t expect the usual editorial standards. I take the view that in matters of fact there is no room for two editorial standards. Letters editors, good letters editors, need almost superhuman qualities to cope with the great range of affairs that threaten to overwhelm them daily. If they do not have the resources to carry out all the vital checking and liaison work needed, should they not be given them? And if significant errors in letters get into print, should they not be corrected as other errors are, and repetition be avoided? • David Bowman is a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald.
