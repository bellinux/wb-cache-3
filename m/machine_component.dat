Following a suggestion from technician Rick Tighe, a pinball <b>machine</b> <b>component</b> was included to make a loud sound when a character falls off the pyramid. The sound is generated by an internal coil that hits the interior of a cabinet wall. Foam padding was added to the area of contact on the cabinet; the developers felt the softer sound better matched a fall rather than a loud knocking sound. The cost of installing foam, however, was too expensive and the padding was omitted.|$|E

50|$|The {{piston rod}} is {{typically}} a hard chrome-plated piece of cold-rolled steel which {{attaches to the}} piston and extends from the cylinder through the rod-end head. In double rod-end cylinders, the actuator has a rod extending {{from both sides of}} the piston and out both ends of the barrel. The piston rod connects the hydraulic actuator to the <b>machine</b> <b>component</b> doing the work. This connection can be in the form of a machine thread or a mounting attachment.

Efforts for optimal scheduling of executing components can then be applied {{not only to the}} <b>machine</b> <b>components</b> but also to embedded human operators, preferably in a uniform integrated fashion. The notion of the risk incursion function (RIF) introduced earlier by the authors is advocated as the guide for optimal allocation of both machine and human resources.

5000|$|A datasheet, data sheet, or spec sheet is a {{document}} that summarizes the performance and other technical characteristics of a product, <b>machine,</b> <b>component</b> (e.g., an electronic component), material, a subsystem (e.g., a power supply) or software in sufficient detail {{to be used by}} a design engineer to integrate the component into a system. Typically, a datasheet is created by the component/subsystem/software manufacturer and begins with an introductory page describing the rest of the document, followed by listings of specific characteristics, with further information on the [...] of the devices. In cases where there is relevant source code to include, it is usually attached {{near the end of the}} document or separated into another file.|$|E
50|$|The {{time scale}} of the {{stochastic}} process may be calendar or clock time or some more operational measure of time progression, such as mileage of a car, accumulated {{wear and tear on}} a <b>machine</b> <b>component</b> or accumulated exposure to toxic fumes. In many applications, the stochastic process describing the system state is latent or unobservable and its properties must be inferred indirectly from censored time-to-event data and/or readings taken over time on correlated processes, such as marker processes. The word ‘regression’ in threshold regression refers to first-hitting-time models in which one or more regression structures are inserted into the model in order to connect model parameters to explanatory variables or covariates. The parameters given regression structures may be parameters of the stochastic process, the threshold state and/or the time scale itself.|$|E

30|$|Time Synchronous Averaging {{can remove}} {{interference}} frequencies induced by environmental noise and other irrelevant <b>machine</b> <b>components</b> [43]. But, {{there is no}} environmental noise in the simulated signals. Other <b>machine</b> <b>components</b> of the simulated spur gear pair are represented by constant damping and constant stiffness parameters and as a result, there are no irrelevant frequency components caused by other <b>machine</b> <b>components.</b> As shown in Figures  7 and 8, only the gear mesh frequency and the pinion pitting fault induced sideband frequency components are present. When a more complex gearbox system is simulated, TSA may be needed. However, in real applications, especially for the slight pitting damage scenario, TSA and subsequent feature extraction may not be adequate for effective fault detection and diagnosis. Advanced signal processing techniques, such as empirical mode decomposition and wavelet analysis, may be used together with TSA for more effective fault detection and diagnosis.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} was proposed {{to estimate the}} reliability of a <b>machine</b> <b>component</b> when the probability density functions of stress and strength can not be exactly determined or only finite experiment data of stress and strength are available. The conventional universal generating function was introduced {{and then it was}} extended to represent the discrete interval-valued random variable. The experimental data of stress and strength were formulated as two discrete interval-valued random variables. Based on the extended universal generating function, a discrete interval-valued stress-strength interference model was proposed. An approach was proposed to solve the proposed stress-strength interference model and {{it can be used to}} calculate the upper and lower bounds of the component reliability. An example was given to demonstrate the proposed approach. It is showed that the proposed approach is suitable to the reliability estimation of a <b>machine</b> <b>component</b> when only finite experimental data of stress and strength can be obtained...|$|E
