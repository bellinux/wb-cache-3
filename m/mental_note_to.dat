60|$|At {{the time}} I did not fancy her {{appearance}} {{and made a}} <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> the effect that I would never like Miss Ashley.

6000|$|Another <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> be {{preserved}} for the diary: [...] "Cowboy. Now what might a cowboy be? Perhaps--" [...] But the viscount perceived that some more questions {{were about to}} be asked; so he worked {{his way out of the}} crowd, released the sleeve, put on the coat and wandered away to seek a humble and obscure lodging. He found it and went to bed and was soon asleep.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he passed}} into the parish of Bratham, and his eye fell upon a neat red brick cottage, a garden planted with sunflowers, and a bright gravel path running to the rustic gate. He thought the garden charmingly old-fashioned, and had just entered a <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> ask Angela who lived there, when the door opened, and figure he knew emerged, bearing a mat {{in one hand and}} a mopstick in the other. He was some way off, and at first could not quite {{distinguish}} who it was; but before she had come to the gate he recognized Pigott. By this time she had stepped into the road, and was making elaborate preparations to dust her mat so that she did not see him, till he spoke to her.|$|E

60|$|Accordingly they went, {{and from}} the top of the wall Benita glanced back to bid goodbye to that place which she hoped never to see again. Yet she could not feel as though she looked her last upon it; to her it wore no air of farewell, and even as she descended the perilous stairs, she found herself making <b>mental</b> <b>notes</b> as <b>to</b> how they might best be climbed again. Also, she could not believe that she had done with Mr. Meyer. It seemed to her as though for a long while yet her future would be full of him.|$|R
60|$|His mood, as the {{automobile}} whirred {{its way down}} the hill toward the town, was sunny. He looked on life benevolently and found it good. The view appealed to him more than it had managed to do on other days. As a rule, {{he was the man}} of blood and iron who had no time for admiring scenery, but to-day he vouchsafed it a not unkindly glance. It was certainly a dandy little place, this island of his. A vineyard on the right caught his eye. He made a <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> uproot it and run up a hotel in its place. Further down the hill, he selected a site for a villa, where the mimosa blazed, and another where at present {{there were a number of}} utterly useless violets. A certain practical element was apt, perhaps, to color Mr. Scobell's half-hours with nature.|$|E
60|$|The curtain {{had risen}} again, indeed, {{and the action}} was soon fast enough for the most {{impatient}} that day. No sooner had the town heard with bated breath of the expulsion of the first citizen from the inner sanctuary of the post-office, than the news of another event began to go the rounds. Mr. Worthington had other and {{more important things to}} think about than minor postmasters, and after his anger and--yes, and momentary fear had subsided, he forgot the incident except to make a <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> remember to deprive Mr. Prescott of his postmastership, which he believed could be done readily enough now that Jethro Bass was out of the way. Then he had stepped into the bank, which he had come to regard as his own bank, as he regarded most institutions in Brampton. He had, in the old days, been president of it, as we know. He stepped into the bank, and then--he stepped out again.|$|E

40|$|Classroom {{management}} {{is one of}} the knowledge and skill that has to be possessed by teachers to create an effective learning environment for students. It is also more complicated when the teachers teach English for young learners. The teachers should have good skills in maintaining children’s discipline, building good relationship with children, and creating interesting activities which encourage children to interact in English. This study aimed at studying classroom management done by the tutor of UEFA course in teaching English at the first grade of SDN Kasin Malang. This study tried to find the classroom management strategies used by the UEFA tutor, the classroom management problems faced by the UEFA tutor, and the ways used by the UEFA tutor to overcome the classroom management problems. This study used qualitative research design with case study approach. The instruments used were participant as observer observation and structured interview. Then, the subject of this study was a senior tutor of UEFA course who taught English in the first grade of SDN Kasin Malang. The result of this study showed that the tutor could apply classroom management well during teaching and learning process. The tutor applied four classroom management strategies; classroom organizing, teaching management, teacher-students relationship, and teacher’s consequences. Besides, the tutor faced some problems in managing the class, those were: name remembering, misbehavior, encouraging students to use English, and seating arrangement problems. The tutor also applied some ways to overcome those problems. To overcome name remembering problem, she interviewed students and made <b>mental</b> <b>notes.</b> <b>To</b> overcome misbehavior problem, she used minor interventions, penalties, silent clap, and repeated instructions. To overcome difficulty in encouraging students to use English, she reminded students to use English and provided some activities which encourage students to use English. To overcome seating arrangement problem, the tutor gave individual and whole class activities more often...|$|R
40|$|Major mental {{disorders}} such as schizophrenia and affective disorders are highly disabling illnesses. The cultural factors that influence the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} these disorders are of paramount clinical significance. We attempted to critically review the cultural factors in relation to the epidemiology, phenomenology, treatment, and outcome of major {{mental disorders}} from an Indian perspective, and tried to compare these with the cultural factors identified in major international studies. The clinical expression of major <b>mental</b> disorders was <b>noted</b> <b>to</b> vary across cultures in the review. In addition, the outcome of major mental disorders is reported to be better in developing nations than in the developed countries. Transcultural variations are also <b>noted</b> <b>to</b> exist in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, traditional healing practices, and psychotherapeutic approaches. The role of cultural factors in severe mental illnesses needs adequate attention from mental health professionals. Continued research on the cultural aspects is required to understand the interplay of all social, cultural, and biological factors. It is important to consider other cultural, traditional, and folk methods for understanding and management of mental illnesses...|$|R
50|$|After her tryst with Dr. Pomatter, Jenna {{arrives at}} the diner for work to {{discover}} Becky and Cal having sex behind the counter. Jenna confronts Becky on the immorality of their affair, but Becky, aware of Jenna’s affair, defends herself, claiming that Jenna’s actions are no more moral simply because of her worse home situation (“I Didn’t Plan It”). Jenna and Dr. Pomatter continue their affair {{over the next few}} weeks, as do Becky and Cal, and Dawn and Ogie’s relationship progresses as well (“Bad Idea (Reprise)”). Jenna’s relationship with Dr. Pomatter, which has become apparent to many people including Dr. Pomatter’s nurse and Joe, comes to a brief halt when Dr. Pomatter is out of town and does not show up to one of their appointments. When he shows up to the next one, Jenna confronts him over their failure to communicate and considers if the whole affair is a mistake, but they both assure each other of their importance in a world where neither of them is truly valued (“You Matter To Me”). Jenna begins writing a <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> her baby, inspired by the happiness that Dr. Pomatter has instilled in her.|$|E

Moreover, as a researcher of undergraduate writing, a postgraduate writer, and a teacher of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) this book ticks all boxes for me. I imagine that every reader of this journal will have some interest in academic writing, even if only as a reader and writer of research articles. This comprehensive volume covers a range of disciplines (e. g. Biology, Economics, History), examines highly specific genres (e. g. the PhD literature review, undergraduate discursive essays) and expands our knowledge of specific features of writing (e. g. restrictive adverbs, engagement features, conjunctive ties) ...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} a hard day. Sally and her {{children}} have just returned to the UK from a holiday abroad. It was just a short break. The flight took over six hours, but the luxury hotel in a tropical location was worth it. They are all tired, but it's {{time to get back}} to the real world [...] or Sally's version of it. The first task is to find something to eat. A quick look in the fridge and freezer confirms the need for a shopping trip. Both fridge and freezer contain plenty of food, but following the break abroad some items are after the 'use by' date and others just don't appeal. After clearing both fridge and freezer, Sally takes the children and drives the family WD to the store, making a <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> avoid 'buy one, get one free' offers and (especially after the recent appeal by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown) not to throw any more food away...|$|E
40|$|Authors {{are listed}} alphabetically. The authors gratefully {{acknowledge}} the editor, associate editor, and {{reviewers for their}} helpful suggestions and comments on previous versions of the article. 3 This article examines how unexpected changes in the marketing mix of one product in a retail setting can influence demand for other, unrelated items. Results from two laboratory studies show that spillover effects can occur in response to {{both positive and negative}} changes in either the price or quality of a product, such that positive changes increase total spending on other items and negative changes reduce it. The results also demonstrate that an attributional process underlies these effects, indicating that consumers experience specific affective responses directed at the retailer that lead them either to reward or punish the retailer accordingly. 4 Consider a consumer who makes an urgent late-night visit to a local supermarket to purchase a pain reliever. Upon arriving she notices that the store is offering routine discounts on a number of unrelated goods such as milk and paper towels, and she makes a <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> pic...|$|E
40|$|Inviting {{artificial}} intelligence into our bodies has appeal - {{but it also}} carries certain risks. I have often {{wondered what it would}} be like to rid myself of a keyboard for data entry, and a computer screen for display. Some of my greatest moments of reflection are when I am in the car driving long distances, cooking in my kitchen, watching the kids play at the park, waiting for a doctor 2 ̆ 7 s appointment or on a plane thousands of metres above sea level. I have always been great at multitasking but at these times it is often not practical or convenient to be head down typing on a laptop, tablet or smartphone.

Or even the ability to slow down the process of ageing, as long as living longer equated to living with mind and body fully intact, as outlined in the video below.

40|$|A 47 -year-old perimenopausal woman, in {{your office}} for a well-woman examination, has a {{newspaper}} clip-ping given to her by a friend. The clipping reviews a re-cent article published in a well-known national medical journal that warns {{against the use of}} hormonal replace-ment therapy (HRT) because of an increased risk of breast cancer. 1 Although she is at low risk for this can-cer, and findings of her breast examination are normal, she resists your recommendation to begin HRT. When you discuss with her the results of an article showing that postmenopausal use of estrogen reduces the risk of severe coronary heart disease, 2 she counters with an-other article from the same issue that concludes that cardiovascular mortality is increased in estrogen users. 3 As you review these studies, you fail to recognize that all have serious flaws. Also, you do not have available arti-cles that are more methodologically sound that show the overwhelming benefit of HRT 4 - 6 with no increased risk in breast cancer 7 - 9 She leaves triumphantly from your office without a prescription, and you feel confused about the overall benefit of HRT. After you make a <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> <b>to</b> read more about HRT, you see your next patient, a 28 -year-old man with allergic rhinitis. He hands you a study he obtained from the Internet, which concludes that the latest anti-histamine is far superior in efficacy to all of the other antihistamines currently available on the market. He asks you for this new prescription, realizing that his health insurance company will not approve it unless you justifY to them why he should take this particular anti-histamine. You promise to review the article and call him later in the week with his prescription.

40|$|The instinctive way {{in which}} people use <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> augment their memory {{suggests}} one {{way in which}} they might manage the disruptive effects of multi-tasking. In this study we investigated whether <b>mental</b> <b>notes</b> and/or physical notes taken before an interruption would reduce time to resume the interrupted task afterwards. Imagine that you are writing email to a colleague when the telephone rings. The interruption lag – the time from when the ringing starts until you pick up the phone – is an opportunity <b>to</b> make <b>notes</b> that might help shorten the resumption lag – the time from when the phone call ends until you resume the preexisting cognitive state required to compose the email message. A physical note would be some contextual information recorded on a physical medium, whereas a “mental note” would be such contextual information encoded in memory. The current study indicates that resumption lag is indeed reduced by having cues available during the interruption lag (<b>to</b> facilitate <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> taking), but is increased by requiring participants <b>to</b> take physical <b>notes...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{protocol}} for EEG biological feedback (BFB) at infra-low frequencies (< 0. 01 Hz) corresponding {{to those of}} the brain default mode network has been devised in recent years. Objective: to evaluate the therapeutic features of an EEG BFB technique in the rehabilitation of patients with a decreased level of consciousness. Patients and methods. The study included 11 patients with a decreased consciousness level (Glasgow coma scores of 7. 4 ± 2. 5).   The patients were examined using the specialized clinical scales before and every 3 weeks during BFB therapy (5 BFB sessions per week). Results. According to the neuropsychological scales, the patients' level of consciousness and <b>mental</b> activity were <b>noted</b> <b>to</b> become obviously increased just after 3 weeks of therapy, which was observed until the neurorehabilitation course was completed. Conclusion. The minimally conscious patients using EEG BFB showed a significant clinical improvement. The infra-low frequency EEG BFB method deserves attention as a promising tool for increasing the patients' level of consciousness in accessible form. </p...|$|R
