5|$|Many of {{the ideas}} in The Satanic Bible are shaped around a secular, {{scientific}} view of the world. However, some of these ideas continue beyond present-day secularism by implying that various occult forces are not supernatural, but rather thus far undiscovered by science. These forces {{are said to be}} <b>manipulable</b> by the practitioner of LaVeyan Satanism, a trait of the religion that has been compared with Christian Science and Scientology.|$|E
5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} surviving examples of secular portraiture in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was <b>manipulable</b> while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E
5|$|A notable recent {{development}} in Philosophy of Psychology is Functional Contextualism or Contextual Behavioural Science (CBS). Functional Contextualism {{is a modern}} philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general, the field of behavior analysis, and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves {{as the basis of}} a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on <b>manipulable</b> variables in their context.|$|E

25|$|After several {{releases}} on the Bugge Wesseltoft label Jazzland, {{he released}} the album Dream Logic (2012) {{on the label}} ECM, where he collaborated closely with Jan Bang and Erik Honoré on the production and timbral design of melodies, sound sculptures and soundscapes. Aarset is a pioneering guitarist with {{a great sense of}} electronics sound and expressiveness, and often the guitar plays a role as <b>manipulable</b> sound source and tool for layer-by-layer routing more than a traditional melody. His style is often associated with that of nu jazz, and his performance, improvising and albums feature, a strong 21'st century electronic influence. He is considered {{to be one of the}} unique re-interpretations of what the role and sound of the electric guitarist can be.|$|E
500|$|Democrats, who {{controlled}} the General Assembly, felt that county election commissioners had been unjust in selecting local election officials, {{and that this}} injustice had contributed to the election of Republican governor William O. Bradley in 1895 and Republican president William McKinley in 1896. Goebel proposed a bill, known as the [...] "Goebel Election Law", which passed along sharp party lines and over Governor Bradley's veto, created a three-member state election commission, appointed by the General Assembly, to select county election commissioners. This system proved {{to be just as}} <b>manipulable</b> as the one it replaced, allowing the Democratically controlled General Assembly to appoint fellow Democrats to the election commission.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice Roberts' {{dissenting opinion}} was devoted largely to standing. With {{specific}} reference to United States v. SCRAP, he wrote that, [...] "Over time, SCRAP became emblematic {{not of the}} looseness of Article III standing requirements, but of how utterly <b>manipulable</b> they are if not taken seriously {{as a matter of}} judicial self-restraint. SCRAP made standing seem a lawyer's game, rather than a fundamental limitation ensuring that courts function as courts and not intrude on the politically accountable branches. Today’s decision is SCRAP for a new generation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Animal vocal {{signals are}} for the most part {{intrinsically}} reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. One can [...] "trust" [...] the signal not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just can't fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more <b>manipulable,</b> but they remain reliable for the same reason— because they are hard to fake. Primate social intelligence is Machiavellian— self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive one another, {{while at the same time}} constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves. Paradoxically, it is precisely primates' resistance to deception that blocks the evolution of their vocal communication systems along language-like lines. Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{a number of}} {{commentators}} in the popular press were dismissive of Rajneesh. The Australian critic Clive James scornfully referred to him as [...] "Bagwash", likening the experience of listening {{to one of his}} discourses to sitting in a laundrette and watching [...] "your tattered underwear revolve soggily for hours while exuding grey suds. The Bagwash talks the way that looks." [...] James finished by saying that Rajneesh, though a [...] "fairly benign example of his type", was a [...] "rebarbative dingbat who manipulates the <b>manipulable</b> into manipulating one another". Responding to an enthusiastic review of Rajneesh's talks by Bernard Levin in The Times, Dominik Wujastyk, also writing in The Times, similarly expressed his opinion that the talk he heard while visiting the Poona ashram was of a very low standard, wearyingly repetitive and often factually wrong, and stated that he felt disturbed by the personality cult surrounding Rajneesh.|$|E
2500|$|In 1870 Palmer was '"probably" [...] {{a student}} of metaphysics, became {{a student of}} science in 1890 while {{practicing}} magnetic healing and after [...] "discovering" [...] chiropractic in 1895 attempted to merge science and metaphysics. In 1896, D.D. Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic was strikingly similar to Andrew Still's principles of osteopathy established a decade earlier. Both described the body as a [...] "machine" [...] whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction to improve health; chiropractors dubbed this <b>manipulable</b> lesion [...] "subluxation" [...] which interfered with the nervous system. [...] Palmer drew further distinctions by noting {{that he was the}} first to use short-lever manipulative techniques using the spinous process and transverse processes as mechanical levers to spinal dysfunction/subluxation. Soon after, osteopaths began an American wide campaign proclaimed that chiropractic was a bastardized form of osteopathy and sought licensure to differentiate themselves. [...] Although Palmer initially denied being trained by osteopathic medicine founder A.T. Still, in 1899 in papers held at the Palmer College of Chiropractic he wrote: ...|$|E

5000|$|If {{there are}} only 2 {{possible}} outcomes, a voting rule may be non-manipulable without being dictatorial. For example, {{it is the case}} of the simple majority vote: each voter assigns 1 point to her top alternative and 0 to the other, and the alternative with most points is declared the winner. This voting rule is not <b>manipulable</b> because a voter is always better off communicating her sincere preferences; and it is clearly not dictatorial.
