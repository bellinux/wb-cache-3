5|$|The domes {{and drums}} {{typically}} incorporated wooden tension rings at several levels to resist deformation in the mortar {{and allow for}} faster construction. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and <b>metal</b> <b>chains</b> were also used to stabilize domed buildings. Timber belts at the bases of domes helped to stabilize the walls below them during earthquakes, but the domes themselves remained vulnerable to collapse. The surviving ribbed or pumpkin dome examples in Constantinople are structurally equivalent and those techniques were used interchangeably, {{with the number of}} divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Aided by the small scale of churches after the 6th century, such ribbed domes could be built with formwork only for the ribs. Pumpkin domes could have been built in self-supporting rings and small domical vaults were effectively corbelled, dispensing with formwork altogether.|$|E
25|$|Apart from pure <b>metal</b> <b>chains,</b> {{cable ties}} are also {{often used as}} {{a quick way to}} tie someone up securely. These ties can leave burn marks on the skin when applied too tightly, and because of their {{durability}} and resistance to struggling, must be handled carefully when applied to joints or being left in place for a longer time.|$|E
25|$|Metal (especially steel) {{is often}} used in bondage, most often in handcuffs, legcuffs, thumbcuffs, hooks and chains, and is often {{combined}} with other materials. Apart from the durability of metal and the flexibility of metal items, metal appeals to many people because of its tough image and the sheer toughness of being bound by metal items. Metal is practically immune to struggling and escape. In BDSM erotica, <b>metal</b> <b>chains</b> are often associated with historical torture and prison scenarios.|$|E

25|$|In the Byzantine period, domes were {{normally}} hemispherical and had, {{with occasional}} exceptions, windowed drums. All {{of the surviving}} examples in Constantinople are ribbed or pumpkin domes, with the divisions corresponding {{to the number of}} windows. Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting lead sheeting. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and <b>metal</b> <b>chains</b> were also used to stabilize domed construction. The technique of using double shells for domes, although revived in the Renaissance, originated in Byzantine practice.|$|E
25|$|In 18th-century Europe, revolutionaries such as Philippe Pinel and Johann Christian Reil {{reformed}} {{the hospital}} system. Instead {{of the use}} of <b>metal</b> <b>chains</b> and restraints, their institutions used rigorous work and leisure activities in the late 18th century. This was the Moral Treatment era, developed in Europe during the Age of Enlightenment, where the roots of occupational therapy lie. Although it was thriving in Europe, interest in the reform movement fluctuated in the United States throughout the 19th century. It re-emerged {{in the early decades of}} the 20th century as Occupational Therapy.|$|E

Jiang Gan wanders around and meets Pang Tong in a nearby temple by chance, without knowing that Pang has been expecting him. He escapes and brings Pang Tong back with him to meet Cao Cao. Pang Tong gives fake advice to Cao Cao by suggesting that he uses <b>metal</b> <b>chains</b> to link his warships together to reduce the chances of his troops falling seasick.

2500|$|Israeli Navy {{warships}} flanked the flotilla and {{an aircraft}} flew overhead after it ignored Israeli instructions. Speedboats were prevented from approaching the Mavi Marmara by throwing broken dishes and <b>metal</b> <b>chains.</b> The other ships were boarded from speedboats. Israeli forces {{were met by}} passive resistance on five of the ships, but clashes broke out aboard the Mavi Marmara. A team of 15 Israeli Shayetet 13 naval commandos abseiled onto the ships from helicopters with paintball guns, plastic bullet riot dispersal handguns, and hidden firearms. The first team commander was thrown over the deck head down, abducted and stabbed, along with a second commando, and a third was grabbed off the rope. They were taken to an inside room and medically treated by the activists, who left the knife in the commander's stomach. A stun grenade from the abducted soldiers was thrown at the commandos and a handgun was allegedly taken from one soldiers and fired by an activist, who was intercepted. The commandos were ordered to use live fire. In the melee, five activists were killed, and two, wounded by rubber bullets, died a short time later. According to the Israeli timeline video, within 5 minutes the roof was secured, {{with the assistance of}} an extra 15 man commando unit. Only 15 minutes later the commandos began the ship takeover with live ammunition and a third team of fighters. The soldier's captors escaped, and the Israeli commander pulled the knife out of his body and jumped overboard along with a second soldier. The third, with severe head injury was left and found by his comrades later. The raid ended with nine activists killed, and dozens injured. A UNHRC fact-finding mission described six of the nine passengers' deaths as [...] "summary execution" [...] by the Israeli commandos. A BBC documentary concluded that Israeli forces had faced a violent premeditated attack by a group of hardcore IHH activists, who intended to orchestrate a political act to put pressure on Israel. The programme was criticised as [...] "biased" [...] by critics of Israel and the PSC (Palestine Solidarity Campaign) questioned why the IDF boarded the ship at night if it had peaceful intention. Seven Israeli commandos were injured in the skirmish. After seizing control of the ships, Israeli forces towed them to Ashdod and detained the passengers. Both sides place responsibility for the bloodshed on the other, and accounts of the events vary.|$|E

40|$|The {{continuing}} {{advances in}} miniaturization of semiconductor devices have seriously challenged con-tact technology. This work explored the chemical reaction {{involved in the}} bottom-up formation of metal contacts using a linear atomic metal string chelate for CVD. The adsorption and thermal reaction of a lin-ear dipyridylamino trichromium chelate on the GaN surface were characterized using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and thermal programmed desorption. The chelate may re-act with GaN at 105 K and chemisorb on the substrate surface via bonding of the chromium atom in the central <b>metal</b> <b>chain</b> after its terminal bond was disrupted. The bonding of dipyridylamino ligands to the central <b>metal</b> <b>chain</b> remained intact during chemisorption. The chromium atom string of the chemisorbed species was inclined to the surface. A change in bonding configuration of the chelate took place as the che-late dose to the substrate was increased. The chemisorbed structure was stable on the surface in the sub-strate temperature range between 110 K and 260 K. Some dipyridylamino ligands may be detached from the chelate at ~ 340 K. At a higher substrate temperature of ~ 540 K, additional ligands may dissociate, along with the cleavage of the chemical bond in the central <b>metal</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|R
