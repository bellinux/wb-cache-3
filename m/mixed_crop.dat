The concepts of analysis of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> are applied to an example of an alley cropping (a type of agroforestry) experiment, and a basic agroforestry research guide is described. <b>Mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> is the growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the same land, either with or without distinct row arrangement (Andrews and Kassam 1976), and includes the practice of agroforestry. <b>Mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> was probably the first type of organized crop production (Francis 1986, Plucknett and Smith 1986) and is still widely practiced in the developing world (Osiru and Willey 1972).

50|$|The {{early history}} of the farm {{property}} is reflective of general trends in the area.

The farm was first used for <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> production, and by 1850 {{was one of the}} town's most successful dairy farms, {{at a time when many}} local farmers were breeding sheep. In 1901 the property was purchased by Charles B. Parsons, president of the St. Joseph Lead Company of Missouri; Parsons' grandfather had been a tenant farmer on the land under Smith. Under Parsons the farm was enlarged and the house given its present Colonial Revival styling. His successor, William R. Bush, introduced the Chester White hog breed to the area, and expanded the farm to its greatest extent, about 1200 acre. Now reduced to a more modest acreage, it has been used since the 1970s for the breeding of horses.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the green}} revolution, {{agricultural}} production has increased tremendously due to synthetic fertilizers, chemical crop protectants and high yielding plant varieties. However, soilborne pathogens remain yield-limiting factors in agricultural production. Hardly any sustainable solutions {{are available to}} control soilborne diseases and effective chemicals are limited and often have unwanted environmental side effects. Therefore, more sustainable ways of cultivating crops and agricultural production are needed. The general goal of this thesis research {{was to investigate the}} effect of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> on soilborne diseases in organically managed soils and to unravel the mechanism(s) involved. First, the disease suppressiveness of organically managed soils against the soilborne fungal pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici and the role of antagonistic Pseudomonas bacteria were investigated. Take-all disease severity was lower in organically compared to conventionally managed soils. Naturally occurring populations of 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol producing pseudomonads were lower in organically managed soils. The initial establishment of an introduced fluorescent pseudomonad was hampered in these soils and its biocontrol efficacy was lower in the organically than in the conventionally managed soils, indicating that these pseudomonads do not {{play an important role in}} disease suppression in organically managed soils. Rather, microbial activity was likely important for disease suppression in the organically managed sandy soils. Disease levels are often lower in <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> compared to single crops. In this thesis we present an overview of soilborne pathogens in <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> and discuss the disease suppressive mechanisms that are involved. Furthermore, we studied the effects of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> (Brussels sprouts-barley and triticale-white clover) in organically managed soils on suppressiveness against three soilborne pathogens. <b>Mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> did not result in enhanced disease suppressiveness compared to the single-cropped soils. Also soil microbial community structure and activity in <b>mixed</b> <b>cropped</b> soils were indistinguishable from single-cropped soils. Finally we investigated the effects of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> triticale-clover on the development of Take-all disease under field and greenhouse conditions and the mechanisms involved. Under field conditions, Take-all disease severity increased for both single- and mix-cropped triticale over three consecutive years. Disease increase tended to be lower in the mixed- than in the single-cropped triticale. In the fourth year this trend was however reversed, probably due to bad clover establishment. In the greenhouse, Take-all disease was lower in the mix- than in the single-cropped triticale during five consecutive cycles. In both the field and greenhouse experiments clover biomass was negatively correlated with Take-all disease severity. Potential disease suppressive mechanisms stimulated by the clover biomass could be a change in triticale root architecture, host dilution, enhanced microbial activity, stimulation of antagonists in the rhizosphere and possibly increased ammonium concentrations in the rhizosphere. We conclude that effects of <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> systems on soilborne pathogens depend more on the crops or cultivars growing at that moment than on the <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> grown previously. Disease suppression in <b>mixed</b> <b>crops</b> is therefore a plant-driven process and effects are mainly observed in the rhizosphere and not in the bulk soil. Root architecture might have a large influence on the interactions that can take place in <b>mixed</b> <b>cropping</b> and the selection of the crops or cultivars to be included in the mixture should be made with great care to have significant effects on soilborne plant pathogens...|$|R

Ricebean is most widely grown as an intercrop, particularly of maize, throughout Indo-China and extending into southern China, India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In the past it was widely grown as lowland crop on residual soil water after the harvest of long-season rice, but it has been displaced to a great extent where shorter duration rice varieties are grown.

Those farmers who depend on <b>mixed</b> <b>crop</b> gardens or on mung bean fields are generally better able to manage during times of poor rain but are seemingly less successful when the rains are good. Corn, as a single crop, remains the predominant staple on Savu, though most farmers try to plant several different fields to increase their chances {{of at least one}} successful harvest. Cotton is the main crop on Rai Jua, where the standard of living is below that of Savu. It is used to make traditional textiles. Corn is planted in late November, December or early January and harvested from February through to March; rice and also mung beans are planted later, usually in January, after soils are well saturated with rain. In El Niño years, farmers are frequently misled by initial rains, which offer promise but then cease. Most farmers keep some seed reserves if they are forced to plant a second time during the wet season. Rarely do farmers have sufficient seed reserves for a third attempt at planting and by the time such a third planting seems necessary, there is little likelihood of success. By mid-March the rains begin to diminish and it is no longer possible to plant corn with any expectation of a good harvest.|$|E
