5|$|Real <b>Madrid</b> has {{maintained}} the white shirt for its home kit {{throughout the history}} of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., {{one of the most famous}} teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real <b>Madrid</b> would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in <b>Madrid</b> and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético <b>Madrid</b> at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real <b>Madrid</b> became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real <b>Madrid</b> of the era.|$|E

On 10 February 2008, Robben scored his first goal, coming at home in a 7–0 victory against Valladolid.

Real <b>Madrid</b> won the Liga title with multiple games to spare, and were already the champions of Spain when they played their arch-rivals Barcelona on 7 May 2008. The Barcelona players formed a guard of honour as the <b>Madrid</b> team came onto the pitch at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and Robben played an important part in Real Madrid's subsequent 4–1 victory, scoring the champions' second goal.|$|E
