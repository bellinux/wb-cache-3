40|$|What are {{the welfare}} gains {{from being in}} a {{currency}} union? I explore this question {{in the context of}} a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with <b>monetary</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade, local currency pricing and incomplete markets. The model generates a trade off between monetary independence and monetary union. On one hand, distinct national monetary authorities with separate currencies can address business cycles in a country specific way, which is not possible for a single central bank. On the other hand, short-run violations of the law of one price and long-run losses of international trade occur if different currencies are adopted, due to the inertia of prices in local currencies and to the presence of trade frictions. I quantify the welfare gap between these two international monetary arrangements in consumption equivalents over the lifetime of households, and decompose it into the contributions of different frictions. I show that the welfare ordering of alternative currency systems depends crucially on the international correlation of macroeconomic shocks and on the strength of the <b>monetary</b> <b>barriers</b> affecting trade with separate currencies. I estimate the model on data from Italy, France, Germany and Spain using standard Bayesian tools, and I find that the trade off is resolved in favour of a currency union among these countries. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{health of}} the Latino migrant {{population}} in the United States is necessary to understand and address, because it affects not only migrant health, but also the non-migrant population. This paper both discusses the health and health disparities of Latino migrants in the U. S {{as well as the}} issues in La Plata County. As well as examines the explanatory models behind these disparities, including discussions of issues of access to healthcare in terms of <b>monetary</b> <b>barriers,</b> structural barriers, and cultural barriers. It is important to understand the disparities for this demographic and the explanatory models that offers explanations to these disparities, to contextualize personal research. Personal research explored; how migration changes certain risk factor behaviors and stressors as well as access that can contribute to the health disparities between Latinos and non-Latinos. The hypothesis for this study; there will be significant differences within the Latino population in Durango before and after their migration to the United States. Differences in behavior, stressors and access to healthcare are the result of high risk factors and significant healthcare disparities between Latinos and non-Latinos. Through a mixed methods survey of 25 participants, data shows that certain risk factor behaviors and stressors increase after migration, such as a decrease in fruit and vegetable consumption and less of a social and emotional support. The survey also explored issues of access by seeing if barriers to accessing healthcare changed after migrating. After migrating participants reported less issues with institutional barriers, but a huge increase in cultural barriers to healthcare, while <b>monetary</b> <b>barriers</b> was an issue both before and after migrating. With this information, we now have a basic needs assessment for Latino migrants in our community. To lessen these health disparities we must work from a community and personal level to provide information on nutrition as well as create support systems for Latino Migrants in our community. By discussing health disparities and identifying behaviors, stressors and issues of access that perpetuate these disparities, it is possible to increase the health of Latino migrants in our community...|$|R

30|$|Finally, our {{analysis}} is positive rather than normative in nature. We find that people largely do not relocate {{in response to}} large increases in violence, {{but it could be}} the case that if the costs were lower or if people had accurate perceptions of violence in the home and destination locations, migration would be the optimal adjustment mechanism. Without more information on alternative responses or the extent to which information and <b>monetary</b> <b>barriers</b> limit migration, {{it is impossible to know}} if the decision to stay in increasingly violent areas is first or second best. We also do not attempt to measure the total welfare cost of the violence, or the extent to which welfare could be improved by relocation, but view such analysis as fruitful, particularly for policy makers attempting to improve individuals’ ability to manage higher levels of violence. Further work on how people form perceptions of violence and the ways in which they adapt are necessary to perform a welfare exercise and further our understanding of the total societal costs of violence.|$|R

The current state of public {{participation in}} EIAs is highly contested as the debate on {{what can be done}} to improve it continues. The primary focus of the thesis is to study public participation and its use in an Irish EIA. It aims to explore exactly how stakeholders of the Lisheen Wind Farm case experienced the public participation offered to them and to what extent did it abide by the main three principal pillars of the Aarhus Convention. The research approach adopted in this thesis utilises an explorative case study approach. By choosing a single representative case study the thesis can concentrate on assessing how the public participation was conducted as well as exploring the experiences of the participants. Qualitative methods were predominately used as the thesis adopted a dual analysis approach utilising practice evaluation criteria and phenomenological methods. The case study findings showed that all of the practice evaluation criteria were fulfilled. However; the results also displayed the weaknesses that are still present in public participation today, such as poor information provision, poor facilitation and the existence of <b>monetary</b> <b>barriers.</b> The phenomenological analysis, with its focus on more subjective elements, found that social factors such as civic duty and self-perception can affect how much participants engage in the participation process. The conclusions drawn from the case study findings are, firstly, that the public {{participation in the}} case adhered to the primary principals of the Aarhus Convention. Secondly that deeper insights gathered from the experiences of participants are an underutilised and could be valuable asset in the goal of improving public participation in EIAs...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents two {{essays in}} international monetary economics; {{the unifying theme}} is the international dimension of monetary policy. I investigate two {{issues related to the}} openness of the economy: (i) the implications of external positions for the conduct of macroeconomic stabilisation policy; (ii) the consequences of monetary unification for social welfare under incomplete international markets. The former subject occupies chapter one; the latter occupies chapter two. In the first chapter, "Monetary policy and wealth effects with external positions", I develop a two-country DSGE model to study how financial integration affects the international transmission of shocks and the conduct of monetary policy. If the households of each country receive dividends from foreign firms, macroeconomic disturbances are followed by international wealth effects that transfer consumption across countries. The direction of these effects varies across different types of shocks, as these imply different comovements of macroeconomic variables. As a consequence, the choice of the monetary policy mix is shown to rest on the relative importance of different sources of uncertainty. In the second chapter, "Monetary policy and welfare in a currency union", I explore the welfare cost of abandoning an independent monetary policy to join a currency union, and I investigate what trade gains can outweigh this loss. The consequences of subjecting distinct economies to a single monetary authority are investigated {{in the context of an}} open-economy DSGE model with country-specific macroeconomic shocks and incomplete international markets. The dependence of the cost of adopting a single currency on the international synchronisation of business cycles is examined first. Next, the welfare implications of international price misalignments and <b>monetary</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade with separate currencies are considered. Finally, the model is estimated with data from Italy, France, Germany and Spain using standard Bayesian tools. Moderate trade frictions are found to be sufficient for a monetary union to guarantee the same welfare as a regime with national currencies. Under a calibration of these frictions in line with the literature, monetary unification is found to offer positive net welfare gains to all these economies...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{compares the}} {{efficiency}} of the European banking systems in view of the constitution of the European Monetary Union. Since competition among banks will increase, it is important to identify the most efficient banking system able {{to play a role in}} that market. A parametric approach is adopted based on the estimation of a stochastic cost frontier. This methodology enables one to measure X-inefficiency and to model it as a function of environmental variables which may influence firms’ efficiency. By means of this analysis it is possible to identify the most efficient banking systems and to focus on the determinants of deviations from cost minimizing. The analysis highlights significant efficiency gaps among the performances of banks in different countries and of different institutional types. In particular, it is found that the Mittel-European model is the one that operates closest to the efficient frontier. This may indicate that, compared with separated banks, the universal banking system allows for production plans which come closer to the optimal frontier. The analysis suggests that, at the beginning of European <b>Monetary</b> Union, national <b>barriers</b> and regulator y frameworks are still responsible for deviation from the efficient frontier...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{represent a}} promising approach to reduce local vehicle emissions, {{and thus to}} improve air quality in urban regions. Their market uptake, however, is still staying below expectations in most countries across Europe, due to <b>monetary</b> and non-monetary <b>barriers.</b> Besides <b>monetary</b> incentives, different non-monetary policy measures to promote electric mobility are either discussed or already in place. Since the different monetary incentives across Europe {{have proven to be}} not equally effective in the support of the electric vehicle market uptake, it is expected that non-monetary policy measures will not express the same impact level in different countries, too. Therefore, the project "Incentives for Cleaner Vehicles in Urban Europe" (I-CVUE) aims to understand the efficacy of policy measures that promote electric vehicles in Europe. In order to gain a deeper understanding a stated preference survey was executed that focusses on studying the value of policy measures and further non-monetary aspects of electric vehicle ownership. The online survey was directed at vehicle drivers and fleet managers in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Spain. Based on the obtained data, country-specific willingness-to-pay values are deducted, which can be used to assess the utility of electric vehicles. The results are used to derive recommendations to city-level policy makers on efficient measures to promote electric vehicles...|$|R

Therefore, this paper intends to find if chochos production {{have the potential}} to increase farmers revenue and contribute to food security if it replaces maize and soybeans, while assuming three scenarios for chochos production that influence farmers revenue. If so, how would it affect the land use change in terms of food security? A gross margin calculation with three scenarios—current, double and triple revenue—for chochos was compared with maize and soybeans gross margin. Then, a land use analysis throughout yields, crude protein and energy differences. Finally, a narrative literature review to highlight cost-benefits and barriers for chochos. As a result, the current revenue for chochos and if it doubles, demonstrates there would be less income for farmers. However, if revenue triples, farmers would earn more money and contribute towards food security if replacing maize. In contrast, if replacing soybeans, food security is not improved since yield performance for this crop is better than chochos. Even though, chochos would not produce more protein or energy than soybeans in the near future, research has shown that the negative aspects of soybeans such as GM seeds, could give a reason for chochos to become a better alternative for the future. Nonetheless, if <b>monetary</b> and agricultural <b>barriers</b> are not overcome, chochos will not increase their yield performance and farmers will not acquire enough interest to replace influential crops...|$|R

40|$|We offer a new {{methodology}} for defining and measuring disparities {{in the distribution}} of health opportunities. We apply such a methodology to Italian data. In particular, we will measure whether and to what extent the adoption of regional plans for budget deficit reduction in the health sector (so called Piani di rientro), have affected the distribution of health opportunities, thus fostering patients’ outflow from southern regions. Our methodological approach is novel. The existing health literature adopts an ex-post approach that is not able to disentangle the opportunities individuals enjoy, from the effective utilization of health services. This is a relevant shortcoming. As utilization also depends on individuals’ preferences and attitudes, conceptualizing (hence measuring) opportunities as utilization is misleading. The existing health literature is therefore not able to provide an acceptable notion of health opportunities that {{can be used as a}} basis for measurements and comparisons (across areas and over time). We propose a new approach based on an ex-ante perspective, hence not affected by the above mentioned shortcoming. In such an approach what is salient is how the monetization of access barriers (either nominal or real costs of access) to a fixed-quality bundle of health services is distributed across cells, where each cell is defined by a set of characteristics which are relevant in determining barriers (age, geographic location, presence of a disability, being part of an ethnic minority, etc.). As access is what gives concrete meaning to the more abstract notion of opportunity, the cornerstone of our methodological approach is the intuition that equality of opportunity is not a meaningless expression only if access is ex-ante granted from any cell. Therefore, in our perspective, equality can only increase either when an additional cell gains access, or when the costs of access are somewhat equalized across cells provided that universal access is granted. Our approach remarkably integrates an assessment of the objective chances of access, typical of the literature focusing on poverty gaps, with a measure of the disparities in the barriers individuals have to overcome, typical of the literature on income inequality. The index we aim to develop for measuring disparities in health opportunities, will be grounded in these principles. The approach we propose is compatible with the consideration of both <b>monetary</b> and real <b>barriers</b> of access (formal and effective equality of opportunity). As for the empirical analysis, according to the Program for the Assessment of the National Health Service developed by the Italian Ministry of Health, we propose to consider the monetization of access barriers to specific treatments: Heart Valve Replacement, Specific services related to cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment; Thighbone (Femur) Fractures. For some of these treatments (e. g. Thighbone (Femur) Fractures) data from the Italian Ministry of Health already provide the chance of ranking providers (hence treatments) on the basis of the quality of the health service provided. Once set the fixed quality health treatment under consideration, by means of simulation analysis based on real data - concerning the distribution of: population, income and wealth, age, transport facilities, and all the other variables affecting the direct cost of access – we will construct a sample of cells representative of the loci occupied by Italian citizens. We will apply this methodology to measure disparities in the geographic distributions of health opportunities. By means of more standard statistical tools we will also assess how public finance budget cuts have affected the distribution of health opportunities and patients’ mobility among Italian regions...|$|R
