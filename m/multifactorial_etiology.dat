40|$|Abstract: Frailty is {{a common}} and {{important}} geriatric syndrome characterized by age-associated declines in physiologic reserve and function across multiorgan systems, leading to increased vulnerability for adverse health outcomes. Two major frailty models have been described in the literature. The frailty phenotype defines frailty as a distinct clinical syndrome meeting three or more of five phenotypic criteria: weakness, slowness, low level of physical activity, self-reported exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss. The frailty index defines frailty as cumulative deficits identified in a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Significant progress has recently been made in understanding the pathogenesis of frailty. Chronic inflam-mation is likely a key pathophysiologic process {{that contributes to the}} frailty syndrome directly and indirectly through other intermediate physiologic systems, such as the musculoskeletal, endocrine, and hematologic systems.

Maternal plasma phenytoin or phenobarbital levels were positively associated with developmental anomalies and total abnormal outcomes. An increase in maternal seizures and/or anticonvulsant drugs, as well as detoxification defects of phenytoin arene oxide metabolites were correlated with decreased head circumference, while family history of seizures was associated with reduced birth weight and/or length.

40|$|Abstract Background Normal and {{abnormal}} {{processes of}} pregnancy and childbirth are poorly understood. This second article {{in a global}} report explains {{what is known about}} the etiologies of preterm births and stillbirths and identifies critical gaps in knowledge. Two important concepts emerge: the continuum of pregnancy, beginning at implantation and ending with uterine involution following birth; and the <b>multifactorial</b> <b>etiologies</b> of preterm birth and stillbirth. Improved tools and data will enable discovery scientists to identify causal pathways and cost-effective interventions. Pregnancy and parturition continuum The biological process of pregnancy and childbirth begins with implantation and, after birth, ends with the return of the uterus to its previous state. The majority of pregnancy is characterized by rapid uterine and fetal growth without contractions. Yet most research has addressed only uterine stimulation (labor) that accounts for Etiologies The etiologies of preterm birth and stillbirth differ by gestational age, genetics, and environmental factors. Approximately 30 % of all preterm births are indicated for either maternal or fetal complications, such as maternal illness or fetal growth restriction. Commonly recognized pathways leading to preterm birth occur most often during the gestational ages indicated: (1) inflammation caused by infection (22 - 32 weeks); (2) decidual hemorrhage caused by uteroplacental thrombosis (early or late preterm birth); (3) stress (32 - 36 weeks); and (4) uterine overdistention, often caused by multiple fetuses (32 - 36 weeks). Other contributors include cervical insufficiency, smoking, and systemic infections. Many stillbirths have similar causes and mechanisms. About two-thirds of late fetal deaths occur during the antepartum period; the other third occur during childbirth. Intrapartum asphyxia is a leading cause of stillbirths in low- and middle-income countries. Recommendations Utilizing new systems biology tools, opportunities now exist for researchers to investigate various pathways important to normal and abnormal pregnancies. Improved access to quality data and biological specimens are critical to advancing discovery science. Phenotypes, standardized definitions, and uniform criteria for assessing preterm birth and stillbirth outcomes are other immediate research needs. Conclusion Preterm birth and stillbirth have <b>multifactorial</b> <b>etiologies.</b> More resources must be directed toward accelerating our understanding of these complex processes, and identifying upstream and cost-effective solutions that will improve these pregnancy outcomes. </p...|$|R
