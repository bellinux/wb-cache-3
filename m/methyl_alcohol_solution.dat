50|$|LG E-Book is a {{proof of}} concept design for {{a new series of}} laptops being {{developed}} by LG Electronics of South Korea. Two prototypes have been built so far, but a release date has not been announced. The laptop uses an organic light-emitting diode screen instead of the traditional LCD. The laptop is powered by a <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>solution</b> instead of the more conventional Li-ion batteries seen in laptops today. However the product is still in early development stages and will not be on the market for some time.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} by "solid-liquid {{separation}} after liquid-liquid extraction" was 	proposed for the spectrophotometric determination of trace amount of magnesium. 	This method {{is based on}} the formation of a yellow chelate (oxinate) which 	is quantitatively extractable by melted naphthalene in the pH range of 10 - 12. 	The extract of oxinate in naphthalene is not soluble in ethyl alcohol, benzene 	or chloroform, but is soluble in methyl alcohol. The optical absorbancy at 375 	nm was measured against the reagent blank and the Beer's law was obeyed 	with 5 - 120 μg of magnesium in 25 m 1 of methyl alcohol. The chelate in <b>methyl</b> 	<b>alcohol</b> <b>solution</b> is very stable for a long time...|$|E
40|$|A new {{biodegradable}} flocculant {{was prepared}} {{from a common}} and inexpensive protein. Milk casein was methylated in a 0. 05 M HCl <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>solution</b> at room temperature. The methylated milk casein (MeCS) having a methylation degree of 81 % {{was applied to the}} separation or flocculation of diatomite in seawater (pH 8. 1 ± 0. 1) at room temperature (18 - 23 °C). The flocculating ability of MeCS was evaluated by a sedimentation balance method (cumulative measuring method). The diatomite suspension was effectively flocculated by the addition of a small amount of MeCS (0. 25 wt% of the diatomite weight). The results of sedimentation analysis showed that the size-frequency curve had a very sharp and high peak thus the diatomite floc formed by MeCS had a rather uniform size. The settling velocity of diatomite floc at the appropriate MeCS dosages (0. 25 - 2 wt% to diatomite) was about 3 × 10 - 3 m s- 1...|$|E
40|$|To a {{solution}} of 1 [1] (1 g, 2. 25 mmol) in 50 mL of dry benzene held under nitrogen, was added 0. 5 mL of ethyl formate [2] (distilled from phosphorus pentoxide) followed by {{a solution}} of (0. 45 g, 8. 33 mmol) of sodium in 35 mL of absolute <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The resulting <b>solution</b> was then kept at room temperature under nitrogen for several hours (usually overnight). Reaction was indicated {{by the appearance of}} a deep colour. The mixture was poured into a cold solution of 5 mL of glacial acetic acid in 20 mL of water, and the resulting precipitate was extracted into benzene or methylene dichloride. The organic layer was washed with water, dried with Na 2 SO 4, and concentrated. The residue was then chromatographed on a silica gel column using hexane/EtOAc (99 / 1) as eluant to give 2 (0. 85 g, 80 %). Mp: 161 - 163 °C...|$|R

40|$|Ultrahigh speed fan blades, {{designed}} {{in accordance with}} the requirements of an ultrahigh tip speed blade axial flow compressor, were fabricated from a high strength graphite fiber tow and a PMR polyimide resin. The PMR matrix was prepared by combining three monomeric reactants in <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and the <b>solution</b> was applied directly to the reinforcing fiber for subsequent in situ polymerization. Some of the molded blades were completely finished by secondary bonding of root pressure pads and an electroformed nickel leading edge sheath prior to final machining. The results of the spin testing of nine PMR fan blades are given. Prior to blade fabrication, heat resin tensile properties of the PMR resin were examined at four formulated molecular weight levels. Additionally, three formulated molecular weight levels were investigated in composite form with both a high modulus and a high strength fiber, both as-molded and postcured, in room temperature and 232 C transverse tensile, flexure and short beam shear. Mixed fiber orientation panels simulating potential blade constructions were also evaluated. Flexure tests, short beam shear tests, and tensile tests were conducted on these angle-plied laminates...|$|R
40|$|Yeast biomass was {{methylated}} in a 0. 1 M HCl <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>solution</b> at {{room temperature}} and the methylated yeast (MeYE) {{was applied to the}} adsorptive separation of Cr(VI) and As(V) anions from aqueous solutions. At near neutral pH, while Cr(VI) and As(V) anions were scarcely adsorbed onto unmethylated yeast biomass, their adsorbed amounts increased with increasing methylation degree. The amount of Cr(VI) adsorbed onto MeYE was almost constant at pH 4 - 6 and decreased with increasing pH above pH 6. The adsorbed amount of As(V) onto MeYE was rather lower than that of Cr(VI) and it had a peak at about pH 7. A metal-binding model was used to describe the adsorption characteristics of Cr(VI) and As(V) onto MeYE. The results showed that MeYE has two different types of adsorption sites. The saturated adsorbed amount of Cr(VI) and As(V) onto MeYE having methylation degree 0. 94 was 0. 55 mmol g- 1...|$|E
40|$|A new biosorbent, {{methylated}} yeast (MeYE), {{was prepared}} for the adsorptive separation of proteins from aqueous solutions. Yeast was methylated in a 0. 1 M HCl <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>solution</b> at room temperature. About 80 % of the carboxylic groups of yeast could be methylated within 9 h. The adsorption of egg albumin to MeYE was studied to evaluate the protein adsorption ability of MeYE. At near neutral pH, egg albumin was scarcely adsorbed to unmethylated yeast and the adsorption amount of egg albumin increased with increasing the methylation degree. The adsorption amount of egg albumin to MeYE increased with increasing pH from 4 to 7 and steeply decreased above pH 7. The Langmuir isotherm was applied to determine the apparent adsorption constant and the saturated adsorption amount of egg albumin to MeYE. Both the apparent adsorption constant and the saturated adsorption amount increased with the degree of methylation. The saturated adsorption amount of egg albumin to MeYE having methylation degree 77 % was 8. 41 × 10 - 6 mol g- 1 or 0. 378 g g- 1 at near neutral pH...|$|E
40|$|A {{common and}} {{inexpensive}} protein, egg albumin, {{was applied to}} the solid-liquid separation or flocculation of diatomite. Egg albumin was methylated in a 0. 1 M HCl <b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>solution</b> at room temperature. About 90 % of the carboxylic groups of egg albumin could be methylated within 24 h. The adsorption of egg albumin to diatomite at pH 6. 8 was remarkably enhanced by methylation. The adsorption constant of methylated egg albumin to diatomite at 30 °C was about 100 -fold larger than that of native egg albumin however the adsorption constant of methylated egg albumin decreased to about one-hundredth with decreasing temperature from 30 to 6 °C. The saturated adsorption amount of egg albumin was also increased by the methylation. The flocculating ability of methylated egg albumin was examined with a diatomite suspension at 6 and 30 °C in the pH range from pH 2 to pH 11. The diatomite suspension was effectively flocculated by the addition of small amount of methylated egg albumin (only 0. 5 - 1 wt-% against diatomite) over a wide pH range from pH 3 to pH 10...|$|E
