6000|$|This is {{the most}} elegant and, for small craft, the most <b>manageable</b> <b>vessel</b> that floats. Its {{proportions}} are more agreeable to the eye than those of any other species of craft, and its rig is in favour with owners of yachts,--especially with those whose yachts are large. The schooner's distinctive peculiarities are, that it carries two masts, which usually [...] "rake aft," [...] or lean back a good deal; and its rig is chiefly fore-and-aft, like the sloop. Of the two masts, the after one is the main-mast. The other is termed the fore-mast. The sails of a schooner are--the main-sail and the gaff, on the main-mast; the fore-sail, fore-top-sail, and fore-top-gallant-sail (the two last being square sails), on the foremast. In front of the fore-mast are the staysail, the jib, and the flying-jib; these last are triangular sails. If a schooner were cut in two in the middle, cross-wise, the front portion would be in all respects a sloop with a square top-sail; the stern part {{would also be a}} sloop, minus the bowsprit and the triangular sails before the mast. Schooners sometimes carry a large square-sail, which is spread when the wind is [...] "dead aft." [...] They are much used in the coasting-trade; and one of their great advantages is that they can be worked with fewer [...] "hands" [...] than sloops of the same size.|$|E
50|$|The Sewalls {{had begun}} {{building}} very large Down Easters in 1869. Beginning with {{the launch of}} the Rappahannock, they built a series of 300 foot, 3,000 tonners. The Rappahannock was a full rigged 3-masted ship, and the Sewalls realized that at this size a fourth mast was needed to make the rig <b>manageable.</b> Subsequent <b>vessels</b> were rigged as 4-masted barks, with a fore-and-aft rigged fourth mast. These were at the limit of wooden ship size, and for this reason they switched to the British practice of building with steel. The after mast was called the jigger, and since it was fore-and-aft rigged like a bark's mizzen, these vessels were commonly called four masted barks.The history of the name Downeaster derives from the fact that these ships were designed for trade between Maine and Boston where the ships generally sailed downwind and easterly on the trip to Maine.|$|R
