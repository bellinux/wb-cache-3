30|$|Microrobotic {{transportation}} has two advantages {{when compared}} to tools such as optical tweezers, optically induced dielectrophoresis (ODEP), and <b>micromanipulators.</b> First, microrobotic transportation does not rely on the optical properties or chemistry of the target objects and the surrounding medium. In contrast, optical tweezers require a refractive index difference between the objects and medium [6]. The medium properties can {{also play a role}} in ODEP manipulation, as the electrical conductivity of the medium can affect the electric field gradients that create the dielectrophoretic force [7]. Secondly, although the most widely used <b>micromanipulators</b> can achieve high velocities during manipulation, their throughput is still limited [8], as this is a serial form of manipulation. Parallel operation of multiple <b>micromanipulators</b> is limited by the working space, due to the macroscale components of the <b>micromanipulators.</b> In contrast, the parallel transportation of microrobots has been demonstrated [1],[9]-[15].|$|R

50|$|The manual {{position}} control {{in this case}} was replaced by a computer controlled piezoelectric <b>micromanipulator</b> that moved the pipette in discrete 2-3μm steps into the tissue until it made contact with a cell.

50|$|The {{inchworm}} motor {{can be used}} in {{the patch}} clamping of biological cells. This technique is most often performed with an optical microscope and <b>micromanipulator</b> holding a glass pipette. The inchworm motor is particularly ideal in patch clamping because it provides the operator with virtually an instantaneous, precise, smooth and predictable motion without drift.|$|E
50|$|Crosses are {{performed}} between haploid MATa and MATα mating strains, then the resulting diploids are transferred to sporulation media {{to form a}} tetrad containing four haploid spores. Tetrads can then be prepared with Zymolyase, or another enzyme, to digest {{the wall of the}} ascus. The spores are then separated with a <b>micromanipulator</b> needle and deposited in separate positions on a petri dish.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} {{requirements}} that an IVF lab need to correctly perform ICSI technique. There are basically 5 main elements: laminar flow cabinet, inverted microscope, <b>micromanipulators,</b> microinjectors and anti-vibration table.|$|R
50|$|<b>Micromanipulators</b> {{are usually}} used in {{conjunction}} with microscopes. Depending on the application, one or more <b>micromanipulators</b> may be fitted to a microscope stage or rigidly mounted to a bench next to a microscope. A typical application of micromanipulation is human intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Here, a spermatozoon measuring some 3 to 5 micrometres across is injected into an oocyte of approximately 100 micrometres in diameter, under the direct manual control of an embryologist. A disposable glass micropipette is fitted to a toolholder mounted on the output of the manipulator. The toolholder can be adjusted for different sized tools as well as the angle at which the tool is held.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{equipment}} needed to record single units is microelectrodes, amplifiers, <b>micromanipulators</b> and recording devices. The type of microelectrode used {{will depend on}} the application. The high resistance of these electrodes creates a problem during signal amplification. If it were connected to a conventional amplifier with low input resistance, there would be a large potential drop across the microelectrode and the amplifier would only measure {{a small portion of the}} true potential. To solve this problem, a cathode follower amplifier must be used as an impedance matching device to collect the voltage and feed it to a conventional amplifier. To record from a single neuron, <b>micromanipulators</b> must be used to precisely insert an electrode into the brain. This is especially important for intracellular single-unit recording.|$|R
50|$|Boris {{started his}} {{scientific}} {{training as a}} Russian émigré in 1920. He studied the initiation and regulation of embryological processes by intracellular and extracellular factors. A major strand of his early research concerned the effect of temperature {{on the development of}} fertilized sea urchin eggs. In this work he used a <b>micromanipulator,</b> which was developed by Robert Chambers, an American biologist.|$|E
50|$|Seifriz was {{a naturalist}} and a {{laboratory}} scientist {{who studied the}} viscoelastic properties and microscopic structure of protoplasm. Using a <b>micromanipulator</b> and microdissection, Seifriz showed that protoplasm was non-Newtonian, thixotropic and elastic. Seifriz proposed that the physical properties of protoplasm were a consequence of long chain molecules attached to one another like a brush heap. Seifriz studied the streaming protoplasm of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum and coined the word, protoplasmatologist for someone who studies the properties of living protoplasm. Seifriz' expertise ranged from physics to philosophy. Seifriz's work appeared in Time Magazine.|$|E
50|$|At {{the age of}} 22, {{he bought}} a {{rudimentary}} machine shop from the estate of a local inventor. He moved the equipment to a small warehouse in Harvard Square, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he built research apparatus for professors and researchers of Boston-area medical schools, and produced many inventions over the following years. In 1928, he designed a Barcroft-Warburg apparatus for tissue respiration studies. In 1930, he designed {{a new type of}} <b>micromanipulator</b> which was valuable in early physiology studies and later saw use in assembly of electronic components. In 1931, Emerson developed an oxygen tent which incorporated an improved cooling system.|$|E
30|$|The {{morphology}} of the NWs {{was investigated}} by electron microscopies: {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). To perform the HRTEM experiments, the NWs were cleaved with <b>micromanipulators</b> in the chamber equipped with a focus ion beam machine and transfer into holey grids covered with a very thin carbon layer.|$|R
40|$|Geckos {{have the}} {{extraordinary}} ability {{to prevent their}} sticky feet from fouling while running on dusty walls and ceilings. Understanding gecko adhesion and self-cleaning mechanisms is essential for elucidating animal behaviours and rationally designing gecko-inspired devices. Here we report a unique self-cleaning mechanism possessed by the nano-pads of gecko spatulae. The difference between the velocity-dependent particle-wall adhesion and the velocity-independent spatula-particle dynamic response leads to a robust self-cleaning capability, allowing geckos to efficiently dislodge dirt during their locomotion. Emulating this natural design, we fabricate artificial spatulae and <b>micromanipulators</b> that show similar effects, and that provide {{a new way to}} manipulate micro-objects. By simply tuning the pull-off velocity, our gecko-inspired <b>micromanipulators,</b> made of synthetic microfibers with graphene-decorated micro-pads, can easily pick up, transport, and drop-off microparticles for precise assembling. This work should {{open the door to the}} development of novel self-cleanin...|$|R

50|$|The {{colloidal}} probes {{are normally}} fabricated by gluing a colloidal particle to a tip-less cantilever with a <b>micromanipulator</b> in air. The subsequent rewetting of the probe {{may lead to}} the formation of nanosized bubbles on the probe surface. This problem can be avoided by attaching the colloidal particles under wet conditions in AFM fluid cell to appropriately functionalized cantilevers. While the colloidal probe technique is mostly utilized in the sphere-plane geometry, it can be also used in the sphere-sphere geometry. The latter geometry further requires a lateral centering of the two particles, which can be either achieved with an optical microscope or an AFM scan. The results obtained in these two different geometries can be related with the Derjaguin approximation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>micromanipulator</b> is {{a device}} {{which is used}} to {{physically}} interact with a sample under a microscope, where a level of precision of movement is necessary that cannot be achieved by the unaided human hand. It may typically consist of an input joystick, a mechanism for reducing the range of movement and an output section with the means of holding a microtool to hold, inject, cut or otherwise manipulate the object as required. The mechanism for reducing the movement usually requires the movement to be free of backlash. This is achieved by the use of kinematic constraints to allow each part of the mechanism to move only in one or more chosen degrees of freedom, which achieves a high precision and repeatability of movement, usually at the expense of some absolute accuracy.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} is done {{under a microscope}} using multiple micromanipulation devices (<b>micromanipulator,</b> microinjectors and micropipettes). A holding pipette stabilizes the mature oocyte with gentle suction applied by a microinjector. From the opposite side a thin, hollow glass micropipette is used to collect a single sperm, having immobilised it by cutting its tail with {{the point of the}} micropipette. The oocyte is pierced through the oolemma and directed to the inner part of the oocyte (cytoplasm). The sperm is then released into the oocyte. The pictured oocyte has an extruded polar body at about 12 o'clock indicating its maturity. The polar body is positioned at the 12 or 6 o'clock position, to ensure that the inserted micropipette does not disrupt the spindle inside the egg. After the procedure, the oocyte will be placed into cell culture and checked on the following day for signs of fertilization.|$|E

However, instruments have since been developed specifically for tetrad dissection; the most advanced allow easy and semi-automated separation of tetrads http://www.singerinstruments.co.uk [...] Most <b>micromanipulators</b> use a glass fiber needle to which the spores adhere due to the formation of a water meniscus between the agar and the needle.|$|R

50|$|The {{technician}} traditionally {{used their}} mouth {{to provide the}} precise pressures required to seal it to the cell. In addition to controlling the pressure, the technician must also position the pipette at precisely the correct distance from the cell so that the membrane will seal with it. Using a <b>micromanipulator,</b> the pipette is moved towards the cell until the technician sees {{a change in the}} electrical resistance between the fluid inside of the pipette and the surrounding fluid (see animation). This typically requires 3-12 months of training before a technician is able to reliably record from cells. The technician is essentially performing a balancing act trying to watch and manipulate several systems simultaneously (motion, pressure, and electrical signals). Unless each portion of the process is performed accurately and with the right timing, the seal will not be formed properly and the technician will have to replace the pipette and start over.|$|E
50|$|There {{are mainly}} two methods for loading samples onto FD emitters: the emitter-dipping {{technique}} and the syringe technique. Emitter-dipping technique {{is simple and}} commonly used in most laboratories. In this technique, the solid samples are dissolved or suspended in a suitable medium, and then an activated emitter (usually a tungsten wire with many microneedles) is dipped into the solution and drawn out again. When the wire {{is removed from the}} solution, the solution of a volume about 10−2 μl adheres to the microneedles (an average length of 30 μm) or remains between them. The other technique, syringe technique, applies to the compounds which are less concentrated than 10−5 M. A droplet of the solution from a microsyringe which is fitted to a <b>micromanipulator</b> is deposited uniformly on the microneedles. After evaporation of the solvent, the procedure for the two techniques can be repeated several times to load more samples. The syringe technique has the advantage that measured volumes of the solution can be accurately dispensed on the center of the wire.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two basic}} types of {{microinjection}} systems. The first is called a constant flow system {{and the second is}} called a pulsed flow system. In a constant flow system, which is relatively simple and inexpensive though clumsy and outdated, a constant flow of a sample is delivered from a micropipette and the amount of the sample which is injected is determined by how long the needle remains in the cell. This system typically requires a regulated pressure source, a capillary holder, and either a coarse or a fine <b>micromanipulator.</b> A pulsed flow system, however, allows for greater control and consistency over the amount of sample injected: the most common arrangement for intracytoplasmic sperm injection includes an Eppendorf [...] "Femtojet" [...] injector coupled with an Eppendorf [...] "InjectMan", though procedures involving other targets usually take advantage of much less expensive equipment of similar capability. Because of its increased control over needle placement and movement and in addition to the increased precision over the volume of substance delivered, the pulsed flow technique usually results in less damage to the receiving cell than the constant flow technique. However, the Eppendorf line, at least, has a complex user interface and its particular system components are usually much more expensive than those necessary to create a constant flow system or than other pulsed flow injection systems.|$|E
40|$|For {{biological}} experiments requiring manipulations under a microscope, it {{is necessary}} to have remote control for the manipulator. Available systems offer the required accuracy at a high cost. Passive <b>micromanipulators</b> are economical but are deficient in performance, the most serious defects being the inability to attenuate operator-induced vibrations and lack of speed control The manipulator described in this paper provides versatile remote control and may be constructed economically...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Micromanipulators.</b> They {{allow us}} to move in three dimensions, so {{that there will be}} one on the left to control the holding of the {{micropipette}} and another to the right for the injection micropipette. In addition, there is an electric manipulator for large movements and an hydraulic one for the finest (adjustment of the pipettes is done with the hydraulic and quick movements to place them with the electric).|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{contribution}} to the development of simple <b>micromanipulators,</b> having high resolution and several degrees-of-freedom, dedicated to the manipulation of miniature objects, the manipulation of biological specimens or to the assembly of microsystems. The actuators for these <b>micromanipulators</b> must have a submicronic resolution over displacements of a few centimeters at a speed of several millimeters per second. They must also be compact and rigid in order ease their integration and to have a high rejection of the external perturbations (vibrations, temperature changes, etc.). Stick and slip actuators studied in this work fulfil very well these requirements. Their main features are: a resolution better than 5 nm over strokes of a few centimeters at a speed of several millimeters per second (2 - 5 mm/s); a high rigidity (6. 5 N/μm) giving an excellent rejection of external perturbations; an extreme simplicity obtained by the combination of the guiding and actuating functions and by using an innovative concept of monolithic flexible structures. This report presents all the stages of our research work: the state of the art: originally, stick and slip actuators have been developed for the scanning probe microscopy (STM or AFM). We have adapted this concept to our purposes. Several innovative solutions allow us to simplify and improve significantly these actuators; the modeling: it allows us to understand in details the behavior of stick and slip actuators and to optimize them; the study of scaling down: it demonstrates that stick and slip actuators can be miniaturized. New applications in the field of microsystems are therefore promising; the experiment: the characterization of a one-degree-of-freedom actuator demonstrates its performances and validates our modeling; the-implementation-and-tests-of-severa 1 micro-mani. pulators-actuated-by-stick and slip confirm the pertinence of our approach; The results of this thesis will help engineers to design and implement efficient <b>micromanipulators</b> using stick and slip actuators...|$|R
