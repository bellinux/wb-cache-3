40|$|Previous {{research}} on meat demand has generally used highly aggregated data (across time, products and consumers). However, <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> across species are likely stronger substitutes than some {{products from the}} same species.

This study uses monthly consumer panel data collected between 1992 and 2000 to estimate a disaggregated <b>meat</b> <b>product</b> demand system. The use of the expectations maximization algorithm is introduced to estimate a demand system that adjusts for the econometric problem of censored data resulting from purchased shares of some products by individuals often being equal to zero.

Three <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> are included, cattle, chicken and pork, and three pollutants generating environmental damages; green house gases, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The calculated unit taxes on <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> correspond to 28 %, 26 %, and 40 % of the price per kg of beef, pork, and poultry in 2009. Consumer responses to the taxes are calculated by means of econometric estimates of a linear demand system of the <b>meat</b> <b>products.</b> The results indicate relatively high own price and income elasticities of the <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> and complementarity in consumption. A simultaneous introduction of taxes on all three <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> can decrease emission of GHG, nitrogen, phosphorus and ammonia by at least 27 %.

The significant expansion of the fast food industry and the increase {{consumption of}} processed <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> makes it necessary for a re-evaluation of the nutritional quality of popular <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> currently available in the market. This review paper described the quality of some processed <b>meat</b> <b>products,</b> their proximate composition, meat quality, use of non meat proteins and binders, and the use of additives in the formulation of burgers, frankfurters, nuggets, bologna, chicken and beef balls. Preliminary results on the protein efficiency ratio of local <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> seemed favourable but this study is limited to only one laboratory.

40|$|Reformed and {{restructured}} meat {{are two major}} categories of processed <b>meat</b> <b>products.</b> Reformed <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> require intact <b>meat</b> pieces to bind together while restructured <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> are extensively minced prior to restructuring. Salts such as sodium chloride and phosphates together with mechanical treatment and heat, {{have been used to}} bind meat pieces together. In the process the proteins in muscle become soluble, bind large amounts of water and gel on heating. While heat-induced gelation of soluble meat protein provides binding in reformed <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> and reduces cook losses in restructured <b>meat</b> <b>products,</b> no binding occurs in raw meat systems. Non-meat proteins, especially soya protein, are routinely used in processed <b>meat</b> <b>products,</b> often in conjunction with salts, to increase water and fat binding during the cooking process. However, such proteins do not bind intact meat pieces in either the raw or cooked state. Transglutaminase (TGase) is a food-grade commercially available enzyme which can crosslink suitable proteins leading to the formation of a protein matrix (gel) and immobilisation of large quantities of water. This property could improve the water-binding properties of non-meat proteins in restructured <b>meat</b> <b>products.</b> The prospect of crosslinking native meat proteins and non-meat proteins or native meat proteins on adjacent meat pieces would make salt-free reformed <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> a realistic objective.
