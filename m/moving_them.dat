5|$|At {{about this}} time there was a serious {{disagreement}} between Jack Hammond and Robert Sherwood, which resulted in Hammond removing all his horses, including St. Gatien from Sherwood's stable and <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> across Newmarket to the Middleton Cottage stable of James Waugh.|$|E
5|$|Among moths with deimatic behaviour, the {{eyed hawkmoth}} (Smerinthus ocellatus) {{displays}} its large eyespots, <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> slowly {{as if it}} were a vertebrate predator such as an owl. Among butterflies, the peacock butterfly Aglais io is a cryptic leaf mimic with wings closed, but displays 4 conspicuous eyespots when disturbed, in a display effective against insectivorous birds (flycatchers).|$|E
5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the setup time to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E

5|$|In 6BC, on {{the verge}} of {{accepting}} command in the East and becoming the second most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to Rhodes. The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear. Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa Gaius and Lucius, and seemed to be <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.|$|E
5|$|Pile and her co-writers {{initially}} used {{battery packs}} to represent characters, <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> around {{on her desk}} to develop scenarios for the show. The decision to make the characters doctors came later. Pile recalls that she mentioned to Peter Fincham that a hospital setting would work well and that he subsequently reported that Channel 4 were enthusiastic about a hospital location, which settled the matter. Even later still, a plot was developed and wall charts were used to mark up story arcs.|$|E
5|$|To reach {{all points}} {{designated}} by the Admiralty for longitude measurements, it was sometimes necessary to take chronometers ashore, across inlets and up rivers too shallow for the ship. This put the chronometers at risk and the disturbance of <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> affected their accuracy. This was another reason for survey ships to carry a large number – most {{of them could be}} kept permanently in a safe, well-cushioned place on the main vessel.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other diurnal primates, {{which usually}} carry their infants with them, ruffed lemur mothers will stash their young by concealing {{them in the}} canopy foliage, leaving them to rest and sit quietly for several hours while she forages and {{performs}} other activities. Mothers continue to transport their offspring by mouth, <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> {{one at a time}} by grasping the infant's belly crosswise. This form of transport usually stops around 2.5 months of age when the infants become too heavy to carry.|$|E
5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> in and out of production.|$|E
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E

5|$|In Cuba, {{slightly}} over 228,000 residents were evacuated from low-lying areas before the storm. Around 10% stayed in temporary shelters, {{while the rest}} stayed with family or friends. Included in the evacuation total were 6,000 tourists and over 1,000 residents in rickety houses. Workers protected tobacco leaves by <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> to sealed warehouses, and transported cattle and livestock to higher ground. The hurricane forced the closure of schools and the cancellation of some flights. The Cuban government issued a Hurricane Watch for Pinar del Río Province, Havana, Havana Province, and Isla de la Juventud 21hours before Irene hit. These areas, along with Matanzas Province, were upgraded to a Hurricane Warning 15hours before Irene hit the area.|$|E
5|$|In Quincy Newspapers' {{acquisition}} of Granite Broadcasting's remaining stations, the acquisition was briefly re-structured to have Malara Broadcast Group—which {{served as a}} virtual duopoly partner for Granite with WISE-TV (NBC) Fort Wayne and KDLH-TV Duluth (CBS), retain the stations and their current agreements with WPTA and KBJR-TV in lieu of having them sold to SagamoreHill Broadcasting. The acquisition was restructured in July 2015 to, again, have SagamoreHill Broadcasting acquire the two stations, but have their current SSAs wound down within nine months. Following {{the end of the}} SSA, the two stations retained The CW as independently-run stations, with their remaining affiliations moved to subchannels of KBJR and WPTA. Quincy similarly wound down an SSA in Peoria, Illinois with Sinclair-owned WHOI by acquiring rights to its ABC and CW programming, and <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> to subchannels of WEEK-TV, in exchange for giving up its Fox affiliation for WSJV-TV in South Bend to Sinclair's WSBT-TV.|$|E
5|$|In the {{unsuccessful}} Lillehammer {{bid for the}} 1992 Winter Olympics, {{ice hockey}} events were proposed played in Hamar and Gjøvik. However, in the Lillehammer bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, all ice events were moved to Lillehammer proper, after recommendations from the International Ice Hockey Federation, who wanted all the ice hockey events {{to take place in}} the same town. This would involve building two temporary ice rinks at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, and after the Olympics <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> to Gjøvik and either Moelv, Brumunddal or Kongsvinger. By 1989, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to include short-track speed skating, increasing the number of ice halls from two to three. In April, the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) therefore proposed building permanent ice rinks in Hamar and Gjøvik.|$|E

5|$|Tank is an arcade game {{developed}} by Kee Games, {{a subsidiary of}} Atari, and released in November 1974. It was the only original title not based on an existing Atari property {{developed by}} Kee Games, which was founded to sell clones of Atari games to distributors as a fake competitor prior to the merger of the two companies. In the game, two players drive tanks through a maze viewed from above while attempting to shoot each other and avoid mines, represented by X marks, in a central minefield. Each player controls their tank {{with a pair of}} joysticks, <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> forwards and back to drive, reverse, and steer, and firing shells with a button to attempt to destroy the other tank. The destruction of a tank from a mine or shell earns the opposing player a point, and tanks reappear after being destroyed. The winner is the player with more points when time runs out, with each game typically one or two minutes long.|$|E
5|$|The conference {{began in}} the evening of September 29, 1920. The Polish {{delegation}} was led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz (who originated from Lithuania), and the Lithuanian delegation by general Maksimas Katche. Lithuania proposed an immediate armistice, but the Polish delegation refused. Only after the Lithuanian delegation threatened to leave the negotiation table did Poland agree to stop fighting, but only {{to the east of}} the Neman River (the Suwałki Region). Fighting {{to the west of the}} river continued. The Polish delegates demanded that the Lithuanians allow the Polish forces to use a portion of the Warsaw– Saint Petersburg Railway and the train station in Varėna (Orany). The Lithuanians refused: their major forces were concentrated in the Suwałki Region and <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> to protect Vilnius without the railway would be extremely difficult. The Lithuanian side was ready to give up the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of the Lithuanian claims to Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|Under Henry III, Richard, the 1st Earl of Cornwall was {{formally}} granted the castle as his main residence in 1231. Richard lived in considerable style, and spent substantial sums on the property, {{building a new}} hall and more luxurious fittings. Richard's election as King of the Romans in 1251 brought an end to {{his use of the}} property, but the castle became embroiled in the Second Barons' War in the 1260s. Simon de Montfort seized the castle after his victory at the battle of Lewes, using it to imprison the royal family for a time, before <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> to the more secure Kenilworth Castle. Reclaimed by Henry III {{at the end of the}} conflict, it continued to be used by the Earls of Cornwall as a luxurious home for the rest of the century.|$|E

5|$|American {{involvement}} in the Everglades began during the Second Seminole War (1836–42), a costly and very unpopular conflict. The United States spent between $30million and $40million and lost between 1,500 and 3,000lives. The U.S. military drove the Seminoles into the Everglades and were charged {{with the task of}} finding them, defeating them, and <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> to Oklahoma Indian territory. Almost 4,000Seminoles were killed in the war or were removed. The U.S. military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found in the Everglades. They tore their clothes on sawgrass, ruined their boots on the uneven limestone floor, and were plagued by mosquitoes. Soldiers' legs, feet, and arms were cut open on the sawgrass and gangrene infection set in, taking many lives and limbs. Many died of mosquito-borne illness. After slogging through mud, one private died in his tracks of exhaustion in 1842. General Thomas Jesup admitted the military was overwhelmed by the terrain when he wrote to the Secretary of War in 1838, trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war.|$|E
5|$|The RPF were {{in disarray}} {{by the time}} Kagame arrived, with troop morale very low. He later {{described}} the experience of meeting and taking charge of this demoralised and wounded group {{as one of the}} worst experiences of his life. He spent the following weeks with the senior officers gathering intelligence. By the end of October, with the RPF forced back to the Ugandan border, Kagame decided it was futile to continue fighting. He therefore withdrew most of the army from northeastern Rwanda, <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> to the Virunga mountains. Some soldiers remained behind as a decoy to carry out small-scale attacks on the FAR, who remained unaware of the RPF's relocation. Kagame knew that the rugged high altitude terrain of the Virungas offered considerable protection from attacks, even if the RPF were discovered there. The trek west took almost a week, and the soldiers crossed the border into Uganda several times, with the permission of President Museveni, taking advantage of personal friendships between the RPF soldiers and their ex-colleagues in the Ugandan army.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of <b>moving</b> <b>them</b> with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E
