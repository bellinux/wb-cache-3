5|$|There is some {{controversy}} concerning the widely reported imbalance of the game, as the rules strongly favor the king, {{although there are}} several rule modifications that can produce <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> play, such as a weaponless king (the king cannot participate in captures), escape to the corners (rather than to the edges), or hostile attacker camps (the king and defenders may be captured against a vacant attacker camp square). Schmittberger (1992) even reveals some workarounds to produce <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> play without modifying the rules of gameplay.|$|E
5|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, particularly after de-Stalinization and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> and neutral assessment.|$|E

Soon after Tsang's re-election as Chief Executive, on 26 March, the Government pressed ahead with plans to dismantle and move the entire pier, piece by piece, enabling the reclamation to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} {{slightly}} <b>more</b> <b>balanced,</b> featuring two running backs who had success throughout the regular season. Maurice Williams rushed the ball 166 times for 1,029yards and sixtouchdowns {{during the regular}} season, and Eddie Hunter contributed 872rushing yards. Through the air, Tech quarterback Erik Chapman passed for 1,627yards and 10touchdowns during the season prior to the Peach Bowl, making him the most prolific Virginia Tech passer in the nine-year tenure of Tech head Coach Bill Dooley.|$|E
5|$|Northern England has {{a strong}} export-based economy, with trade <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> than the UK average, and the North East is the only region of England to {{regularly}} export more than it imports. Chemicals, vehicles, machinery and other manufactured goods make {{up the majority of}} Northern exports, just over half of which go to other EU countries. Major manufacturing plants include car plants at Vauxhall Ellesmere Port, Jaguar Land Rover Halewood and Nissan Sunderland, the Leyland Trucks factory, the Hitachi Newton Aycliffe train plant, the Humber, Lindsey and Stanlow oil refineries, the NEPIC cluster of chemical works based around Teesside, and the nuclear processing facilities at Springfields and Sellafield.|$|E

5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would seem very rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a local}} {{perception}} that Shepton Mallet has been in economic decline for some time. Some 350 manufacturing jobs {{were lost in the}} late 1990s and early years of the 21st century. However, the District Council asserts that, despite the loss of the manufacturing jobs on which Shepton Mallet has been historically dependent, more jobs in distribution, business services and public administration, health, education, quarrying, construction and hi-tech services (from companies such as the ISP Easynet) have been created, thereby creating a <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> economy. In 2001, there were slightly more jobs in the town than economically active people, resulting in a small in-flow of workers.|$|E
5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, {{the mean number of}} patients being treated in hospice facilities on any given day was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E

5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E
5|$|Poole's {{economy is}} <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> {{than the rest}} of Dorset. In the 1960s {{prosperity}} was fuelled by growth in the manufacturing sector, whereas the 1980s and 1990s saw expansion in the service sector as office based employers relocated to the area. The importance of manufacturing has declined since the 1960s but still employed approximately 17% of the workforce in 2002 and remains more prominent than in the economy of Great Britain as a whole. Sunseeker, the world's largest privately owned builder of motor yachts and the UK's largest manufacturer, is based in Poole and employs over 1,800 people in its Poole shipyards. Other major employers in the local manufacturing industry include Faerch Plast, Hamworthy Heating, Hamworthy Combustion, Lush, Mathmos, Kerry Foods, Transmission Developments, Eurac, Siemens, Southernprint and Ryvita. Poole has the largest number of industrial estates in South East Dorset, including the Nuffield Industrial estate, Mannings Heath, Arena Business Park, Poole Trade Park and the Branksome Business Centre.|$|E
5|$|Project M {{first began}} as a {{development}} project to rework the character Falco to play like he did in Melee. The designers' goal {{at the time was}} for the game to be accessible to newcomers and encourage people to get better at the game, which was accomplished by creating a character roster that is <b>more</b> <b>balanced.</b> The mod's first demo was announced on January 15, 2011, with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament, where it was featured. It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Brawl, as well as new stages Brawl had not included. It was later given a solid date of February 7, 2011. A patch was later created to fix the demo's bugs and fine-tune the player's control of their movement direction after being attacked.|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{using the}} PECE {{algorithm}} (Fig.  8), the energies {{of the network}} ran out at about the 1700 th round, and the PECE algorithm could keep more time and <b>more</b> <b>balance</b> of energy consumption than LEACH and PEGASIS; the nodes are more energy-efficient.|$|R

This {{is because the}} horse is slightly bent {{in the direction of}} movement in the half-pass. In the leg-yield, the horse is fairly straight or looking slightly away from the direction of travel.|$|R
5|$|As {{predicted}} by analysts, the team easily secured a {{berth in the}} 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3–2, advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals {{for the first time}} in franchise history. Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell, the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie. Toronto was the <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim. Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting, after a 39-point performance in Game 6. Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs.|$|E
