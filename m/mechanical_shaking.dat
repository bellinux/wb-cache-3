40|$|D-amygdalin is a toxic {{compound}} {{found in the}} kernels of some bitter almond cultivars. This compound is toxic because of its potential to release poisonous hydrogen cyanide. The D-amygdalin contents of the kernels of 18 commercial almond cultivars (Prunus dulcis Mill. = Amygdalus communis L.) and three wild genotypes (Amygdalus webbii Spach.) were determined by HPLC. In initial tests, two extraction procedures [100 % (v/v) methanol or 4 % (w/v) citric acid) ], two different kernel cutting sizes (powdered or roughly-cut pieces), and two shaking techniques (<b>mechanical</b> <b>shaking</b> or sonication) were assessed.

The <b>mechanical</b> <b>shaking</b> of tree branches is one of the widely studied and used techniques for harvesting small tree fruit crops like cherries. To automate the branch shaking operation, different methods of detecting branches and cherries in full foliage canopies of the cherry tree have been developed previously. The next step in this process is the localization of shaking positions in the detected tree branches for <b>mechanical</b> <b>shaking.</b> In this study, a method of locating shaking positions for automated cherry harvesting was developed based on branch and cherry pixel locations determined using RGB images and 3 D camera images. First, branch and cherry regions were located in 2 D RGB images. Depth information provided by a 3 D camera was then mapped on to the RGB images using a standard stereo calibration method. The overall root mean square error in estimating the distance to desired shaking points was 0. 064 m. Cherry trees trained in two different canopy architectures, Y-trellis and vertical trellis systems, were used in this study. Harvesting testing was carried out by shaking tree branches at the locations selected by the algorithm. For the Y-trellis system, the maximum fruit removal efficiency of 92. 9 % was achieved using up to five shaking events per branch. However, maximum fruit removal efficiency for the vertical trellis system was 86. 6 % with up to four shakings per branch.

40|$|The stimuli-induced {{gelation}} of a urethane-functionalized ditopic ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) compound is presented, and {{the mechanism}} by which the gelation proceeds is proposed. In a 40 – 120 mM solution in chloroform, the compound can exist in two different aggregated states, namely a low viscous mixture of (cyclic) oligomers or a fibrous gel. As evidenced by IR, NMR, and WAXS, the liquid state is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the UPy and the back-folded chain, while the fibrous gel is stabilized by lateral hydrogen bonds within stacked UPy dimers. Controlled preparation techniques allow for pathway selection to arrive at one of both states. The remarkable long-term stability of the low viscous state (over 2 months for a 80 mM solution) {{is in contrast to}} the fast transformation into a gel by stirring in a few hours. Other <b>mechanical</b> stimuli like <b>shaking,</b> sonicating, and stirring for a shorter period, as well as freezing and thawing the solution, yield weaker gels than those obtained by long stirring. Heating the gels and slow cooling reversibly yield the nonviscous solution. This shows that the formation of UPy–urethane hydrogen bonds kinetically traps the UPy polymers, thereby preventing their lateral aggregation. The application of mechanical stress or freezing disrupts this interaction, allowing for the formation of a stacked nucleus on which further material can grow, eventually leading to gelation of the solution...|$|R
40|$|The article {{acknowledges}} {{the formation of}} bacterial biofilms in strains of bacteria species Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae when grown in liquid media {{under the influence of}} negative factors (chemical factor) — containing agents. Biofilms, as a community of microorganisms cause many chronic infections (meningitis, inflammatory diseases of the oral cavity, urogenital infections) and create problems in the industry (fouling of processing equipment, ship hulls, oil platforms, biocorrosion metal products). Ordinary disinfectants, such as chlorine and sodium chlorite, can not remove the biofilm, so finding an effective means of dealing with them is enough actual problem. Various antibacterial agents are ineffective in combating biofilms, since bacteria produce large amounts of polysaccharides — substances that help the colony stay without disintegration. Polysaccharide serves as a barrier layer for substances in water, including for biocides. This is the main reason for the survival of microorganisms even in the heavily chlorinated water. In the study the latest data took into account on the subject, especially concerning adverse effects of oxygen on the growth of bacterial cells and directs action as a factor in the formation of biofilms. In our study we analyzed the latest generation disinfectant as an influencing factor. Working concentrations were shown in three embodiments. The number of strains studied was 6 (3 strains of each species). All strains were obtained from the Department of Museum MVE and VSE Ulyanovsk State Agricultural Academy n. a. P. A. Stolypin.

40|$|Intensive tillage and {{monoculture}} cropping practices reduce soil C accumulation hence increasing soil {{vulnerability to}} chemical, physical and biological degradation. This study focussed on enhancing biomass production of wheat and oat winter cover crops {{as a means}} of increasing C sequestration in the low organic C soils of the central part of Eastern Cape Province. The specific objectives were (i) to evaluate the short-term effects of no till and cereal-fallow based crop rotations on; soil organic matter related parameters, pH and electrical conductivity, (ii) soil bulk density, water retention and aggregate stability, (iii) soil microbial biomass C and N, mineralizable N, soil respiration, and dehydrogenase enzyme activity, (iv) grain yield, soil nutrient concentration (N, P and K) and their uptake by maize, and (v) to identify soil parameters with high sensitivity to tillage under maize-fallow-maize, maize-wheat-maize and maize-oat-maize rotational cover cropping practices. The experiment was laid out as a split-plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates. Tillage treatments (CT and NT) were applied on the main plots which measured 8 × 18 m while crop rotation treatments were applied in the subplots which measured 8 × 6 m. The rotation treatments were maize-fallow-maize (MFM), maize-wheat-maize (MWM) and maize-oat-maize (MOM). Weed control in NT plots involved preplant application of glyphosate to control mainly the grass weeds while post emergence weed management was done using Atrazine (485 atrazine and 15 g l- 1 triazines). Initial weed control in CT plots was achieved through ploughing to a depth of 20 cm followed by disking while post emergence weed iii management was done by hand hoeing. Soil parameters measured were; (i) particulate organic matter (POM), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), pH and electrical conductivity (EC), (ii) soil bulk density (b), moisture at field capacity (FC), aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) determined by fast wetting (FW), slow wetting (SW), <b>mechanical</b> breakdown by <b>shaking</b> (MB) and the stability index (SI), (iii) soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), mineralizable N (MN), soil respiration (SR), and dehydrogenase enzyme activity (DHEA). No-till increased POM and TN compared to CT in Lenye and Burnshill, respectively. The MWM and the MOM rotations increased TN relative to the MFM rotation in Lenye. The MWM and MOM rotations enhanced SOC relative to MFM in all sampled soil depths at Burnshill and similar observations were made under MOM rotation in the 5 - 20 cm depth in Lenye. The MWM and MOM rotations tended to depress soil pH relative to the MFM rotation in both sampled soil depths in Lenye while NT reduced soil pH relative to CT on the surface soil layer in Burnshill. Soil EC and pH varied with depth across tillage practices but both parameters remained within the ideal range for successful crop production over the study period. Soil stability index (SI) and aggregate MWD determined by FW, SW and MB were higher in Lenye compared to Burnshill. The MOM rotation enhanced the SI relative to MFM and MWM rotations at both sites. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that more organic C was incorporated into the soil under NT and MOM rotation compared to CT and MFM rotation which had few organic coatings on the soil particles. Microbial properties varied with plant biomass input as influenced by tillage and type of rotational cover crop at both sites. Like in other past studies, NT showed higher levels of MBC, MBN, NM and SR at the soil surface layer compared to CT in Burnshill. No till increased MN iv relative to CT in both sampled soil depths in Lenye and resulted in higher DHEA compared to CT in Burnshill. The MOM rotation increased MBC, MBN, MN relative to MFM rotation especially within surface soil layer. Similar observations were made with respect to MN and SR in both sampled soil layers at Lenye. By contrast, the DHEA was higher under the MFM relative to the MWM and MOM rotations in Lenye but similar under the MFM and MOM rotations in Burnshill. Maize grain yield was not affected by both tillage and crop rotations but varied with cropping season. Comparable grain yields observed under the two tillage practices with similar fertilizer application rates indicated the advantage of NT over CT in saving on labour costs in maize production without compromising yields. High plant biomass retention under NT relative to CT contributed to high soil N and P levels under the former compared to the latter tillage practice especially on soil surface layer at both study sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that soil chemical and biological parameters closely linked to organic matter, namely SOC, MN, MBC and MBN showed the highest sensitivity to tillage and crop rotation treatments. Soil aggregate MWD determined by SW and b were the physical parameters which were highly altered by agronomic management practice. The MWM and MOM rotations were clustered together and clearly separated from the MFM rotation and this observed trend only applied to the 0 - 5 and 5 - 20 cm depths in Lenye site only. No till, MWM and MOM rotations enhanced POM, SOC and TN relative to CT and MFM rotation suggesting these practices have greater potential to improve soil chemical properties compared to intensive tillage and maize monoculture based production practices. Reduced soil b under MOM rotation and improved SI under NT compared to MFM and CT, respectively v indicate that these practices have the potential to improve degraded soils. Although not significantly different, NT values for MBC, MBN, MN, SR and DHEA were higher compared to CT indicating the potential of the practice to improve soil biotic activity relative to conventional tillage practices. No till enhanced surface soil nitrate N and extractable P compared to CT at both sites revealing the long-term potential of NT in improving the supply of these essential plant nutrients compared to CT. Principal component analysis showed that SOC, MN, K, P, MBC, MBN, soil aggregate MWD determined by SW and b were the most sensitive parameters to tillage and crop rotations. Therefore, these parameters could constitute the minimum data set for assessments of the impact of selected CA practices on soil quality attribute...|$|R

The extraction of HBCDs, and subsequent clean-up procedures are similar to those used for polybrominated diphenylethers, and include Soxhlet, homogenisation, <b>mechanical</b> <b>shaking,</b> sulphuric acid treatment and gel-permeation chromatography. Single-quadrupole and ion-trap mass analysers as well as LC separations were optimised using pure and individual HBCD stereoisomers, and determinations were performed using selected ion monitoring (m/z 640. 7) of the [M-H](-) ion. This article presents options for analyte extraction and information regarding instrument optimisation, and demonstrates that LC-MS is a suitable technique for quantifying HBCD stereoisomers in complex environmental matrices.

30|$|In {{the next}} step, the silver {{nanoparticle}} ink was spray-deposited {{on the surface}} of the textured and doped wafer. Within a few minutes, the capillary forces cause the nanoparticles to agglomerate in the deep valleys in between the texture pyramids. This process is enhanced with <b>mechanical</b> <b>shaking</b> of the wafer. At sufficient density, NP form continuous chains. However, a simple touching is not sufficient to assure good inter-particle contact, since NPs are coated with PVP insulating shells (by-product of their synthesis). To remove these, and to form continuous metallic wires by pre-melting, we implemented anneal/sintering in a microwave oven and in a furnace. The microwave sintering [29, 30] was done in a commercial microwave oven operating at 2.46  GHz, with the output power of 80  W. A typical exposure time used was ~ 10  s to selectively heat and sinter the silver nanoparticles into a continuous conducting nanowire network. The furnace sintering was done in a commercial rapid thermal processor (RTP) (RTP- 500, Beijing Eaststar Labs) at temperature of 320  °C and duration of 10  s. The sintering resulted in the formation of well-conducting NNN.|$|E
40|$|Key {{comparison}} CCQM K- 28 {{was undertaken}} {{to assess the}} measurement capabilities for quantitation of (C 4 H 9) 3 Sn+ (TBT) in a prepared marine sediment by National Metrology Institutes (NMIs), which {{are members of the}} Comit 9 Consultatif pour la Quantit 9 de Mati 8 re (CCQM). It follows a previous pilot study, CCQM-P 18. [1, 2] This exercise was sanctioned by the 8 th CCQM meeting, 182 ̆ 01319 April 2002, as an activity of the Inorganic Analysis Working Group and was jointly coordinated by the Institute for National Measurement Standards of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and LGC, UK. Eight NMIs initially indicated their interest, with seven ultimately submitting their results. All NMIs relied on isotope dilution mass spectrometry using a species-specific 117 Sn-enriched TBT standard, which was supplied by LGC. No analytical methodology was prescribed for this study. As a result, a variety of extraction approaches was adopted by the participants, including <b>mechanical</b> <b>shaking,</b> sonication, accelerated solvent extraction, microwave assisted extraction and heating in combination with ethylation and direct sampling. Detection techniques included ICP-MS (coupled to GC or HPLC for the separation of Sn species) and GC-MS. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTCorneocyte {{counting}} is {{a method}} for quantitation and visualization of the desquamating portion of the human stratum corneum. The desquamating portion is removed by rubbing the surface in a detergent solution. The cells are dispersed by detergency and <b>mechanical</b> <b>shaking,</b> stained with an aniline dye mixture and counted in a hemocytometer. Glabrous skin gives a count of 105 cells per sq cm, plantar and scalp counts are higher and forehead skin is significantly lower. In dandruff the scalp count is nearly twice as great as in normal subjects and exceeds three times the normal value in clinically severe cases. High counts are also found from lesions of psoriasis. In addition to enumeration of the total epithelial cell count the proportion of parakeratotic cells can be assessed. Glabrous areas show 2 % or less parakeratotic cells, the forehead 9. 9 % and normal scalp 16 %. In dandruff the proportion exceeds 25 % while in psoriatic lesions up to 60 % of parakeratotic cells are present. Some evidence on the depth organization of the horny layer is possible by serial sampling at the same spot...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} method has been devised for typing Pseudomonas aeruginosa by pyocin production. Pyocins are produced as strains grow overnight in Trypticase soy broth (without glucose) plus 1 % potassium nitrate. Because P. aeruginosa can use nitrate instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, <b>mechanical</b> <b>shaking</b> is not necessary, nor is induction by mitomycin C. Pyocins {{can now be}} produced in screw-cap tubes in a water bath or incubator. A total of 250 strains were tested as possible pyocin indicators, which included 60 strains already used in pyocin-typing systems. The final set contained 18 indicators which were chosen because (i) they had clear positive or clear negative reactions, thus eliminating reactions difficult to read, (ii) they had few zones due to bacteriophage lysis, and (iii) they were most sensitive in differentiating clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. The final typing method was tested in several studies {{and the results were}} clear; thus definitive epidemiological conclusions could be made. Because it is simple to perform and easily automated, the new method should have application in many hospitals; however, it should be used only in carefully planned epidemiological studies. The method and its application are described in detail, and some pitfalls are discussed...|$|E
