The evaluation of these angles becomes challenging during <b>manoeuvres</b> with high <b>load</b> <b>factors,</b> typical for high-performance aircraft. In these conditions, the air data elaboration accuracy is significantly lowered by the sensors’ dynamics.

40|$|Fatigue life is {{a random}} variable. The {{reliability}} of a conservative fatigue life prediction for a component in the helicopter dynamic system thus needs to be substantiated. A standard analytical substantiation method uses averaged <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>loads</b> instead of seeing <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>loads</b> as a random variable whose distribution is estimated with limited precision. This simplification may lead to inaccuracies. A new simulation-based method is developed to conservatively predict fatigue life while also accounting for the full random distribution and uncertainty of <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>loads.</b> Both methods fully account for uncertain fatigue strength but assume that the mission profile is known or can at least be conservatively estimated. Simulations under synthetic but realistic engineering conditions demonstrate that both methods {{may be used for}} accurate substantiation of conservative fatigue life predictions. The simulations also demonstrate that, under the tested conditions, uncertainties from <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>loads</b> may be neglected in fatigue life substantiations as the resulting error is not significant with respect to uncertainties in component fatigue strength.

40|$|Purpose: One key {{variable}} for improving efficiency in freight transport systems {{is to increase}} the load factor; the ratio of the actual load carried to the maximum load that could have been carried. A high <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in transport operations is of interest for several reasons; to lower costs and to reduce environmental impact. Shippers have a large influence on transport operations e. g. through choices concerning packaging, loading and planning. Therefore, it is of interest what opportunities there are for shippers to improve <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Meanwhile, there are few studies focusing on <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Since <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is often one of many aspects examined when discussing wider topics, such as transport efficiency, the research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is dispersed. Thus, it is difficult to get an overview of the subject, in particular to identify opportunities from a shipper’s perspective. To address the lack of overview of research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how specific actors, in particular shippers, can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> {{the purpose of this paper}} is to structure how academic literature has described how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> can be influenced, with a specific focus on the role of shippers. Research approach: An extensive literature search in scholarly journals was performed on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> terms using Summon search tool. A total of 473 articles were identified, where 29 articles discussed <b>factors</b> that influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> (determinants). Literature was categorized according to focus on <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> actor perspective, mode of transport covered, how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is measured and determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Findings and Originality: The literature review identifies determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> within warehousing; order and delivery; packaging and loading; transport operations; information sharing and IT; and regulations. Surprisingly few studies discuss determinants, especially from the perspective of a shipper. The literature review shows a lack of detailed descriptions of determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Also, it is difficult to gain reliable data about <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and consequently also compare results between studies. Suggested research areas include how shippers can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in their transports, detailed descriptions of how determinants influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> performance can be measured; e. g. through standardized measuring methods. This research is unique since it is the first, to our knowledge, review on determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Research impact: This literature review contributes with an overview of the dispersed research on <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> structured according to determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Areas of interest for future research are suggested.

Hence, the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> {{is a measure of}} the extent to which supply and demand are balanced at prevailing prices. The achieved <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> for the industry as a whole conceal marked variations between different type of airliners, with regional carriers at the lower end of the spectrum and charter airlines generally achieving higher <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> than scheduled carriers [8]. The average <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> for individual airline enterprises masks variations between different markets and cabins. Economy cabins achieving higher <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> because customers tend to book further in advance and expect lower levels of seat accessibility than for premium cabins. The average <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> in the airline industry also conceal pronounced daily, weekly and, in particular, seasonal variations.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new {{methodology}} {{for evaluating the}} impact from <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>loads,</b> in the life assessment of the front frame in the RM 12 engine, has been developed.

These indications will facilitate the engineers at GKN Aerospace in future life assessments, not only for the front frame but all static components in the engine. It was found that including the <b>loads,</b> due to <b>manoeuvring</b> of the aircraft, resulted in over twice the damage in the front frame when compared to the damage due to the axial loading induced by differences between the atmospheric pressure and the air pressure within the engine.

40|$|Purpose: Improving the {{efficiency}} of freight transport leads {{to a reduction in}} both costs and emissions. One key aspect of efficient transport is the <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> i. e., the load carried (required capacity) compared to the maximum load that could be carried (available capacity) in a load unit (e. g., a vehicle). Few existing articles discuss <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> from a shipper’s perspective. Also, the concept of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is interpreted in different ways, and there is confusion about what is 100 % full. To achieve a high <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> {{can be seen as a}} balance between required and available capacity. As a step towards identifying opportunities for shippers to improve <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> the purpose of this paper is to structure the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> concept based on the balance between required and available capacity. Research Approach: A conceptual model was developed based on the literature. This model was applied in the typical case of a shipper outsourcing freight transport. The data collection consisted of several semi-structured interviews with people in logistics and transport roles. Findings and Originality: This paper presents a model that structures the concept of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> based on required and available capacity, including <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as the balance between required and available capacity at different levels. Further, required capacity for a particular time period is determined by order details, item characteristics, number of items and the consolidation of items in the load at each <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> level. Available capacity for a particular time period is determined by the type of load units and the number of load units at each <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> level. The different levels interact, and, to complement the balance at each <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> level, an overall measure comparing the required capacity at the lowest <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> level with the available capacity at the highest <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> level is suggested. Research Impact: The conceptual model presented in this paper can be used to describe imbalances in shipper systems between required and available capacity. By providing structure and explaining inefficiency in terms of the imbalance between required and available capacity, the model is a step towards identifying opportunities for improving <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> The findings are also of interest to researchers in the field of transport efficiency and green logistics. Practical Impact: Logistics managers can achieve a better understanding of the concept of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and at what level their required and available capacity are imbalanced. Improving the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is of interest in terms of both reducing costs and improving environmental performance...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} modelling {{approach for}} gust and <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>loads</b> analysis is presented. Typically, the unsteady aerodynamics for gust loads are computed by the Doublet Lattice Method. However, this method {{does not account}} for effects, which are important from a flight dynamics and <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>loads</b> perspective. E. g., the roll-yaw coupling, also responsible for the flight mechanical eigenmodes like the dutch roll mode, are unaccounted for by the DLM. Since, the dutch roll mode might also be excited by lateral gusts, this might have an influence on the loads response. In this paper, the unsteady aerodynamics are computed by a 3 D panel method, capable of capturing the flight dynamics accurately and provide complex Aerodynamics Influence Coefficients for gust loads analysis as a function of reduced frequency similar to the DLM. The aerodynamics of the panel method are validate by comparison with CFD results. Differences in the flight mechanics between the DLM and the panel methods are assessed for a parametric variation of the wing dihedral of an aircraft model. Finally, results from a frequency domain gust loads analysis of a lateral gust for the DLM and the 3 D panel method are compared...|$|R

The relationship between load diversity coefficient and route coefficient of variation in occupancy <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is quantified. Two tables are provided that enhance passenger capacity and quality of service (QoS) assessment regarding onboard passenger load. The first expresses the transit operator’s perspective of load diversity and the passengers’ perspective of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> relative to the operator’s, across six service levels corresponding to ranges of coefficient of variation in occupancy <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> The second interprets the relationships between passenger average travel time and each of passenger-relative <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and occupancy <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> The application of this methodology is illustrated using a case study of a premium radial bus route in Brisbane, Australia.
