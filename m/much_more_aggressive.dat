5|$|All have paddle-like {{tails and}} many have {{laterally}} compressed bodies that give them an eel-like appearance. Unlike fish, {{they do not have}} gills and must surface regularly to breathe. Along with whales, they are among the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this group are species {{with some of the most}} potent venoms of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, but others are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive.</b> Currently, 17genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 62 species.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, {{based on a}} Roman type by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The font family contains regular, semibold, and bold weights and was developed through viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to Garamond's work, a contrast to the <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> ITC Garamond popular at the time. The OpenType version of the font family was released in 2000 as Adobe Garamond Pro, with enhanced support for its alternate glyphs such as ligatures, small caps and italic swash capitals, and is sold through Adobe's Typekit system. It {{is one of the}} most popular versions of Garamond in books and fine printing.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because they seem to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel and toss them back into the water barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E
50|$|Paddle-tail newts are {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} Japanese fire belly newts and sold as such, but are <b>much</b> larger and <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> and will eat smaller firebelly newts if given the opportunity.|$|R
50|$|Heart of Darkness is sixth studio album by Grave Digger. They {{showed a}} <b>much</b> darker and <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> sound with this release {{than any of}} their {{previous}} albums. All of the songs have dark, lyrical concepts such as hate, death, betrayal, etc.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} the band's musical direction, Sugar stated [...] "I think {{we got a little}} more {{progressive}} since the debut, more complex. The new music is so <b>much</b> darker and <b>more</b> <b>aggressive,</b> and that's really not due to any choice in direction -- it's just the result of our attitudes as people." ...|$|R
25|$|After {{the reforms}} Qin became <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive.</b> In 340 Qin took land from Wèi {{after it had}} been {{defeated}} by Qi. In 316 Qin conquered Shu and Ba in Sichuan to the southwest. Development of this area {{took a long time}} but slowly added greatly to Qin's wealth and power.|$|E
25|$|Among other things, the {{observations}} demonstrate actual hunting behaviors of adult Architeuthis, a subject on which {{there had been}} much speculation. The photographs showed an aggressive hunting pattern by the baited squid, leading to it impaling a tentacle on the bait ball's hooks. This may disprove {{the theory that the}} giant squid is a drifter which eats whatever floats by, rarely moving so as to conserve energy. It seems the species has a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> feeding technique.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a {{study on}} Chilean {{flamingos}} (Phoenicopterus chilensis) found that birds in a bond were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> than single birds. The paired birds {{were significantly more likely}} to start an agonistic encounter in defense of their mate or young whereas single birds were typically non-breeding and less likely to fight. Not all flamingos can mate in the population because of an unsuitable sex ratio or some dominant flamingos mating with multiple partners. Mates are a fiercely contested resource in many species as the production of offspring is essential for an individual to propagate its genes.|$|E
5000|$|True Love Always is a pop band {{formed in}} Charlottesville, Virginia in 1995, {{with a mission}} to play only love songs. [...] Heavily {{influenced}} by Joao Gilberto, Dionne Warwick and Earth, Wind and Fire, their sound was at odds with <b>much</b> of the <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> indie-rock gaining popularity at the time. The band {{has been associated with}} TeenBeat Records for their entire existence.|$|R
50|$|Mika Seido: Mika is {{the main}} {{character}} of the story. She is short but has considerable strength, though it is explained that she has the genetype white, leading to her being mocked by other characters as being inferior. Mika is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> passionate and <b>aggressive</b> {{than many of the}} people around her, but is also extremely loyal.|$|R
5000|$|Serpentine Dominion's sound {{has been}} {{described}} as death metal, extreme metal, progressive death metal and melodic death metal, when asked about the project's musical style, Dutkiewicz said: [...] "It's not straight death metal — there's some melodic elements in there — but it's <b>much</b> faster and <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> than Killswitch Engage is. And the drums are blazing, so Shannon {{is probably one of the}} only guys on the face of the earth who could pull this off." ...|$|R
25|$|After {{becoming}} {{once again}} satrap of Babylon, Seleucus became <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> in his politics. In {{a short time}} he conquered Media and Susiana. Diodorus Siculus reports that Seleucus also conquered other nearby areas, which might refer to Persis, Aria or Parthia. Seleucus did not reach Bactria and Sogdiana. The satrap of the former was Stasanor, who had managed to remain neutral during the conflicts. After the defeat of Nikanor's army, there was no force in the east that could have opposed Seleucus. It is uncertain how Seleucus arranged {{the administration of the}} provinces he had conquered. Most satraps had died. In theory, Polyperchon was still the lawful successor of Antipater and the official regent of the Macedonian kingdom. It was his duty to select the satraps. However, Polyperchon was still allied with Antigonus and thus an enemy of Seleucus.|$|E
25|$|The early Roman army (c. 500 BC) was, {{like those}} of other {{contemporary}} city-states influenced by Greek civilization, a citizen militia which practiced hoplite tactics. It was small (the population of free males of military age was then about 9,000) and organized in five classes (in parallel to the comitia centuriata, the body of citizens organized politically), with three providing hoplites and two providing light infantry. The early Roman army was tactically limited and its stance during this period was essentially defensive. By the 3rd century BC, the Romans abandoned the hoplite formation {{in favor of a}} more flexible system in which smaller groups of 120 (or in some cases 60) men called maniples could maneuver more independently on the battlefield. Thirty maniples arranged in three lines with supporting troops constituted a legion, totaling between 4,000 and 5,000 men. The early Republican legion consisted of five sections, each of which was equipped differently and had different places in formation: the three lines of manipular heavy infantry (hastati, principes and triarii), a force of light infantry (velites), and the cavalry (equites). With the new organization came a new orientation toward the offensive and a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> posture toward adjoining city-states.|$|E
500|$|In a November 1996 video interview, Rowntree claimed, [...] "It's a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> {{record in}} many ways {{as well as a}} more {{emotional}} record. I think the music we're making now is the music that we've always wanted to make but got distracted from in a way." ...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic {{patients}} have a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> widespread and <b>aggressive</b> form of atherosclerosis and therefore, {{higher risk for}} myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and stroke, but the molecular mechanisms leading to accelerated damage are still unclear. Recently, we showed that hyperglycemia activates the transcription factor NFAT in the arterial wall, inducing {{the expression of the}} pro-atherosclerotic protein osteopontin. Here we investigate whether NFAT activation may be a link between diabetes and atherogenesis...|$|R
50|$|According to {{political}} scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson {{writing in the}} book Winner-Take-All Politics, the important policy shifts were brought on not by the Republican Party but {{by the development of}} a modern, efficient political system, especially lobbying, by top earners - and particularly corporate executives and the financial services industry. The end of the 1970s saw a transformation of American politics away from a focus on the middle class, with new, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> effective, <b>aggressive</b> and well-financed lobbyists and pressure groups acting on behalf of upper income groups. Executives successfully eliminated any countervailing power or oversight of corporate managers (from private litigation, boards of directors and shareholders, the Securities and Exchange Commission or labor unions).|$|R
5000|$|For The Force Awakens, {{director}} J. J. Abrams {{decided to}} approach the choreography similarly to {{how it was done}} in the original trilogy. Abrams stated that the prequel trilogy choreography was [...] "increasingly spectacular and stylised, almost like dance choreography", but that wasn't what they really wanted to go for the new films. He told Empire magazine, [...] "When you look at Star Wars and Empire, they are very different lightsaber battles, but for me they felt more powerful because they were not quite as slick. I was hoping to go for something <b>much</b> <b>more</b> primitive, <b>aggressive</b> and rougher, a throwback to the kind of heart-stopping lightsaber fights I remembered being so enthralled by as a kid." ...|$|R
500|$|Age of Empires II: HD Edition {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} with aggregate review website Metacritic assigning {{a score of}} 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics. Critics agreed that the HD Edition changed very little from the original game. Daniel Starkey of Destructoid added that the reluctance to change the game features encourages [...] "a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive,</b> and obsessive style of play". He highlights {{the fact that many}} of the problems of trying to run the original game on a modern computer are gone, and calls its compatibility with Steam's Workshop [...] "an amazing bonus".|$|E
500|$|In March 1989, Gingrich became House Minority Whip {{in a close}} {{election}} against Edward Rell Madigan. This was Gingrich's first formal {{position of}} power within the Republican party. He said his intention to [...] "build a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive,</b> activist party". Early {{in his role as}} Whip, in May 1989, Gingrich was involved in talks about the appointment of a Panamanian administrator of the Panama Canal, which was scheduled to occur in 1989 subject to U.S. government approval. Gingrich was outspoken in his opposition to giving control over the canal to an administrator appointed by the dictatorship in Panama.|$|E
500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] is a dance {{song with}} {{influences}} of electro, relying {{heavily on the}} usage of synthesizers. The pre-chorus has a sing-rap section in which Gomez delivers the lyrics in a thick British accent. [...] "Whiplash" [...] is musically different and <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> {{than the rest of}} the album, and its lyrics speak of a blossoming romance; it has been compared to the work of Spears. [...] "Whiplash" [...] received mixed to positive reviews. While some critics called it one of the standout tracks of When the Sun Goes Down, others dismissed its rap sections and lyrics. Selena Gomez & the Scene performed the song at shows while on the We Own the Night Tour (2011).|$|E
50|$|Chase, {{after his}} girlfriend's death, {{has been using}} Old Lace in a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> angry and <b>aggressive</b> manner, even {{going so far as}} to command Old Lace to rip an enemy's throat out; though {{eventually}} was called off by Chase after being scolded by Nico. The Deinonychus later went on to follow Chase but when ordered to hurt Karolina as well as Nico, Old Lace showed her own will by greeting them warmly.|$|R
5000|$|Diamond Resorts International {{is notable}} for {{high-pressure}} sales tactics used to close sales and generate fees for consumers. Club members are charged yearly maintenance fees (including management fees), which are set by Diamond Resorts International {{and which the}} FTC warns are likely to rise every year. Diamond Resorts International's official 2014 SEC filing states that club members {{do not have the}} right to terminate membership, except in certain areas where consumers are protected by state law. [...] Jeff Weir, a Diamond timeshare owner and journalist covering the timeshare industry, told the New York Times: [...] "In my experience, Diamond is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> ambitious, <b>aggressive</b> and downright nasty in their sales presentations compared to Marriott and Westin. Diamond just has an amazing reputation of being tough on people." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Brian Olewnick awards the album 4 stars and states [...] "a highly {{successful}} and enjoyable effort, {{one that can}} stand comfortably with work being done at that time by Tony Williams or John McLaughlin... Garbarek's own playing, here entirely on tenor, come largely out of Albert Ayler as well as Coltrane, and his general attack is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> raw and <b>aggressive</b> than the style for which he would eventually become more widely known through his recordings for ECM".|$|R
500|$|... "Applause" [...] {{is set in}} {{the time}} {{signature}} of common time and has a tempo of 140 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G minor, following the chord progression of Gm–F–E–Cm–F–Gm, with Gaga's vocals spanning from F3 to A6. The record has been pinned to the electropop and Eurodance music genres, and has been cited as returning Gaga to her career roots by mirroring the sounds of her debut album. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters described it as [...] "closer to 'Just Dance' in style over any of her Born This Way-era hits, but in a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> fashion, catering to the gradual EDM-stranglehold of pop radio." [...] Erin Coulehan of Rolling Stone concurred, calling it [...] "a throwback to 'LoveGame'-era Gaga." ...|$|E
500|$|Although trading {{companies}} such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch used the conventional [...] "agent model" [...] for reporting revenue (where only the trading or brokerage fee would be reported as revenue), Enron instead selected to report the entire value of each of its trades as revenue. This [...] "merchant model" [...] was considered <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> in the accounting interpretation than the agent model. Enron's method of reporting inflated trading revenue was later adopted by other companies in the energy trading industry {{in an attempt to}} stay competitive with the company's large increase in revenue. Other energy {{companies such as}} Duke Energy, Reliant Energy, and Dynegy joined Enron in the wealthiest 50 of the Fortune 500 mainly due to their adoption of the same trading revenue accounting as Enron.|$|E
500|$|Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer became Commander {{in chief}} of the High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916 when Admiral von Pohl became too ill to {{continue}} in that post. Scheer favored a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> policy than that of his predecessor, and advocated greater usage of U-boats and zeppelins in coordinated attacks on the Grand Fleet; Scheer received approval from the Kaiser in February 1916 to carry out his intentions. Scheer ordered the fleet on sweeps of the North Sea on 26 March, 2–3 April, and 21–22 April. The battlecruisers conducted another raid on the English coast on 24–25 April, during which the fleet provided distant support. Scheer planned another raid for mid-May, but the battlecruiser [...] had struck a mine during the previous raid and the repair work forced the operation to be pushed back {{until the end of the}} month.|$|E
5000|$|Another major {{addition}} to the sequel is {{the introduction of a}} new type of enemy - the yamibito, who, although <b>much</b> <b>more</b> resilient, <b>aggressive,</b> and intelligent than the shibito, function essentially the same way. Their main weakness is that they are repelled by light, meaning that they can be weakened by focusing a flashlight on them or turning on the lights in a room. Like the shibito, a yamibito can be defeated, but is revived when a yamirei (lit. [...] "darkness spirit") re-enters the corpse. Eliminating the yamirei (who are also intolerant to light) renders the yamibito unconscious indefinitely. However, due to their improved intelligence and strength, yamibito will not fall for distractions that may have worked on shibito, and they are also much harder to defeat in combat.|$|R
50|$|In {{conjunction}} with the new competition the National Rugby League, Manly-Warringah would change their logo in 1998. A new stylised sea eagle appeared under the 'Sea Eagles' banner, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> fierce and <b>aggressive</b> than its predecessor. It featured predominantly maroon, white, yellow and blue to symbolise the connection the club had with its major sponsor at the time Pepsi. This logo would not last however when the ill-fated merger with North Sydney Bears in 2000 saw them take on the Northern Eagles moniker instead.|$|R
5000|$|The UN responded {{the next}} day with Resolution 837, reaffirming that the {{secretary-general}} was authorized to [...] "take all necessary measures against those responsible for the armed attacks and to establish the effective authority of UNOSOM II throughout Somalia." [...] This was essentially equivalent to declaring war on Aidid and his army, a declaration that would lead to numerous confrontations between UNOSOM II personnel and Aidid's militia. UNOSOM II had much fewer war-fighting resources than UNITAF, but it was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> ambitious and <b>aggressive.</b>|$|R
500|$|Following {{the split}} from the SPD, the FVdG was {{increasingly}} influenced by French syndicalism and anarchism. In 1908, Kater called the Charter of Amiens, the platform of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the earliest and largest syndicalist union worldwide, [...] "a new revelation". Although {{there was no}} contact between German [...] "intellectual anarchists" [...] (like Gustav Landauer and Erich Mühsam) and the FVdG, it did have influential anarchist members, most notably Andreas Kleinlein and Fritz Köster. Kleinlein and Köster increasingly influenced the federation from 1908 on, and {{this led to the}} founding of Der Pionier in 1911. This newspaper, which was edited by Köster, had a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> tone than Die Einigkeit. Despite these developments, the influence of the anarchists in the pre-World War I FVdG remained quantitatively minute, especially as leading members like Kater were at the time very skeptical of the anarchist ideology.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I think maybe I am more attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive.</b> He makes more of a physical impact in a game, in midfield. He is amazing. I don’t think I have this quality yet. I think I can develop in that way but he is much stronger." [...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira was more of a passer of the ball. Diaby is more of a dribbler, more offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira was more of a constructor. They have a similar elegance and type of play but are not completely comparable".|$|E
500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] is a dance {{song with}} {{influences}} of electro. It features a heavy usage of synthesizers, which {{were compared to}} those in Christina Aguilera's [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] (2010). During the pre-chorus, there is a sing-rap section in which Gomez delivers several phrases in a thick British accent, before the pulsating chorus begins. [...] "Whiplash" [...] has a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> vibe than the typical teen pop sound. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, it is written in the key of D minor. The song runs through a shuffle beat and maintains a tempo of 138 beat per minute. Gomez's vocal range spans from the high-tone of A3 to the lower register of B4. It is also musically different and a departure from other songs in When the Sun Goes Down which are more straightforward pop, such as [...] "Who Says" [...] and [...] "Bang Bang Bang".|$|E
50|$|Jimmy does {{research}} about wolves in California {{and starts to}} believe that the creature was a werewolf, sharing his thoughts with a disbelieving Ellie. Later, Ellie is surprised to find herself attracted to the smell of blood on a co-worker, but eases her concerns by touching a silver picture frame and not getting burned. Jimmy is becoming <b>much</b> stronger and <b>more</b> <b>aggressive,</b> as shown when a bully named Bo coerces him to join the wrestling team. He easily defeats three wrestlers, including Bo, and calls Bo out for constantly making gay jokes towards him, saying that Bo himself is repressing his own homosexuality.|$|R
5000|$|The 1969 Camaro {{carried over}} the {{previous}} year's drivetrain and major mechanical components, but all-new sheetmetal, except the hood and trunk lid, gave the car a substantially sportier look. The grille was redesigned with a heavy [...] "V" [...] cant and deeply inset headlights. New door skins, rear quarter panels, and rear valance panel also gave the car a <b>much</b> lower, wider, <b>more</b> <b>aggressive</b> look. This styling would serve for the 1969 model year only. Collectors often debate the merits of smooth, rounded lines of 1967 and 1968 model versus the heavily creased and sportier looks of the 1969.|$|R
50|$|Geophagus is a genus of {{cichlids}} that mainly live in South America as {{far south}} as Uruguay, but a single species, G. crassilabris is from Panama. The genus is currently polyphyletic and in need of further taxonomic revision. Some geophagine cichlids previously included in this genus have been reallocated to Gymnogeophagus or Satanoperca. Sensu stricto species include the true geophagines of very peaceful disposition usually with long fin extensions like the type species Geophagus altifrons. Sensu lato geophagines include the <b>much</b> <b>more</b> robust and <b>aggressive</b> species of the Geophagus brasiliensis complex.|$|R
