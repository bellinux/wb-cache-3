Both these methods are dependent on the distance over which it measure, either directly as in the Time-of-flight, or indirectly through the matching number of wavelengths over the physical extent of the specimen which resonate.|$|E
2500|$|An assay is {{an investigative}} (analytic) {{procedure}} in laboratory medicine, pharmacology, environmental biology and molecular biology for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence, amount, or functional activity {{of a target}} entity (the analyte). [...] The analyte can be a drug, a biochemical substance, or a cell in an organism or organic sample. The measured entity is generally called the analyte, the <b>measurand</b> or {{the target of the}} assay. The assay usually aims to measure an intensive property of the analyte and express it in the relevant measurement unit (e.g. molarity, density, functional activity in enzyme international units, degree of some effect in comparison to a standard, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Another {{basic premise}} of the GUM {{approach}} {{is that it is}} not possible to state how well the true value of the <b>measurand</b> is known, but only how well it is believed to be known. Measurement uncertainty can therefore be described as a measure of how well one believes one knows the true value of the <b>measurand.</b> This uncertainty reflects the incomplete knowledge of the <b>measurand.</b>|$|E
40|$|During flight test, {{a common}} {{objective}} is to collect data from specially instrumented aircraft. Typically several hundreds of <b>measurands</b> (parameters) such as speed, altitude, and pressure, are monitored and telemetered to the ground receiving station for both real-time monitoring and storage for later post-test analysis. Prior to this transmission, <b>measurands</b> are digitally represented {{and placed in a}} certain order within a data structure know as Data Cycle Map (DCM). These placements are based on <b>measurands</b> periodicity, sample rate and certain industry standards. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the order of placement before hand. The process of designing data cycle map can be performed manually for few <b>measurands</b> but as the number of <b>measurands</b> increases the process becomes rather complex and time consuming. The need to improve this process has become an interesting topic to explore in operation research group. In the past the problem of designing DCM has been modelled using set covering integer-programming formulation. In this approach <b>measurands</b> (the parameters) are allocated to the map and the DCM design is optimised in terms of the amount of wasted space on the map. This problem is equivalent to Multi Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). As number of <b>measurands</b> increases, the solve time increases exponentially. It is therefore NP-hard and clever optimisation technique is needs to solve these problems. The focus {{of this paper is to}} investigate a new mathematical approach to strengthen the set-covering model described in the past. It is desired that solution based on branch and bound process can be speed up by generating strengthened LP solution. ...|$|R

50|$|The items {{required}} by a measurement model {{to define a}} <b>measurand</b> are known as input quantities in a measurement model. The model {{is often referred to}} as a functional relationship. The output quantity in a measurement model is the <b>measurand.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{task is to}} {{conclude}} the unknown value of the <b>measurand</b> from the observed outcome of the measurement process. It is impossible to determine the true value of the <b>measurand</b> {{by means of the}} measurement process because of randomness. It is only possible to specify a set of values that includes the true value. Such a set constitutes the measurement result and it is called [...] "correct" [...] if it contains the true value of the <b>measurand</b> and wrong if not.|$|E
5000|$|A {{measurement}} is used {{to determine}} the actual value of a characteristic that is usually called <b>measurand.</b> A measurement is possible only if the <b>measurand</b> had been quantified prior to measurement by means of a suitable unit so that each value of the <b>measurand</b> is represented by a unique real number. For example, the characteristic [...] "length" [...] of a material object is quantified by the unit [...] "meter", or the characteristic [...] "(time) duration" [...] of a development is quantified by the unit [...] "second". Any measurement assumes a measurement process which is subject to randomness resulting in uncertainty about its indeterminate future outcome. Because of this uncertainty with respect to the future outcome of the measurement process, it is generally impossible to determine the true value of the <b>measurand.</b>|$|E

The possible influence of different physical effects on these dimensional <b>measurands</b> is demonstrated. In addition, a correction method to improve the accuracy of the geometric data determined by CT is presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{crucial part}} of any {{chemical}} analysis is the degree of representativeness of the <b>measurand(s)</b> in the test portion for the same <b>measurands</b> in the object, originally collected for investigation. Such an object usually may have either to be homogenized and sub-sampled, or digested/dissolved. Any of these steps introduce sampling errors, risk of contamination or loss of the <b>measurand(s).</b> Neutron (and photon) activation analysis and prompt gamma analysis have the capabilities of analyzing large objects or samples without the need of any pre-treatment, i. e., intact 'as received', with masses varying from tens of grams to tens of kilograms, and with any type of (irregular) shape. The basic concept of neutron activation analysis and prompt gamma analysis are shortly revisited and the scope of application of the large sample analysis with these technique are elaborated on with an outlook for use in forensic studies, including the analysis of medicinal products and drugs of abuse. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The GUM {{provides}} a way to express the perceived quality of {{the result of a}} measurement. Rather than express the result by providing an estimate of the <b>measurand</b> along with information about systematic and random error values (in the form of an [...] "error analysis"), the GUM approach is to express the result of a measurement as an estimate of the <b>measurand</b> along with an associated measurement uncertainty.|$|E

Consequently, the measurement process is represented by a variable X which is called a random variable.|$|E
