50|$|The {{main focus}} of the {{scientists}} of Breeding and Genetics Section, CCRI, Multan is to develop and commercialize Bt. and non-Bt. new cotton varieties with inbuilt resistance/tolerance against the biotic and abiotic stresses along with desirable fibre traits. Development of germplasm has {{a key role in}} the process of variety development. This section holds its own recognition in this aspect. Two Bt. varieties Bt. CIM-600, Bt. CIM-616 and one non Bt. Variety CIM-612 were submitted for approval to Expert Sub-Committee. Six advanced Bt. strains were evaluated at Multan and Khanewal locations. The new strain Bt.CIM-616 gave best performance at both the locations. The strain had the lint percentage of 41.7 with the staple length of 28.8 mm and <b>micronaire</b> of 4.7 µg inch-1. The fibre strength of the strain is very good up to 100.3 tppsi. Seven advanced non-Bt. strains were also evaluated at Multan and Khanewal locations. The new strain CIM-716 produced the highest seed cotton yield on overall basis. All these strains have the desirable fibre characteristics. The crosses with exotic material (AS-0349) from France and Mac-7 for induction of CLCuD resistant/tolerance are in different filial generations.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe term “micronaire” {{describes}} an important cotton fiber property by characterizing both the fiber maturity and fineness. In practice, <b>micronaire</b> is regularly measured in laboratories with the well established high volume instrumentation (HVI™) protocol. In most scenarios, cotton breeders/geneticists sent cotton breeding line field trial samples to laboratories equipped {{to use the}} HVI™ systems available for fiber <b>micronaire</b> determination. Researchers have previously investigated the use of NIR as an alternative means of measuring <b>micronaire</b> either at breeding sites or in standard laboratories. As a proof-of-concept investigation, this study collected both near infrared (NIR) spectra and HVI™ <b>micronaire</b> from a total of 381 cottons harvested in the 2011 and 2012 crop years. Partial least square (PLS) calibration model relating NIR spectral information to fiber HVI™ <b>micronaire</b> was developed and then applied to both a validation sample set from identical crop years and an independent test sample set from the 2014 crop year. Results indicated an acceptable bias (or differences between HVI™ measured and NIR predicted <b>micronaire)</b> and an over 97 % correctly predicted <b>micronaire</b> (within ± 0. 30 <b>micronaire</b> unit) in an independent test set. Therefore, {{the development of a}} robust and effective NIR model for rapid laboratory <b>micronaire</b> assessment that would be applicable to remote/breeding locations is feasible...|$|E

There is some evidence to suggest management can impact fiber <b>micronaire.</b> Approximately 250 cases were identified in cotton production areas in Arizona ranging from the lower Colorado River Valley to near 2, 000 ft. elevation with grower cooperators in the 2000 season. Field records were developed for each field by use of the University of Arizona Cotton Monitoring System (UA-CMS) for points such as variety, planting date, fertility management, irrigation schedules, irrigation termination, defoliation, etc. Routine plant measurements were conducted to monitor crop growth and development and to identify fruiting patterns and retention through the season. As the crop has approached cutout and the lower bolls began to open, open boll samples have been collected from the lowest four, first position bolls (theoretically the bolls with the highest <b>micronaire</b> potential on the plant) from 10 plants, ginned, and the fiber analyzed for <b>micronaire</b> (low 4).

40|$|Genotype is an {{important}} factor in determining some fiber properties, but environmental variations are the chief determinants of <b>micronaire,</b> color, and uniformity. In a 1996 - 97 study of Upland cotton grown in SC, spatial variations in soil pH and the levels of P, Na, Ca, Mg, or % organic matter modulated fiber properties, including <b>micronaire</b> and color.

Higher soil K also improved fiber whiteness. Increased soil pH and Ca and Mg were negatively correlated with <b>micronaire</b> and maturity, and soil P and %OM were negatively correlated with yield in both years.

The study aims {{to investigate the}} relationship between N rates and formation of fiber length, strength, maturity and <b>micronaire</b> in bolls with different flowering dates. Field experiments were conducted using two cotton cultivars (Kemian 1 and NuCOTN 33 B) and three N fertilization rates (0, 240, and 480 kg N ha- 1) in Nanjing and Xuzhou in 2005 and in Anyang in 2007, China. The fiber length, strength, maturity, <b>micronaire,</b> and N concentration per unit area (NA) of the subtending leaf of cotton boll were analyzed. N fertilization rates, flowering dates, and N fertilization rates × flowering dates significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) affected NA {{and the formation of}} fiber length, strength, maturity and <b>micronaire.</b> N fertilization rates affected fiber quality by influencing NA which was significantly related to rate and duration of the fiber quality formation process. The optimal NA for fiber quality formation was varied.

For bolls flowering after September 10 when MDTBMP was lower than 21 °C, NA in the 480 kg N ha- 1 treatment was optimal for fiber quality development.

In order to do this, it is neces-sary to understand the opportunities that exist to improve the measurement of short fiber. Since the Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS) is the most widely recognized method for determining short fiber content in cotton, it is the focus of this study. Hand sortings of fibers were collected by length groups from three bales of upland cotton with <b>micronaire</b> values of 3. 7, 4. 3, and 5. 4. These fibers were tested for <b>micronaire</b> and strength by the Fibronaire and Stelometer, respectively, and then tested on AFIS to determine the lengths of the fibers ranging from 9. 53 mm to 25. 44 mm. Although short fibers were not present in a sample prior to testing on AFIS, the machine reported a short fiber content measurement. In addition, frictional properties and convolutions of individual fibers were determined by the RotorRing and by Favimat, respectively, for each sample. These tests indicated that the high <b>micronaire</b> cottons exhibited more convolutions than the low <b>micronaire</b> counterparts, and that the longer fibers exhibited higher frictional properties than shorter fibers. Short fiber content, fibers less than 12. 7 mm (0. 5 in) long, in cotton has a significant influence on the marketability, processing, and end-product quality of cotton. The accurate and precise measurement of short fiber content in a given cotton sample has been the goal of many research efforts (Zeidman et al., 1991).

For {{the case of}} cotton, an automated prototype system using image processing to measure the <b>micronaire</b> value of cotton fiber during harvest was designed and built in the laboratory. This system was tested with two image-processing algorithms to identify and remove the effects of objects present in the images that were not cotton fiber, and then measure the reflectivity in three Near-Infrared (NIR) wavebands. Both algorithms yielded similar results when used on seed cotton samples. The reflectivity measurement after removing the effects of foreign matter had a strong relationship to standard <b>micronaire</b> measurements (R^ 2 = 0. 73 and 0. 74 for the ratio-image and single-image algorithms, respectively) with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0. 28 and 0. 27, respectively.

The twin-line system produced more lint than the conventional single-line system at 4 of 16 locations; the yields of the twinline and single-line systems were 1273 and 1186 lb/acre, 1572 and 1461 lb/acre, 1478 and 1290 lb/acre, and 1309 and 1210 lb/acre, respectively, at the Grasty, Ramona, Rovey, and Wells sites, respectively. There {{were no significant}} differences in yield or fiber <b>micronaire</b> in 7 of the 16 experiments. The twin-line system produced less lint than the conventional system at 5 of 16 locations; yields of the twin-line and single-line systems were 2019 and 2189 lb/acre, 1400 and 1489 lb/acre, 1537 and 1845 lb/acre, 1065 and 1200 lb/acre, and 1271 and 1431 lb/acre, respectively, at the Chaffin (75 K), Cooley, Hull, Papago, and Wakimoto sites, respectively. Fiber <b>micronaire</b> was reduced in five experiments; the <b>micronaire</b> values were 4. 25 and 4. 73, 4. 46 and 4. 78, 4. 60 and 4. 85, 4. 76 and 4. 98, and 4. 93 and 5. 15, in the twin-line and single-line systems, respectively, at the Rogers, Papago, Grasty, Hull, and Perry sites, respectively.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center (MAC – 1100 ft. elevation) in 2002 to evaluate plant population relationships with conventional row spacing under a range of high population conditions with new Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) varieties. The varieties, which included AG 3601, DP 458 BR, and STV 4892 BR, were each planted to six densities of 15, 000, 30, 000, 45, 000, 60, 000, 75, 000, and 90, 000. Inseason plant measurement data revealed crop vigor and fruit retention levels were well within the optimum threshold for all varieties and populations. There was no interaction between variety and population in terms of lint yield and fiber quality parameters. However, results show significant differences in lint yield and fiber strength among varieties but not the fiber <b>micronaire.</b> In addition, higher population had no significant effect on lint yield or fiber quality. Higher populations had no effect in lowering fiber <b>micronaire</b> to premium levels as well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A key {{cotton fiber}} quality {{property}} is <b>micronaire,</b> which {{acts as an}} indicator of the fiber's maturity and fineness. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of Near Infrared (NIR) instrumentation to measure these cotton properties with varying degrees of success, but these studies did not provide conclusions on the capabilities of NIR spectroscopy as a general technique for these analyses. Recent advances in NIR technology could result in improved meas-urements of these cotton properties. A compara-tive investigation was implemented to determine the capabilities of modern commercial bench-top and portable NIR systems to monitor cotton fiber <b>micronaire,</b> maturity, and fineness in order to gain insight as to the universality " of the NIR meas-urements for these fiber properties. Cotton sam-ples were analyzed on five commercial systems and an older, custom-built system. Very good spectral agreement was observed between the portable and bench-top NIR units. The rapid and simultaneous measurement of cotton <b>micronaire,</b> maturity, and fineness by multiple commercial systems was demonstrated and compared favora-bly to the custom system, but without the delay and cost in building custom units. For the bench-top NIR systems, all end-state criteria were suc-cessfully meet. The "universal " nature of the NIR measurement of these cotton fiber properties was validated for commercial NIR systems. As expected, the NIR results for the portable NIR units were normally not as good as those for the bench-top instruments, but they were very accept-able for demonstrating the potential for the porta-ble units to measure these cotton fiber properties...|$|E

40|$|Irrigation can {{positively}} influence cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) {{yield and}} fiber quality {{during periods of}} short-term drought. A cover crop in conjunction with conservation tillage can also benefit cotton yield and fiber quality by conserving soil moisture and potentially increasing plant available water. A split-plot experiment in a randomized complete block design was utilized to examine how interactions between irrigation levels and tillage systems affect cotton yield and fiber quality in the Tennessee Valley on a Decatur silt loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Rhodic Paleudults) from 2001 - 2003. Main plots were tillage systems and subplots were irrigation levels. The no-tillage system increased yields 13 % in 2003 (normal rainfall year), while irrigation levels increased yields 46 % and 32 %, respectively in 2002 and 2003 over non-irrigated yields. <b>Micronaire</b> and staple were not affected by tillage system or irrigation level in 2001; however, <b>micronaire</b> and staple were influenced by tillage system and irrigation level in 2002. Only irrigation level influenced fiber quality in 2003. A no-tillage system, utilizing a cover crop combined with irrigation, can improve cotton yields in the Tennessee Valley...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{reported on}} a screening method to assess the functionalisation of bioengineered cotton fibres through the absorption of CI Acid Orange 7. The aim of the present paper is to extend this study to different dye classes. Thus the dye absorption of bioengineered cotton fibres containing oligochitin is studied {{for a series of}} dye classes. Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} cotton lines designed to produce oligochitin in the fibre and their respective controls for all tested dyes, confirming previous results with CI Acid Orange 7. Further, although variations in <b>micronaire</b> influenced dye absorption, it was confirmed for all dyes tested as well as for CI Acid Orange 7 that the oligochitin production had a larger impact on the exhaustion values than the differences in <b>micronaire.</b> The method described in this paper can be applied as a screening tool to meet the challenge of working with small quantities of fibrous materials. Moreover it shows the potential that the incorporated oligochitin has for increasing dyeability with a wide range of dyes and creating fibres with more versatile reactivity...|$|E
40|$|Aiming to {{evaluate}} the effect of irrigation depths on fiber quality of upland cotton, an experiment was conducted from July to December 2010 in Barbalha-CE, Brazil. The treatments consisted of a factorial combination of two upland cotton cultivars (BRS Aroeira and BRS Araripe) and five irrigation depths (260. 93, 418. 93, 514. 21, 711. 81 and 894. 68 mm), arranged in a split-plot design with four replicates. A line-source sprinkler irrigation system was used and irrigation depth in the control treatment was calculated according to the crop evapotranspiration. The analysed fiber quality variables were: fiber percentage, length, uniformity, short-fiber index, resistance, elongation at rupture, <b>micronaire</b> index, maturity, degree of yellowing, reflectance degree and count strength product (CSP) index. The irrigation depths influenced fiber length, short-fiber index, strength, <b>micronaire</b> index, maturity and reflectance degree. The cultivars influenced fiber percentage, length and color (degree of yellowing). The best results of fiber quality were found with irrigation depths of 514. 21 and 418. 93 mm for the upland cotton cultivars BRS Araripe and BRS Aroeira, respectively. 201...|$|E
40|$|The {{volume of}} the Texas-Oklahoma spot cotton market {{analyzed}} by the Daily Price Estimation System (DPES) for the 2002 / 03 marketing year increased from 364, 267 bales the previous year to 606, 661 bales this year. The average price received by producers during the 2002 / 03 marketing year was 41. 98 cents/lb, which is about 16 cents/lb. higher than the previous year. The 2002 crop was generally of good quality. The average <b>micronaire</b> level was slightly lower in 2002 at 4. 33, and {{the average number of}} bales having level 1 bark was up in comparison to the 2002 crop. With the exception of strength and <b>micronaire,</b> price discounts for the 2002 crop increased for all quality attributes. Premiums remained about the same for all quality attributes with the exception of leaf. The premiums for lower levels of leaf in the 2002 - 03 market year showed a relative increase. In regard to strength, the first digit of the color grade, and staple length, producers did not appear to receive much of a premium for better than base qualities. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E
40|$|As características da fibra - comprimento, uniformidade, índice <b>Micronaire</b> (finura), resistência Pressley -, a resistência do fio, assim como a porcentagem de fibra, peso de um capulho, peso de 100 sementes e a produção, foram correlacionados com a maturidade da fibra, determinada pelo fibrógrafo digital. Para tanto foram utilizados os dados de 12 ensaios regionais de variedades instalados no ano agrícola de 1970 / 71, e de 13 ensaios instalados em 1971 / 72, em diferentes locais do Estado de São Paulo. Esses ensaios, em quadrado latino 6 x 6, forneceram 72 pares de valores no primeiro ano e 78 pares no segundo, para os cálculos dos coeficientes de correlação. Estes foram computados por ano e por variedade. Valores médios foram estimados através da transformação Z de Fisher. Houve variações sensíveis no valor dos coeficientes entre anos dentro de variedades e entre variedades dentro de ano. As estimativas médias foram significativas, com exceção da resistência da fibra, da resistência do fio e da porcentagem de fibra. Houve falta de homogeneidade nos casos do índice <b>Micronaire</b> e da uniformidade de comprimento. No ano de 1971 / 72, de condições piores para o algodoeiro, os coeficientes de correlação alcançaram valores mais altos. Simple {{correlations}} between maturity indices {{determined by the}} digital fibrograph and the characteristics of fiber length, uniformity, <b>Micronaire,</b> Pressley (1 / 8 gauge), yarn strength, mean boll weight, mean weight of 100 seeds, percentage of fiber, and yield were studied. Data of 12 experiments of regional variety tests planted in 1970 / 71 and of 13 experiments planted in 1971 / 72 in {{different regions of the}} State of São Paulo were used. These experiments delined in 6 x 6 latin squares yielded 72 pairs of data in the first year and 78 in the second year. Correlation coefficients were computed by variety within years and mean estimates obtained through Fisher's Z transformation. Large variations of the values obtained were observed among varieties within year as well as between years within variety. The mean estimates were signicant except for Pressley, yarn strength, and percentage of fiber. An explanation of these exceptions is presented through compensation mechanisms that may occur during the determinations. Lack of homogeneity was observed in the case of <b>Micronaire</b> and of Uniformity. Adverse conditions of the year of 1971 / 72 corresponded to higher values of the correlation coefficients...|$|E
