5|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the film}} on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film Fuck instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to call it Fuck, because it succinctly described the film's contents. There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly. Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre <b>marquees.</b>|$|E

25|$|While {{the film}} was in production, a logo was {{commissioned}} from Dan Perri, a title sequence designer who had worked on the titles for films such as The Exorcist (1973), Taxi Driver (1976). Perri devised a foreshortened STAR WARS logotype consisting of block-capital letters filled with stars and skewed towards a vanishing point. This logo design was originally conceived to follow the same perspective as the film's opening crawl. In the end, Perri's logo was not used for the film's opening title sequence, although it was used widely on pre-release print advertising and on cinema <b>marquees.</b>|$|E

They also estimated that the late Nasimuddin Amin, {{the former chairman of the}} Naza group, received 6,387 in 2003, making him the largest single recipient of APs. More than 12,200 APs were issued in 2003. In addition to APs, foreign car <b>marquees</b> are required to pay between 140% to 300% import duty.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the building's 1978 {{application}} for the National Register of Historic Places designation, the venue's <b>marquee</b> had been replaced twice. The original <b>marquee</b> was basic and facilitated two lines of text for announcements. The 1922–23 <b>marquee</b> had ornate [...] "flashing pinwheels, swirls and garlands of colored lights". It also included [...] "milk glass letter attraction boards, and CHICAGO in large letters on three sides". The 1949 replacement was similar to the second <b>marquee,</b> but its attraction boards were larger and the oversized CHICAGO lettering only appeared on the front. Until Balaban and Katz' 1969 sale to the American Broadcasting Company, their name was on the marqee. The entire <b>marquee</b> was replaced in 1994, but retains the look of its predecessor. In 2004, the original <b>marquee</b> was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.

25|$|It is such {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, to have made all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and say you are protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. It was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best <b>marquees,</b> and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E

It relaxed its exclusive distribution contract with Disney, who wanted a more prestigious exhibit {{in the form of a}} limited-run roadshow attraction. A total of thirteen roadshows were held across the United States; each involving two daily screenings with seat reservations booked in advance at higher prices and a fifteen-minute intermission. Disney hired film salesman Irving Ludwig to manage the first eleven engagements, who was given specific instructions regarding each aspect of the film's presentation, including the setup of outside theater <b>marquees</b> and curtain and lighting cues. Patrons were taken to their seats by staff hired and trained by Disney, and were given a program booklet illustrated by Gyo Fujikawa.|$|E
