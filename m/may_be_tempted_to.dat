But, if such a person leaves home, then comes in need of medication, it is permissible under the laws of Pikuach nefesh to break Shabbat and bring the medication to the person. A small number of authorities {{in recent years have}} been permitting carrying the medication, however, since such a person <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> leave home without it, and then his/her life may be endangered thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The group {{velocity}} {{of a wave}} (e.g., a light beam) may also exceed c in some circumstances. In such cases, which typically {{at the same time}} involve rapid attenuation of the intensity, the maximum of the envelope of a pulse may travel with a velocity above c. However, even this situation does not imply the propagation of signals with a velocity above c, even though one <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> associate pulse maxima with signals. The latter association {{has been shown to be}} misleading, because the information on the arrival of a pulse can be obtained before the pulse maximum arrives. For example, if some mechanism allows the full transmission of the leading part of a pulse while strongly attenuating the pulse maximum and everything behind (distortion), the pulse maximum is effectively shifted forward in time, while the information on the pulse does not come faster than c without this effect. However, {{group velocity}} can exceed c in some parts of a Gaussian beam in vacuum (without attenuation). The diffraction causes that the peak of pulse propagates faster, while overall power does not.|$|E
25|$|According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder {{from the}} Center for Responsible Nanotechnology {{as well as}} Anders Sandberg from the Future of Humanity Institute {{molecular}} manufacturing is the application of nanotechnology that poses the most significant global catastrophic risk. Several nanotechnology researchers state {{that the bulk of}} risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government. Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade, a potential peace-promoting factor; (5) wars of aggression may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.|$|E

The goal was to create a cadre of Revolutionaries who would lead by example and help create a model for a new revolutionary culture. There are obvious parallels here to the traditional obligation for people involved in public life to set an example and promote virtue as well.|$|R
25|$|For example, if Mauritius imports {{more than}} it exports, then {{this means that the}} supply of rupees is likely to exceed the demand in the foreign exchanging market, ceteris paribus. One can thus infer that the Mauritius rupee would be under {{pressure}} to depreciate against other currencies. On the other hand, if Mauritius exports {{more than it}} imports, then the rupee would be likely to appreciate. Second, a country's balance-of-payment data may signal its potential as a business partner {{for the rest of the}} world. If a country is grappling with a major balance-of-payment difficulty, it may not be able to expand imports from the outside world. Instead, the country <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> impose measures to restrict imports and discourage capital outflows in order to improve the balance-of-payment situation. On the other hand, a country experiencing a significant balance-of payment surplus would be more likely to expand imports, offering marketing opportunities for foreign enterprises, and less likely to impose foreign exchange restrictions. Third, balance-of-payments data can be used to evaluate the performance of the country in international economic competition. Suppose a country is experiencing trade deficits year after year. This trade data may then signal that the country's domestic industries lack international competitiveness. To interpret balance-of-payments data properly, it is necessary to understand how the balance of payments account is constructed.|$|E

Soon after his investment, Paul stopped in Ancona on his way to Greece. He remained in the city for several weeks, fêted by the locals, and presented them with purported relics: on 4 March 1380 the head of James the Just, followed on 17 April by the foot of Saint Anne and a nail from the True Cross.

500|$|Seen by Romanian critic Radu Voinescu as an {{extended}} anecdote, the novella Moș Nichifor Coțcariul ("Old Man Nichifor Slyboots") establishes {{a connection with}} the language of fairy tales, being located in a legendary and non-historical age. It details the elaborate seduction of a young Jewish bride by a worldly Moldavian wagoner, on the route between Târgu Neamț and Piatra. The episode, which the text itself indicates is just {{one in a series}} of Nichifor's conquests among his female clients, highlights the seducer's verbose monologue, which covers accounts of his unhappy marriage, allusions about the naturalness of physical love, and intimidating suggestions that wolves <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> attack the wagon (prompting the young woman to seek refuge in his arms). The seducer's behavior, Constantinescu notes, presents an alternative to the theme of old age as a time of immobility: [...] "the still-green old man, the rake, the joker who enjoys his amorous escapades, while justifying them by the natural course of life". Nichifor mostly expresses himself with the help of folk sayings, which he casually mixes in with personal observations about the situation. The background to the plot is a record of various superstitions, some anticlerical or antisemitic: Nichifor voices the belief that priests crossing one's path will produce bad luck, as well as the claim that Jewish apothecaries sold [...] "poisons".|$|E

50|$|While it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>tempting</b> <b>to</b> aim for an LOS A, this is {{unrealistic}} in urban areas. Urban areas more typically adopt standards varying between C and E, {{depending on the}} area's size and characteristics, while F is sometimes allowed in areas with improved pedestrian, bicycle, or transit alternatives. More stringent LOS standards (particularly in urban areas) tend to necessitate the widening of roads to accommodate development, thus discouraging use by these alternatives.
