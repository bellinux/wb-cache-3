40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{transitional}} dynamics in a quality ladder model of endogenous growth in which North-South trade leads to technological diffusion through reverse engineering of intermediate goods. The concept of learning-to-learn is incorporated into both imitative and innovative processes, {{which in turn}} drive domestic technological progress. International trade with imitation leads to feedback effects between Southern imitators and Northern innovators who compete for the world market. Consequently, both regions face transition paths dependent on their relative technologies. Using numerical solutions we see that rates of innovation and imitation are initially high but fall as the technology gap decreases in transition to steady-state. Increased interaction between the two regions leads to higher world growth, demonstrating dynamic benefits to the South of increased trade with a <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>region.</b> Despite faster per capita output growth, transition costs lead to decreased Northern welfare, although this loss is attributable {{to the lack of}} intellectual property rights rather than trade per se. The fall in Northern innovation as the technology gap between the two regions is reduced may explain the slowdown of measured total factor productivity growth in OECD countries over the last 30 years. *I would like to thank Robert Evenson, Xavier Sala-i-Martin, and T.

As the scope of economy expanding, the water's restriction to the development of economy and society is more and more evident. This paper tried to track and assess the harmonious status between the water resource and environment's Status and the development of economy and society in Shandong Peninsula in order to provide decision support for regional sustainability. This paper analyzed the water's development situation through calculating the total amount of water recourses, the balance of water's supply and demand and the utilization effects of water recourses and gave the aftereffect of environment because of inconsequential development and use. With Delphi and AHP methods, an appraisal index system was built including five aspects of harmony degree (A), sustainability degree (B), opening degree (C), stability degree (D) and controllability degree (E). The results showed that: 1) Shandong peninsula belongs to the essence coordination type and the indexes of opening degree and sustainability degree are above the average level; 2) The economic increase of Shandong peninsula belongs to extensive mode and depends on amount input of funds, labor and the excessive consumption of resource; and 3) water resource becomes the main factor that constrained the coordination of economy, society and environment in Shandong peninsula.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{estimates}} of {{low birth weight}} (LBW), preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), and infant mortality in two birth cohorts in Brazil. METHODS: The two cohorts were performed during the 1990 s, in São Luís, located in a less developed area in Northeastern Brazil, and Ribeirão Preto, situated in a <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>region</b> in Southeastern Brazil. Data from one-third of all live births in Ribeirão Preto in 1994 were collected (2, 839 single deliveries). In São Luís, systematic sampling of deliveries stratified by maternity hospital was performed from 1997 to 1998 (2, 439 single deliveries). The chi-squared (for categories and trends) and Student t tests {{were used in the}} statistical analyses. RESULTS: The LBW rate was lower in São Luís, thus presenting an epidemiological paradox. The preterm birth rates were similar, although expected to be higher in Ribeirão Preto because of the direct relationship between preterm birth and LBW. Dissociation between LBW and infant mortality was observed, since São Luís showed a lower LBW rate and higher infant mortality, while the opposite occurred in Ribeirão Preto. CONCLUSIONS: Higher prevalence of maternal smoking and better access to and quality of perinatal care, thereby leading to earlier medical interventions (cesarean section and induced preterm births) that resulted in more low weight live births than stillbirths in Ribeirão Preto, may explain these paradoxes. The ecological dissociation observed between LBW and infant mortality indicates that the LBW rate should no longer be systematically considered as an indicator of social development...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{sets forth}} an {{expansion}} on {{a model of}} uneven development, developed by Paul Krugman, in his article "Trade, Capital Accumulation and Uneven Development" from 1981. Krugman (1981) explains the phenomenon of uneven development in a model, in which the world consists of two regions trading with each other. There are two sectors in Krugman's model: an industrial sector and an agricultural sector. The agricultural sector is characterised by constant returns to scale. In the industrial sector, on the other hand, there are external economies, and so increasing returns to scale in the sector as a whole. Due to the external economies in the industrial sector, the region that starts of with the most capital will have the highest productivity. The initial lead in industrial development will cumulate over time, and this region will take the leadership in world trade. In this way, trade with the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>region</b> will prevent industrialisation in the less-developed region. The thesis proposes two changes on this and works out {{the effects of these}} changes. First, the state is assumed to subsidise education. This results in two different labour productivities. The workers with education are assumed to be more productive in the industrial sector than the workers without education. This will change the wage development in the model. The wages of the educated workers will increase when the agricultural sector is emptied of this type of labour. As wages increase, the profit rate will decrease, and so will the rate of investments. This will slow down the development, and may even lead to stagnation if the world price of manufacturing goods is low. Second, the thesis will explore the possible effects of coordinating wage bargaining. As long as wage bargaining is decentralised, each worker will try to get the highest wage possible. Higher wage demands slow down the economic development. This thesis will show that if the workers moderate their wage demands for a period, in some cases they will be better off in the long run. The effect one worker would have on the economy by moderating his wage demands would be minimal, and so it will not outweigh the private gains of a higher wage. Thus, it will not pay for a single worker to moderate his wage demands. If wage demands are coordinated, however, the workers will be able to internalise some {{of the effects of the}} wage setting. In some cases, this will lead to temporary wage moderation, so that the capitalists can invest in capital and promote economic development...|$|E

Special attention is paid to the changes in their functioning in the perspective of Poland's membership in the European Union. The evaluation of the position of firms with foreign participation in the Polish economy confirms that they play an important role in its development. This group of firms seems to be better prepared for the competition within the single European market. Foreign investors, when locating their capital abroad take into consideration different location factors. Location of firms with foreign capital in less <b>developed</b> <b>regions</b> is possible, but in practise these firms tend to locate their activities in <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions.</b> According to the recent surveys, the import of the foreign capital leads to the regional polarization of the Polish economy.

40|$|An {{inevitable}} {{consequence of}} the demographic transition and the shift to lower fertility and mortality has been the evolution in the age structure of the world population. Many societies, especially in the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions,</b> have already attained older population age structures than have ever {{been seen in the}} past. Many developing countries {{in the midst of the}} demographic transition are experiencing rapid shifts in the relative numbers of children, working-age population and older persons. DEMOGRAPHIC ASPECTS The number of persons aged 60 years or older in the world is estimated to be 605 million in 2000. This number is projected to grow to nearly 2 billion by 2050, at which time it will be as large as the population of children (0 - 14 years). This historic crossover of an increasing share of older persons and a declining share of children will mark the first time that the number of children and older persons are the same. Persons aged 60 or older currently comprise 10 per cent of the world population (see table 1). The percentage is much higher in the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions</b> (20 per cent) than in the less <b>developed</b> <b>regions</b> (8 per cent), which are at an earlier stage of the demographic transition. It is especially low in the least developed countries (5 per cent). Among individual countries, the most aged are Greece and Italy, where 24 per cent of the population is aged 60 or older in 2000. Many European countries, as well as Japan, have percentages nearly as high. By 2050, the older ages will make up a projected 22 per cent of the world population— 33 per cent in the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions,</b> 21 per cent in the less <b>developed</b> <b>regions</b> and 12 per cent in the least developed countries.
