The structure-activity relationship studies with the <b>mitonafide</b> analogs demonstrated that there was selective targeting of leishmanial nuclear topoisomerase II and human topoisomerase II and differential targeting of kinetoplast over nuclear topoisomerase II in the parasite. <b>Mitonafide</b> analogs appeared to have multiple mechanisms of action leading to death of leishmanias, but several compounds that affected kinetoplast but not nuclear topoisomerase II were not cytotoxic as determined by short-term assays. These studies provide new insight into the differential sensitivities of leishmanial nuclear and kinetoplast topoisomerase II to topoisomerase II-targeting drugs...|$|E

Their DNA-binding ability and cytotoxic activity have been evaluated. Some of the target compounds have shown high DNA affinity as well as relevant cytotoxic properties. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The DNA ligases, {{enzymes that}} seal {{breaks in the}} {{backbones}} of DNA, are essential for all organisms, however bacterial ligases essential for DNA replication use β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as their co-factor, whereas those that are essential in eukaryotes and viruses use adenosine- 5 ′-triphosphate. This fact leads {{to the conclusion that}} NAD+-dependent DNA ligases in bacteria could be targeted by their co-factor specific inhibitors. The development of novel alternative medical strategies, including new drugs, are a top priority focus areas for tuberculosis research due to {{an increase in the number}} of multi-drug resistant as well as totally drug resistant tubercle bacilli strains. Here, through the use of a virtual high-throughput screen and manual inspection of the top 200 records, 23 compounds were selected for in vitro studies. The selected compounds were evaluated in respect to their Mycobacterium tuberculosis NAD+ DNA ligase inhibitory effect by a newly developed assay based on Genetic Analyzer 3500 Sequencer. The most effective agents (e. g., pinafide, <b>mitonafide)</b> inhibited the activity of M. tuberculosis NAD+-dependent DNA ligase A at concentrations of 50 µM. At the same time, the ATP-dependent (phage) DNA LigT 4 was unaffected by the agents at concentrations up to 2 mM. The selected compounds appeared to also be active against actively growing tubercle bacilli in concentrations as low as 15 µM...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{and cancer}} {{represent}} {{two of the}} {{main causes of death}} worldwide. They are complex multifactorial diseases and several biochemical targets have been recognized to play a fundamental role in their development. Basing on their complex nature, a promising therapeutical approach could be represented by the so-called "Multi-Target-Directed Ligand" approach. This new strategy {{is based on the assumption}} that a single molecule could hit several targets responsible for the onset and/or progression of the pathology. In particular in AD, most currently prescribed drugs aim to increase the level of acetylcholine in the brain by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). However, clinical experience shows that AChE inhibition is a palliative treatment, and the simple modulation of a single target does not address AD aetiology. Research into newer and more potent anti-AD agents is thus focused on compounds whose properties go beyond AChE inhibition (such as inhibition of the enzyme Î²-secretase and inhibition of the aggregation of beta-amyloid). Therefore, the MTDL strategy seems a more appropriate approach for addressing the complexity of AD and may provide new drugs for tackling its multifactorial nature. In this thesis, it is described the design of new MTDLs able to tackle the multifactorial nature of AD. Such new MTDLs designed are less flexible analogues of Caproctamine, one of the first MTDL owing biological properties useful for the AD treatment. These new compounds are able to inhibit the enzymes AChE, beta-secretase and to inhibit both AChE-induced and self-induced beta-amyloid aggregation. In particular, the most potent compound of the series is able to inhibit AChE in subnanomolar range, to inhibit Î²-secretase in micromolar concentration and to inhibit both AChE-induced and self-induced beta-amyloid aggregation in micromolar concentration. Cancer, as AD, is a very complex pathology and many different therapeutical approaches are currently use for the treatment of such pathology. However, due to its multifactorial nature the MTDL approach could be, in principle, apply also to this pathology. Aim of this thesis has been the development of new molecules owing different structural motifs able to simultaneously interact with some of the multitude of targets responsible for the pathology. The designed compounds displayed cytotoxic activity in different cancer cell lines. In particular, the most potent compounds of the series have been further evaluated and they were able to bind DNA resulting 100 -fold more potent than the reference compound <b>Mitonafide.</b> Furthermore, these compounds were able to trigger apoptosis through caspases activation and to inhibit PIN 1 (preliminary result). This last protein is a very promising target because it is overexpressed in many human cancers, it functions as critical catalyst for multiple oncogenic pathways and in several cancer cell lines depletion of PIN 1 determines arrest of mitosis followed by apoptosis induction. In conclusion, this study may represent a promising starting pint for the development of new MTDLs hopefully useful for cancer and AD treatment. ...|$|E
