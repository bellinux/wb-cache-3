50|$|The {{question}} of {{the extension of the}} franchise, which was a burning one, was to be the principal measure of the Staaff government.

The latter chamber instead passed a bill for manhood suffrage at elections for the Second Chamber, on the condition that the elections for both chambers should take place on the basis of proportional representation. Both chambers thereupon decided to ask the opinion of the king with regard to the simultaneous extension of the franchise to women at elections for the Second Chamber. The government bill having, however, been passed by the Second Chamber, the Prime Minister proposed to the king that the Riksdag should be dissolved and new elections for the Second Chamber take place in order to hear the opinion of the country, but as the king did not approve of this Mr Staaff and his government resigned.|$|E
50|$|Lawmaking was {{essentially}} {{the job of}} the Volkskammer rather than the Länderkammer, but the latter could propose draft laws to the former. The legislative process also exhibited important differences from the West German model; the East German upper house, the Länderkammer, for example, which represented the interests of the individual states, occupied a much weaker position than its West German counterpart. The Volkskammer was constitutionally defined as the highest organ of state power. Article 51 stated that the members of the Volkskammer were to be elected in universal, equal, and secret elections based on the relative <b>majority</b> <b>principle.</b> Another important difference concerned the role of political parties in the government. According to Article 92, parties with at least 40 seats in the Volkskammer, which then had a total of 400 members, had the right to representation in the government. This policy was consistent with the SED's Marxist Alliance Policy, which stipulated that in order to achieve its aims, the party of the working class must initially work with and through other parties. It also ensured that if the SED was ever demoted to a minority position, its continued influence in the government would be safeguarded if it maintained a minimum of 40 seats. A set of basic human rights, including the right to strike (Article 14) and to emigrate (Article 10) retained features of a liberal Rechtsstaat and formally guaranteed that sovereignty would remain vested in the people.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method of polarimetric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification using improved superpixel segmentation and manifold learning. Firstly, a 27 -dimension polarimetric feature space is extracted by simple arithmetic operations of polarimetric parameters and polarimetric target decomposition. Secondly, Laplacian Eigenmap (LE) algorithm is used to reduce the dimension of the 27 -dimension polarimetric features. This algorithm can reduce redundant information in feature space and extract the main information. Then, the paper uses SVM which has the best classification performance to classify the low-dimension PolSAR data for the first time. And then, the superpixel segmentation is obtained by improving SLIC algorithm. At last, the <b>majority</b> voting <b>principle</b> is used to classify the superpixel blocks, which is the second classification and final classification of PolSAR data.|$|R

40|$|The {{merit of}} {{approval}} voting {{has been widely}} discussed in the past 25 years. The distinct property of this rule is the extent of flexibility it allows; any voter can approve as many alternatives/candidates as he wishes. Nevertheless, this advantage is the very reason for two drawbacks of approval voting: its extreme vulnerability to majority decisiveness (Theorem 1) and its extreme vulnerability to erosion of the <b>majority</b> <b>principle</b> (Theorem 2). On the one hand, under some feasible voting strategies any majority of more than 1 / 2 of the voters can guarantee the selection of its most favorable candidate, regardless of the preferences of the other voters. On the other hand, under alternative voting strategies even the largest majority cannot impose its common most preferred candidate. A simultaneous resolution of the two problems is possible by restricted approval voting (RAV), a voting rule that allows partial voter flexibility by restricting the minimal and maximal number of candidates that can be approved. Our main result (Theorem 3) clarifies how the foregone flexibility in voters’ sovereignty mitigates the above mentioned drawbacks under sincere and insincere coordinated voting. Our findings suggest a new possible justification of a particular voting rule {{which is based on}} the significance assigned to three considerations: the advantages of voters’ flexibility, immunity to majority decisiveness and immunity to erosion of the <b>majority</b> <b>principle.</b> Such justification can provide a possible explanation to the prevalent use of some special cases of RAV, notably, of the plurality rule and of approval voting.
