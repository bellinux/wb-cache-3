50|$|<b>Meroplankton</b> species {{composition}} depends on spatial distribution and reproductive habits of adults {{in a given}} area. Biotic and abiotic factors such as tidal and lunar cycles and availability of food determine adult spawning schedules, in turn, determining subsequent <b>meroplankton</b> populations. Behavioural factors, such as predator avoidance are also important. Freshwater inputs {{play a key role}} in <b>meroplankton</b> {{species composition}} in estuarine environments. Effects of tides contribute greatly to <b>meroplankton</b> species distribution. One study conducted in a Patagonian Fjord found that species composition of the <b>meroplankton</b> community depended on the seasonally varying input levels from the Baker river as well as vertical and horizontal stratification of the water column. Events such as wind driven upwelling and downwelling also affect <b>meroplankton</b> species distribution. Most species are swept in the direction of the flow of water, either off shore during an upwelling or near shore during a downwelling. Some species, such as bivalve larvae, have the ability to maintain their nearshore position during these events.|$|E
5000|$|Water and benthos {{pollution}} from industrial sources {{has been demonstrated}} to have varying effects on biological diversity and survival potential of <b>meroplankton.</b> One study conducted in the Vostok Bay region in Russia, demonstrated {{that even in the}} presence of industrial pollutants, most species of <b>meroplankton</b> were able to proliferate almost unaffected. The authors of this study attribute these findings to the fact that <b>meroplankton</b> are transported by ocean currents generally from cleaner open waters inshore. Furthermore, the same study also concluded that even in heavily polluted areas, <b>meroplankton</b> populations were able to reestablish if pollution was brought under control and sufficient time was allowed to pass. However, the rate of recolonization was demonstrated to be notably slow, on average talking about 10 years before the abundance and diversity of <b>meroplankton</b> returned to its original levels. This is in part due to the slow nature of detoxification of benthic sediments, which retain much of the heavy metal pollution ...|$|E
5000|$|Survival rate of <b>Meroplankton</b> is {{critical}} to successful development of adult organisms. Low survival rates of <b>meroplankton</b> will result in reduction in adult population numbers. One factor which often determines <b>meroplankton</b> survival is larval dispersal. Most species within the <b>meroplankton</b> community rely on ocean currents for dispersal. Currents {{play a key role}} in delivering larval organisms to specific settlement locations, where they are able to transition and mature into adult forms. Organisms which do not make it to the right settlement site are unlikely to complete their lifecycle. Scientists in recent years have also discovered that many of these tiny animals in the plankton (in particular larval fish and crustaceans) quickly become very good swimmers capable of incredible feats of speed and endurance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meroplankton</b> is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} {{a wide variety of}} planktonic organisms, which spend a portion of their lives in the benthic region of the ocean. These organisms do not remain as plankton permanently, rather, they are planktonic components in transition, which eventually become larger organisms. After a period of time in the plankton, <b>meroplankton</b> either graduate to the nekton or adopt a benthic (often sessile) lifestyle on the seafloor. <b>Meroplankton</b> consists of larval stages of organisms such as sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans and dinoflagellates and diatoms. <b>Meroplankton</b> forms an algal medium that is found between the loosely mixed sediments and water. This layer can be re-suspended in the water column by turbulent mixing. Success of <b>meroplankton</b> populations depends on many factors, such as adult fecundity, fertilization success, growth and larval stage duration, behaviour, dispersal, and settlement. Mortality depends on many factors, such as predation, competition, disease, parasites, and physiological stresses. Survival and mortality of <b>meroplankton</b> has a direct effect on adult population numbers of many species. Many of the common, well-known animals found on the Great Barrier Reef spend time as free-swimming <b>meroplankton,</b> bearing little or no resemblance to the adult they will become. The differences between the appearance of larval and adult stages led to much confusion in the past when larval forms were often believed to be completely different species from the adults. Larvae spend varying amounts of time in the plankton, from minutes to over a year. However, just how long these tiny animals can be considered truly planktonic is under some debate.|$|E
50|$|A {{major factor}} {{affecting}} <b>meroplankton</b> survival is food availability. While {{living in the}} plankton, <b>meroplankton</b> either feed on {{other members of the}} plankton, or they live off the yolk they have retained from the egg they hatched from. Many members of the <b>meroplankton</b> community rely on the surrounding planktonic community for nutrition. In order to ensure that larvae have sufficient amounts of nutrition, many species coordinate larval release with times of algal blooms. This synchronicity between release of larvae and algal blooms often leads to <b>Meroplankton</b> making up the largest percentage of the planktonic community during such reproductive periods. It has been demonstrated that certain species are able to commence spawning as they come into contact with phytoplankton cells. These species store embryos in the mantle cavity until they detect algal blooms. This adaptation allows for better larval survival.|$|E
50|$|Within the plankton, {{holoplankton}} {{spend their}} entire life cycle as plankton (e.g. most algae, copepods, salps, and some jellyfish). By contrast, <b>meroplankton</b> are only planktic {{for part of}} their lives (usually the larval stage), and then graduate to either a nektic (swimming) or benthic (sea floor) existence. Examples of <b>meroplankton</b> include the larvae of sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans, marine worms, and most fish.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} in the North Sea between 1958-2005, collected samples of <b>meroplankton</b> using a CPR survey. These samples consisted of larval echinoderms, decapods, bivalves, cirripedes, and ectoprocts. <b>Meroplankton</b> abundance as well as PCI levels (amount of chlorophyll in each sample in relation to sea surface temperature) were examined. Researchers concluded that echinoderm larvae increased in abundance throughout the study, with the largest increase occurring in the Northern and Central regions. Decapod larvae were found to increase in abundance as well, and were found to appear earlier in the year. Bivalve larvae showed an overall decline in abundance. It was also concluded that PCI levels increased throughout the study, particularly during the summer months. It was determined that climate, particularly sea surface temperature, drives <b>meroplankton</b> abundance. Warmer sea surface temperature shortens developmental time of the larvae, increasing their survival rate.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Meroplankton</b> {{diversity}} and abundance {{are affected by}} many factors. Seasonal and spatial variations are {{among some of the}} main causes of such variability. A study which was conducted in Dunkellin Estuary, determined that spawning times of many species are timed to maximize food availability at a particular time of year, while minimizing presence of other species which exploit the same food source [...] Diversity and abundance are depth dependent qualities. Generally, shallow coastal waters contain far greater numbers of <b>meroplankton</b> than deep, open ocean waters. Most abundant regions occur at depths between 0 and 200 meters of the water column, where light penetration is highest. Availability of sunlight allows for proliferation of phytoplankton, which serves as one of the major food sources for <b>meroplankton.</b> Deep oceanic waters show significantly lower abundance than shelf regions, due to poor light penetration.|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{patterns}} in abundance {{and composition of}} benthic invertebrate larvae (<b>meroplankton),</b> the correlation between these patterns and environmental variables (temperature, salinity and chl a) and the relative abundance of <b>meroplankton</b> in the mesozooplankton community were investigated in the sub-Arctic Porsangerfjord, Norway (70 ° N). Zooplankton samples and CTD-profiles were collected at 17 stations along the fjord in April 2013. A total of 32 morphologically different larval types belonging to 8 phyla were identified. <b>Meroplankton</b> were found at all stations, and their community and abundance differed significantly along the fjord. <b>Meroplankton</b> abundance in {{the inner and outer}} parts of the fjord was low and was dominated by Gastropoda and Echinodermata.

These changes in community structure were attributed to spatial gradients in environmental variables such as chl a, salinity and temperature. The different communities suggested a seasonal succession in reproductive events from the fjord mouth toward the head.

40|$|Many benthic {{marine organisms}} produce pelagic larvae, <b>meroplankton,</b> which spend from hours to {{months in the}} pelagic. During this time, they form an {{important}} part of the pelagic community. Few studies have focused on the year round dynamics of <b>meroplankton,</b> thus many aspects of <b>meroplankton</b> dynamics remains unknown at high-latitudes. In the 1960 s the red king crab was intentionally introduced into Russian waters and now serves as an important resource for Norway and Russia while at the same time posing a threat to the ecosystem. Currently there is no knowledge on when and where larvae are released in Norwegian waters. The objectives of this thesis were to increase our understanding on the seasonal and spatial dynamics of <b>meroplankton</b> at high-latitudes, identify environmental variables responsible for spawning and the potential role of <b>meroplankton</b> in the pelagic. The temporal and spatial dynamics of red king crab larvae was also investigated. Sampling monthly to bi-monthly over a 1. 5 -years in Porsangerfjord, Norway, showed that <b>meroplankton</b> abundance and assemblage separate into different seasonal communities. The highest abundance and greatest number of taxa occurs in spring and summer, correlating with increased chlorophyll a and temperature. Numerically, <b>meroplankton</b> contributed highly to the mesozooplankton community these seasons, suggesting that they are an important component of the pelagic food web. In spring, different <b>meroplankton</b> assemblages were found along the fjord and correlated with temperature and chlorophyll a. This provides evidence that larval release by benthic invertebrates is coupled with variations in these environmental variables. In a warming ocean this coupling could cause a shift in reproductive phenology and a range expansion of benthic organisms. Larvae of the red king crab were continually released over a period of six months and the greatest densities of larvae was found at protected stations. Having a prolonged larval release is advantageous for this invasive species as it ensures some larvae coincides with favorable conditions. These findings coupled with a wide tolerance to environments as larvae and adults means that they have the potential to continue their expansion in Norway and north into Svalbard waters...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about larval {{processes}} {{that occur in the}} temperate estuarine waters of Australia. <b>Meroplankton,</b> a term used to describe organisms that spend usually their larval stages of their life-cycle in a planktonic form, are common inhabitants of the estuarine system. In the saltmarsh and mangroves that fringe most estuaries in temperate Australia, some <b>meroplankton</b> groups have developed endogenous timing to environmental (exogenous) factors. These environmental factors are the result of periodic cycles that arise from the forces of the sun and moon acting on the earth. Specifically, <b>meroplankton</b> time larval release and supply to diel (light/dark), tidal (flood/ebb), tidal amplitude and lunar cycles. Coinciding the timing of larval release and supply to these cycles is thought to increase their likelihood of survival, by reducing times when <b>meroplankton</b> are exposed to predation and inhospitable physical factors. Few studies have examined the life histories of estuarine intertidal fauna in Australia and this study attempts to add to this limited body of knowledge. The current study aimed to examine the role each environmental cycle has on the abundance of larval <b>meroplankton</b> and their spatial and temporal patterns during these cycles. This was tested by collecting larvae in the lower saltmarsh and mangrove habitats at two estuaries during times when key phases of the environmental cycles occurred. Multifactorial designs and analyses were used to test diel, tidal, tidal-amplitude and lunar factors and that may drive spatial and temporal patterns. The light/dark and tidal cycle interaction was the main driver for larval release and supply for crab larvae, which usually accounted {{for the majority of the}} <b>meroplankton</b> in the samples. Specifically, larval crabs occurred at great densities during the nocturnal ebb tide. Gastropod and polychaete larvae, which were also substantially large in most samples, appeared to show no conclusive release or supply patterns to environmental cycles, although at times were greater in densities on specific diel and tidal phases. During the lunar and tidal phases, great <b>meroplankton</b> abundances occurred during the ebb tides compared with flood tides, and these results were significant during new-moon ebb tides. However, significant month-to-month variation during the ebb tides could have just as likely explained differences between <b>meroplankton</b> abundances. This study builds on the few studies in Australia that have examined larval release and supply. For organisms with a planktonic life history, the dispersal of their larvae largely influences adult population community structure. Further, the periods during which these processes occur increase the productivity of the estuary through predator-prey interactions. As a result, the ecological value of the saltmarsh and mangrove habitats is being understood and recognised. Further studies are needed to gain a greater insight into larval <b>meroplankton</b> life histories and the processes that influence them, until then it remains difficult to make generalisations about larval release and supply within and between temperate estuaries in Australia...|$|E

Here, we report on a 1 -year study of <b>meroplankton</b> seasonal variability from a fjordic system in the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. The study combines an examination of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and hard bottom benthic settlement with measurements of environmental parameters (e. g., water temperature, particulate organic matter, and dissolved organic carbon).

The occurrence of benthic larvae varied between the seasons, reaching a maximum in both abundance and taxon richness in late spring through early summer. Meroplanktonic larvae were absent in winter. However, settlement of benthic organisms was also recorded during the winter months (February and March), which indicates individual trade-offs related to timing of reproduction and competition. In addition, it suggests that these larvae are not relying on higher summer nutrient concentrations, but instead are dependent on alternative food sources.

Larval palatability assays were conducted by collecting live invertebrate larvae from a temperate field site and offering them to a suite of common predators (the fishes Lagodon rhomboides, Leiostomus xanthurus, and Monacanthus hispidus and the hard coral Oculina arbuscula). By crushing larvae that were rejected intact and re-offering them to predators, it was possible to distinguish between defenses based on morphological and chemical characteristics of the larvae. Additionally, abundance data were collected for taxonomic groups of larvae at our sampling location. The majority of invertebrate larvae were palatable to consumers. Most predators readily consumed polychaete larvae, barnacle nauplii, bivalve veligers, shrimp zoeae, crab megalopae, phoronid actinotrochs, and hemichordate tornaria (which together accounted for 65 % of <b>meroplankton</b> abundance), suggesting that these larvae lacked effective morphological or chemical defenses. Against at least 1 fish predator, a significant number of gastropod veligers, barnacle cyprids, crab zoeae, and stomatopod larvae (which accounted for 34 % of <b>meroplankton</b> abundance) appeared to be morphologically defended.

Behavioural adaptations to these environmental variables are compared within and between the holo- and <b>meroplankton</b> constituents of a community. We used a nested design to analyse patterns at several scales in time; (semi-diel, diel, spring-neap tidal cycle and season) and two in space; (depth and site). To reduce complexity and aid interpretation we studied a semi-isolated community in a semi-enclosed, seasonally stratified sea lough (Lough Hyne Marine Nature Reserve, Ireland). In this, the main environmental gradient was water flow rate (or water residence time) caused by tidal currents. Vertical profiles of abundance showed that populations of the most abundant species of holo- and <b>meroplankton</b> in the lough have considerable behavioural plasticity, enabling them to switch between sedentary and migratory behaviour and patterns of migration. Some species migrate vertically in synchrony with diel cycles and others in response to semi-diel tidal currents; a few do both, but the majority did neither.

40|$|International audienceThe {{relationship}} between <b>meroplankton</b> distribution and spatio-temporal variabil- ity of coastal mesoscale hydrological structure {{was investigated in}} the northern Bay of Biscay, North-East Atlantic. For the three coastal polychaetes studied, i. e. Pectinaria koreni, Owenia fusiformis and Sabellaria alveolata, the highest larval abun- dances were sampled in low-salinity, low-density and high-temperature river plume waters. For two species (P. koreni and O. fusiformis), maximal abundances were observed in the surface and thermocline layers due to ontogenic migrations. Variance partitioning based on multiple regression and redundancy analyses {{was used to assess}} the relative roles played by the hydrological environment alone, the geographical space alone and their interactions, i. e. the spatial structure of the hydrological environment. These analyses demonstrate the key role played by the hydrological spatial structure in the distribution of larval abundances. The hydrological environment alone was insignificant, whereas geographical space alone explained {{a significant part of the}} variability in <b>meroplankton</b> distribution, probably in conjunction with ecological processes. For species whose benthic populations are spatially structured, the distribution and the size of adult popu- lations and the timing of spawning events can significantly affect larval distribution and dispersal...|$|E
40|$|Most marine benthic macroinvertebrate species {{reproduce}} via a larval phase but {{attempts to}} explain the occurrence of different larval strategies (feeding or non-feeding, pelagic or benthic) in different habitats have been largely inconclusive. There have been very few year-round surveys of <b>meroplankton</b> at any latitude and in consequence fundamental data on the diversity, abundance, and timings of larval life history phases are lacking. There has been considerable debate regarding the viability of pelagic larvae in cold waters with highly seasonal primary production {{but there has been}} only one year-round study of <b>meroplankton</b> in the Southern Ocean, and that was outside of the Antarctic Circle. We present data from the first year-round survey of <b>meroplankton</b> assemblages at a location within the Antarctic Circle. We surveyed abundances of meroplanktonic larvae over 1. 5 year at Rothera Point, West Antarctic Peninsula (67 A degrees 34 'S, 68 A degrees 07 'W). Larvae were collected in monthly diver-towed net samples close to the seabed at 20 and 6 m total water depths at each of three locations and were identified and counted live immediately after sampling. A total of 99 operationally defined taxonomic types representing 11 phyla were recorded but this is likely to be an underestimate of true diversity because of inherent difficulties of identification. Larvae were present in all months of the year and although planktotrophic larvae were more abundant in summer, both feeding and non-feeding types were present in all months. Comparisons of seasonal larval abundances with data from a settlement study at the same sites and from the literature show that larvae of mobile adults settle in summer regardless of developmental type, whereas sessile taxa settle in all seasons. We suggest that this is a consequence of differences in the food requirements of mobile and sessile fauna and that the availability of food for post-larval juveniles is more critical for survival than factors affecting the larval stage itself...|$|E

Phytoplankton and zooplankton densities were found to decrease with distance from the Raritan-Hudson River estuary. Phytoplankton populations were dominated by diatoms (cold months) and chlorophytes (warm months) in the estuary and apex and by diatoms in the outer Bight. Zooplankton populations were dominated by copepods and <b>meroplankton</b> (summer only) in the estuary and by copepods in the Bight...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the size {{dependency}} of grazing and growth rates in zooplankton, data wcrc collected from laboratory studies in the literature, covering both limnic and marinc organisms. Data were obtained from about 60 species of nano-, micro-, and mesozooplankton, representing flagellates, ciliates, rotifers, <b>meroplankton</b> larvae, copepods, and cladocerans. Estimates of maximum ingestion and clearance were extracted from functional responses (ingestion rates {{as a function of}} food density) cstablishcd from laboratory experiments. Maximum specific rates were expressed as a function of predator body volume. Maximum specific clearance and ingestion rates decreased with predator volume within each group of zooplankton, with a-common exponent (scaling factor) of- 0. 23 (SE = 20. 12) in accordance with previous findings. However, significant differences wcrc found between groups. In particular, among the protists, ciliates display maximum ingestion, growth, and clearance rates that exceed those of dinoflagellates by a factor of 2 - 4. Among the metazooplankton, Calanoid copepods have maximum clearance rates that cxcccd those of filter-feeding cladocerans and <b>meroplankton</b> larvae by a factor of 10. Because of these differenccs between the groups, the entire set of observations could not be fitted by an overall regression. Quantification of zooplankton grazing and production has been subject to intensive research for decades. A variety of methods have been introduced, including radioactive tracer...|$|E

40|$|Manuel C. Rodríguez Hidalgo et al. Studies {{investigating}} the environmental {{influence on the}} structure of meroplanktonic communities generally focus on fish larvae. To our knowledge, no study to date has combined information on other important groups of the <b>meroplankton</b> such as decapod crustaceans and cephalopods. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of a summer <b>meroplankton</b> community in the upper water column of the Balearic Sea (Western Mediterranean). The study compares 2 contrasting years (2004 and 2005) in terms of hydrographic (i. e. thermal pattern, spatial structure of the oceanic front) and biological (i. e. origin and composition of phytoplankton) components of the pelagic seascape. Our results reveal that both year-specific drivers, such as salinity gradient, and common factors between years, such as chlorophyll concentration, influence the community structure. This resulted in a contrasting influence between years of hydrographic and biological components of the seascape, which implies an alternating effect of dispersal pathways and retention to coupling productive conditions. The study characterizes recurrent environmental scenarios associated with different co-occurring fish and decapod crustacean larvae (i. e. mixed assemblages), the most relevant being: (1) recent Atlantic waters of low salinity, (2) resident waters of higher salinity, and (3) high chlorophyll concentration at depth of chlorophyll maximum. This study sheds new light on the complex responses of plankton communities to exogenous drivers in highly variable environments such as frontal systems. © 2014 Inter-Research. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|During June and September 1984, {{zooplankton}} {{samples were}} collected with other hydrographic and biological data along the Galician coast (NW of Spain). In June copepods contributed - 60 % to the total zooplankton community, with larvaceans, siphonophores and cladocerans also abundant. In September > 90 % of the zooplankton sampled were copepods. The dominant species of copepods in both June and September were Acartia e/ausi, Paracalanus parvus and Temora longicornis. The <b>meroplankton</b> was dominated by echinoderms, bryozoans, barnacle larvae and bivalve larvae. In June the average zooplankton biomass was 31. 08 mg e m- 3; the September average was 41. 69 mg e m- 3 The relationship between {{the slopes of the}} regression equations (biomass versus abundance) suggests that the zooplankton assemblage in June was composed by larger animals than in September. The major concentration of zooplankton was between O and SO m, with both June and September daytime surface samples having 6 - 7 times the amount of organisms than the lower water column (50 - 100 m). There were no distinct differences in total zooplankton abundances at the inshore and offshore stations; however, the inshore stations often had a higher percentage of <b>meroplankton</b> than the offshore stations. In June zooplankton abundance at the northern transects and the western transects was similar. In September there were greater concentrations of zooplankton in the western Galician shelf as compared with the northern shelf. These differences in the horizontal distribution of the zooplankton were related to upwelling events. Postprin...|$|E
