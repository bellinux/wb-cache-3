50|$|Almy was a {{coal mining}} camp in Uinta County, Wyoming, {{near the town}} of Evanston. In 1881 an {{explosion}} killed 38 miners in the Central Pacific <b>Mine,</b> <b>marking</b> the first mine explosion west of the Mississippi River. Another explosion killed 13 in 1886, and a third explosion in Red Canyon in 1895 killed 62 miners, the third worst mining disaster in Wyoming history. Following the second explosion, the Wyoming territorial legislature established the office of the state mining inspector, which subsequently shut down the Almy mines in the 1940s after it was deemed too dangerous to mine there.|$|E

It has been widely shown that the top coal caving hydraulic support is the decisive factor that makes the fully mechanized caving mining the safe, efficient, and high-recovery mining technology for thick and super thick coal seam.|$|R
50|$|Gold mining in the United States {{has taken}} place {{continually}} since the discovery of gold at the Reed farm in North Carolina in 1799. The first documented occurrence of gold was in Virginia in 1782. Some minor gold production took place in North Carolina as early as 1793, but created no excitement. The discovery on the Reed farm in 1799 which was identified as gold in 1802 and subsequently <b>mined</b> <b>marked</b> the first commercial production.|$|R
25|$|The coal {{industry}} survived several disasters, including an explosion at Wilkes-Barre's Baltimore Colliery in 1919, which killed 92 miners. It {{could not survive}} the gradual switch {{in the country to}} other energy sources. Most coal operations left Wilkes-Barre by the end of World War II. The 1959 Knox Mine Disaster, resulting in the flooding of numerous <b>mines,</b> <b>marked</b> the end of King Coal's heyday. Industrial restructuring also caused the city to lose jobs and go into a decades-long decline.|$|R

50|$|The last 900 mm gauge mine railway in the German {{state of}} Saxony, a major mining area in central Europe, was closed in 1999 at the Zwenkau Mine in Leipzig. Once a very {{extensive}} railway network, {{towards the end}} it only had 70 kilometres of movable 900 mm track and 90 kilometres of 900 mm fixed railway track within the Zwenkau open cast mine site itself, {{as well as a}} 20-kilometre, standard gauge, link railway for the coal trains to the power stations (1995-1999). The closure of this <b>mine</b> <b>marked</b> the end of the history of 900 mm mine railways in the lignite mines of Saxony. In December 1999, the last 900 mm railway in the Central German coal mining field in Lusatia was closed.|$|R

25|$|Otto Schoetensack had {{the site}} {{at the bottom}} of the sand <b>mine</b> <b>marked</b> with a {{commemorative}} stone on which a horizontal line represented the level of the find. Whether his wish had been granted - namely that the stone may remain in its place, even if the sand mine will one day be re-filled - is unknown. In fact, the part of the mine, in which the lower jaw came to light, was filled with overburden in the 1930s, later re-natured as arable land and declared a nature reserve in 1982. The actual site is therefore not accessible for research at the present time. Absolute dating of the strata using contemporary scientific methods proved to be not possible. Alternatively scientists have repeatedly tried to deduce the age of the fossil's layer, using stratigraphic methods.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Mine</b> {{detector}} <b>Mark</b> I was a {{metal detector}} for landmines developed during World War II.

Voltes V was designed by Professor Kentaro Gō (Doctor Ned Armstrong), his wife Professor Mitsuyo Gō (Doctor Mary Ann Armstrong) and their trusted colleague, Professor Hamaguchi (Doctor Richard Smith) and built by large scale construction effort backed by United Nations Earth Defense Force and General Oka (Commander Robinson).

2500|$|The Squadron {{was also}} {{occupied}} with route and mine clearance. The SADF laid recognised, marked and fenced, anti-personnel minefields typically as perimeter protection to bases and vital assets. The SADF reported laying 45,000 mines during {{the conflict of}} which 3,000 were unaccounted for when UNTAG arrived. SWAPO employed mines {{as a means of}} ambushing or intimidation. Much of the work of the 75 Field Engineers deployed with each contingent was area search, clearance of exposed <b>mines,</b> <b>marking</b> minefields and route clearance. Colonel John Crocker, the Commander of the 2nd Contingent wrote that [...] "For {{the first time since the}} Vietnam War, Australian Sappers hand cleared their way into live minefields on seven separate occasions to destroy exposed mines. Similar mines killed several civilians and many animals during the mission. Field engineers of the contingent destroyed over 5,000 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO) ranging from artillery shells, through RPG rockets to grenades. UXO, a legacy of the 20-year Bush War, posed a major hazard to local inhabitants in the northern provinces and to UNTAG personnel in that area".|$|R

5000|$|Ippei <b>Mine</b> (<b>Mark</b> Gordon), Born on November 24 an 18 {{year old}} rodeo champion, was {{orphaned}} while still a young boy. His mother died {{trying to save}} him from a pack of wolves. After his mother's death, he grew bitter, aloof, but cool under crisis. He learned how {{to live in the}} streets and perform odd jobs. This kind of life strengthened his personality. Upon joining the rodeo, he learned to ride horses and how to use a whip. He found his greatest friend in a white stallion known as Eiffel ("Alpha"). The two, man and beast, became inseparable. He won two rodeo championship contests with Eiffel as his horse. Then one day, The Earth International Defense Force asked Ippei to join the team. When he refused, he was taken forcibly, so for the first time, Ippei and Eiffel were separated. Dr. Hamaguchi has Eiffel brought to Big Falcon early in the series. His uniform was blue. Voiced by Kazuyuki Sogabe in the original Voltes V series. He pilots the Volt Bomber (Boruto Bonbā) (Arms) and has a Maverick and Iceman-like rivalry with Ken'ichi.|$|R
