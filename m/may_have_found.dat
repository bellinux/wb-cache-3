5|$|Merchants and peasant farmers paid {{property}} and poll taxes in coin cash and land taxes with {{a portion of}} their crop yield. Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners, in businesses like breweries or by selling agricultural goods and homemade wares at urban markets. The Han government <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Even though Sava's {{diplomacy}} was of {{no effect}} either, Strez died the night after Sava's departure. Serbian sources present the death of Strez as a miracle, Strez being stabbed by an angel, though in reality he was very likely murdered in a plot orchestrated by Sava. Historian John V. A. Fine theorizes that Sava <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> supporters among Strez's nobles, {{some of whom had}} turned against him and organized his murder, only to defect to Serbia immediately afterwards. According to the hagiography of Saint Sava, in his dying words Strez claimed he was stabbed by a young soldier on the order of Sava.|$|E
5|$|In the Mahabharata retelling, when Sugriva re-challenges Vali, Tara dissuades Vali {{from going}} to the fight and points out that Sugriva <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> a protector. Tara, {{described}} as lustrous like the moon, is praised by Vali as one who understands the language of all creatures and is astute to clarify her statement. Tara warns him about Sugriva's alliance with Rama and the plotting of Vali's death {{at the hands of}} Sugriva and his advisers. Vali not only disregards Tara's advice, but also suspects Tara of cheating on him with Sugriva. Vali leaves, speaking harshly to Tara.|$|E

The agents discover a large complex of filing cabinets containing smallpox vaccination records and tissue samples. Mulder finds his sister's file and finds that it was originally meant for him. Meanwhile, Skinner tells the Smoking Man that he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> the digital tape. The Smoking Man is agitated at this, insisting {{that he will not}} make a deal with Skinner and tacitly threatening his life.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists accept Allosaurus as {{an active}} {{predator}} of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on Stegosaurus, including an Allosaurus tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a Stegosaurus tail spike, and a Stegosaurus neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an Allosaurus snout. Sauropods seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of scavenging, based {{on the presence of}} scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones. However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988, Allosaurus was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods. Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults. Research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> other solutions to this question. Robert T. Bakker, comparing Allosaurus to Cenozoic sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although Allosaurus did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a saw-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.|$|E

25|$|The {{love of a}} {{good man}} was {{ultimately}} what redeemed Rachel. At a welcoming party thrown in his honor, Rachel crossed paths with wealthy publisher, Mac Cory (Douglass Watson). Originally, Mac was a love interest for Liz Matthews, but Lemay noticed the chemistry between Watson and Wyndham and wrote a love story for them. Fearing backlash from viewers who <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> an older man-younger woman relationship tasteless, Lemay penned chance encounters for the two characters, which led to innocent yet intimate conversations.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{poetry in}} the {{contemporary}} era has been {{moving out of the}} mainstream and onto the college and university campus. The growth in the popularity of graduate creative writing programs has given poets the opportunity to make a living as teachers. This increased professionalization of poetry, combined with the reluctance of most major book and magazine presses to publish poetry, has meant that, for the foreseeable future at least, poetry <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> its new home in the academy and in small independent journals.|$|E

25|$|Some {{companies}} {{included a}} complimentary blank cassette with their portable cassette recorders {{in the early}} 1980s. Panasonic's was a C14 and came with a song recorded on side one, and a blank side two. Except for C74 and C100, such non-standard lengths always {{have been hard to}} find, and tend to be more expensive than the more popular lengths. Home taping enthusiasts <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> certain lengths useful for fitting an album neatly on one or both sides of a tape. For instance, the initial maximum playback time of Compact Discs was 74 minutes, explaining the relative popularity of C74 cassettes.|$|E
25|$|The Dorset/Thule culture {{transition}} dates {{around the}} 9th–10th centuries. Scientists theorize {{that there may}} have been cross-contact of the two cultures with sharing of technology, such as fashioning harpoon heads, or the Thule <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> Dorset remnants and adapted their ways with the predecessor culture. Others believe the Thule displaced the Dorset. By 1300, the Inuit, present-day Arctic inhabitants and descendants of Thule culture, had settled in west Greenland, and moved into east Greenland over the following century. Over time, the Inuit have migrated throughout the Arctic regions of Canada, Greenland, Russia, and the United States.|$|E
25|$|In visual art, the plagues have {{generally}} been reserved for works in series, especially engravings. Still, relatively few depictions in art emerged compared to other religious themes until the 19th century, when the plagues became more common subjects, with John Martin and Joseph Turner producing notable canvases. This trend probably reflected a Romantic attraction to landscape and nature painting, for which the plagues were suited, a Gothic attraction to morbid stories, and a rise in Orientalism, wherein exotic Egyptian themes found currency. Given the importance of noble patronage throughout Western art history, the plagues <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> consistent disfavor because the stories emphasize the limits of a monarch's power, and images of lice, locusts, darkness, and boils were ill-suited for decoration in palaces and churches.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the {{settlement}} of Rezzonico are also debated. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been <b>founded</b> by the Orobii, a Celtic tribe which was settled in the areas around Como, Lecco and Bergamo, between the River Ticino and Oglio; there <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been an Etruscan origin of the settlement too; or it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been <b>founded</b> by other Gaulish tribes, possibly even the Senones.

25|$|It is also {{speculated that}} such an {{invasion}} {{may have been the}} origin of the presence of the Brigantes in Ireland as noted in Ptolemy's 2nd century Geography. The Brigantes were a rebellious British tribe only recently conquered in Agricola's time. The dispossessed nobility may have been ready recruits for Tuathal's invasion force, or the Romans <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it a convenient way of getting rid of troublesome subjects, just as Elizabeth I and James VI & I planted rebellious Scots in Ireland in the 16th and 17th century. Other tribal names associated with the south-east, including the Domnainn, related to the British Dumnonii, and the Menapii, also known from Gaul (Roman France), may also date from such an invasion.|$|E
25|$|Searching {{through the}} closets of Orthanc, King Elessar {{and his aides}} found the long lost first Elendilmir, a white star of Elvish crystal affixed to a fillet of mithril. Once owned by Elendil, the first King of Arnor, it was an emblem of royalty in the North Kingdom. After Elendil fell in the War of the Last Alliance, his eldest son Isildur ascended to the throne. On his journey back to the {{northern}} capital of Arnor, his retinue was ambushed by orcs. Isildur tried to escape by jumping into a river but was killed by arrows. Saruman <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> his body there, and taken the Elendilmir from it. A replica was made, which was used by Isildur's successors up to the re-establishment of the kingdom (reunited with Gondor) by Elessar. He thus used both, using {{one or the other}} on certain occasions.|$|E
25|$|In June 1899, Ranjitsinhji was {{appointed}} Sussex captain after Murdoch retired, ahead of other amateur cricketers. George Brann captained the county's first match after Murdoch stood down but he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{the position to}} be too difficult and Ranjitsinhji led the team {{for the remainder of}} the season. The press regarded his first season as a success as a late sequence of matches without defeat took Sussex to fifth in the County Championship, the highest position achieved by the team to that point. As captain, Ranjitsinhji took great care over details such as weather conditions, but some of his innovations, such as the frequent changing of the person bowling or implementing fielding practice, were unpopular with the players. He took the opportunity of leading the side to increase the amount of bowling he did, taking 31 wickets in the season. But the team's lack of effective bowlers was a problem before Ranjitsinhji took over.|$|E
25|$|In the Late Formative era, {{a number}} of urban centers arose in central Mexico. The most {{prominent}} of these {{appears to have been}} Cuicuilco, on the southern shore of Lake Texcoco.
