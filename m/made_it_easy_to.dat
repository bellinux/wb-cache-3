This {{included}} tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that {{might be used to}} construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine thermal stability of materials, and to train operators.|$|E
5|$|Kalata and Snelgrove {{thought that}} Puzzle de Call {{featured}} interesting ideas, {{but that there}} was not anything special about it. They enjoyed how Messiah Riser was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting. Famitsu writers thought that Card Summoner rules were very complex, but noted that the tutorial <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> learn.|$|E
5|$|Sydenham Hill {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{locations}} in London; 109metres (357ft) above sea level (spot height on Ordnance Survey Map); {{and the size of the}} Palace and prominence of the site <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> identify from much of London. This led to the residential area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill. The Palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to Miyamoto's design {{mentality of}} {{creating}} the gameplay system first, development started out with the scenario writing, which Flagship was in charge of. Some of the staff members, the team led by director and designer Hidemaro Fujibayashi that was responsible for tasks other than the storyline, wanted to skip the remake and create an original Zelda title right away. As the first installment in the series was deemed too difficult for {{the new generation of}} players, more and more changes were applied {{to the point where it}} had an entirely different world map. As a result, the team ran into problems because the scenario and the maps had to be reworked constantly to make all the modifications match. The Game Boy Color's screen presented an additional hurdle when attempting to rework the earlier Zelda title as it is narrower than that of a television; players could not view an entire room without scrolling which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> overlook stairways or clues on walls.|$|E
5|$|The first Wellington N2960 {{took off}} from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09:27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett at the controls. No. 9 Squadron {{took off from}} the nearby RAF Honington and formed up over King's Lynn and started out over the North Sea. Feltwell's No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the {{rendezvous}} and {{caught up with the}} main formation an hour later over the North Sea. Once over the Wash they set a course of 040° true, as far as latitude 55°north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands. However, as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal clear sky. Two bombers, N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned due south, continuing their mission in perfect visibility which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> be spotted by German aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The M3 saw {{action for}} the first time during the defense of the Philippines in December 1941. It {{went on to become a}} factor in the Guadalcanal Campaign, where it was {{successfully}} employed against both Japanese armor and infantry. Throughout the war it remained effective against Japanese vehicles, which were thinly armored and were rarely committed in large groups. The light weight of the gun <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> move through difficult terrain; for example, when attacked by Japanese tanks on Betio during the Battle of Tarawa, Marines were able to heave the M3 over the -high seawall. While high-explosive and canister ammunition proved useful in stopping Japanese infantry attacks, against enemy fortifications the M3 was only somewhat effective because of its small high-explosive projectile. Its overall effectiveness and ease of use meant the gun remained in service with the Marine Corps and with some army units in the Pacific until the end of the war. Unhappy with the unusually low shield of the M3, some Marine Corps units extended it to provide better protection. These extensions sometimes had a scalloped top edge, intended to improve camouflage. A standard kit was tested in 1945, but was never issued.|$|E

5|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw an {{increase}} in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of audio file formats such as MP3 and Real Audio, combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for bootleg collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of Napster in 1999 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> share bootlegs between a large computer network. Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were ripped to computer hard disks, and new material was created with digital recording of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and downloading bootlegs of individual songs. Artists gave a mixed reaction to bootleg sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while King Crimson's Robert Fripp and, infamously, Metallica were strongly critical of the ease in which Napster could circumvent the traditional channels of royalty payments.|$|E

25|$|Many {{suffered}} hardships {{while living}} on the frontier and tended to move frequently, around the same area to escape the harsh conditions and find greater opportunities. It also <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> migrate {{since most of the}} wealth people had was movable. The number of families moving three or more times was below 50. Only 23 families moved four times or more and 13 moved five times or more.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{during the}} Revolution, {{settlers}} {{in search of}} good farmland began working {{their way up the}} Muscoot River from its confluence with the Croton River.

25|$|The tolls levied for {{crossing}} the new bridge required {{the building of}} a gatehouse for those collecting the levies and providing protection for people using the route: the creation of the toll house thereby inadvertently founding the new settlement. The almost captive market of the travelling parties provided endless potential for trade, and the abundance of natural resources <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> erect a dwelling. As the volume of traffic using the road increased, so did the size and population of Bulwell.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} decimal measuring devices, developed in 1620 by the English clergyman and mathematician Edmund Gunter, introduced two new units of measure— the chain and the link—and a new measuring device: Gunter's chain. Gunter's chain was one chain (one tenth of a furlong) in length and consisted of 100links, making each link 0.001 furlongs. The decimal nature of these units and of the device <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> calculate the area of a rectangle of land in acres and decimal fractions of an acre.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} reliability {{problem is}} caused by air leakage into the tube. Usually oxygen in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode, quickly ruining it. Designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably. This was why most tubes were constructed of glass. Metal alloys (such as Cunife and Fernico) and glasses had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts, as temperature changed. These <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> construct an insulating envelope of glass, while passing connection wires through the glass to the electrodes.|$|E

25|$|During 734BC the Phoenicians, a sea trading {{people from}} the north of ancient Canaan, built a small {{settlement}} on the natural harbor of Palermo. Some sources suggest they named the settlement Ziz. It {{became one of the}} three main Phoenician colonies of Sicily, along with Motya and Soluntum. However, the remains of the Phoenician presence in the city are few and mostly preserved in the very populated center of the downtown area, making any excavation efforts costly and logistically difficult. The site chosen by the Phoenicians <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> connect the port to the mountains with a straight road that today has become Corso Calatifimi. This road helped the Phoenicians in trading with the populations that lived beyond the mountains that surround the gulf.|$|E
25|$|In late December 1915, Major Bornemann, {{commander}} of the 26th Division field artillery, wrote a report in which he described failures of communication, which led to an advantage created by the blowing of a mine being squandered by the artillery. Bornemann wrote that artillery battery observation posts had been left unmanned, {{on the assumption that}} they had been superseded by artillery liaison officers in the front line. Reporting had been inadequate due to complacency and reports should have been circulated to all headquarters rather than individual officers assuming that the information had been communicated. The artillery should avoid settling into routine firing, since prisoners had reported that its predictability <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> evade and limiting firing to the area in front of batteries should cease and oblique firing into adjacent sectors begin, to ensure that British artillery could not fire with impunity from the flanks. Concentrations of fire consumed too much ammunition on local targets and should be limited to provide ammunition for firing on other targets, to disrupt British operations and to reassure German infantry {{that they would not be}} abandoned by the artillery.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the game}} types they explored, Team 5 soon {{focused on the}} {{collectible}} card game approach, given that many on the team and in Blizzard had played such games since their introduction. The team found it natural to build the card game around the existing Warcraft lore; according to production director Jason Chayes, Warcraft was already a well-known property, {{and the depth of}} characters and locations created for other games in that series <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> create cards inspired by those. They also saw that new players to Warcraft may be drawn into the other games through playing Hearthstone. The team was able to pull concepts and art from the pre-existing World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, first published in 2006 by Upper Deck and later by Cryptozoic Entertainment; when Hearthstone was near completion, in 2013, Blizzard terminated its license with Cryptozoic as to favor their pending digital card game. The addition of heroes, an aspect from the previous trading card game, was found to help personalize the game for the player to allow players to discover useful combinations of cards for each hero.|$|E
