And, therefore, I presume not peremptorily to advise you, but to cast in my thoughts; which, if they seem unsatisfactory to you, reject them.|$|E

It is well laid out by one Brown who has set up on a few ideas of Kent and Mr Southcote." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{release from}} prison, Kesselring protested {{against what he}} {{regarded}} as the [...] "unjustly smirched reputation of the German soldier". In November 1953, testifying at a war crimes trial, he warned that [...] "there won't be any volunteers for the new German army if the German government continues to try German soldiers for acts committed in World War II". He enthusiastically supported the European Defence Community, and suggested that the [...] "war opponents of yesterday must become the peace comrades and friends of tomorrow". On the other hand, he also declared that he found [...] "astonishing" [...] those who believe [...] "that we must revise our ideas in accordance with democratic principles ... That is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> take." ...|$|E

[...] Scott Feinberg, of the Los Angeles Times, criticized the concept of Downey's portrayal of an African-American, writing [...] "...I just can't imagine any circumstance under which a blackface performance would be acceptable, any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> imagine any circumstance under which {{the use of the}} N-word would be acceptable." [...] Sara Vilkomerson said Cruise did [...] "...an astonishingly funny and surprising supporting performance." [...] Logan Hill of New York argued against Cruise's cameo saying that it [...] "...just makes him look a little lost and almost pathetic—shucking and jiving, trying to appeal to the younger moviegoers who are abandoning him." ...|$|E
500|$|Louise's {{relationship}} with the two sisters closest to the Queen, Beatrice and Helena, was strained at best. Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885, and they had four children. Louise, who had a jealous nature, had grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity {{on account of the}} Queen's constant need for her. Beatrice's biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties. Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne's alleged homosexuality. Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual {{relationship with}} her popular husband, which Louise was not. Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself. Certainly, following Prince Henry's death in 1896, Louise wrote that: [...] "he [...] was almost the greatest friend I had—I, too, miss him <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say". In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, meant nothing to him.|$|E
500|$|After {{speaking}} with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated {{on the idea}} of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, [...] "For me, I like {{to think of it as}} good versus evil. And this girl is just completely – just the evil one." [...] Swift entitled the album after [...] "Speak Now" [...] because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person. [...] "It's called Speak Now, and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> even tell you," [...] she said. The song was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2010, as part of Countdown to Speak Now, an exclusive campaign launched by the iTunes Store. During the opening week of Speak Now, Swift performed [...] "Speak Now" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E

500|$|Distinguished {{for being}} the remake's [...] "most powerful" [...] {{original}} song, [...] "Evermore" [...] {{has been described as}} a [...] "big" [...] and [...] "romantic" [...] number by music critics. A [...] "soaring ballad" [...] bolstered by [...] "grand orchestration", WTOP's Jason Fraley described [...] "Evermore" [...] as a [...] "haunting song of longing"; a [...] "mournful love song" [...] that crescendos into a powerful lament about lost love. An emotionally delivered power ballad, the Belfast Telegraph agreed that the ballad is [...] "a soaring lament of longing". The accompaniment begins with the Beast's [...] "eerie" [...] theme before transitioning into a solo, first emerging from the film's [...] "Rose" [...] theme before taking on its central melody and instrumental bridge. Despite being a miserable [...] "lovesick ballad", the somber tone of which Chris Knight of the National Post likened to songs from the musical Les Misérables, the ballad is a more upbeat offering than its Broadway counterpart, [...] "If I Can't Love Her", [...] "captur the elaborate aesthetic of musical theatre". However, the track remains one of the more melancholy inclusions on a soundtrack that consists of largely upbeat songs and musical numbers, contributing a sense of emotional depth to the album. Writing for Elle, Alyssa Bailey dubbed the song a [...] "Broadway version of a breakup ballad", which features the lyrics [...] "I let her steal into my melancholy heart/It's <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> bear," [...] as [...] "swoon" [...] by Stevens. Musically, the track bares similarities to songs from Disney's animated film The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), which Menken himself also composed, as well as the work of musical theatre composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.|$|E

2500|$|Though she {{considered}} herself a Democrat at the time, Crosby was a keen admirer {{of the leading}} Whig, U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, who in 1848 made a tour of large eastern cities. He visited the New York Institution for the Blind in New York City, where Crosby lived. The visit came {{two years after the}} death of Henry Clay, Jr., in the Mexican-American War. Crosby recalled that [...] "the great statesman was never quite himself after his son's death, and I purposely avoided all mention of it in the address of welcome on the day he came to visit us, lest I mighty wound the heart of the man whom I had learned not only to venerate but to love; for Mr. Clay was always an especial favorite among public men. There was a strength in his character and an earnestness in his speeches that appealed to me <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell. ... I would have challenged any person, whether Whig or Democrat, Northerner or Southerner to come within range of the man's eloquence [...] without being moved to admiration and profound respect; for his personal magnetism was wonderful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Visits {{from his}} mother to Likani were greatly enjoyable. In 1895, George and his mother visited Denmark. They had not seen their Danish {{relatives}} for four years. It was sad {{as it was the}} first time for both of them without the late Tsar. Then suddenly, his health deteriorated, [...] "Yesterday, in the garden, he expectorated some blood...that frightened me <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell - the surprise of it was shocking, because he had been so well of late...I am quite desperate that this should have happened here" [...] As a result, George was forbidden to smoke and confined to bed until he was fit enough to return to Likani. Writing to Nicholas back home once again, George said about his trip to Denmark, [...] "Of course it was good to see the family after 4 years, but it did not really do me any good, as I lost more than 5 pounds which I had put on with such difficulty in May and June. I also get out of breath more easily. So these are the results of my trip. Very annoying." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{referring}} to the bequest of the Outhwaite family and making placatory remarks about the Marist Brothers, Liston welcomed the Christian Brothers. He {{said that they were}} [...] "here at the invitation of the Bishop to take charge of St Peter's school and to have their part, along with the Marist Brothers and other religious communities, in our Catholic education system. They have their own traditions to give us, formed in the society's work of teaching since 1802, and the fruit of the experience gathered, to speak only of Australia and New Zealand, of over 500 Brothers teaching more than 20,000 boys". Liston added, [...] " ... if I know the Brothers at all, the boys under their care will be put to hard work - an excellent thing - and teachers will not do for them what they should do for themselves. The thought of the years ahead and of the eternal life will be regarded as of first importance. Teachers will feel it their daily duty to fit the boys to bear life's burdens with a spirit of nobility and to meet life's problems with unfaltering courage". At the conclusion of his speech, Bishop Liston said, [...] "This is a very happy day for me indeed for I owe much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> say to the training I received {{at the hands of the}} Christian Brothers in Dunedin long years ago".|$|E
2500|$|... "I Will Try" [...] {{is about}} having a {{positive}} outlook on life. James has explained that he has 'a very negative outlook on the world' and that he can 'never really appreciate anything' so the song is a reminder to himself to try and {{look on the bright}} side. He continued; 'the line [...] "I've got friends who have lost their fathers and they're much stronger men than me" [...] refers mainly to Chris (Pennells, guitar), Jamie (manager) and my dear friend David Rice who have lost family members and yet still find a smile and appreciate all the upsides of life'. [...] "Little White Lies" [...] is about dishonesty. The song 'covers the way that lies eat away at my brain and cause me to almost lose my mind, yet I still keep making mistakes and bad decisions', according to James. He revealed little about the background of [...] "Leeches", saying only that 'Leeches is about something terrible and unspeakable that happened to someone who once made me very happy'. Speaking about [...] "Anemophobia", he said; 'the title of this song means a fear of wind, which I have, but the song on the whole though is about anxiety. ...This song was written when I was at my lowest point, I genuinely believed I was dying. ...The song is also about how lost I felt and still feel and how most days I don't feel like myself any more'. [...] "Fifty Four" [...] is about James' girlfriend. 'She is my only real sense of normality and I owe her <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> write down in words for that'.|$|E
