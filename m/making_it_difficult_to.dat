5|$|In the Iowa caucuses, Keyes did {{not appear}} {{on any of the}} {{election}} totals. Keyes stated that many of the caucus locations he visited did not list him as a choice. His campaign CEO, Stephen Stone blamed much of this on the media and on Keyes's decision to enter the race late. Stone explained that the media would not acknowledge Keyes's candidacy, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> run an effective campaign.|$|E
5|$|Most of Jennings {{second term}} was spent {{grappling}} with the state's continuing financial difficulties. When tax revenues and land sales remained low, the state's revenue was not sufficient to repay the bonds it used to finance internal improvements. The Indiana General Assembly was forced to significantly depreciate {{the value of its}} bonds, harming the state's credit and <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> secure new loans.|$|E

5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars {{much more quickly than}} would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> predict future developments.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} HMS Glatton was also derived {{from that of}} Cerberus, {{although}} she exchanged one turret for heavier guns and armour. She was given a deeper draught for better seakeeping abilities, but retained the low freeboard of the older ships to make her a smaller target, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> weather head seas in heavy weather. Nominally intended for coast defence, she was designed to attack the defences of deep-water ports like Brest and Cherbourg.|$|E

5|$|The free {{element is}} {{remarkable}} for its robustness, especially {{the fact that}} it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered, melting at 3422°C (6192°F, 3695K). It also has the second highest boiling point, at 5930°C (10706°F, 6203K). Its density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{multifaceted}} {{nature of}} design management leads to varied opinion, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> give an overall definition; furthermore, design managers {{have a broad}} range of roles and responsibilities. These factors, combined with a multitude of other influences such as the industry involved, company size, the market situation, and the importance of design within the organization's activities. As a result, design management is not restricted to a single design discipline and usually depends on the context of its application within an individual organization.|$|E

On 1 October eight Douglas A-20 Havoc bombers of the US 89th Bombardment Squadron attacked the Japanese positions in the Salankaua Plantation and Kakakog Ridge area at 10:35, followed by ten Vultee Vengeance dive bombers of No. 24 Squadron RAAF. This was followed by twenty 25-pounders of the 2/12th Field Regiment firing 30 rounds per gun.|$|E

5|$|After Skanderbeg's raid into Macedonia {{the year}} before, the Sultan decided to {{strengthen}} his fortresses in the area. He then sent Şeremet bey to Ohrid, a city close to Skanderbeg's domains, with 14,000 cavalry to prevent another Albanian incursion. After learning of this, Skanderbeg prepared to march against Şeremet. The pasha's men, however, were stationed {{both inside and}} outside the city, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> defeat them. Before marching, Skanderbeg received news that Pius had arrived in Ancona and died upon seeing the crusader fleet. He left Cimarosto with an Italian force in Valikardhë (near modern-day Bulqizë in eastern Albania). Skanderbeg then decided to march against Şeremet anyway and set off with 12,000 cavalry three hours after dusk. After one day of marching, Skanderbeg reached Macedonia and began pillaging the land.|$|E
5|$|Another myth current amongst Tamils {{says that}} the temple was {{renovate}}d by a legendary Chola king, Kullakotan. According to that myth, the king, who was afflicted with an incurable skin disease, was cured after taking a bath in the ruined temple’s holy pond. Following the miracle, the king went on to renovate the temple and created a community of temple caretakers to maintain the temple. The equivalent myth amongst the Sinhalese people indicates that the diseased king was Rajasinghe or Bhuvanekabahu and the king prayed to the presiding goddess who cured him of his affliction. There were at least two kings called Rajasinghe in Sri Lanka, {{and both of them}} were involved in the actual renovations of the temple, and at least seven kings named Bhuvanekabahu, thereby <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> identify the right king.|$|E

Statements from other police and military witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers did not give statements to the police until over a week after the shootings.|$|E
