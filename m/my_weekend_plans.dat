The introduction of the form led to a significant improvement in the proportion of notes containing a <b>weekend</b> <b>plan</b> and the proportion of notes containing a resuscitation decision (p, 0. 05), which will {{have a significant impact on}} patient care.

50|$|Weekend Outlook was {{a weekend}} morning weather program on The Weather Channel. It was {{comparable}} to First Outlook, {{but with a}} different focus: Weekend Outlook was geared toward <b>weekend</b> <b>planning</b> and forecasts, compared to the commuter/straightforward style of First Outlook. It also started one hour later than First Outlook; the first hour is occupied by Weather in the Classroom and then Sunrise Weather, a weekend-exclusive early morning weather program. Weekend Outlook {{was one of the}} lowest-rated programs on The Weather Channel. From 2003 to 2007, It was hosted by only Ray Stagich, then from 2007 to 2008, it was hosted by Stagich and Bob Stokes.

30|$|Our between-subjects design {{involved}} six treatments in 12 sessions. To {{control for}} hunger levels we conducted sessions at two {{different times of}} the day: before lunch (6 sessions) and after lunch (6 sessions). In Spain, lunch is the main meal and unlikely to be skipped, and following local habits for lunch, the schedules set for the experiments were at 1 pm (before lunch) and at 3 pm (after lunch). For obvious reasons, we expected more hungry participants in the first case and less hungry participants in the second case. As mentioned previously, although the timing of the sessions were scheduled so as to have “hungry” and “satiated” participants, subjects were also asked questions pertaining to the time since their last meal. In an attempt to have similar meal situations for all participants, the experiments were carried {{out in the middle of}} the week (Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays), to avoid potential effects of “weekend leftovers” that participants may bring on Mondays or special <b>weekend</b> <b>plans</b> on Fridays.|$|R
