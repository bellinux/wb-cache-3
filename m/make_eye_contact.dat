5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree, reading a textbook. As they <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact,</b> the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|The {{video is}} similar in {{thematic}} content to Mötley Crüe's video for the single [...] "Girls, Girls, Girls". But in contrast, this video tells the story from Madonna's point of view. [...] She looks down into the cubicles to <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> with the men but {{they are unable to}} return it. She also looks assertively into the camera, making eye contact with the viewer. With these scenes Madonna portrays her holding power over the men and the ability to pursue them. Madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being. Author Bruce Forbes notes that the men in the cubicles are proved unworthy of her and there is an undertone of mockery when Madonna addresses them as 'baby' while shaking her body.|$|E
500|$|A {{few members}} of Cho's family, those who {{remained}} in South Korea, had concerns about his behavior during his early childhood. Cho's relatives {{thought that he was}} selectively mute or mentally ill. According to Cho's uncle, Cho [...] "didn't say much and did not mix with other children." [...] Cho's maternal great-aunt described Cho as [...] "cold" [...] and a cause of family concern from as young as eight years old. According to his great-aunt, who met him twice, Cho was extremely shy and [...] "just would not talk at all." [...] He was otherwise considered [...] "well-behaved," [...] readily obeying verbal commands and cues. The great-aunt said she knew something was wrong after the family's departure for the United States because she heard frequent updates about Cho's older sister but little news about Cho. During an ABC News Nightline interview on August 30, 2007, Cho's grandfather reported his concerns about Cho's behavior during childhood. According to Cho's grandfather, Cho never looked up to him to <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact,</b> never called him grandfather, and never moved to embrace him.|$|E

500|$|A common {{feature of}} this form of {{diagnosis}} within attachment therapy {{is the use of}} extensive lists of [...] "symptoms" [...] which include many behaviours that are likely to be a consequence of neglect or abuse, but are not related to attachment, or not related to any clinical disorder at all. Such lists have been described as [...] "wildly inclusive". The APSAC Taskforce (2006) gives examples of such lists ranging across multiple domains from some elements within the DSM-IV criteria to entirely non-specific behavior such as developmental lags, destructive behaviors, refusal to <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact,</b> cruelty to animals and siblings, lack of cause and effect thinking, preoccupation with fire, blood and gore, poor peer relationships, stealing, lying, lack of a conscience, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, poor impulse control, abnormal speech patterns, fighting for control over everything, and hoarding or gorging on food. Some checklists suggest that among infants, [...] "prefers dad to mom" [...] or [...] "wants to hold the bottle as soon as possible" [...] are indicative of attachment problems. The APSAC Taskforce expresses concern that high rates of false positive diagnoses are virtually certain and that posting these types of lists on web sites that also serve as marketing tools may lead many parents or others to conclude inaccurately that their children have attachment disorders." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ovechkin was {{reportedly}} {{involved in a}} feud with Pittsburgh Penguins forward Evgeni Malkin, who was drafted second behind Ovechkin in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. Though the two were reported to be good friends when they roomed together during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, this friendship quickly cooled. There is no definitive information on what caused the feud, but the most popular theory is that it began in August 2007, when Ovechkin supposedly punched Malkin's Russian agent, Gennady Ushakov, at a Moscow nightclub. Ovechkin has denied that version of events, while Malkin confirmed it, although he was not certain whether this was the precipitating event to the feud. The most notorious event took place on 21 January 2008, in Pittsburgh, when Ovechkin took a run at Malkin, which would have seemingly resulted in a devastating hit had Malkin not ducked {{out of the way}} just in time. The two would also not <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> at the 2008 NHL Awards Ceremony. Despite these incidents, Ovechkin has repeatedly denied [...] "having it out" [...] for Malkin.|$|E

2500|$|Matthew Speltz of the University of Washington School of Medicine {{states that}} the roots of {{attachment}} therapy are traceable to psychologist Robert Zaslow and his [...] "Z-process" [...] in the 1970s. Zaslow attempted to force attachment in those suffering from autism by creating rage while holding them against their will. He believed this {{would lead to a}} breakdown in their defense mechanisms, making them more receptive to others. Zaslow thought attachment arose when an infant experienced feelings of pain, fear and rage, and then made eye contact with the carer who relieved those feelings. If an infant did not experience this cycle of events by having his fear and rage relieved, the infant would not form an attachment and would not <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> with other people. Zaslow believed that creating pain and rage and combining them with eye contact would cause attachment to occur, long after the normal age for such developments. Holding therapies derive from these [...] "rage-reduction" [...] techniques applied by Zaslow. The holding is not used for safety purposes but is initiated for the purpose of provoking strong negative emotions such as fear and anger. The child's release typically depends upon his or her compliance with the therapist's [...] agenda or goals. In 1971, Zaslow surrendered his California psychology license following an injury to a patient during rage-reduction therapy. Zaslow's ideas {{on the use of the}} Z-process and holding for autism have been dispelled by research on the ...|$|E
