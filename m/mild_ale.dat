5|$|After Henry Boddington's death, his son, William Slater Boddington became company chairman, and {{the company}} went public in 1888 when it was {{estimated}} to have assets of £320,465. It was now known as Boddingtons Breweries Ltd. The company owned 212 public houses by 1892, making it the twelfth largest tied estate in the United Kingdom. Its major local competitors were Groves and Whitnall, Threlfalls and the Manchester Brewing Company. 86 percent of production was of <b>mild</b> <b>ale</b> in January 1902.|$|E
5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{of the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century, and emergency laws aimed at restricting drinking during the First World War created difficult trading conditions for brewers. In 1919 net profit was reported at £22,325 (£900,000 at 2010 prices). Samuel Wentworth Webster, a director of the company and grandson of the founder, died in 1928 with a personalty of £45,000 (£2.2million in 2010). In 1928, one of the brewery's most successful beers was launched; Webster's Green Label, a light <b>mild</b> <b>ale.</b> In 1929 the company's entire stock of properties, land and brewery buildings was valued at £468,833 (£23.2million in 2010). The company took over Joseph Stocks of Halifax in December 1932, which could trace its origins back to 1790. In 1957, Webster's took over the brewer, John Ainley & Sons of Huddersfield and Woodhead Brothers of Elland, near Halifax, a mineral water manufacturer. The company dray horses, used for local beer deliveries, were retired by the end of the 1950s. In 1961 Webster's bought Daniel Fielding & Sons of Halifax, which added 19 public houses to their tied estate. The same year the company sought out partnership with the national brewer Watney Mann in order to benefit from the technical knowledge of the much larger company. In return Webster's brewed and sold the brewery conditioned Watney's Red Barrel ale throughout their tied estate. In 1962, a reciprocal trading agreement was reached with Ind Coope's North East division which saw Webster's houses stock lager for the first time. That same year the group won the contract to bottle Tuborg for West Yorkshire.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mild</b> <b>ales</b> are {{generally}} based on mild malt or pale malt. Most milds contain, in addition, {{a quantity of}} crystal malt; dark milds, meanwhile, make use of chocolate malt, black malt or dark brewing sugars. Milds tend to be lightly hopped compared to pale ale and are usually low in alcohol; strong <b>mild</b> <b>ales</b> used to reach six or seven per cent abv, but very few such beers are still brewed. Sarah Hughes Dark Ruby Mild, brewed to a pre-World War I recipe, is a rare example of a strong Mild (6.0% ABV).|$|R

5000|$|Mild {{in modern}} times is {{generally}} considered to be a low-gravity beer with a low hop rate and predominantly malty palate. Historically, <b>mild</b> <b>ales</b> were of standard strength for the time (and rather strong by modern standards). Modern <b>mild</b> <b>ales</b> are mainly dark coloured with an abv of 3% to 3.6%, though there are lighter hued examples, as well as stronger more traditional examples reaching 6% abv and higher. The term 'mild' originally {{had nothing to do with}} strength or level of hop bitterness, but rather as a label for beers that were not [...] "vatted" [...] (aged) and hence did not have some of the tart and even slightly sour flavour of ales that were subject to long aging, which was considered a desirable attribute of premium ales.The dark colour characteristic of modern-day milds can come from either the use of roast malt or caramelised sugars, or more commonly, both. These ingredients lead to differences in flavour characteristics.|$|R
60|$|Imboldened by the consciousness, that {{in case of}} need succour {{was close}} at hand, Rose drew back into her little chamber, and having ascertained, by listening, {{that there was no}} noise or {{stirring}} in that of Eveline, she began to make some preparations for her own repose.

Having from their youth up been entirely unaccustomed to any liquor stronger than cider or <b>mild</b> <b>ale,</b> it was no wonder that they had succumbed, one and all, with extraordinary uniformity, after the lapse of about an hour.|$|E

25|$|The Black Country {{is notable}} for its small breweries and brewpubs which, unlike most in Britain, {{continued}} brewing their own beer alongside larger breweries {{which opened in}} the Industrial Revolution.

6000|$|In the Blue Lion, {{which was}} the name of the country public-house, Colour-Sergeant Brand {{introduced}} his new friend, Mr. Harker, to a number of ingenious mixtures, calculated to prevent the approaches of intoxication. These he explained to be [...] "rekisite" [...] in the service, so that a self-respecting officer should always appear upon parade in a condition honourable to his corps. The most efficacious of these devices was to lace a pint of <b>mild</b> <b>ale</b> with twopence-worth of London gin. I am pleased to hand in this recipe to the discerning reader, who may find it useful even in civil station; for its effect upon Mr. Harker was revolutionary. He must be helped on board his own waggon, where he proceeded to display a spirit entirely given over to mirth and music, alternately hooting with laughter, to which the sergeant hastened to bear chorus, and incoherently tootling on the pipe. The man of war, meantime, unostentatiously possessed himself of the reins. It was plain he had a taste for the secluded beauties of an English landscape; for the cart, although it wandered under his guidance for some time, was never observed to issue on the dusty highway, journeying between hedge and ditch, and for the most part under overhanging boughs. It was plain, besides, he had an eye to the true interests of Mr. Harker; for though the cart drew up more than once at the doors of public-houses, it was only the sergeant who set foot to ground, and, being equipped himself with a quart bottle, once more proceeded on his rural drive.|$|E

50|$|Winter warmers are a type {{of winter}} {{seasonal}} beer. These include old <b>ales</b> and <b>mild</b> <b>ales</b> that have been brewed during the winter months. Prior to the times of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-eighteenth century in England, some winter warmers were aged in barrels for months, and even years, which added to their flavor profile. The barrels were typically made from oak. During this time, tannins from the wooden barrels served to add flavor notes to winter warmers, and wild yeasts added a mild sour flavor. Winter warmers also sometimes have spices added for additional flavor.|$|R

50|$|Porter is a {{historically}} significant style developed in 18th century London, {{which is the}} ancestor of stout, a style now considered typically Irish. English Porters and stouts are generally as dark or darker than old ales, and significantly more bitter. They differ from dark <b>milds</b> and old <b>ales</b> {{in the use of}} roast grains, which adds to the bitterness, and lends flavours of toast, biscuit or coffee.|$|R
50|$|This incroachment on the {{consumption}} of the drinks which London had always been habituated to, excited the brown beer brewers to produce if possible a better sort of commodity in their own way, than heretofore had been made. To their honour I say it, my old Masters were foremost in this attempt and thus much let me add, I approved of the undertaking. They began to hop their mild beer more and the Publican started three, four, sometimes six butts at once, but so little idea had the brewer or his customers incurring the charge of great stocks of beer, that some moneyed people made a trade of purchasing their hopped beers at the first hand, keeping them sometime and when stale {{to dispose of the}} same to Publicans for 5/- per barrel and 6/- per barrel. Our tastes but slowly alter or reform. Some drank mild beer and stale mixed, others <b>ale,</b> <b>mild</b> beer and stale blended together at threepence per quart, but many used all stale at fourpence per pot.|$|R
