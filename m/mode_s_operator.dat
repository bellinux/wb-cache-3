5000|$|One {{issue with}} <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders is that pilots {{have entered the}} wrong flight {{identity}} into their <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders. [...] In this case, the capabilities of ACAS II and <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> SSR can be degraded.|$|R
5000|$|Another <b>mode</b> called <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> (Select) is {{designed}} to help avoiding overinterrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders are compatible with Mode A and Mode C Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) systems. [...] This is the type of transponder that is used for TCAS or ACAS II (Airborne Collision Avoidance System) functions, and is required to implement the extended squitter broadcast, one means of participating in ADS-B systems. A TCAS-equipped aircraft must have a <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder, but not all <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders include TCAS. Likewise, a <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder is required to implement 1090ES extended squitter ADS-B Out, but {{there are other ways to}} implement ADS-B Out (in the U.S. and China.) The format of <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> messages is documented in ICAO Doc 9688, Manual on <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> Specific Services.|$|R
50|$|Two other modes, mode 4 and <b>mode</b> <b>S,</b> are not {{considered}} part of the ATCRBS system, but they use the same transmit and receive hardware. Mode 4 is used by military aircraft for the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> is a discrete selective interrogation, rather than a general broadcast, that facilitates TCAS for civilian aircraft. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders ignore interrogations not addressed with their unique identity code, reducing channel congestion. At a typical SSR radar installation, ATCRBS, IFF, and <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> interrogations will all be transmitted in an interlaced fashion. Some military facilities and/or aircraft will also utilize <b>Mode</b> <b>S.</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> {{data link}} is a {{high-capacity}} air-ground digital communications {{system that can}} deliver information to the cockpit {{in a form that}} will significantly improve pilot situational awareness and aircraft utility. The Federal Aviation Administration is currently deploying <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> surveillance sensors with data-link capability at 143 sites across the United States. Two <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> data-link applications-Traffic Information Service and Graphical Weather Service-have been developed to meet the specific needs ofgeneral aviation.

50|$|<b>Mode</b> <b>S,</b> or <b>mode</b> select, despite {{also being}} called a mode, is {{actually}} a radically improved system intended to replace ATCRBS altogether. A few countries have mandated <b>mode</b> <b>S,</b> and many other countries, including the United States, have begun phasing out ATCRBS {{in favor of this}} system. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> is designed to be fully backward compatible with existing ATCRBS technology.|$|R
50|$|TCAS and its {{variants}} {{are only}} able to interact with aircraft that have a correctly operating mode C or <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder. A unique 24-bit identifier is assigned to each aircraft that has a <b>mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> {{secondary}} {{surveillance radar}} system, 'squitter' is a term used to describe messages that are unsolicited downlink transmissions from an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder system. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders transmit acquisition squitter (unsolicited downlink transmissions) to permit passive acquisition by interrogators with broad antenna beams, where active acquisition may be hindered by all-call synchronous garble. Examples of such interrogators are an {{airborne collision avoidance system}} and an airport surface system.|$|R
50|$|The {{height of}} a target with an SSR Mode C or <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> {{transponder}} can also be provided by decoding the Mode C or <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> response directly, which is the {{normal mode of operation}} for the civilian VERA-AP system.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{the type}} of interrogation, the {{transponder}} sends back a transponder code (or [...] "squawk code", Mode A) or altitude information (Mode C) to help air traffic controllers to identify the aircraft and to maintain separation between planes. Another <b>mode</b> called <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> (<b>Mode</b> Select) is designed to help avoiding over-interrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders are backward compatible with Modes A and C. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> is mandatory in controlled airspace in many countries. Some countries have also required, or are moving towards requiring, that all aircraft be equipped with <b>Mode</b> <b>S,</b> even in uncontrolled airspace. However, in the field of general aviation there have been objections to these moves, because of the cost, size, limited benefit to the users in uncontrolled airspace, and, in the case of balloons and gliders, the power requirements during long flights.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009 the ICAO {{published}} an [...] "extended" [...] form of <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> with more message formats {{to use with}} ADS-B; it was further refined in 2012. Countries implementing ADS-B can {{require the use of}} either the extended squitter mode of a suitably-equipped <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder, or the UAT transponder on 978 MHz.|$|R
5000|$|Upon interrogation, <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders {{transmit}} {{information about}} the aircraft to the SSR system, to TCAS receivers on board aircraft and to the ADS-B SSR system. This information includes the call sign of the aircraft and/or the aircraft's permanent ICAO 24-bit address (which is represented for human interface purposes as six hexadecimal characters. One of the hidden features of <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders {{is that they are}} backwards compatible; an aircraft equipped with a <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder can still be used to send replies to Mode A or C interrogations. This feature can be activated by a specific type of interrogation sequence called inter-mode.|$|R

40|$|III GPS-Squitter merges the {{capabilities}} ofAutomatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) with the <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> beacon system. In ADS, an aircraft determines {{its position on}} board by using satellite navigational data from a system such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). The information is then broadcast to ground and airborne users to provide surveillance ofthe aircraft. In GPS-Squitter, an aircraft would transmit the ADS information by using the <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> squitter-a spontaneous periodic broadcast transmitted by all <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders. Currendy, the <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders emit a 56 -bit squitter once per second, and the squitters are used by the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) to acquire the 24 -bit address ofthe aircraft. For the GPS-Squitter system, the squitter broadcast is extended to 112 bits {{to provide for the}} transmission of a 56 -bit ADS message field.

40|$|The world’s first ADS-B over Satellite (AOS) In- Orbit Demonstrator (IOD) within ESA’s PROBA-V {{mission is}} {{operational}} since May 2013 and has successfully validated {{the principle of}} detecting weak <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder transmissions from a Low Earth Orbit (LEO). A special feature {{was included in the}} receiver’s firmware that allows to upload new configurations and to activate these by remote access. During mission runtime so far, this has been successfully tested several times. In the meanwhile an improved <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> correlation mechanism was developed that benefits from the phase coherence of the pulse train from the first <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> preamble pulse to the fifth format bit. In lab tests it could be shown that the telegram detection rate increased significantly. Moreover, by generating and saving ”Low-Confidence Bits” for the 112 <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> data bits in DF 17, there is an additional chance to increase the success rate for error-free demodulation of the telegram in post-processing. The improvement on ADS-B data from space in comparison with the results gained with the non coherent approach will be shown...|$|R
5000|$|The major {{demonstrated}} {{problem of}} the ADS-B protocol integration is this added verbosity of the extra information transmitted, which is considered unnecessary for collision avoidance purposes. The more data transmitted from one aircraft {{in accordance with the}} system design, the lesser the number of aircraft that can participate in the system, due to the fixed and limited channel data bandwidth (1 megabit/second with the 26/64 data bits to packet length bit capacity of the <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> downlink data format packet). For every <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> message of 64 bits, the overhead demands 8 for clock sync at the receiver and <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> packet discovery, 6 for type of <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> packet, 24 for who it came from. Since that leaves only 26 for information, multiple packets must be used to convey a single message. The ADS-B [...] "fix" [...] proposal is to go to a 128 bit packet, which is not an accepted international standard. [...] Either approach increases channel traffic above the level sustainable for environments such as the Los Angeles Basin.|$|R
5000|$|Automatic Independent Surveillance - Privacy (AIS-P) is a {{data packet}} {{protocol}} for the TailLight system of aircraft Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), wherein a single <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> 64 microsecond message is transmitted by an aircraft ATCRBS or <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder, and received by aircraft and Air Traffic Control on the ground. This is an augmentation to aircraft transponders, which report aircraft position and velocity {{in such a}} way as to minimize interference with any other avionics system, maximize the possible number of participating aircraft, while not relying on any equipment on the ground, and protecting aircraft from potential attack. AIS-P and ADS-B are competing protocols for aircraft based surveillance of traffic, a replacement technology for <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> radar and TCAS.|$|R
