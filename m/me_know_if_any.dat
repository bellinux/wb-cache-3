40|$|Due to {{collision}} singularities, the Lagrange action functional of the N-body {{problem in}} general is only lower semi-continuous {{in the space of}} Sobolev paths. Because of this, the usual critical point theory can not be applied to this problem directly. We introduce a notation called weak critical point for such an action functional, as a generalization of the usual critical point. A corresponding definition of Morse index for such a weak critical point will also be defined. Moreover it will be shown that the Morse index gives an upper bound of the number of possible binary collisions in a weak critical point of the $N$-body problem with weak force potentials including the Newtonian potential.

You will also learn the following concepts: 1. Use of recursive functions, 2. Use of dynamic programming (or backward recursion) to avoid an exponential growth in computation time. 3. Use of linear interpolation to estimate a function value during backward recursion. Use whichever language you're most comfortable with. This initial project may be too easy. <b>If</b> so let <b>me</b> <b>know.</b> <b>If</b> you have <b>any</b> questions, email me or call me at the office. 2 Background: option pricing in the binomial model The following sub-sections give a watered-down account of the finance concepts you'll need for this assignment.

40|$|The {{family of}} planar linear chains are found as collision-free action minimizers of the spatial N-body problem with equal masses under D_N-symmetry {{constraint}} and {{different types of}} topological constraints. This generalizes a previous result by the author in Y 15 c for the planar N-body problem. In particular, the monotone constraints required in Y 15 c are proven to be unnecessary, as it will be implied by the action minimization property. For each type of topological constraints, by considering the corresponding action minimization problem in a coordinate frame rotating around the vertical axis at a constant angular velocity ω, we find an entire family of simple choreographies, as ω changes from 0 to N. Such a family starts from one planar linear chain and ends at another. The action minimizer is collision-free, when ω= 0 or N, but may contain collision, when 0 3. Comment: 32 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|Big {{changes to}} how StarModel fits happen now [...] -fitting now {{defaults}} to using MultiNest via PyMultiNest. To {{take advantage of}} this change, you must install MultiNest and PyMultiNest. If you don't have these packages, you can follow these directions to install them. MultiNest does a much better job than emcee of exploring the stellar model parameter space when only photometry is being used as observational constraints, because the posterior can be quite multi-modal. As a result, you must use MultiNest if you want a fair fit when you're just using photometry. The way to fit a StarModel now is using the. fit() method, which will default to. fit_multinest() if MultiNest is available, and will otherwise default back to using emcee via. fit_mcmc(). Please let <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> you have <b>any</b> troubles with this. The starfit command-line script should work the same as before; again defaulting to MultiNest if available.

In a letter from to Harold Spivacke dated 10 May 1943 Copland states that he means to stick {{as close as possible to}} Chávez’s instrumentation of a double quartet , but another letter to Spivacke written a little less than a month later makes it clear that Copland still did not know exactly the instrumentation Chávez had in mind, even though the expected premiere was by then less than five months away: [...] "I shall assume that the premiere date is October 30th unless I hear to the contrary. Please be sure to let <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> there is <b>any</b> change, as the more time I have the better. Also, if you can find out from Chavez what instruments he intends using, that would be a help" [...] However, nothing yet had appeared from Chávez , and Copland was experiencing delays himself with other projects. In July, Graham wrote to Copland complaining that she still had received no word from Chávez, and on 21 July Copland wrote again to Spivacke, expressing hope that Chávez's score would arrive soon, [...] "giving Martha something to work on until I am ready", but also inadvertently dropping his friend into hot water by carelessly saying, [...] "As you probably know, he is famous for getting things done at the last possible moment", and suggesting a further postponement of the premiere until the Spring of 1944 [...] A month later, Hawkins wrote that Graham had agreed it would be necessary to postpone the performance once again. Although they were aware of and could have accommodated Copland’s delay, they had been counting on the arrival of Chávez’s score, and were both [...] "terribly disappointed" [...] in him [...] When at last a token fragment of the score arrived in December, Spivacke apologetically sent it to Hawkins, worrying, [...] "I can hardly imagine that Miss Graham will have enough even to start work on" [...]|$|R
