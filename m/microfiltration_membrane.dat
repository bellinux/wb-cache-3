50|$|The {{first of}} the two {{filtration}} steps, microfiltration, is used to remove the cells from the reactor broth. Ceramic filters are used because, although expensive, they can last for five to ten years. High temperatures {{have been found to}} increase the flux of liquid across the <b>microfiltration</b> <b>membrane,</b> so a minimum temperature of 165 F is specified. A series of three ultrafiltration membranes are used to filter out proteins with a molecular weight of 5,000 Daltons and higher. The feed pressure to the <b>microfiltration</b> <b>membrane</b> is typically 65 psia with a transmembrane pressure drop of 40 psia. The feed pressure to each ultrafiltration membrane is 60 psia. Using these feed pressures and temperatures, typical transmembrane liquid fluxes are 108 LMH (liters per hour per square meter) for the <b>microfiltration</b> <b>membrane,</b> and 26 LMH for the ultrafiltration membrane.|$|E
50|$|The most {{fundamental}} and usually preferred method of controlling fouling {{is to prevent}} the ingress of the fouling species into the cooling water circuit. In steam power stations and other major industrial installations of water technology, macro fouling is avoided by way of pre-filtration and cooling water debris filters. Some plants employ foreign-object exclusion program (to eliminate the possibility of salient introduction of unwanted materials, e.g., forgetting tools during maintenance). Acoustic monitoring is sometimes employed to monitor for fretting by detached parts. In the case of micro fouling, water purification is achieved with extensive methods of water treatment, <b>microfiltration,</b> <b>membrane</b> technology (reverse osmosis, electrodeionization) or ion-exchange resins. The generation of the corrosion products in the water piping systems is often minimized by controlling the pH of the process fluid (typically alkanization with ammonia, morpholine, ethanolamine or sodium phosphate), control of oxygen dissolved in water (for example, by addition of hydrazine), or addition of corrosion inhibitors.|$|E

The membranes studied included a polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) <b>microfiltration</b> <b>membrane</b> with a non-woven support layer, a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) <b>microfiltration</b> <b>membrane</b> with a non-woven support layer, and three MD membranes made from PTFE of different pore size and all with a structured scrim support layer. The results showed that distillation using PTFE membranes produced much higher flux {{than that of the}} PVDF <b>microfiltration</b> <b>membrane</b> at the same operational conditions, and the support layer affected not only the flux, but also the energy efficiency (0. 51 – 0. 24). The results also show that increasing the velocity of the feed and its inlet temperature increased the flux, but the rate of flux increase diminishes at high velocities. The mass transfer coefficient improved for thinner support and active layer membranes, leading to fluxes as high as 46 L m− 2 h− 1 at 80 °C. The heat transfer characteristics were found to be superior for the open scrim backed membranes compared to the non-woven support membranes, resulting in significantly greater thermal efficiency for the scrim backed membranes...|$|E

This study, which {{is part of a larger}} project on investigation of hybrid membrane processes for trace hormones removal, focuses on binding of hormones to <b>microfiltration</b> hollow fibre <b>membranes</b> in filtration of solutions containing trace hormones. The adsorption capacity of the membrane, kinetics of adsorption and desorption of to/from <b>microfiltration</b> hollow fibre <b>membranes,</b> and the factors affecting adsorption to the membranes have been studied using estrone as model solute. The experiments showed that the adsorption of estrone to the <b>microfiltration</b> <b>membranes</b> could result in high retention of estrone molecules. However, since the mechanism of retention is adsorption rather than sieving, the retention decreases with increase in the amount of estrone accumulated on the membrane and breakthrough occurs when the accumulated estrone on the membrane reaches an equilibrium concentration corresponding to the feed concentration. For long-term operation, although membranes could be saturated by hormone molecules the membrane processes could still have a function of buffer for instantaneous high hormones concentration because the saturation surface concentration increased with the increase in the feed concentration. In addition, the experiments also indicated that the adsorption capacity of the membranes for hormones could be affected by membrane types, pH, affinity of hormones to water, as well as the presence of other organics.
