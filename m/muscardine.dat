5|$|The first {{silkworm}} diseases {{began to}} appear in 1845, creating an epidemic. Among them are pébrine, caused by the microsporidia Nosema bombycis, grasserie, caused by a virus, flacherie, caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or white <b>muscardine</b> disease, caused by the fungus Beauveria bassiana. The epidemic grew to a massive scale, and after having attacked the silkworms, other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees. The chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, French minister of agriculture, was charged with stopping the epidemic. In face of sericulturers' call for help, he asked Louis Pasteur to study the disease, starting in 1865. For many years, Pasteur thought that pébrine was not a contagious disease. In 1870 he changed his view, and measures were enacted that caused the disease to decline.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Agostino Bassi {{had shown that}} <b>muscardine</b> {{was caused by a}} fungus that {{infected}} silkworms. Since 1853, two diseases called pébrine and flacherie had been infecting great numbers of silkworms in southern France, and by 1865 they were causing huge losses to farmers. In 1865, Pasteur went to Alès and worked for five years until 1870.|$|E

60|$|The {{silkworm}} {{has long}} been known to be subject to a very fatal and infectious disease called the <b>Muscardine.</b> Audouin transmitted it by inoculation. This disease is entirely due {{to the development of a}} fungus, Botrytis Bassiana, in the body of the caterpillar; and its contagiousness and infectiousness are accounted for in the same way as those of the fly-disease. But, of late years, a still more serious epizootic has appeared among the silkworms; and I may mention a few facts which will give you some conception of the gravity of the injury which it has inflicted on France alone.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have already}} shown, {{in the earlier}} part of this chapter, that many {{instances}} of change, imputed to the inheritance of acquired variations, are really cases of selection; while {{the very fact that}} use implies usefulness renders it almost impossible to eliminate the action of selection in a state of nature. As regards mutilations, it is generally admitted that they are not hereditary, and there is ample evidence on this point. When it was the fashion to dock horses' tails, it was not found that horses were born with short tails; nor are Chinese women born with distorted feet; nor are any of the numerous forms of racial mutilation in man, which have in some cases been carried on for hundreds of generations, inherited. Nevertheless, a few cases of apparent inheritance of mutilations have been recorded,[215] and these, if trustworthy, are difficulties {{in the way of the}} theory. The undoubted inheritance of disease is hardly a difficulty, because the predisposition to disease is a congenital, not an acquired character, and as such would be the subject of inheritance. The often-quoted case of a disease induced by mutilation being inherited (Brown-Sequard's epileptic guinea-pigs) has been discussed by Professor Weismann, and shown to be not conclusive. The mutilation itself--a section of certain nerves--was never inherited, but the resulting epilepsy, or a general state of weakness, deformity, or sores, was sometimes inherited. It is, however, possible that the mere injury introduced and encouraged the growth of certain microbes, which, spreading through the organism, sometimes reached the germ-cells, and thus transmitted a diseased condition to the offspring. Such a transference of microbes is believed to occur in syphilis and tuberculosis, and has been ascertained to occur in the case of the <b>muscardine</b> silkworm disease.[216] ...|$|E

5000|$|Beauveria bassiana, {{the fungus}} that causes white <b>muscardine</b> disease in various insects ...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the best}} known forms is white <b>muscardine,</b> which is caused by Beauveria bassiana.|$|E
50|$|Other insects {{prone to}} white <b>muscardine</b> include the brown planthopper and the diaprepes root weevil.|$|E
50|$|Penicillosis {{of insects}} is {{considered}} a type of <b>muscardine,</b> particularly when caused by Penicillum citrinum and P. granulatum.|$|E
50|$|Grassy <b>muscardine</b> {{is caused}} by Hirsutella necatrix. This fungus {{produces}} an enzyme that breaks down the chitin in its host's body.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>muscardine.</b> They are often named for {{the color of the}} conidial layer each fungus leaves on its host.|$|E
50|$|Yellow red <b>muscardine</b> {{is caused}} by Paecilomyces fumosoroseus. It can produce reddish patches on the {{external}} body and powdery masses of spores internally.|$|E
50|$|The insect disease {{caused by}} the fungus is a <b>muscardine</b> which has been called white <b>muscardine</b> disease. When the {{microscopic}} spores of the fungus {{come into contact with}} the body of an insect host, they germinate, penetrate the cuticle, and grow inside, killing the insect within a matter of days. Afterwards, a white mold emerges from the cadaver and produces new spores. A typical isolate of B. bassiana can attack a broad range of insects; various isolates differ in their host range. The factors responsible for host susceptibility are not known.|$|E
5000|$|Aspergillosis {{of insects}} {{can be called}} brown <b>muscardine.</b> Over 10 Aspergillus species can cause the disease, such as A. flavus and A. tamari. The conidial layer may be {{brownish}} or greenish yellow.|$|E
50|$|Fungicidal agents such as {{azadirachtin}} and phytoallexin {{have been}} used against some <b>muscardine</b> pathogens. Silkworm breeders dust their cages with slaked lime to discourage fungal growth. In India a dust of chaff soaked in formalin {{is applied to the}} larvae.|$|E
50|$|While {{studying}} <b>muscardine</b> in silkworms in the 19th century, Agostino Bassi {{found that}} the causal agent was a fungus. This was the first demonstration of the germ theory of disease, {{the first time a}} microorganism was recognized as an animal pathogen.|$|E

50|$|He {{became a}} {{professor}} of mineralogy and zoology at the University of Pavia in 1851, and was appointed professor of comparative anatomy in 1863. He was interested in various domains of natural history, and identified the fungus responsible for the white <b>muscardine</b> disease of silkworms, Beauveria bassiana.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{enemies of}} the moth include several parasites such as the tachinid fly Lydella grisescens, the braconid wasp Macrocentrus cingulum, and the ichneumon wasp Eriborus terebrans. It is also {{susceptible}} to the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Nosema furnacalis. It may develop the insect disease <b>muscardine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Green <b>muscardine</b> {{is caused}} by Nomuraea rileyi. Keepers of {{silkworms}} recognize symptoms such as dark brownish lesions with lighter centers on the sides and back of the larva. At death the larva turns white {{and within a few}} days it is covered in a bright green fungal coating.|$|E
50|$|In the 1830s in Italy, Agostino Bassi {{traced the}} {{silkworm}} disease <b>muscardine</b> to microorganisms. Meanwhile, in Germany, Theodor Schwann led research on alcoholic fermentation by yeast, proposing that living microorganisms were responsible.Leading chemists, such as Justus von Liebig, seeking solely physicochemical explanations, derided this claim and alleged that Schwann was regressing to vitalism.|$|E

50|$|Beauveria bassiana is {{a fungus}} that grows {{naturally}} in soils {{throughout the world}} and acts as a parasite on various arthropod species, causing white <b>muscardine</b> disease; it thus belongs to the entomopathogenic fungi. It is {{being used as a}} biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as termites, thrips, whiteflies, aphids and different beetles. Its use in the control of bedbugs and malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation.|$|E
50|$|Agostino Bassi, {{sometimes}} called de Lodi (25 September 1773 - 8 February 1856), was an Italian entomologist. He preceded Louis Pasteur {{in the discovery}} that microorganisms can {{be the cause of}} disease (the germ theory of disease). He discovered that the <b>muscardine</b> disease of silkworms was caused by a living, very small, parasitic organism, a fungus that would be named eventually Beauveria bassiana in his honor. In 1844, he stated the idea that not only animal (insect), but also human diseases are caused by other living microorganisms; for example, measles, syphilis, and the plague.|$|E
50|$|When {{suffering}} from white <b>muscardine,</b> an insect larva may become inactive and stop eating. The elasticity of its cuticle is lost {{and it may}} experience vomiting and diarrhea. As it dies it hardens. The fungus leaves the body of its host covered in powdery white conidia. The fungal layer is tough due to oxalate crystals, and this slows the decay of the body. When a pupa is infected, it often mummifies. It shrinks and wrinkles before growing a fungal coating. In an adult moth, the body hardens and the wings drop off.|$|E

5000|$|The {{species is}} named after the Italian {{entomologist}} Agostino Bassi, who discovered it in 1815 {{as the cause of}} the <b>muscardine</b> disease which then led to carriers transmitting it by airborne means. It was formerly also known as Tritirachium shiotae. The name B. bassiana has long been used to describe a species complex of morphologically similar and closely related isolates. Rehner and Buckley [...] have shown that B. bassiana consists of many distinct lineages that should be recognized as distinct phylogenetic species and the genus Beauveria was redescribed with a proposed type for B. bassiana in 2011. [...] In light of this work and the known existence of cryptic species, it is important to characterise isolates used to develop biological insecticides.|$|E
5000|$|Monte Solarolo is a {{mountain}} of the Veneto, Italy. It has an elevation of 1,625 metres. Monte Solarolo, one of the [...] "Solaroli" [...] peaks, {{is one of several}} peaks on the ridge from Monte Valderoa leads to the summit of Monte Grappa. This divides two important valleys of the Massif, the Valley of Mure, descending becomes the torrent valley <b>muscardine</b> (Alano di Piave) and the Valley of Seren del Grappa, on the low Feltrino territory on the border with the municipalities of the Treviso foothills of Mt. Grappa.Fighting for the conquest of this summit in a long and bloody battle 25 to 27 October 1918, the Aosta Battalion of the IV Alpine regiment earned the gold medal for military valor.|$|E
50|$|The disease {{caused by}} the fungus is {{sometimes}} called green <b>muscardine</b> disease because of the green colour of its spores. When these mitotic (asexual) spores (called conidia) of the fungus {{come into contact with}} the body of an insect host, they germinate and the hyphae that emerge penetrate the cuticle. The fungus then develops inside the body eventually killing the insect after a few days; this lethal effect is very likely aided by the production of insecticidal cyclic peptides (destruxins). The cuticle of the cadaver often becomes red. If the ambient humidity is high enough, a white mould then grows on the cadaver that soon turns green as spores are produced. Most insects living near the soil have evolved natural defenses against entomopathogenic fungi like M. anisopliae. This fungus is therefore locked in an evolutionary battle to overcome these defenses, which has led to a large number of isolates (or strains) that are adapted to certain groups of insects.|$|E
