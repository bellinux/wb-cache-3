As market conditions for food products have changed in recent decades, the question is raised whether co-operatives are still efficient organisations for carrying transaction with agrifood products? Bijman (2002) has addressed this question for the fresh produce industry in The Netherlands. Traditionally, fruits and vegetables were sold through auctions, organised by grower-owned co-operatives. In the 1990 s several auction co-operatives merged, transformed into <b>marketing</b> <b>co-operatives,</b> and vertically integrated into wholesale. In addition, growers have set up many new bargaining associations and <b>marketing</b> <b>co-operatives.</b> These new co-operatives have started crop and variety specific marketing programmes.

Firstly, it reviews competitiveness factors in the current European agri-food market, especially {{in relation to the}} fruit and vegetables sector. Secondly, the productivity trend is studied empirically using nonparametric methods (Malmquist indices) and taking as reference panel data of Andalusian horticultural co-operatives for the period 1994 - 2001. For this purpose productivity is decomposed into technological change, efficiency and quality-environmental change. Additionally, the correlation of these results with other economic variables is analysed. The indicators obtained show a relevant increase in efficiency for the period under study and a high relationship between the results and product quality-environmental improvement. productivity, quality-environment, efficiency, <b>marketing</b> <b>co-operative,</b> horticultural sector, Agribusiness, Productivity Analysis, D 24, Q 13, Q 21, L 15,...|$|E

The co-operative is composed of self-described 'back-to-the-landers', who are motivated by an agrarian dream of {{a better quality of}} life, making a living off the land and contributing to the environmental sustainability of farming. Organic agriculture as a technical practice with a lucrative market holds the promise of realising these dreams, and the co-operative functions as an alternative food network that delivers organic produce to a regional market. The members of the co-operative employ a diversity of labour strategies, some of which reproduce the labour processes and outcomes of the conventional food systems, and others which (sometimes simultaneously) configure new social and economic relations with farm workers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{evaluate}} the economic rationale of input use by small trawlers in Kerala Coast. In order to estimate the production elasticities of different inputs, a Cobb- Douglas type of production function was fitted to the pooled data on coast and earnings of 50 trawlers for a period of 10 years from 1971 - 72 to 1980 - 81, obtained from Kozhikode Regional Fish <b>Marketing</b> <b>Co-operative</b> Society. For functional analysis, vessel-wise gross returns (in rupees) was taken as dependent variable and number of days fished, fuel expenditure (in rupees) and repairing and maintenance charges (in rupees) as independent variables. Marginality analysis was also done to evaluate the eflSciency of input use. The production function as well as the marginality analysis indicated that the increase in the number of days fished would lead to higher gross income. So also increase in oil expenditure from mean level would yield a more than proportionate increase in gross income. However, repairing and maintenance cost had a negative impact on fishing income which indicated that the vessel owner in his own interest should be cautious in the operation to avoid frequent repairs and to reduce the delay in getting the vessels repaired...|$|E

A multi-stage random sampling technique was adopted to select 96 beneficiaries and structured questionnaires as well as personal interview were used to collect data. Probit and logit models were used to analyse the factors influencing credit delinquency among food crop farmers in the state. Result of the descriptive analysis of the socio-economic characteristic of respondents revealed that 93 % of male and 72 % of female food crop farmers had one form of formal education ranging from primary to tertiary education. Empirical result from the Probit and logit models were similar and showed that borrower’s non-farm income, credit amount received, household size, net farm profit and farm size are determinants of credit delinquencies among food crop farmers in Akwa Ibom state.

Next, he worked for one year as a teacher at the Faculty of Philosophy and Technical Social Sciences, Delft Technical University. In September 1991 he joined the LEI, where his research initially focused on technology assessment and socio-economic impacts of agricultural biotechnology. In recent years he has extended his expertise to internationalisation of agribusiness and the organisation of (international) agrifood chains. The author has written many reports and articles on the impact of agricultural biotechnology, recently in the (electronic) journals AgBioForum (www. agbioforum. org), Biotechnology and Development Monitor, International Journal of Biotechnology and Food Policy. Articles on internationalisation, co-operatives and the organisation of the agrifood chain have appeared in Dutch journals, such as Co?peratie, Spil, TSL, Maandschrift voor Accountancy en Bedrijfseconomie, and in English journals such as American Journal of Agricultural Economics, and the European Review of Agricultural Economics. This thesis studies the efficiency of the <b>marketing</b> <b>co-operative</b> for carrying out transactions with farm products. A co-operative is a special type of governance structure, characterised by collective ownership and forward vertical integration. These characteristics influence investment decisions by farmers and other firms in the agrifood chain. As vertical co-ordination has become more important in agrifood markets, investments in production and marketing become co-specialised. The main question is whether the farmerowned co-operative induces optimal incentives for complementary investments in two (or more) stages of the chain. The empirical research focuses on the Dutch fruit and vegetable industry...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} primarily with the export marketing {{performance of the}} Northern Ireland seed potato industry. The Industry has shown a dramatic decline in exports {{over the past twenty}} years, and this thesis proposes strategies aimed at regaining, and maintaining, a competitive advantage for the industry in world markets. A comparative analysis is conducted of the strategic and organisational export capabilities of the Northern Ireland industry and its main competitors. In addition, an analysis of the requirements of major world seed potato markets is undertaken. Academically, the thesis aims to apply the principles of export marketing to a traditionally managed sector of agriculture. As such, it is hoped that the thesis makes a useful contribution to the literature on agricultural marketing and export marketing. Major academic themes explored in the thesis include - Globalisation versus 'customisation' - New product development strategy and export success - Product-life-cycle analysis and product-enhancement strategies - Export promotional strategies - The utility of horizontal and marketing performances - 'Market spreading' versus 'key market concentration' vertical integration in enhancing - Centrality or peripherality of the export function The central hypothesis explored in the thesis is that in an agricultural industry, such as a seed potato one, where production is fragmented over a. large number of small production units, then a necessary prerequisite to successful strategic exporting is the existence of an appropriate organisational structure to carry out the strategic tasks. This hypothesis is confirmed by the findings of the research. As the product and service requirements of world seed potato markets have changed over the years, and are becoming more sophisticated, the Northern Ireland industry has been unable to adopt an appropriate customisation strategy in response. This is due to the inhibiting effect of an inappropriate organisational structure within the industry. By way of contrast, industries which have developed considerably by responding to changing market requirements (such as the Netherlands, France and Scotland) are characterised by a strongly integrated organisational structure (both horizontal and vertical). In all these countries this has largely been achieved by the development of marketing co-operatives. In seeking to propose export marketing strategies for the Northern Ireland industry therfore, a necessary prerequisite is to establish an appropriately integrated organisational system within the industry. As the seed potato <b>marketing</b> <b>co-operative</b> Expotato Limited has already begun to introduce a horizontally and vertically intergrated discipline into the Northern Ireland industry, it is suggested that this co-operative should be further developed as a catalyst for positive organisational and strategic development of the industry [...] .

40|$|By the mid- 1970 s, Tanzania had {{the biggest}} {{co-operative}} movement in Africa and the oldest in East Africa. Despite such achievement, for decades, the literature on Tanzania’s small-scale coffee and cotton cultivation and marketing co-operatives has suffered from a dearth of substantive historical accounts. The available literature is fragmented along various academic disciplines, mostly political science and sociology. In addition, {{there is no single}} substantive secondary historical study specifically dedicated to the co-operative movement since the inception in 1932. The neglect is more critical given the current renaissance in Africa and increasing international interest in the co-operative movement at either national or local levels. This thesis seeks to fill this gap by utilising primary sources from the Co-operative College archive in Manchester and Tanzania National Archive (TNA) to examine and evaluate the coffee and cotton marketing co-operatives during the 1932 to 1982 period. The study further explores the interlocking forces and policies that led to its growth and development. The development is also examined against the changing political and ideological influences during the interwar, and post-war to independence periods. This thesis is structured under three cases, two of which are coffee marketing co-operatives, the Kilimanjaro Native Co-operative Union (KNCU) and Bukoba Co-operative Union (BCU) in Kagera; and the cotton apex <b>marketing</b> <b>co-operative</b> in the WCGA, the Victoria Federation of Co-operative Unions (VFCUS) which was formed in 1955. Study findings show that the time gap {{in the formation of the}} mentioned co-operatives were due to the colonial authority neglecting its own co-operative development policy. The evidence shows that, the KNCU which was formed in 1933 and BCU in 1950 were both established at the behest of the British colonial government in a move to control the coffee industry. Importantly, the study examines the power relations involved and the government interventions in the process and the extent to which the co-operatives were promoted and controlled by the government through the co-operative and agricultural marketing policies and legislations. This was particularly provided under Section 36 of the 1932 co-operative legislation and was further reinforced by three policies, the 1934 Chagga Rule, the 1937 Native (control and marketing) Ordinance and the Defence Ordinance, Orders of 1939 and 1940; and the African Agricultural Products (Control and Marketing) Ordinance, 1949. The post-colonial authority perpetuated the colonial policies in promoting co-operatives and the control of agricultural export revenues provided under the 1962 by the National Agricultural Products Board (Control and Marketing) Act by intensifying the intervention, effectively strangling and restructuring them to provide for effective control. Again, there was an increased politisation of the movement’s function as they became an integral part of the propagation of the socialist/ujamaa ideology and the national development plan as the 1976 villagisation policy. This study is of the view that the colonial and post-colonial authorities intervened in the formation of co-operatives given the fact that they were economically strategically vital. During the phases covered in this thesis, the established legislations reinforced the government’s control over the co-operative movement and the producers; and granted themselves a monopoly over the handling and export of small-scale produced coffee and cotton through the control of marketing boards by appointing co-operatives as crop handling agents. Thus, the co-operative movement never attained autonomous status as it became part of the government machinery in extracting resources and exploiting small-scale growers...|$|E
