40|$|Background: The {{micronuclei}} (<b>MNi)</b> <b>test</b> on exfoliated cells {{has been}} successfully used to screen population groups at risk for cancers of oral cavity, urinary bladder, cervix and esophagus. Their frequency appears to increase in carcinogen-exposed tissues long before any clinical symptoms are evident. There are only limited numbers of studies on MN scoring in cervical pre-neoplastic and neoplastic conditions. Aims : To compare the micronucleus (MN) score in the whole spectrum of cervical lesions including normal, inflammatory, abnormal squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), abnormal squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and invasive cancer (IC) and to evaluate the role of MN as a biomarker in different pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions. Materials and Methods: A total of 221 slides, comprised of normal (32), inflammatory (32), ASC-US (31), ASC-H (31), LSIL (32), HSIL (31) and IC (32), were studied. All the cases were reviewed by two pathologists independently. Histopathological correlation was done {{in a few cases}} of ASC-US, ASC-H, HSIL and IC which were available in the department. Two observers separately and independently counted the number of micronucleated cells per 1, 000 epithelial cells in oil immersion magnification and were expressed as MN score per 1, 000 cells. Results : The mean MN scores ± SD in normal, inflammatory, ASC-US, ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL and IC cases of cervical lesions were 0. 84 ± 0. 68, 1. 06 ± 0. 84, 3 ± 0. 73, 4. 78 ± 1. 43, 4. 06 ± 1. 13, 8. 03 ± 1. 64 and 10. 5 ± 2. 01, respectively. MN scores of IC and HSIL were significantly high compared to normal (P< 0. 000), inflammatory (P< 0. 000), ASC-US (P< 0. 000), ASC-H (P< 0. 000) and LSIL (P< 0. 000) group (analysis of variance test). LSIL showed significant difference with the normal (P< 0. 000), inflammatory (P= 0. 001), ASC-US (P= 0. 028), HSIL (P< 0. 000) and IC (< 0. 000), but not with the ASC-H (P= 0. 64) group. Conclusions: MN scoring on the epithelial cells of cervix {{could be used as a}} biomarker in cancer screening. This is an easy, simple, reliable, reproducible and objective test which can be performed on routinely stained pap smears...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tissue {{specific}} promoters may {{be utilized}} {{for a variety}} of applications, including programmed gene expression in cell types, tissues and organs of interest, for developing different cell culture models or for use in gene therapy. We report a novel, tissue-specific promoter that was identified and engineered from the native upstream regulatory region of the human gene NDUFV 1 containing an endogenous retroviral sequence. Results: Among seven established human cell lines and five primary cultures, this modified NDUFV 1 upstream sequence (mNUS) was active only in human undifferentiated germ-derived cells (lines Tera- 1 and EP 2102), where it demonstrated high promoter activity (~twice greater than that of the SV 40 early promoter, and comparable to the routinely used cytomegaloviral promoter). To investigate the potential applicability of the mNUS promoter for biotechnological needs, a construct carrying a recombinant cytosine deaminase (RCD) suicide gene under the control of <b>mNUS</b> was <b>tested</b> in cell lines of different tissue origin. High cytotoxic effect of RCD with a cell-death rate ~ 60 % was observed only in germ-derived cells (Tera- 1), whereas no effect was seen in a somatic, kidneyderived control cell line (HEK 293). In further experiments, we tested mNUS-driven expression of a hyperactive Sleeping Beauty transposase (SB 100 X). The mNUS-SB 100 X construct mediated stable transgene insertions exclusively in germ-derived cells, thereby providing further evidence of tissue-specificity of the mNUS promoter...|$|R

Conclusions We conclude that mNUS may be used as an efficient promoter for tissue-specific gene expression in human germ-derived cells in many applications. Our data also suggest that the 91 bp-long sequence located exactly upstream NDUFV 1 transcriptional start site plays {{a crucial role in the}} activity of this gene promoter in vitro in the majority of tested cell types (10 / 12), and an important role - in the rest two cell lines. </p...|$|R
