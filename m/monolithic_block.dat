An American company {{in the midst of}} the Apollo program, launched in 1961, pioneered the stacking of multiple discs to create a <b>monolithic</b> <b>block.</b> This [...] "multi-layer ceramic capacitor" [...] (MLCC) was compact and offered high-capacitance capacitors. The production of these capacitors using the tape casting and ceramic-electrode cofiring processes was a great manufacturing challenge. MLCCs expanded the range of applications to those requiring larger capacitance values in smaller cases. These ceramic chip capacitors were the driving force behind the conversion of electronic devices from through-hole mounting to surface-mount technology in the 1980s. Polarized electrolytic capacitors could be replaced by non-polarized ceramic capacitors, simplifying the mounting.|$|E

They provide comparable spatial resolution, improve the sensitivity and make easier the mechanical design of the system. In this study we evaluate by means of Geant 4 -based simulations the possibility of replacing the APDs by SiPMs. Several commercial matrices of light sensors coupled to LYSO:Ce <b>monolithic</b> <b>blocks</b> have been simulated and compared.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of the hereby study was the {{description}} of microstructure and properties of the new low-carbon Mn-Cr-Mo-V-Ni bainitic cast steel developed in the AGH Laboratory of Phase Transformations for cast mono-blocks of scissors crossovers. Investigations comprise material in as-cast state and after various variants of normalization as well as normalization and high tempering. Design/methodology/approach: Analyses of microstructure, strength properties, impact toughness and crack resistance (KIc) were performed both for material in the as-cast state and after heat treatments. The influence of the initial microstructure on the investigated cast steel hardness – after the normalizing and after the normalizing and tempering – was determined. Findings: Changes in the microstructure of the cast bainitic scissors crossovers were determined and their properties described. Research limitations/implications: The investigations were performed in order to estimate a possibility of applying bainitic cast steels for production of scissors crossovers {{in the form of}} <b>monolithic</b> <b>blocks.</b> Practical implications: Application of bainitic cast steels for scissors crossovers in the form of <b>monolithic</b> <b>blocks.</b> Originality/value: Designing of the chemical composition of the bainitic cast steel (Mn-Cr-Mo-V-Ni) and its heat treatment...|$|R

30|$|To achieve better {{predictability}} {{and improve}} memory requirements and execution speed, we optimize the dataflow model for DTSMD by grouping together or “clustering” selected actors. The resulting clusters are implemented as <b>monolithic</b> <b>blocks</b> of optimized code—that is, they {{are combined into}} individual actors of increased complexity, while the overall dataflow graph is of somewhat reduced complexity, as shown in Fig.  3. In this optimized dataflow graph, production and consumption rates are of a more predictable parametric synchronous dataflow (parametric SDF) form, which means that for a given set of graph parameters, the dataflow rates are all constant. We distinguish our use of parametric synchronous dataflow modeling here from the parameterized dataflow meta-model [15], which is a more specialized dataflow modeling technique that is not employed in this work.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the Library building began in 1961. The project was designed by the group of architects - A. A. Volovik, E.V. Amosov and the consultant architect from Moscow F.N. Paschenko. The building got the form of <b>monolithic</b> <b>block</b> with the symmetric decision of its façade. The transfer of books and the departments of the Library began in 1967, on January, 7 (when the first container with books arrived at Novosibirsk) and was finished on May 31, 1965, (when the last container was received).|$|E
50|$|Conceptualised {{with the}} HIP {{objective}} in mind, the {{collaboration between the}} two architectural firms resulted in a postmodern pluralistic collage of experimental building forms. The architecture of the Gallery Hotel consists of several seemingly disjointed, unrelated building forms meshed together. These forms are each disparately expressed and connected by a circulation system of internal streets, gangways and stairways, aiming to {{give a sense of}} urban complexity to the scheme. With a narrow end fronting the Singapore River, the architects worked to create a microcosm of the city in the restricted site, rather than a <b>monolithic</b> <b>block.</b>|$|E
50|$|Roller-compacted concrete, {{sometimes}} called rollcrete, is a low-cement-content stiff concrete placed using techniques borrowed from earthmoving and paving work. The concrete {{is placed on}} the surface to be covered, and is compacted in place using large heavy rollers typically used in earthwork. The concrete mix achieves a high density and cures over time into a strong <b>monolithic</b> <b>block.</b> Roller-compacted concrete is typically used for concrete pavement, but has also been used to build concrete dams, as the low cement content causes less heat to be generated while curing than typical for conventionally placed massive concrete pours.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} propose a non {{structural}} system of partition walls with <b>monolithic</b> <b>blocks</b> based on a composite material resulting from an admixture of cork and textile fibers combined with a non cement binder, gypsum. These blocks consist of two half blocks which have to be connected during laying process. The developed blocks were first tested under compressive and flexural loading in order to derive their mechanical behaviour. Different curing conditions were applied to the blocks during their production in order to evaluate the effect on eth behaviour. The variables analyzed included curing temperature and period of curing, ambient humidity in which the blocks were prepared. This study aims at obtaining insight {{on the influence of}} these parameters on the mechanical behaviour of the blocks and at providing guidelines for their use in construction sites. ...|$|R

50|$|Crownlays are {{typically}} used {{in place of}} traditional post and core restorations. Post and core buildups are essentially rods of restorative material made out of titanium, stainless steel or resin that glean extra surface area against the internal walls of root canal-treated teeth when {{there is little to}} no tooth left above the gumline to hold a normal crown or onlay in place. The post and core buildup serve to aid in retention of a traditional crown but increase the likelihood of root fracture because chewing forces are directed vertically along the hollowed out and subsequent weaker remnants of the internal surfaces of an endodontically-treated (root-canal-treated) tooth. Crownlays {{are typically}} constructed from milled, <b>monolithic</b> <b>blocks</b> of solid porcelain which not only very intimately fit the prepared tooth, but are acid etched and bonded into place using very strong resin materials, decreasing the need for physical retention.|$|R

40|$|Multiobjective {{evolutionary}} algorithms (MOEAs) {{are typically}} proposed, studied, and applied as <b>monolithic</b> <b>blocks</b> {{with a few}} numerical parameters {{that need to be}} set. Few works have studied how the algorithmic components of these evolutionary algorithms can be classified and combined to produce new algorithmic designs. The motivation for studies of this latter type stem from the development of flexible software frameworks and the usage of automatic algorithm configuration methods to find novel algorithm designs. In this paper, we propose anMOEA template and a new conceptual view of its components that surpasses existing frameworks in both number of algorithms that can be instantiated from the template and flexibility to produce novel algorithmic designs. We empirically demonstrate the flexibility of our proposed framework by automatically designing MOEAs for continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. The automatically designed algorithms are often able to outperform six traditional MOEAs from the literature, even after tuning their numerical parameters.

Two different compositions of industrial sludge were characterized and loaded in ratios ranging from 10 to 50 wt. %. Setting times and compressive strengths were recorded to establish the feasibility of this method to achieve a good handling and a safe landfilling of these samples. Short solidification periods were found and leaching tests showed an excellent retention for toxic metals (Zn, Ni, Cu, Cr and Mn) and for organic matter. Retentions over 99. 9 % for Zn and Mn were observed even for loadings as high as 50 wt. % of the wastes.

40|$|Pervasive {{devices are}} {{becoming}} popular and smaller. Those mobile systems {{should be able}} to adapt to changing requirements and execution environments. But it requires the ability to reconfigure deployed codes, which is considerably simplified if applications are component-oriented rather than <b>monolithic</b> <b>blocks</b> of codes. So, we propose a middleware approach called WComp which federates an event-driven component-oriented approach to compose services for devices. This approach is coupled with adaptation mechanisms dealing with separation of concerns. In such mechanisms, aspects (called Aspects of Assembly) are selected either by the user or by a self-adaptive process and composed by a weaver with logical merging of high-level specifications. The result of the weaver is then projected in terms of pure elementary modifications of components assemblies with respect to blackbox properties of COTS components. Our approach is validated by analyzing the results of different experiments drawn from sets of application configurations randomly generated and by showing its advantages while evaluating the additional costs on the reaction time to context changing...|$|R
