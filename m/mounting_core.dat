30|$|Cores were air dried while loosely <b>mounted</b> in <b>core</b> <b>mounts</b> with {{multiple}} strips of low-stick painter’s tape to allow sanding {{to provide a}} ‘readable’ surface. Normally cores would be glued in place before sanding but the subsequent use of these cores for destructive stable isotope sampling meant non-permanent mounting was preferable. Sanded cores were visually cross-dated, using a binocular microscope when necessary. Ring-width measurements were taken using a Velmex measuring stage with a precision of 0.001  mm. These ring-width data were then converted to a growth index (a process called standardisation). This process compares the width of an individual ring to those rings around it, making it an internally relative standard. Standardisation allowed for the comparison of fast- and slow-growing individuals on the same scale and removed trends related to age or stand dynamics. Growth-index data were then used to confirm the visual cross-dating using COFECHA software (Holmes [1983]). A raw ring-width ‘site master chronology’ was compiled from the average of all cores.|$|R

The results. indicated that decreasing oil recovery and tertiary recovery factors were noticed with decreasing oil API for miscible WAG flooding. This {{is believed to be}} a resultof wettability alteration and viscous fingering. Equal ultimate recovery was obtained for the miscible experiments conducted with different brine composition and concentration with some delay in approaching that recovery when using the low salinity brine solution. However, switching from low to high salinity brine resulted in an increase in tertiary recovery factor "TRF" and slight decreasein the CO 2 Utilization factor "UF". Miscible WAG injection in vertically <b>mounted</b> <b>core</b> sample representing updipping reservoirs was investigated and resulted in slightly lower oil recoverycompared to that obtained from horizontally laid core sample at the same conditions of WAG ratio and slug size.

40|$|Researchers have {{reported}} that tall grain sorghum will outyield short grain sorghum within the same isogenic line (15, 23). With this fact in mind, we then logically question why the taller line outyields the shorter. Since these isogenic lines are genetically the same except for the desired character of height, to what can we attribute this increased yield?Could it be the crop canopy as influenced by height, or could it be the root system? When we reduce the plant height, we, in essence, merely shorten the intermodal dimensions of the plant. Does this dwarfing also {{reduce the size of}} the plant’s root system?Will this dwarfing reduce the number of lateral and fibrous roots? If so, reduction of the lateral and fibrous roots in both number and length could reduce the plant’s efficiency in obtaining essential nutrients and water. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the possibility of differences existing in the root systems of 3 dwarf and 2 dwarf RS 610 hybrid grain sorghums. If differences were found to occur, this could be a factor in yield differences. Two methods of approach were utilized. The first involved the actual examination of the sorghum root systems in the field. This required the establishment of a technique of taking selective samples of roots from plants grown in the field under production conditions. The second approach was to utilize the same isogenic lines under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. The entire plants could be compared in this manner. The utilization of soil coring techniques for comparative study of root systems seemed to be a workable system. The soil coring procedure showed the extent of the development of the root system in the field without total root extraction. This technique could also be utilized to analyze the effects of soil matrix problems on root extension and development. The major disadvantages to this method are several. The soil coring technique destroys adjacent plants in the plot area if truck or tractor <b>mounted</b> <b>coring</b> machines are utilized. The comparative study of root systems with this method requires a soil survey in order to secure an area of uniform soil profile. This method usually requires at least two men to secure the samples in the field. The washing of the soil cores is a long and often tedious process when a great many samples are taken.

40|$|The {{relation}} of interannual connection between Asian dust outbreaks and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT) in spring was {{suggested by the}} dust and tritium variations in the <b>Mount</b> Wrangell ice <b>core,</b> Alaska in Yasunari et al. (2007). However, these impacts on the ice core site in each event scale have not been investigated. Hence, the present paper focuses on the material transport and deposition processes for further understanding these impacts oil the ice core. The variations in dust and tritium concentrations in spring in an ice core taken at Mt. Wrangell, Alaska are explained by meteorological analysis and simulation of trajectories associated with Asian dust outbreaks and STT. Material transport and deposition at Mt. Wrangell are examined in two contrasting years (2001 and 2002). Dust and tritium concentrations both reached peak values {{in the early spring}} of 2002, while the dust peak occurred in early spring and the tritium peak occurred in late spring in 2001. Six severe East Asian transpacific dust storms over this period are modeled by forward trajectory and meteorologically analyzed. It is found that 5 of 6 events contributed to the ice core record in Alaska. Stratospheric air is also transported to the ice core site in most cases. Tritium deposition is found to have been suppressed in the cases of the 2001 dust Storms due to lack of snowfall at appropriate times. Taken the detailed transport and deposition processes after the severe dust storms with atmospheric circulations into account, we can well explain spring dust and tritium variations in the <b>Mount</b> Wrangell ice <b>core...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{scientific}} borehole, CO 2 W 55, was drilled into an onshore anticline, {{near the}} town of Green River, Utah for the purposes of studying a series of natural CO 2 reservoirs. The objective of this research project is to recover core and fluids from natural CO 2 accumulations in order to study and understand the long-term consequences of exposure of supercritical CO 2, CO 2 -gas and CO 2 -charged fluids on geological materials. This will improve our ability to predict the security of future geological CO 2 storage sites and the behaviour of CO 2 during migration through the overburden. The Green River anticline is thought to contain supercritical reservoirs of CO 2 in Permian sandstone and Mississippian-Pennsylvanian carbonate and evaporite formations at depths > 800 m. Migration of CO 2 and CO 2 -charged brine from these deep formations, through the damage zone of two major normal faults in the overburden, feeds a stacked series of shallow reservoirs in Jurassic sandstones from 500 m depth to near surface. The drill-hole was spudded into the footwall of the Little Grand Wash normal fault at the apex of the Green River anticline, near the site of Crystal Geyser, a CO 2 -driven cold water geyser. The hole was drilled using a CS 4002 Truck <b>Mounted</b> <b>Core</b> Drill to a total depth of 322 m and DOSECC’s hybrid coring system was used to continuously recover core. CO 2 -charged fluids were first encountered at ~ 35 m depth, in the basal sandstones of the Entrada Sandstone, which is open to surface, the fluids being effectively sealed by thin siltstone layers within the sandstone unit. The well penetrated a ~ 17 m thick fault zone within the Carmel Formation, the footwall damage zone of which hosted CO 2 -charged fluids in open fractures. CO 2 -rich fluids were encountered throughout the thickness of the Navajo Sandstone. The originally red sandstone and siltstone units, where they are in contact with the CO 2 -charged fluids, have been bleached by dissolution of hematite grain coatings. Fluid samples were collected from the Navajo Sandstone at formation pressures using a positive displacement wireline sampler, and fluid CO 2 content and pH were measured at surface using high pressure apparatus. The results from the fluid sampling show that the Navajo Sandstone is being fed by active inflow of CO 2 -saturated brines through the fault damage zone; that these brines mix with meteoric fluid flowing laterally into the fault zone; and that the downhole fluid sampling whilst drilling successfully captures this dynamic process...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Sea ice {{plays an}} {{important}} role in ocean–atmosphere heat exchange, global albedo and the marine ecosystem. Knowledge of variation in sea-ice extent is essential in order to understand past climates, and to model possible future climate scenarios. This paper presents results from a short firn core spanning 15 years collected from near Mount Brown, Wilhelm II Land, East Antarctica. Variations of methanesulphonic acid (MSA) at Mount Brown were positively correlated with sea-ice extent from the coastal region surrounding Mount Brown (60 – 1208 E) and from around the entire Antarctic coast (0 – 3608 E). Previous results from Law Dome identified this MSA–sea-ice relationship and proposed it as an Antarctic sea-ice proxy (Curran and others, 2003), with the strongest results found for the local Law Dome region. Our data provide supporting evidence for the Law Dome proxy (at another site in East Antarctica), but a deeper <b>Mount</b> Brown ice <b>core</b> is required to confirm the sea-ice decline suggested by Curran and others (2003).

40|$|Disclosed are any {{electronic}} system or module which includes embedded actives and discrete passives, and methods {{for use in}} fabricating packages containing embedded active devices and/or discrete passive devices. Exemplary apparatus comprises a plurality of build-up layers defining circuit interconnections and that comprise one or more thin film type of embedded passive devices, at least a cavity formed in the build-up layers, and at least an active device and/or at least a discrete passive device disposed in the cavity and electrically connected to the circuit interconnections of the build-up layers. A stiffener may be coupled to an exposed (back) surface of the active device and to an adjacent surface of the build-up layers. The build-up layers may be <b>mounted</b> to a <b>core,</b> and the core may be attached to {{a printed circuit board}}. Alternatively, a bottom surface of the build-up layers may be mounted to a printed circuit board without core. The packages have a chip reworkability, an easier thermal management, a very thin profile and enhanced electrical performance comparable to packages produced using chip-first or chip-middle approaches.

40|$|The plate {{silencer}} [1] {{that consists}} of an expansion chamber with two side-branch cavities covered by a light panel can achieve a desirable noise reduction in broadband theoretically. The concept is similar to drum silencer [Choy YS, Huang L. Experimental studies of drum-like silencer. J Acoust Soc Am 2002; 112 : 2026 - 35]. To attain optimal noise reduction, either the membrane of the silencer should be of minimal weight while retaining very high tensile strength or the panel should be kept at very high bending stiffness that is dependent on its geometry and mechanical properties. To achieve such goal, various kinds of composite system such as carbon fibres or aluminum were <b>mounted</b> on light <b>core</b> foam to build a noise reflection panel. A design of composite panels which can provide a reduction in panel weight as well as enhance the bending stiffness, is introduced in this paper. Predictions of the new model are to {{be compared with the}} normal foam plate in the aspects of noise reflection capability and performance of noise abatement apart from the material properties.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{modeling}} the response of an eddy-current probe made {{by one or more}} coils <b>mounted</b> on magnetic <b>cores.</b> The numerical model is based on an integral formulation in terms of the induced eddy-current J and the magnetization vector M. In terms of numerical modeling, the presence of the magnetic material has a major impact on the computational cost when, as in usual eddy current test operations, the probe is moved {{on the surface of the}} test specimen. Here, we propose an efficient numerical method, based on an integral formulation, to model the response of eddy-current testing probes with a magnetic core. The magnetic material is supposed to be homogeneous and linear. This last assumption is motivated by the circumstance that the fields levels occurring in typical eddy-current testing operations are low. The magnetization vector is, then, the gradient of an harmonic function and it admits a minimal representation made by a set of unknowns associated to a proper subset of edges of the boundary of the magnetic domain. An experimental test shows the accuracy of the method and the foundation of the underlying hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Sheet metal {{is often}} stored in large wound coils and {{processed}} through such manufactur-ing stages as cleaning, coating, and slitting in a finishing plant or thickness reduction in a rolling mill. During winding and unwinding operations, {{as well as}} during storage and transportation, a coil can be supported {{in a variety of}} methods. The coil can be formed on a relatively compliant fiber core, or it can be <b>mounted</b> with the <b>core</b> onto a drive shaft or a pair of core chucks. The stresses within the coil develop in response to the sheet metal’s material properties, the process tension, and the type of support condition that is present along the coil’s inner diameter. In this investigation, a two-dimensional finite element model is applied to capture the stress distribution within sheet metal coils. The influence of support condition on the state of stress is investigated for sheet metal on a core alone, and for the cases in which the coil is supported by a drive shaft or core chucks during winding. The radial and width-wise variations of the stress components are calculated and compared {{in the light of the}} differences in compliance between the three means of support...|$|R
