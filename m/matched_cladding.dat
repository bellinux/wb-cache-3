40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the research on}} optimization of the splicing process in the electric arc of telecommunication optical fibers and erbium doped EDF fibers. The results of the calculations of diffusion coefficients GeO 2 in telecommunication optical fibers and diffusion coefficients Er and Al 2 O 3 (together) in the fiber EDF are presented. Diffusion coefficients were determined for the fusion temperature in the electric arc ≈ 2000 ◦C, {{on the basis of}} changes, along the splice, of spliced thermoluminescence intensity profiles of the fibers. On the basis of knowledge of diffusion coefficients simulation calculation of loss joints of MC SMF fiber (<b>Matched</b> <b>Cladding</b> Single Mode Fiber – SiO 2 : GeO 2) and NZDS SMF (Non Zero Dispersion Shifted – Single Mode Fiber – SiO 2 : GeO 2) with EDF (Erbium Doped Fiber – SiO 2 : Al 2 O 3, Er) was performed and presented as a function of diffusion time. Experimental studies of optimization of thermal connected MC SMF and NZDS SMF with EDF were presented and compared with theoretical results. This paper {{presents the}} results of microscopic observations of defects and diffusion, and X-ray microanalysis in the spliced areas of single-mode telecommunication optical fibers: MC SMF, NZDS-SMF and erbium doped active single mode optical fibers. Studies were performed {{with the use of the}} scanning electron microscope JSM 5800 LV and JSM 6610 A microscope equipped with EDS X-ray spectrometer. Results showing the influence of heating time on the diffusion of core dopants and the formation of deformations in the splice areas were presented.

Bending losses are influenced by different optical parameters like Mode Field Diameter (MFD), Cut-off wavelength and MAC value. This paper highlights the results of a series of tests conducted, to determine the power loss of <b>matched</b> <b>clad</b> step index Single Mode Optical Fiber (SMF). The effect of MFD, Cut-off wavelength and MAC value have been studied with various macro and micro bend testing techniques.

The suitability of the nanowire lasers for use in plastic fiber communication systems with direct modulation is demonstrated through their modulation bandwidth of f- 3 dB,max = 3. 1 GHz, very low values of chirp (0. 8 Å) and α-parameter, and large differential gain (3. 1 × 10 - 17 cm 2) ...|$|R

Films of gallium lanthanum sulphide (Ga:La:S) glass were deposited onto an expansion coefficient <b>matched</b> Ga:La:S <b>cladding</b> substrate. These amorphous films, with an optimized composition designed to be resistant against crystallization, were observed to have an excellent interface quality and uniformity. The designed planar chip had a buried core, 6   µm thick in the vertical direction, in single-mode operation at 1. 064   µm and a measured propagation loss of < 0. 2   dB  cm– 1.

A high temperature capable hydrogen sensor composed of D-shaped optical fiber with palladium nanoparticles infused nanoporous (~ 5 nm) TiO 2 film is demonstrated. The behavior of the developed sensor was characterized by examining the wavelength of an incorporated Fiber Bragg Grating and by observing the transmission losses at temperatures up to 700 C. In addition, with frequency domain reflectometry the distributed sensing potential of the developed sensor for hydrogen concentrations of up to 10 % is examined. The results show the possibility of detecting chemical gradients with sub-cm resolution at very high temperatures(> 500 C).

40|$|Flow cytometers {{are widely}} applied to {{environmental}} monitoring, industrial testing, and biochemical studies. Integrating a flow cytometer into microfluidic networks helps to miniaturize {{the system and}} make it portable for field use. The integration of optical components, such as lenses, further improves the compactness and thus has been intensively studied recently. However, the current designs suffer from severe light scattering due to the roughness of the solid-based lens interface. In this Letter, we propose a flow cytometer using an optofluidic lens to focus the light beam.

40|$|Large mode area rod-type fibers {{have enabled}} {{amplification}} of ultra-short pulses to mJ pulse energy and MW peak powers. For very large mode field areas, fibers {{have to be}} designed as rigid rods with typical fiber lengths of around 1 m for efficient operation. A shorter fiber length can be desirable to reduce the packaging size of commercial systems and to decrease the impact of parasitic nonlinear effects for peakpower scaling. The fiber design presented here {{is based on a}} modified large-pitch fiber with an effectively higher ytterbium concentration in the fiber core. To achieve index <b>matching</b> the <b>cladding</b> index needs to be changed. In this contribution we propose to co-dope the passive host material with germanium to match both indices and to obtain a higher Yb-concentration within the active core. Compared to standard LPF, where the core index is reduced by co-doping the core with Flourine, the ytterbium doping concentration of this novel germanium-pedestal LPF is doubled. A detailed numerical and experimental investigation shows that with short fiber lengths < 40 cm is feasible to achieve output powers beyond 100 W with 10 W seed. Significantly higher gains, of nearly 30 dB, can be achieved for fiber lengths in the order of 60 cm. A similar gain can be expected in a conventional LPF with 1. 20 m length. In conclusion, we demonstrate a fiber design for significantly enhanced energy storage per fiber length and improved pump absorption. This concept will notably reduce the footprint of ultra-short fiber laser systems...|$|R

In this work, we present the plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxial growth of quantum well infrared photodetector structures. The growth of Si-doped GaN/AlN multiple quantum well structures is optimized by controlling substrate temperature, metal excess and growth interruptions. Structural characterization confirms a reduction of the interface roughness to the monolayer scale. P-polarized intersubband absorption peaks covering the 1. 33 - 1. 91 μ m wavelength range are measured on samples with quantum well thickness varying from 1 to 2. 5 nm.

The growth of Si-doped GaN/AlN multiple quantum well (QW) structures is optimized by controlling substrate temperature, metal excess and growth interruptions. Structural characterization confirms a reduction of the interface roughness to the monolayer scale. P -polarized intersubband absorption peaks covering the 1. 33 – 1. 91 μm wavelength range are measured on samples with QW thickness varying from 1 to 2. 5 nm. The absorption exhibits Lorentzian shape with a line width around 100 meV in QWs doped 5 × 10 19 cm − 3. To prevent partial depletion of the QWs owing to the internal electric field, we have developed highly-conductive Si-doped AlGaN cladding layers using In as a surfactant during growth.

40|$|The {{material}} and device characteristics of InGaN/GaN heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) grown by metalorganic {{chemical vapor deposition}} are examined. Two structures grown on sapphire with different p-InxGa 1 -xN base-region compositions, xIn = 0. 03 and 0. 05, are presented in a comparative study. In a second experiment, NpN-GaN/InGaN/GaN HBTs are grown and fabricated on free-standing GaN (FS-GaN) and sapphire substrates to investigate the effect of dislocations on III-nitride HBT epitaxial structures. The performance characteristics of HBTs on FS-GaN with a 20 × 20 m 2 emitter area exhibit a maximum collector-current density of ~ 12. 3 kA/cm 2, a D. C. current gain of ~ 90, and a maximum differential gain of ~ 120 without surface passivation. For the development of deep-ultraviolet optoelectronics, several various structures of optically-pumped lasers at 257, 246, and 243 nm are demonstrated on (0001) AlN substrates. The threshold-power density at room temperature was reduced to as low as 297 kW/cm 2. The dominating polarization {{was measured to be}} transverse electric in all cases. InAlN material was developed to provide lattice <b>matched,</b> high-bandgap energy <b>cladding</b> layers for a III-N UV laser structure. This would alleviate strain and dislocation formation in the structure, and also mitigate the polarization charge. However, a gallium auto-doping mechanism was encountered which prevents the growth of pure ternary InAlN, resulting instead in quaternary InAlGaN. This phenomenon is quantitatively examined and its source is explored. Ph. D...|$|R
