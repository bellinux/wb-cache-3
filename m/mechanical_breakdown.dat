5|$|Canning is {{a process}} during which the enzymes in {{vegetables}} are deactivated and the micro-organisms present killed by heat. The sealed can excludes air from the foodstuff to prevent subsequent deterioration. The lowest necessary heat and the minimum processing time are used {{in order to prevent}} the <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the product and to preserve the flavor as far as is possible. The can is then able to be stored at ambient temperatures for a long period.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} campaigns of World War II, Germany's light tanks, {{including}} the PanzerI, formed {{the bulk of}} its armoured strength. In March1938, the German Army marched into Austria, experiencing a <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown</b> rate of up to thirty percent. However, the experience revealed to Guderian several faults within the German Panzerkorps and he subsequently improved logistical support. In October 1938, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland, and {{the remainder of the}} country in March 1939. The capture of Czechoslovakia allowed several Czech tank designs, such as the Panzer 38(t), and their subsequent variants and production, to be incorporated into the German Army's strength. It also prepared German forces for the invasion of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian {{teeth are}} adapted for seizing and holding prey, and food is {{swallowed}} unchewed. The digestive tract is relatively short, as meat {{is a fairly}} simple substance to digest. The stomach {{is divided into two}} parts: a muscular gizzard that grinds food, and a digestive chamber where enzymes work on it. The stomach is more acidic than that of any other vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths, which {{play a role in the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown</b> of food. Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures. Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently, low energy requirements. This allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal, digesting the food slowly. They can withstand extended fasting, living on stored fat between meals. Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food, losing 23% of their bodyweight during this time. An adult crocodile needs between a tenth and a fifth of the amount of food necessary for a lion of the same weight, and can live for half a year without eating.|$|E

5|$|The two new Panther battalions – the 51st and 52nd – {{together}} {{equipped with}} 200 Panthers, {{for which the}} offensive had been delayed, were attached to the Großdeutschland Division in the XLVIII Panzer Corps of Army Group South. With the 51st and 52nd Battalions arriving on 30 June and 1 July, the two units had little time to perform reconnaissance or to orient themselves to the terrain they found themselves in. This was a breach of the methods of the Panzerwaffe, considered essential for the successful use of armour. Though led by experienced panzer commanders, many of the tank crews were new recruits and had little time {{to become familiar with}} their new tanks, let alone train together to function as a unit. The two battalions came direct from the training ground and lacked combat experience. In addition, the requirement to maintain radio silence until the start of the attack meant that the Panther units had little training in battalion-level radio procedures. Furthermore, the new Panthers were still experiencing problems with their transmissions, and proved mechanically unreliable. By the morning of 5 July, the units had lost 16 Panthers due to <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown,</b> leaving only 184 available for the launching of the offensive.|$|E

25|$|All {{vehicles}} {{of the type}} were by this time completely worn out and close to being phased out in favour of light Hotchkiss tanks. Of some units the crews had already departed to be retrained {{in the use of}} the tank and had to be hastily recalled when the invasion came. They nevertheless fought with some effectiveness against the invading forces: e.g. on 14 May two P 16's of 1er GRDI were crucial in retaking Haut-le-Wastia from German infantry belonging to 5th Panzer Division. Due to the long distances the motorised divisions had to cover, most P 16's eventually had to be abandoned after a <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chauncey Vibbard {{suffered}} a rare <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown</b> on Monday, August 5, 1878, {{on a trip}} from Albany. Approaching the Poughkeepsie landing, her starboard paddleshaft broke. Her 400 passengers and their baggage were disembarked at Poughkeepsie, and a special train commissioned {{to enable them to}} complete their journey. Temporary repairs were meanwhile made to Chauncey Vibbard, allowing her to complete the passage to New York at a slow speed, where she arrived about 10 pm. Damage was estimated at between $2,000 and $2,500, and Chauncey Vibbard was laid up at the foot of 22nd Street New York for the installation of a new shaft, which was expected to take {{no more than a few}} days. To replace her during the repairs, the reserve steamer Armenia was quickly readied for service, a task which included the transfer of Chauncey Vibbards bar fixtures and furniture. This breakdown was the first time in 13 years of service that Chauncey Vibbard had missed a scheduled trip.|$|E

From [...] the 3rd Armoured Brigade lost most of its tanks to <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown,</b> fuel shortage and demolitions to prevent them being captured. About twenty tanks had been returned earlier to Tobruk for repairs and another three unserviceable tanks were salvaged during the retreat; [...] tanks were knocked out but many were recovered later and repaired.|$|E

2500|$|Concerns {{about the}} ship's quality {{ultimately}} proved groundless. The damage sustained {{on these two}} initial voyages {{was determined to be}} caused by improper loading of the ship combined with weakness of the wooden decks, which were subsequently [...] replaced with iron. After these repairs and modifications, City of Peking went on to establish an enviable record of reliability, suffering only one complete <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown</b> over the course of almost three decades of transpacific service. By 1879, American editorialists were again singing the praises of the great ship, while a period in drydock proved her still capable of attracting thousands of curious sightseers. City of Peking would eventually make a total of 116 round trips between San Francisco and Yokohama/Hong Kong in the period from 1875 to 1903.|$|E
2500|$|As {{automobile}} ownership {{rose and}} highways and roads improved, passenger travel fell off. [...] Many boats {{were converted to}} automobile ferries, the first being the Bailey Gatzert. [...] Others were eventually just abandoned on beaches or never repaired after a wreck or a <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown.</b> [...] Some, like the Magnolia, were converted into towboats. [...] Others had different fates. [...] Arcadia, the last passenger vessel (capacity 275 passengers, 100 tons freight) operating between Tacoma and upper Puget Sound landings {{under the command of}} Capt.

2500|$|On January 11, 1935, Earhart {{became the}} first aviator to fly solo from Honolulu, Hawaii to Oakland, California. Although this transoceanic flight had been {{attempted}} by many others, notably by the unfortunate participants in the 1927 Dole Air Race that had reversed the route, her trailblazing flight had been mainly routine, with no <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> In her final hours, she even relaxed and listened to [...] "the broadcast of the Metropolitan Opera from New York".|$|R
2500|$|The NRA {{only had}} {{small number of}} {{armoured}} vehicles and mechanised troops. At {{the beginning of the}} war in 1937 the armour were organized in three Armoured Battalions, equipped with tanks and armoured cars from various countries. After these battalions were mostly destroyed in the Battle of Shanghai and Battle of Nanjing. The newly provided tanks, armoured cars, and trucks from the Soviet Union and Italy made it possible to create the only mechanized division in the army, the 200th Division. This Division eventually ceased to be a mechanized unit after the June 1938 reorganization of Divisions. The armoured and artillery Regiments were placed under direct command of 5th Corps and the 200th Division became a motorized Infantry Division within the same Corps. This Corps fought battles in Guangxi in 1939–1940 and in the Battle of Yunnan-Burma Road in 1942 reducing the armored units due to losses and <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the vehicles. On paper China had 3.8 million men under arms in 1941. They were organized into 246 [...] "front-line" [...] divisions, with another 70 divisions assigned to rear areas. Perhaps as many as forty Chinese divisions had been equipped with European-manufactured weapons and trained by foreign, particularly German and Soviet, advisers. The rest of the units were under strength and generally untrained. Overall, the Nationalist Army impressed most Western military observers as more reminiscent of a 19th- than a 20th-century army.|$|E
2500|$|The 1–206th FA {{received}} an alert for mobilization {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom on 28 July 2003. The 1–206th was inducted into federal service 12 October 2003, at home stations. The battalion learned {{that it would be}} deployed {{along with the rest of}} the 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (United States), as an element of the 1st Cavalry Division (United States). At this time the 1st Battalion adopted the nickname [...] "Aleutian" [...] as the unit's fixed call sign. The unit underwent training at Fort Hood, Texas for three months of intensive training in Force Protection, Convoy Security, Route Clearance and Urban Operations. The 1–206th FA became the first Army unit to field and conduct artillery live fire exercises with the new ANGYK-57 Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). Each battery conducted two days of artillery live fire training during post mobilization training. At this time the 1–206th FA received the attachment of Battery A, 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery, Rhode Island National Guard. The 1–206th FA had arrived at mobilization station approximately 80 soldiers short of its required strength, most vacancies being in the Fire Support Teams. The National Guard Bureau supplied this shortage by activating A/1-103rd and attaching it to 1–206th for deployment. A/1-103rd FA quickly became known as the [...] "Rhody" [...] Battery. While the 1–206th was at Fort Hood, the battalion commander, battalion operations officer, and three battery commanders accompanied the brigade staff and other battalion commanders and staff on a Pre-Deployment Site Survey (PDSS) to Iraq. The commanders spent 10 days traveling to the Baghdad Area of Operations, being hosted by the 16th Engineer Battalion, 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division. In late January 2004 the 1–206th FA moved to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana for a Mission Rehearsal Exercise to validate the brigade training for the deployment. While at Fort Polk the 39th Brigade staff was informed by the 1st Cavalry Division that due to a scheduling gap and the need to assume responsibility of the base defense operations center at Camp Taji, Iraq, the brigade would have to deploy one battalion approximately three weeks ahead of the rest of the brigade. The 39th Brigade selected the 1–206th to assume this mission and the battalion was prioritized on the brigade's movement plan. The advance party of the 1–206th FA departed Fort Polk on 28 February 2004. Due to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>breakdown</b> en route the advanced party arrived in Kuwait on 8 March 2004. By this time the 1–206th had been officially designated as the division main effort, with orders to conduct pre-combat checks and rehearsals and move to Camp Taji, Iraq via ground convoy as quickly as possible.|$|E
