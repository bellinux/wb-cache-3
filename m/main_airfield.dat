5|$|Having {{taken off}} {{prior to the}} Japanese attack, American bombers based on Midway made several attacks on the Japanese carrier force. These {{included}} 6 Grumman Avengers, detached to Midway from Hornets VT-8 (Midway was the combat debut of both VT-8 and the TBF); Marine Scout-Bombing Squadron 241 (VMSB-241), consisting of 11 SB2U-3s and 16 SBDs; plus 4 USAAF B-26s of the 18th Reconnaissance and 69th Bomb Squadrons, armed with torpedoes; and 15 B-17s of the 31st, 72nd, and 431st Bomb Squadrons. The Japanese repelled these attacks, losing 2 fighters while destroying 5 TBFs, 2 SB2Us, 8 SBDs, and 2 B-26s. The first Marine aviator to perish in the battle, Major Lofton R. Henderson of VMSB-241, was killed while leading his inexperienced Dauntless squadron into action. The <b>main</b> <b>airfield</b> at Guadalcanal was named after him in August 1942.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several weeks}} of air attacks and a short naval bombardment, {{soldiers}} of the Australian 24th Brigade were landed on Labuan from American and Australian ships on 10 June. The Australians quickly captured the island's harbour and <b>main</b> <b>airfield.</b> The greatly outnumbered Japanese garrison was mainly concentrated in a fortified position {{in the interior of}} Labuan, and offered little resistance to the landing. The initial Australian attempts to penetrate the Japanese position {{in the days after the}} invasion were not successful, and the area was subjected to a heavy bombardment. A Japanese raiding force also attempted to attack Allied positions on 21 June, but was defeated. Later that day, Australian forces assaulted the Japanese position. In the following days, Australian patrols killed or captured the remaining Japanese troops on the island. A total of 389 Japanese personnel were killed on Labuan and 11 were captured. Australian casualties included 34 killed.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} units used the airfield throughout its lifetime, the first unit was No. 14 Elementary Flying Training School RAF (EFTS) which flew Tiger Moths using RAF Elmdon as the <b>main</b> <b>airfield</b> and Hockley Heath as a satellite between 10 September 1939 and 1 February 1946 providing initial assessment before pupil pilots were sent abroad in the Commonwealth Air Training Scheme which was operated by Airwork Services.|$|E
25|$|Next was No. 1 Flying Instructors School RAF (FIS) flying Airspeed Oxfords and Avro Tutors using RAF Church Lawford as a <b>main</b> <b>airfield</b> and RAF Warwick and Hockley Heath as {{satellite}} airfields.

No. 18 ((P)AFU) flew Oxfords and Boulton Paul Defiants using RAF Church Lawford as a main base and RAF Snitterfield, RAF Warwick, RAF Southam and Hockley Heath between 27 October 1942 and 29 May 1945 which was a major unit training multi-engine pilots which were mainly returning from overseas in the Commonwealth Air Training Plan.|$|E

25|$|On 22 June 1950, the 8th Bomb Squadron went on TDY to Ashiya Airfield, Japan for a Far East Air Force {{readiness}} test.

On 27 June, the United Nations asked its members to go to the aid of the Republic of Korea. On that day the 8th was called on to aid in the Korean police action from their TDY location at Ashiya AB. The first combat mission of the 3d Bomb Group was flown by the 8th that day against the rail yards at Munsan, South Korea. which had been captured by North Korean forces.

25|$|The Lebanese Air Forces have a {{long history}} {{operating}} Hawker Hunter jets since 1958. A Lebanese Hawker Hunter shot down an Israeli jet over Kfirmishki in the early 1960s and its pilot was captured by the Lebanese Armed Forces. One Lebanese Hawker Hunter was shot down {{on the first day of}} the Six-Day War by an Israeli Air Force Mirage IIICJ. The Hawker Hunters have not flown any combat sorties since September 17, 1983. This was at a time when the French and Americans were rebuilding the Lebanese Army. Three F.Mk.70s were made airworthy, and resumed combat operations on September 15. Because the <b>main</b> <b>airfield,</b> Rayak Air Base, had been shelled by Syrian forces, the Hunters had to operate from an airfield in Byblos. The Hunters were finally grounded in 1994 after a minor accident with one of the T.66 trainers during landing and the remaining 8 were stored in Rayak. The last loss took place in 1989 near Batroun during routine training, when the undercarriage failed to lower, causing the jet to crash. The pilot ejected safely from the doomed aircraft and landed in the Mediterranean sea, where he was promptly rescued by the Syrian Army, which then handed him over to Suleiman Frangieh, who in turn handed him over to the Lebanese Army at the al-Madfoun crossing.|$|E
500|$|As {{there was}} little space on the carriers, two requisitioned {{merchant}} container ships, [...] and , were modified with temporary flight decks and used to carry Harriers and helicopters to the South Atlantic. The Harrier GR.3s focused on providing close air support to the ground forces on the Falklands and attacking Argentine positions; suppressing enemy artillery was often a high priority. Sea Harriers were also used in the war, primarily conducting fleet air defence and combat air patrols against the threat of attacking Argentine fighters. However, both Sea Harriers and Harrier GR.3s were used in ground-attack missions against the <b>main</b> <b>airfield</b> and runway at Stanley.|$|E
50|$|At this time, {{the island}} {{provided}} critical operational air bases for the Allies with proximity to Axis shipping lanes and the battlefields of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Pantelleria, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and mainland Italy during World War II.

500|$|The U.S. Army {{established}} bases at Adak and 13 other locations. At the War Department's suggestion, {{an initial}} reconnaissance of Amchitka {{was carried out}} in September 1942, which found that {{it would be difficult to}} build an airstrip on the island. Nevertheless, planners decided on December 13 that the airfield [...] "had to be built" [...] to prevent the Japanese from doing the same. A further reconnaissance mission visited Amchitka from 17 to 19 December, and reported that a fighter strip could be built in two to three weeks, and a <b>main</b> <b>airfield</b> in three to four months.

500|$|The {{plans for}} the capture of Labuan {{specified}} that the 24th Brigade Group's two infantry battalions were to land simultaneously on the beach near Victoria (designated Brown Beach) at 9:15 am, with the 2/28th Battalion coming ashore {{on the western side}} of the beach and the 2/43rd to the east. The 2/11th Commando Squadron was to be initially held in reserve on board the invasion fleet. The brigade group's objectives were to secure a beachhead, capture the <b>main</b> <b>airfield</b> (located north of Victoria and designated [...] "No. 1 Strip" [...] by the Australians), destroy the Japanese garrison, and prepare for further operations on the eastern shore of Brunei Bay. Priority was given to rapidly opening the port and airfield so that they could be used to support other operations.|$|E
500|$|The {{attack on}} The Hague ended in {{operational}} failure. The paratroopers {{were unable to}} capture the <b>main</b> <b>airfield</b> at Ypenburg {{in time for the}} airborne infantry to land safely in their Junkers. Though one armoured car had been damaged by a bomb, the other five Landsverks, assisted by machine gun emplacements, destroyed the eighteen Junkers of the first two waves, killing many occupants. [...] When the airstrip was blocked by wrecks the remaining waves aborted the landing and tried to find alternatives, often putting down their teams in meadows or on the beach, thus dispersing the troops. The small auxiliary airfield of Ockenburg was only lightly defended, and fell at once to German attack. [...] The airfield of Valkenburg was likewise quickly occupied, the morale of the defenders shaken by the bombardment. However, the landing strip was still under construction and the ground water level had not yet been lowered: planes landing there sank away in the soft soil. None of the airfields were thus capable of receiving substantial reinforcements. In the end the paratroopers occupied Ypenburg but failed to advance into The Hague, their route blocked by hastily assembled Dutch troops. Early in the afternoon they were dispersed by fire from three Dutch artillery batteries. Dutch batteries likewise drove away the German occupants from the other two fields, the remnant airborne troops taking refuge in nearby villages and mansions.|$|E
