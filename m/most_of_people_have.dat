Euclidean geometry is limited to study classical shapes present in nature, but rugged, disordered and nonclassic shapes and functions were marginalized by this geometry because of uncotrollability. In the twenty-first century, human beings have always been encountered the challenge of how to discipline the seemingly disordered natural phenomena to employ them in improving human life (Asadi Harouni et al. 2013). Since Euclidean geometry {{is not able to}} describe and formulate disordered shapes and substances (Mojtahed Zadeh et al. 2013), and it cannot explain intricacies present in nature, scientists have been in search of a kind of geometry that is able to explain all the processes present in nature (Afzal et al. 2011).|$|E

The hardware of cellular phone device also provides the light, small size with wide screen, more convenient, stable, flexible and available to easy obtain the information from internet world wide web (WWW). According to magazine reporting, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> an above 2 G cellular phone at least in Taiwan and use the multi-function to retrieve data from internet. In this paper, it is implemented the intelligent communication agent [3, 6, 8, 12] mechanism characterizes and integrated the RFID mechanism to establish a communication channel to automatically transmit data packets from source site to destination site.

So, we propose a new {{differential}} compression method for high-speed transfer. In this proposed method, the feature which is the encoding process according to subjectively image quality can be demonstrated. Human {{studies have shown that}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> the interest about special area. Using the individuality, the relatively high quality can be obtained at the special area and the relatively low quality can be obtained at the other area in encoding process. In order to use these characteristics, the image is separated simple and complex block using 8 x 8 block standard deviation. And also, we have applied low compression rate and high compression rate to each region. The experimental results are demonstrated that proposed differential scheme can achieve better image quality at the high compression ratio. The proposed method is possible to maintain a high quality by differential compression of images. And then, we can apply to MPEC and H. 26 X...|$|E

Most of parents and teachers are directed on these aspects both in kindergarten and at primary school. Of course, parents are different. Nevertheless so many parents can’t possibly but speak about achievements of their children. Some start making their own children learn better by the example of success of the others. They make their children learn long chains of figures with no understanding. It is even more sad to see how a mom asks her 4 -year old son: “How much is two plus three? [...] ’ But he replies just because he learned the answer but not calculated. Not only parents but also kindergarten tutors don’t want to understand that drilling for arithmetic has no sense.

The writer uses a psychological approach to analyze character and the writer uses qualitative method as the research method. As the result, the writer finds six characteristics of Charlie as a mental retarded person, namely IQ score 68, poor concentration, failure to relate with other people, anxious, fearfulness, and feeling tired easily. There are five similarities (low IQ, poor concentration, failure to relate with other people, anxious, fearfulness) and one difference (feeling tired easily) between Charlie’s characters and psychology theory.

Besides other skills, it is considered {{as one of the most}} influential factors when applying for a job or maintaining a particular work position, which is often conditional to the advancement of a language level. Since the ability to communicate in English has become a necessity in human life, people take advantage of different opportunities to acquire it. The best and most natural way to learn this language is to study it in an English peaking country. Being exposed to a foreign language abroad without no interference of a mother tongue is undoubtedly the most beneficial and fastest way to improve language skills. However, not everyone is provided with such an opportunity. Therefore, the only chance <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> is learning English in Secondary school, and taking in account the factor that the Nicaraguan Educational System does not include in its curriculum teaching English during the first years in school, that is preschool and primary school, as a result the transition to secondary school is affected by the inclusion of teaching a language in students` curriculum, this can be overwhelming and intimidating for students; therefore some teacher try to engage the students in the class by speaking and communicating in the mother tongue, in our case in Spanish, they consider student are more eager to learn the language if they use Spanish than using a language they cannot pronounce or understand. This research intends to analyze how this decision affects the learning process and if it is more effective than using English to motivate the students to produce the target language...|$|E

The study population was about 152 HIV patients. A questionnaire with closed end questions {{was used as a}} tool to collect information. Data was analyzed by using Epi Info (Results: Among 94 patients who did experience one or more side effects during their period of using AR) /s l` 6 (2 l. 7 %) stop using the medication and they were switched to another type of regimen and 78 (78. 3 %) continued to use the same medication. Among 152 patients who were interviewed at the clinic, 35 (23. 0 %) reported to miss at least one dose while the remaining ll 7 (77 %) reported not to miss any dose in any day during their long term usage of ARVs. The reasons reported by the patients are as indicated in table 8, above that among 35 patients who reported to miss the medication l 9 (54. 3 %) did forget(2. 9 %) missed because the medication was out of stock and l 5 (42. 9 %) reported to have family and social problems such as attending funerals Conclusion: The findings show that, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> an education about ARV adherence and they know all factors that contribute to non adherence but some did not put their knowledge in practice.

By learning word formation, people will know and understand about kind of words and the origin of word. When people create new terms of words, they make word formation at the same time. This means that they can use word formation to understand the form of new words. Accordingly, word formation process is significant to be observed since <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> not realized that actually they can learn from their surrounding. In this study, the writer wants to identify 1) the terms found in beauty products at Dhitos beauty salon, 2) kind of word-formation process of the term found in beauty products at Dhitos beauty salon and 3) the meaning of terms on beauty products in Dhitos beauty salon. The {{purpose of this study is}} very essential since students are difficult to understand about word-formation in linguistic field. The writer chooses to investigate the word formation process of beauty products because the writer wants to make the students realize that they can learn English from things around them. The writer used descriptive qualitative study design because the study described and explained about the structure of word. The object in this study was all terms of beauty products at Dhitos beauty salon. This study used observation (non-participant) and documentation.
