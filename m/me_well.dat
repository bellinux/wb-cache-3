It {{marked the first}} time a well-known African-American woman writer had expanded her life story into a third autobiography. She also published two volumes of poetry entitled Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit <b>Me</b> <b>Well</b> (1975).|$|E
5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated <b>me</b> <b>well.</b> I recall warmly the years I spent there.

The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E

25|$|This listing {{features}} the lineup from 1967 to 1975. After 1975, the lineup changed {{with each of}} the last four Sly and the Family Stone LPs. Personnel appearing on these recordings are credited in the individual album articles for High on You, Heard You Missed <b>Me,</b> <b>Well</b> I'm Back, Back on the Right Track, and Ain't But the One Way.|$|E
25|$|Sly {{recorded}} {{two more}} albums for Epic: High on You (1975) and Heard You Missed <b>Me,</b> <b>Well</b> I'm Back (1976). High On You {{was billed as}} a Sly Stone solo album; Heard You Missed Me was a Sly and the Family Stone album in name only. Although Sly continued to collaborate {{with some of the}} original Family Stone members on occasion, the actual band no longer existed. Sly played most of the instruments on record himself; he maintained a band to support him for live shows. Among his main collaborators were Cynthia Robinson and Pat Rizzo from the Family Stone, and background vocalists Lynn Mabry and Dawn Silva, who parted with Sly in 1977 and formed The Brides of Funkenstein in 1978. Epic released Stone from his contract in 1977, and in 1979 released 10 Years Too Soon, a remix album featuring disco versions of the 1960s Family Stone hits.|$|E

A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to <b>me,</b> <b>well</b> there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

500|$|Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit <b>Me</b> <b>Well</b> {{is a book}} {{of poems}} by American author Maya Angelou, {{published}} by Random House in 1975. [...] It is Angelou's second volume of poetry, written after her first two autobiographies and first volume of poetry were published. [...] Angelou considers herself a poet and a playwright, but {{is best known for}} her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they have not received serious critical attention.|$|E

500|$|Oh Pray My Wings are Gonna Fit <b>Me</b> <b>Well</b> is Maya Angelou's {{second volume}} of poetry. [...] She studied and began writing poetry {{at a young}} age. [...] After her rape {{at the age of}} eight, as recounted in her first {{autobiography}} I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), she dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature, including poetry, which helped bring her out of her self-imposed muteness. [...] Angelou's film Georgia, Georgia, produced by a Swedish film company and filmed in Sweden, was the first screenplay written by a Black woman, and was released in 1972. [...] Angelou married Welsh carpenter and ex-husband of Germaine Greer, Paul du Feu, in San Francisco in 1973.|$|E
500|$|There {{were other}} factors at play. Balukas admits to having been under great pressure, {{much of it}} self-imposed. After she reached the {{pinnacle}} of her profession, [...] "That’s when I started getting nervous... that’s when I started {{putting a lot of}} pressure on myself." [...] "Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but [...] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time." [...] Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport [...] "...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. It just got to a point where I had so much animosity toward the pool world. And that was my out. You know, you're going to fine <b>me?</b> <b>Well,</b> see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou uses rhyme and {{repetition}} {{throughout all}} her works, yet rhyme is only found {{in seven of}} the poems in Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie; critic Lyman B. Hagen calls her use of rhythm [...] "rather ordinary and unimaginative". [...] Death is an important theme throughout many of Angelou's works, especially in Caged Bird, which opens with it and, according to scholar Liliane K. Arensberg, is resolved at the book's end, when her son is born. [...] Death is directly mentioned in 19 of the 38 poems in Diiie. [...] According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout, many of the poems in Diiie, along with those in Angelou's second volume Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit <b>Me</b> <b>Well,</b> [...] "lack the overt empowerment themes of her later, better known works", especially And Still I Rise (1978) and I Shall Not Be Moved (1990).|$|E

500|$|Angelou {{sometimes}} pairs poems {{together in}} her collections to strengthen her themes, something she does, for example, throughout her second volume Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit <b>Me</b> <b>Well</b> (1975). Many of her poems, {{especially those in}} Oh Pray, contain universal identifications with ordinary objects. She uses familiar and feminine metaphors, {{many of the same}} themes also found in blues songs, and the dialect of African Americans to express universal themes applicable to all races. Angelou uses rhyme and repetition, which critic Lyman B. Hagen calls [...] "rather ordinary and unimaginative" [...] throughout all her works, both prose and poetry, yet rhyme is found in only seven of the thirty-eight poems in her first volume, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie. Librarian John Alfred Avant states that many of Angelou's poems could be set to music like that of jazz singer and musician Nina Simone. For example, [...] "They Went Home" [...] in Diiie was originally written as song lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Boyd met Harrison {{during the}} filming of The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night in 1964. [...] She was cast as a schoolgirl in that film. Her only line in the film was asking [...] "Prisoners?", but she later {{appeared}} in the [...] "I Should Have Known Better" [...] segment. Boyd was in a serious relationship with photographer Eric Swayne during this time, and so declined a date proposal from Harrison. Several days later, after ending her relationship with Swayne, {{she went back to}} work on the film, and Harrison asked her out on a date for a second time; she said [...] "yes". The couple went to a private gentlemen's club called the Garrick Club, chaperoned by the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. According to Boyd {{one of the first things}} Harrison said to her on the film set was: [...] "Will you marry <b>me?</b> <b>Well,</b> if you won't marry me, will you have dinner with me tonight?" ...|$|E
500|$|According to critic Harold Bloom, in his {{analysis}} of [...] "Times-Square", the first line of the fourth stanza ("I ain't playing dozens mister") is an allusion to the Dozens, a game in which the participants insult each other. [...] The game is mentioned in later poems, [...] "The Thirteens (Black)" [...] and [...] "The Thirteens (White)." [...] According to critic Geneva Smitherman, Angelou uses the Thirteens, a twist on the Dozens, to compare the insults of blacks and whites, which allows her to compare the actions of the two races. [...] Bloom compares [...] "Times-Square" [...] to Langston Hughes' blues/protest poetry. [...] He suggests {{that the best way to}} analyze the subjects, style, themes, and use of vernacular in this and most of Angelou's poems is to use [...] "a blues-based model", since like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. Hagen compares the themes in [...] "The Thirteens (Black and White)" [...] with Angelou's poems [...] "Communication I" [...] and [...] "Communication II", which appear in Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit <b>Me</b> <b>Well,</b> her second volume of poetry.|$|E
