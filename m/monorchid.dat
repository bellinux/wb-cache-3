2500|$|A ridgling or [...] "rig" [...] is a cryptorchid, a {{stallion}} {{which has}} {{one or both}} testicles undescended. If both testicles are not descended, the horse {{may appear to be}} a gelding, but will still behave like a stallion. A gelding that displays stallion-like behaviors is sometimes called a [...] "false rig". In many cases, ridglings are infertile, or have fertility levels that are significantly reduced. The condition is most easily corrected by gelding the horse. A more complex and costly surgical procedure can sometimes correct the condition and restore the animal's fertility, though it is only cost-effective for a horse that has very high potential as a breeding stallion. This surgery generally removes the non-descended testicle, leaving the descended testicle, and creating a horse known as a <b>monorchid</b> stallion. Keeping cryptorchids or surgically-created monorchids as breeding stallions is controversial, as the condition is at least partially genetic and some handlers claim that cryptorchids tend to have greater levels of behavioral problems than normal stallions.|$|E

5000|$|Owners of {{a prized}} animal may opt for surgery to {{preserve}} {{the value of a}} horse as a breeding stallion. There is debate over whether to remove the undescended testicle in a stallion; some people believe it causes discomfort to the animal, others disagree. Proponents of surgery note that it is low-risk, and the undescended testicle is non-functional, and it can be removed with laparoscopy or a very small incision. Some stallions show improved behavior and athletic performance when the non-functional testicle is removed. [...] Such animals are sometimes called <b>monorchids</b> due to having only one testicle, but usually are fertile.|$|R
5000|$|A {{broad sense}} of the term [...] "eunuch" [...] is {{reflected}} in the compendium of ancient Roman laws collected by Justinian I in the 6th century known as the Digest or Pandects. Those texts distinguish between the general category of eunuchs (spadones, denoting [...] "one who has no generative power, an impotent person, whether by nature or by castration", D 50.16.128) and the more specific subset of castrati (castrated males, physically incapable of procreation). Eunuchs (spadones) sold in the slave markets were deemed by the jurist Ulpian to be [...] "not defective or diseased, but healthy", because they were anatomically able to procreate just like <b>monorchids</b> (D 21.1.6.2). On the other hand, as Julius Paulus pointed out, [...] "if someone is a eunuch {{in such a way that}} he is missing a necessary part of his body" [...] (D 21.1.7), then he would be deemed diseased. In these Roman legal texts, spadones (eunuchs) are eligible to marry women (D 23.3.39.1), institute posthumous heirs (D 28.2.6), and adopt children (Institutions of Justinian 1.11.9), unless they are castrati.|$|R

The band recorded their October 8, 2004, show at Monkey Mania in Denver, Colorado, with Permanent Record Studios. The concept was to release a [...] "bootlegged" [...] live version of their Zulu album, but due to the band's split the live CD was never released.

5000|$|As a {{means of}} ridiculing the Nazis, “Hitler Has Only Got One Ball” became immensely popular among Allied troops, who in {{transmitting}} this song were exercising something of a wartime convention by demeaning the sexual faculties of enemy leaders. But the mockery extended beyond just the Nazis’ sexual capacities. Since the 1920s, the words balls or ballsy had come to denote notions of courage, nerve, or fortitude. In that sense, defective testicles rendered the Nazis defective soldiers. This song’s itemized taxonomy of malformed German genitalia—the <b>monorchid,</b> the micro-orchid, the anorchid—was particularly forceful, and satisfying, to Allied soldiers in that it scattered satiric buckshot across the whole Nazi high command (Hitler; Hermann Göring, {{commander in chief of}} the Luftwaffe; Heinrich Himmler, Reichsführer of the SS; and Goebbels, Reich minister of propaganda).|$|E

40|$|Testis sparing surgery (TSS) is a {{well-known}} technique {{in the treatment of}} small testicular masses. Grayscale ultrasound (US), color/power Doppler US (CPDUS) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) are considered the best diagnostic imaging tools in those patients. Aim {{of this study was to}} assess the role of US imaging in the detection of small testicular masses in <b>monorchid</b> patients after orchiectomy for malignant neoplasm, and in guiding surgery to reach the target and also to differentiate lesions which presented vascular activity within the mass. METHODS: From January 2011 to October 2014, 18 patients were enrolled in this study. They had previously undergone orchiectomy and were investigated for suspected contralateral disease. During routine follow-up, all patients underwent grayscale US. If findings were positive, CPDUS and CEUS were performed and eventually all patients underwent surgery. After exteriorization of the testis, the small mass was identified by intraoperative US, and a needle was placed under US guidance. After excision of the mass, frozen section examination was performed. When malignancy was found, radical orchiectomy was performed; if histological outcome was negative, the healthy testis was conserved. RESULTS: All patients underwent grayscale US examination, which showed small hypoechoic masses. Each mass identified at US imaging was confirmed at surgery. All patients underwent CPDUS; 12 / 19 lesions showed blood flow while 7 / 19 showed absence of blood flow. At CEUS, 16 / 19 lesions showed enhancement and subsequent histological examination revealed that 8 were seminomas and 3 were Leydig cell tumors. In 5 / 19 cases CEUS showed the presence of lesions (focal inflammatory lesions) and in 3 / 19 cases CEUS was negative. CONCLUSIONS: TSS in <b>monorchid</b> patients may be a safe procedure leading to excellent results. We therefore consider it a valid alternative to radical orchiectomy, and US imaging is essential to guide the resection of non-palpable neoplasms and to exclude concomitant lesions...|$|E
40|$|The word “adenomatous {{hyperplasia}} of rete testis” (AHRT) {{was used}} by M. Nistal et Al. {{for the first time}} in an article about the cystic dysplasia of the testis (1976). AHRT is a benign lesion of the testis. The patient who came to our attention was studied with a testicular echo color Doppler that identified a solid, well circumscribed and hypoechoic mass of 4. 5 x 3. 8 mm as diameter, localized in the upper third of the right testicle and with a perilesional vascularization pattern. The preoperative study was based on an accurate medical history, on an ultrasound with contrast and on a RMI. The treatment consisted in an echo guided excisional biopsy of the testicular lesion, considering this as the best approach for those testicular neoformation difficult to define, with a lot of benefits for the patients, especially for those <b>monorchid...</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Ultrasound (US) is {{the main}} imaging {{technique}} {{in the assessment of}} testicular masses, as it has proved to be highly accurate in the visualization of these pathologies. Identification of a Leydig cell tumor is essential since the lesion is benign in 90  % of cases. The aim of this multicenter study is to assess the effectiveness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in differentiating Leydig cell tumors from seminoma using qualitative and quantitative features. Materials and Methods: From February 2011 to December 2013, 31 patients (mean age: 34 years; range: 25  -  52) were recruited for this prospective study. Three of them were <b>monorchid.</b> Therefore, a total of 59 testicles were assessed. All patients underwent grayscale US, color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS), CEUS and orchiectomy. The paired one-tailed Student's t-test was carried out to differentiate between Leydig cell tumors and seminomas. Results: 31 lesions suspicious for malignancy were hypoechoic on grayscale US while they did not show a typical pattern on CDUS.  CEUS qualitative analysis, based on contrast enhancement pattern, during the arterial and venous phases, did not allow discrimination of Leydig cell tumors from seminoma. Quantitative analysis of time-intensity curves (TICs) demonstrated that only three parameters presented statistical significance, i.  e. wash-in rate (WiR) p =  0. 014, peak enhancement (PE) p =  0. 001 and time to peak (TTP) p =  0. 003. Conclusion: The vascular bed of a Leydig cell tumor is wider and the blood flow velocity is higher than that of a seminoma due to more regular neovascularization. In contrast, a seminoma presents large areas of necrosis due to irregular neovascularization. This explains the different PE and WiR values. Further studies involving larger patient populations are mandatory to confirm these encouraging preliminary results...|$|E
