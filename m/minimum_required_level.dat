50|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to measure complexity, it seems uncontroversial that mammals are more complex than bacteria. Gould (1997) agrees, but claims that this apparent largest-scale trend is a statistical artifact. Bacteria represent a minimum level of complexity for life on Earth today. Gould (1997) argues that there is no selective pressure for higher levels of complexity, but there is selective pressure against complexity below the level of bacteria. This <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> <b>level</b> of complexity, combined with random mutation, implies that the average level of complexity of life must increase over time. Gould (1997) uses the analogy of a random walk that begins near a wall. Although the walk is random, the walker cannot pass through the wall, so we should expect the walker to move increasingly further from the wall as time passes. This does not imply that the walker is driven away from the wall. The wall is analogous to the complexity level of bacteria. We should expect evolution to wander increasingly further from this level of complexity, but it does not imply that evolution is driven towards increasing complexity.|$|E

50|$|The Iberian lynx preys {{foremost}} on the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) for {{the bulk}} of its diet, supplemented by red-legged partridge, rodents and to a smaller degree also on wild ungulates. It sometimes preys on young fallow deer, roe deer, mouflon, and ducks. A male requires one rabbit per day while a female raising kittens will eat three per day. The Iberian species has low adaptability — it continued to rely heavily on rabbits (75% of its food intake) despite the latter's repeated population crashes due to two diseases: myxomatosis, which spread to Iberia after a physician intentionally introduced it in France in 1952, and rabbit haemorrhagic disease beginning in 1988. There were two major outbreaks of the latter in 2011 and 2012. Recovery has occurred in some areas — in 2013, rabbit overpopulation was reported south of Córdoba, causing damage to transport infrastructure and farms. In December 2013, however, it was reported that wildlife officials were concerned about the spread of a new strain of the hemorraghic disease, affecting mainly young rabbits. Sierra Morena's rabbit population was worst affected, falling from an average of three per hectare to less than one — below the <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> <b>level</b> of 1.5 to two per hectare.

In the model the bank jointly determines the capital issuance and investment policy. Given an exogenous minimum capital requirement, lower-of-cost-or-market accounting {{is the most}} effective regime that induces the bank to issue more excess equity capital above the <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> <b>level</b> and implement less risky investment policy. However, the disciplining role of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting may discourage the bank from exerting project discovery effort ex-ante. From the regulator’s perspective, the accounting regime that maximizes the social welfare is determined by a tradeoff between the social cost of capital regulation and the efficiency of the bank’s project discovery efforts. When the former effect dominates, the regulator prefers lower-of-cost-or-market accounting; when the latter effect dominates, the regulator may prefer other regimes...|$|E

Alternatively, the WETI efficiency problem might be solved by outlining the way to reduce the <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> <b>level</b> of the radio signal to enable energy harvesting (i.e., well below − 30 dBm). This can be done either via improving parameters of the diodes used in current rectifier designs or by suggesting new rectifier architectures. Finally, the most realistic option considering the current state of the technology seems to employ highly directional antennas. This, in turn, would require simple and precise node localization mechanisms, as well as technology to enable cheap and simple antennas with a changeable radiation pattern. However, we are hopeful that the outlined technical issues are solved in the very near future.|$|E

A constant demand is satisfied by remanufacturing end-of-used products and manufacturing raw materials outsourced from outside.

For remanufacturing, only the used products that satisfy a <b>required</b> <b>minimum</b> quality <b>level</b> will be recycled. Thus, the returning rate {{is a function of the}} <b>required</b> <b>minimum</b> quality <b>level.</b> Functions of returning rate, buyback price and remanufacturing cost, which are closely connected to the quality level of end-of-used products, are investigated here.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 31) With {{the enormous}} growth in telecommunication industry, energy efficiency {{has become a}} critical issue. Base stations account for {{a significant portion of}} the energy budget of a cellular network. Traditional energy saving techniques switch some base stations off completely during light loads to save energy. This creates problems for the backhaul network and also for quickly returning to full capacity when demand increases. In this paper, we propose a novel technique called cell zooming to reduce energy consumption at base stations. With cell zooming, base stations dynamically adjust their coverage radius and hence their transmit powers based on user locations. The transmit power is set to the <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> <b>level</b> depending on user locations and signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) required. Base stations are never completely switched off. Simulations show that the proposed cell zooming algorithm reduces the energy consumption of base stations by up to 40 % without compromising the quality of service (QoS) for users compared to traditional static-coverage-area base stations...|$|E
40|$|Repayment decisions—how much of {{the loan}} to repay and when to make the payments—directly {{influence}} consumer debt levels. The authors examine how minimum required payment policy and loan information disclosed to consumers influence repayment decisions.

Experimental evidence from U. S. consumers shows that consumers’ propensity to pay the minimum required each month moderates these effects; U.

However, increasing the minimum level is unlikely to completely eliminate the negative effect of presenting minimum payment information. In addition, disclosing supplemental information, such as future interest cost and time needed to repay the loan, does not reduce the negative effects of including minimum payment information and has no substantial positive effect on repayments.

Conceptually this may be achieved {{by the use of}} a combination of one gas chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry method and one liquid chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry method. In this work a quantitative screening method using high-resolution liquid chromatography in combination with accurate-mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry was developed and validated for determination of glucocorticosteroids, ß 2 -agonists, thiazide diuretics, and narcotics and stimulants in urine. To enable the simultaneous isolation of all the compounds of interest and the necessary purification of the resulting extracts, a generic extraction and hydrolysis procedure was combined with a solid-phase extraction modified for these groups of compounds. All 56 compounds are determined using positive electrospray ionisation {{with the exception of the}} thiazide diuretics for which the best sensitivity was obtained by using negative electrospray ionisation. The results show that, with the exception of clenhexyl, procaterol, and reproterol, all compounds can be detected below the respective <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> performance <b>level</b> and the results for linearity, repeatability, within-lab reproducibility, and accuracy show that the method can be used for quantitative screening. If qualitative screening is sufficient the instrumental analysis may be limited to positive ionisation, because all analytes including the thiazides can be detected at the respective <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> <b>levels</b> in the positive mode. The results show that the application of accurate-mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry in combination with generic extraction and purification procedures is suitable for unification and expansion of the window of screening methods of doping laboratories. Moreover, the full-scan accurate-mass data sets obtained still allow retrospective examination for emerging doping agents, without re-analyzing the samples...|$|R

40|$|The Problem. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{performance}} of two groups of Omaha Westside High School seniors on five minimum competency tests in the areas of mathematics, reading, writing, consumerism, and democratic process. The first group (class of 1976) had been required to meet traditional graduation requirements. They had never taken minimum competency tests. The second group (class of 1977) had been required to meet a combination of traditional requirements and newly established minimum competency requirements. The sample from the class of 1977 had previously passed minimum competency tests and they were retested for purposes of this study. ^ The Procedures. A review of the literature was conducted to provide the background and rationale for this study. The population of the study included the seniors of the Omaha Westside classes of 1976 and 1977 who had taken the Differential Aptitude Test while in the ninth grade. Basic data were obtained from the test results of the five competency tests. Data were examined to determine if students <b>required</b> to pass <b>minimum</b> competency tests for graduation performed better than those who were not required to do so. ^ Summary of Findings [...] (1) No statistically significant interaction was found to exist between class year and class rank quartile. (2) A statistically significant difference was found to exist between students in the class rank quartiles in their performance on five minimum competency tests. (3) The class of 1976 performed slightly better than the class of 1977 on the reading test while the class of 1977 performed somewhat better on the democratic process test. The two classes performed essentially the same in the areas of mathematics, consumerism, and writing. (4) Ninety-eight percent of the class of 1976 and 94 percent of the class of 1977 achieved the <b>required</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>level</b> on the reading test. (5) Eighty-three percent of the class of 1976 and 84 percent of the class of 1977 achieved the <b>required</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>level</b> on the democratic process test. (6) Seventy-five percent of the class of 1976 and 78 percent of the class of 1977 achieved the <b>required</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>level</b> on the writing test. (7) Thirty-eight percent of both classes achieved the <b>required</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>level</b> on the mathematics test. (8) Only five percent of the class of 1976 and seven percent of the class of 1977 achieved the <b>required</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>level</b> on the consumerism test. (9) Only five students from the class of 1976 and seven students from the class of 1977 achieved the <b>required</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>level</b> on all five tests combined. (10) When the consumerism test was eliminated because of its suspect reliability, 32 students from each class achieved the <b>required</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>level</b> on the four remaining tests. (11) All of the students in the class of 1977 had achieved minimum level scores on each of the five tests and were eligible to graduate. However, when similar tests were readministered at the end of the year, from six percent to 93 percent of these students failed one or more of the tests. ^ Conclusions. When retested, students who had previously met the established minimum competency requirements did not necessarily perform better than students who had not been required to meet these same requirements. In fact, students who had previously passed the tests, tended to regress to a lower level when retested. Furthermore, the minimum competency program did not necessarily cause more students to function at the <b>minimum</b> skill <b>level</b> <b>required</b> in the program. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a method to}} find the best maintenance policy for a light rail rolling stock system based on reliability, availability, and maintenance cost. The objective of this maintenance policy is to maintain a <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> <b>level</b> of system reliability at minimum maintenance cost and maximum availability. The maintenance policy defines one of three predefined preventive maintenance actions at fixed time based intervals for each of the subsystems. These maintenance actions are assumed to improve the degradation rate of the reliability of the system during the time interval between maintenance or increase the reliability after maintenance or both. The reliability degradation of the system and its subsystems is model by a twoparameter Weibull distribution based on the actual failure data of the rolling stock fleet under the current maintenance policy. Improved reliability, availability, and cost driven maintenance policies are presented for the rolling stock braking system and compared with each other and the currently used maintenance policy. It is concluded that the proposed maintenance policies can offer significant improvements in reliability and maintenance cost.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} a constrained sequential resource allocation problem where an individual needs {{to accomplish a}} task by repeatedly guessing/investing a sufficient level of effort/input. If the investment falls short of a <b>minimum</b> <b>required</b> <b>level</b> that is unknown to the individual, she fails; with each unsuccessful attempt, the individual then increases the input and tries again until she succeeds. The objective is {{to complete the task}} with as little resources/cost as possible subject to a delay constraint. The optimal strategy lies in the proper balance between 1) selecting a level (far) below the minimum required and therefore having to try again, thus wasting resources, and 2) selecting a level (far) above the minimum required, and therefore, overshooting and wasting resources. A number of motivating applications arising from communication networks are provided. Assuming that the individual has no knowledge on the distribution of the minimum effort required to complete the task, we adopt a worst-case cost measure and a worst-case delay measure to formulate the above constrained optimization problem. We derive a class of optimal strategies, shown to be randomized, and obtain their performance {{as a function of the}} constraint.
