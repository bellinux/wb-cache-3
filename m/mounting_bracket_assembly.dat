5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|R
40|$|In modern {{spacecraft}} {{with the}} requirement of increased accuracy of payloads, the on-orbit structural dynamic behavior of spacecraft is increasingly influencing the design and performance of spacecraft. During the integrated spacecraft testing {{of one of the}} satellites, a strong coupling between rotating momentum wheels and an earth sensor was detected. This resulted in corruption of the earth sensor data at certain wheel speeds. This paper deals with the dynamic coupling problem of a rotating momentum wheel with its support brackets affecting other subsystems of spacecraft. As part of this investigation, extensive modal tests and vibration tests were carried out on the momentum wheel <b>bracket</b> <b>assembly</b> with wheels in stationary and rotating conditions. It was found that the effects of gyroscopic forces arising out of rotating wheels are significant and this aspect needs {{to be taken into account}} while designing the <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets.</b> Results of analysis and tests were used to redesign the bracket leading to a significant reduction in the interaction and associated problems. A procedure for design of a support structure using a low-order mathematical model is also shown...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of {{vibration}} that produce by a car is engine and transmission. Engine and transmission location determination is an important thing that must be considered for a car. Method of locating engine and transmission will be proposed to determine the right position. This method depends to the size and type of engines. The project objective {{is to find a}} location for the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> for a new car. It is important to reduce the vibration from the engine and transmission to the car’s body or chassis. These is also important to fit the engine bay before consider the component of engine clearance with component of body. The stress analysis is done for the location test, different thickness of side member, and different cross section of side member. The FEA software Algor is use for this analysis and Solidwork to modeling the side member. Five different cross section and design are use to analyze the location of the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket.</b> The range location of the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> is at the middle of the side member. This range depends to the packaging of the engine and the clearance between the components of engine with engine bay. Thickness of the side member also important to decrease the weight of the car and to minimize the stress value when load apply.
