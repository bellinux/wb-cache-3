5|$|Bacteria {{frequently}} secrete chemicals {{into their}} environment {{in order to}} modify it favourably. The secretions are often proteins and <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as enzymes that digest some form of food in the environment.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms, inhibitors <b>may</b> <b>act</b> {{as part of}} a {{feedback}} mechanism. If {{an enzyme}} produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as an inhibitor for the enzyme {{at the beginning of the}} pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of negative feedback. Major metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle make use of this mechanism.|$|E
5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists <b>may</b> <b>act</b> {{as an obstacle to}} students when learning about natural selection. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.|$|E

5|$|A major crustal lineament {{known as}} the Archibarca lineament intersects the main {{volcanic}} arc at Lastarria. Other volcanic centres such as Galán and ore deposits are also found on this lineament. The intersection between this lineament and the arc <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as a weakness zone that focuses the ascent of magma. Farther south lie volcanoes such as Wheelwright Caldera and Cerro Blanco, the last of which shows evidence of recent unrest.|$|E
5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as a disincentive to people expressing political views. These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered by the fear of defamation suits.|$|E

5|$|Maillard et al. and Li et al. provide {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a functional antiviral RNAi pathway in mammalian cells. Other functions for RNAi in mammalian viruses also exist, such as miRNAs expressed by the herpes virus that <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as heterochromatin organization triggers to mediate viral latency.|$|E
5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous lipids make an {{important}} contribution in maintaining {{the integrity of the}} skin barrier, and express both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Sebum <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as a delivery system for antioxidants, antimicrobial lipids, pheromones, and hydration of the stratum corneum. The insoluble fatty acids contained within sebum have broad antimicrobial activity. Additionally, sebaceous gland secretion provides vitamin E to the upper layers of facial skin.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy Tactics differs {{in several}} key areas from other {{titles in the}} Final Fantasy series. Instead of a generic battle screen, with the player's characters {{on one side and}} the enemies on the other, encounters take place on three-dimensional, isometric fields. Characters move on a battlefield composed of square tiles; movement and action ranges are determined by the character's statistics and job class. Battles are turn-based; a unit <b>may</b> <b>act</b> when its CT (Charge Time) reaches 100. Charge time is increased once every CT unit (a measure of time in battles) by an amount equal to the unit's speed statistic. When CT reaches 100 or greater, the unit <b>may</b> <b>act.</b> During battle, whenever a unit performs an action successfully, it gains Experience Points (EXP) and Job Points (JP).|$|E
5|$|The product, chloryl fluoride, {{is one of}} {{the five}} known {{chlorine}} oxide fluorides. These range from the thermally unstable FClO to the chemically unreactive perchloryl fluoride (FClO3), the other three being FClO2, F3ClO, and F3ClO2. All five behave similarly to the chlorine fluorides, both structurally and chemically, and <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as Lewis acids or bases by gaining or losing fluoride ions respectively or as very strong oxidising and fluorinating agents.|$|E
5|$|A journey between Arnos Grove and Southgate {{typically}} takes {{slightly more}} than four minutes. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3-9 minutes between 07:07 and 01:07 eastbound, and every 2-6 minutes between 05:19 and 00:06 westbound. When operational problems occur on the line, Arnos Grove station <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as a temporary terminus of a reduced service – either a shuttle service between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters or a truncated service from Central London. The station has a set of seven sidings to its south for stabling trains.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} arc of Amazing Spider-Girl, Aunt <b>May</b> <b>acts</b> a spiritual advisor to May {{in order to}} help her grandniece reclaim her {{identity}} and save Peter from Norman Osborn.

He is restricted to communicating through Take-Two's attorneys on any future matter, but is able to maintain his outspoken stance against their titles and <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as counsel in lawsuits against Take-Two by other parties. For their part, Take-Two agreed to drop the contempt of court lawsuit against Thompson regarding alleged improper conduct during the court hearings for Rockstar's game Bully in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they <b>may</b> <b>act</b> {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian {{paralysis}} tick, are also intrinsically venomous {{and can cause}} tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by migratory birds <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as reservoirs and vectors of infectious diseases. Over twenty strains of pathogenic virus were found in the autumn in the Egyptian migratory bird study.|$|E

5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} the swim bladder. In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that {{attached to the}} swim blabber cause it to oscillate rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the swim bladder <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as a resonator. Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the swim bladder have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is in the}} apatite {{group of}} phosphates, and forms a {{chemical}} series with the minerals pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), with both of which it may form solid solutions. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and vanadate (VO4). Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus, arsenic and calcium, where these <b>may</b> <b>act</b> as an isomorphic substitute for vanadium. Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.|$|E
