40|$|This report {{explores the}} {{viability}} of small scale anaerobic digestion for livestock farming {{where there is a}} need to deal with animal <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> in a manner that minimises the emission of greenhouse gases. Dairy farming for example is dominated by small herds of animals that must in any case manage <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> in a manner that is efficient for the farming operation and maintains high standards of health in a cost effective manner. AD is an acknowledged technology for farming operations that affords a high standard of manure management, the production of high quality biofertiliser and also the possibility of generating energy for own use as well as export. The report is aimed at energy policy and decision makers as well as WWTP operators and was produced by IEA Bioenergy Task 37, an expert working group that addresses challenges related to the economic and environmental sustainability of biogas production and utilisation.

40|$|The {{number of}} food {{poisoning}} cases caused by enteropathogens {{has increased in}} recent years. A {{significant part of the}} outbreaks associated with the consumption of raw vegetables has been attributed to Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Bovine <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> are the main environmental sources of these pathogens. Thus, reduction of the multiplication of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium in cattle and their survival in <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> are important tasks to minimize the risks of contamination of plant products and outbreaks of food-borne diseases. This thesis describes the influence of various environmental factors on survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium in manure, slurry and soil amended with manure or slurry. The results presented in this thesis can be used for risk assessment of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium in dairy farming systems and will help to identify and evaluate potential control strategies to minimize the chance of pathogen spread in the vegetable production chain...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of aerobic and anaerobic {{conditions on the}} survival of the enteropathogens Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella serovar Typhimurium was investigated in microcosms with broth, cattle manure or slurry. These substrates were inoculated with a green fluorescent protein transformed strain of the enteropathogens at 10 (7) cells g(- 1) dry weight. Survival data was fitted to the Weibull model. The survival curves in aerobic conditions generally showed a concave curvature, while the curvature was convex in anaerobic conditions. The estimated survival times showed that E. coli O 157 :H 7 survived significantly longer under anaerobic than under aerobic conditions. Survival ranged from approximately. 2 weeks for aerobic <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> to more than six months for anaerobic manure at 16 degrees C. On average, in 56. 3 % of the samplings, the number of recovered E. coil O 157 :H 7 cells by anaerobic incubation of Petri plates was significantly (p < 0. 05) higher in comparison with aerobic incubation. Survival of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium was not different between aerobic and anaerobic storage of LB broth or manure as well as between aerobic and anaerobic incubation of Petri dishes. The importance of changes in microbial community and chemical composition of <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> was distinguished for the survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in different oxygen conditions.

40|$|International audienceIntensive soil {{fertilization}} with mineral fertilizers {{has led to}} several issues such as high cost, nitrate pollution and loss of soil carbon. Fertilization with organic matter such as compost therefore represents an alternative for sustainable agriculture. Traditional organic amendments such as <b>manures,</b> composts <b>and</b> sewage sludge have been extensively studied in the past. However, applications of biogas digestates and their impacts {{on the environment and}} human health are still unexplored. Recent articles report the agricultural potential and conflicting results of digestate performances. As a consequence, the effectiveness of digestate as organic amendment and fertilizer is still under debate. Here we review the legislative, chemical, agronomic and environmental literature on anaerobic digestates. We found that digestates can be considered as organic amendments or organic fertilizers, when properly handled and managed. Indeed we further show that anaerobic digestates have a higher potential to harm the environment and human health than undigested animal <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurries.</b> The main points are the following: (1) Most solid digestates comply with the European organic matter minimal requirement for an organic amendment; (2) the fertilizer values of liquid digestates lie between those of livestock <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> inorganic fertilizers; (3) anaerobic digestates have higher NH 3 emission potential than undigested animal <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurries</b> <b>and,</b> consequently, pose a greater risk to the broad environment; (4) high Cu and Zn concentrations in digestates from co-digestion of pig <b>and</b> cattle <b>slurry</b> feedstock could jeopardize the sustainability of agricultural soils and (5) high Mn concentrations in digestates can induce Mn toxicity in agricultural soils, upon repeated applications...|$|R

In this study, {{it was hypothesized}} that use of <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> bio <b>slurry</b> increased abundance <b>and</b> dispersal of H. arator in maize fields. However, this was not determined by research. To understand factors affecting dispersal and abundance of H. arator is important before formulating a sound management program.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} is of global concern. Most antimicrobial use is in agriculture; <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> are especially {{important because they}} contain a mix of bacteria, including potential pathogens, antimicrobial resistance genes and antimicrobials. In many countries, <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> are stored, especially over winter, before spreading onto fields as organic fertilizer. Thus these are a potential location for gene exchange and selection for resistance. We develop and analyze a mathematical model to quantify the spread of antimicrobial resistance in stored agricultural waste. We use parameters from a slurry tank on a UK dairy farm as an exemplar. We show that the spread of resistance depends in a subtle way on the rates of gene transfer and antibiotic inflow. If the gene transfer rate is high, then its reduction controls resistance, while cutting antibiotic inflow has little impact. If the gene transfer rate is low, then reducing antibiotic inflow controls resistance. Reducing length of storage can also control spread of resistance. Bacterial growth rate, fitness costs of carrying antimicrobial resistance and proportion of resistant bacteria in animal faeces have little impact on spread of resistance. Therefore effective treatment strategies depend critically on knowledge of gene transfer rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} cattle <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> {{application}} on percolation and survival of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was investigated for different soil depths after {{the addition of}} water. Four treatments were chosen for {{the first set of}} experiments: (i) addition of inoculated farmyard manure on the soil surface, (ii) mixing of inoculated farmyard manure with the top 10 cm of soil, (iii) addition of inoculated slurry on the soil surface, and (iv) injection of inoculated slurry into the top 10 cm of the soil. Homogeneity of water distribution in the soil profile was confirmed by a nondestructive nuclear magnetic resonance method. Survival data were fitted to a modified logistic model, and estimated survival times were compared. In the second set of experiments, pathogen-inoculated farmyard manure or slurry was applied to soil columns with 1 -month-old lettuce plants. More pathogen cells percolated to greater depths after slurry than after manure application. Survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 was significantly longer in soil with slurry than in that with manure, while survival of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium was equally high with <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry.</b> The densities of the pathogens were not different in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil with manure, while the densities were higher by 0. 88 ± 0. 11 and 0. 71 ± 0. 23 log CFU per g (dry weight), respectively, in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil after slurry application. Our results suggest that surface application of manure may decrease the risk of contamination of groundwater and lettuce roots compared to injection of slurry...|$|E
40|$|<b>Manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> are {{valuable}} resources that may enhance many soil properties.

This research aimed to elucidate the impact of microbial community structure on pathogen decline following entry to such organisms into the soil. It was hypothesised that pathogen survival would be significantly influenced by both diversity and phenotypic configuration of the microbial community.

Livestock and especially animal manures {{are the most important}} sources of NH 3 emissions in Europe, followed by the application of mineral nitrogen fertilizers (Leip et al. 2011). The increase in animal stocking and in the price of chemical fertilizers encourage farmers to use animal <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> as an option to reduce the use of commercial fertilizers. However, the handling and spreading of these fertilizers may pose an agronomic and environmental risk, not only because of leakage of nitrate to ground waters but also because of gaseous losses of NH 3 (Asman 1992). Ammonia can form secondary particulate matter in the atmosphere that may have adverse effects on human health (Moldanová et al. 2011).|$|E

Three consecutive simulated rainfall events, producing 35 mm rainfall and separated by 24 h, {{were carried out}} for each plot. Fecal indicator (Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens and coliphage) loads released in rainfall runoff from plots treated with fresh cattle manure, aged cattle <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> swine <b>slurry</b> treatments ranged from 5. 52 x 105 to 4. 36 x 109, 3. 92 x 104 to 4. 86 x 108, and 9. 63 x 105 to 3. 05 x 108, respectively. Plot runoff concentrations of protozoa (Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts) ranged from 1. 65 x 105 to 1. 04 x 106, 2. 93 x 103 to 2. 75 x 105, and 9. 12 x 104 to 3. 58 x 106 for fresh cattle manure, aged cattle <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> swine <b>slurry</b> plot treatments, respectively. These results suggest that large microbial loads could be released via heavy precipitation events that produce runoff from livestock manure-applied agricultural fields, of even modest size, and could {{have a significant impact}} on water bodies within the watershed.

Pig <b>slurries</b> <b>and</b> poultry <b>manures</b> have remained a common source of composting ingredient (Pampuro et al. 2016). Co-composting of wastes from winery distilleries with animal <b>and</b> poultry <b>manure</b> under static pile composting system was assessed on different parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter, soluble carbon, polyphenolics content, humification characteristics, and plant germination index (Bustamante et al. 2008). Agricultural food wastes are also attractive composting materials for their conversion into decomposed manures to be used for producing high-value crops (Rubio et al. 2013). It was largely considered that composting processes that ensure nutrient-rich conditions, appropriate carbon rating, organic matter humification and adequate bulking for reducing N-losses are required to overcome production cost (Bernal et al. 2009). Results confirm that composting helped in detoxification and degradation of phytotoxic compounds in the residual matter and therefore, offers a favorable way to recycle wastes into value-added products (Pampuro et al. 2016).|$|R

Beneficial externalities include the creation of amenity and landscape and negative externalities include pollution of surface and groundwater. In so far as parts of agricultural subsidies compensate for beneficial externalities, they are said to be 'internalised' and should not be the subject of further policy measures. However, agricultural subsidies also add to the negative externalities by expanding output and encouraging environmentally detrimental farming practices. Comprehensive attempts to value these externalities in the UK and to compare them to the true value added of the agricultural sector {{are to be found in}} Hartridge and Pearce (2002) and Pretty et al.

40|$|Estimation of nitrate {{leaching}} from agricultural systems {{is critical to}} environment impact studies. Simulation models can help to assess and understand the dynamics of nitrates in the soil and in relation to fertilizer types and agronomical management. The main hypothesis {{of this study was}} that the long term annual application of mineral and organic N fertilizers, in irrigated sandy soil areas increases dramatically the quantity of NO 3 − in the soil for potential {{nitrate leaching}}. The main objectives of this research were then to quantify inorganic N concentration in soil layers affected by mineral and organic N (<b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry)</b> fertilizers; and to test the SALUS crop simulation model to identify the best N management strategy able to minimize NO 3 − leaching without compromising crop growth and yields. A first set of rotational simulations were carried out for the 2007 and 2008 experiments, with the goal of comparing measured and simulated results. A second set of rotational simulations were carried out for a long term assessment (50 years) of the two treatments in comparisons. Additional long term rotational simulation runs were carried out considering two different fertilization strategies based on the maize crop uptake in 2007 (276 kg N ha − 1) and on the PUA (“Best Nitrogen Management with manures”) which defines the fertilization practices adopted in the nitrate vulnerable zones (no more than 170 kg N ha − 1 year − 1). Measured data showed that in the manure treatment, the highest nitrate-N concentration was 627. 3 mg kg− 1 at 0. 10 m depth on August 2008, while the lowest was 2. 50 mg kg − 1 at 1. 40 m depth on July 2007. In the slurry treatment, the maximum nitrate N concentration was 344. 6 mg kg − 1 at 0. 10 m depth on August 2008 and the minimum was 8. 9 mg kg − 1 at 0. 60 cm depth on September 2007.

The definition of livestock subcategories was based on data from the Chilean Agriculture and Forestry Census as well as technical reports published by the Chilean National Statistics Institute. Significant differences were observed among the sources of livestock emissions in Chile's regions, and there was high variability depending on the degree of livestock confinement.

40|$|Background: Manure {{can provide}} a {{favourable}} environment for pathogens' survival. De-contamination may be conducted by extended storage, until field conditions are suitable for application to land as source of agricultural nutrients. Results: The hygienic evaluation of <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurry</b> coming from a plant that collects cattle livestock wastes from a big slaughterhouse was carried out. Samples were even collected from spillages {{in the area around}} the plant. Microbial analyses highlighted the massive presence of faecal indicators in all samples: mean counts of Escherichia coli and enterococci were always above EU limits for marketable processed manure products. Cultures referable to the genus Brucella spp. were recorded in two samples of fresh manure but not in the aged ones. Conventional isolation techniques failed to detect members of the Mycobacterium genus, while by means of IS 900 and F 57 PCR real-time system on DNA directly extracted from environmental samples, the pathogen was detected in all cases. Conclusions: Thoughtful design of manure storage infrastructure is critical to prevent spills and over-topping of an open structure. The documented overload situation seems to lay the basis for an ongoing environmental contamination by enteric organisms and opportunistic pathogens circuit faecal-oral route. Moreover, the type of wastes analysed during this study, namely a mixture of fresh cattle manure, bedding and rumen content, needs a longer storage period or, alternatively, of specific chemical, biological or thermal treatments for stabilization...|$|E
40|$|Biogas is a {{combustible}} gas consisting of methane, {{carbon dioxide and}} small amounts of other gases and trace elements. Production of biogas through anaerobic digestion of animal <b>manure</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurries</b> {{as well as of}} a wide range of digestible organic wastes and agricultural residues, converts these substrates into electricity and heat and offers a natural fertiliser for agriculture. In this paper, solid waste management status in the city of Misurata has been investigated through an extensive survey carried out and generation of organic waste in the city of Misurata was calculated to establish a database for build up a biogas plant in the city. The average solid waste generation rate was found to be 1. 48 kg/person/day. Only 3 % of the solid waste was recycled and open dumping is currently the most popular form of waste disposal for 360 tons of waste daily. The waste composition was mainly comprised of 56 % organic, 26. 5 % plastics, and 8 % paper. The waste was evaluated, the moisture content and the calorific heating values were calculated. The results of this study along with key findings are discussed and summarized. In addition, several effective recommendations and improvements of solid waste management (SWM) are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Sewage sludge {{contains}} significant {{proportions of}} nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter. It therefore {{has a similar}} fertiliser value to animal <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurries.</b> Typical applications can provide {{a significant contribution to}} the nitrogen and phosphate requirements of arable and grassland crops. In addition, sludge can contain potentially harmful substances, including pathogens, persistent organic pollutants and toxic metals. It is therefore necessary to control the use of sewage sludge in order to protect human and animal health and to maintain soil fertility and crop yields. The bioavailability of heavy metals can be affected by several factors. Some of these factors are related to soil and some others may be related to plant characteristics. Soil pH, organic mater content, redox status, carbonate content, chloride content, moisture, source and form of metals and plant genotype may be the most important. However, investigation of any factors which may reduce or enhance the availability of heavy metals in soil and uptake by plants would be crucial. Such knowledge and information on these factors could be used and would help the authorities to manage and control the environmental problems which are concerned with sludge application to agricultural land and could threaten the human health. This paper is going to review and describe the factors and circumstances of which the bioavailability of potentially harmful metals would reduce or enhance in soil...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLand {{application}} of <b>manures</b> <b>and</b> <b>slurries</b> {{are a major}} source of pollution such as water contamination by nitrates and greenhouse gas emissions. NH 3 and N 2 O emissions can be lowered by suitable spreading techniques. However, a comprehensive review of the impact of slurry spreading techniques is lacking. For that we developed a model, named OSEEP, that simulates the effect of slurry incorporation, <b>slurry</b> spatial distribution, <b>and</b> soil compaction on NH 3 and N 2 O emissions. OSEEP integrates a soil compaction model, a hydraulic pedotransfer function, a NH 3 volatilization model, and a crop model. We ran OSEEP for five sites in France for 7  years. Four techniques were simulated: broadcast spreading, band spreading, incorporation after surface spreading, and injection. We tested various sizes of <b>slurry</b> tankers <b>and</b> tractors. We calculated NH 3 and N 2 O relative emissions from various spreading techniques with respect to band spreading. Results show good agreement between model calculation and published field data. We found that slurry applied by a self-propelled 15 -m 3 tanker with extra large tires led to an increase of 20  % in N 2 O emission, by comparison with a 15 -m 3 tanker trailed by a tractor. Hence, we show that soil compaction should be taken into account to optimize trade-offs between NH 3 and N 2 O emissions...|$|R
