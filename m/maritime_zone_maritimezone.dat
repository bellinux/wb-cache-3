40|$|The ICJ’s {{decision}} addresses {{facts and}} themes {{related to the}} question {{whether or not a}} maritime boundary extended to 200 -nautical miles had been set between Chile and Peru. Thus, the ICJ decision is deeply interwoven with the history of the <b>maritime</b> <b>zone</b> of 200 –nautical miles and its Latin American roots. The task of theCourtwas to ascertain whether a delimited boundary had been agreed, and if that had been the case, whether it has been established in connection with the long standing proclamations of an extended <b>maritime</b> <b>zone</b> of 200 nautical miles, first unilaterally and then multilaterally by the 1952 Santiago Declaration on the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Zone</b> and further agreements. The explicit reference to a delimitation line embedded in successive agreements was settled in favor of an implicit agreement enshrined in the terms of the 1954 Agreement of a <b>Maritime</b> Frontier <b>Zone,</b> preceded by a subtle crystallization of a delimitation process prior to it. The point was deduced from Article I of the 1954 Agreement which explicitly states that “A special zone is hereby established, at a distance of 12 nautical miles from the coast, extending to a breadth of 10 nautical miles {{on either side of the}} parallel which constitutes the maritime boundary between the two countries”...|$|R
