Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode's [...] "most interesting facet" [...] was its flashbacks to Dexter's youth from Debra's perspective, though {{he felt that the}} young Debra's hasty apology to Dexter after insulting him was [...] "a slightly cheesy moment". He thought that LaGuerta's bonding with Oscar [...] "was okay, but [...] fell a little flat". TV Guides Paula Paige [...] "love" [...] the episode, saying that [...] "It just keeps getting better and better", but was unsure [...] "what Deb having dinner with the Doakes' family has to do with anything".

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{critically}} and commercially successful films of Hoffman's career was The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), which he considered [...] "as edgy {{as you can get}} for a Hollywood movie". He played a [...] "preppy bully" [...] who taunts Matt Damon's Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called [...] "the truest upper class twit in all of American movies". Hoffman's performance caught the attention of Meryl Streep– another of his cinematic idols– with his performance: [...] "I sat up straight in <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> and said, 'Who is that?' I thought to myself: My God, this actor is fearless. He's done what we all strive for– he's given this awful character the respect he deserves, and he's made him fascinating."

(I literally bolted up in <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> when Peter vanished into thin air after creating a bridge between the universes.)" [...] Entertainment Weekly included the episode's ending in their list of television's best cliffhangers of 2011, and later named it the sixteenth best episode of the series.

500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson {{felt that it}} served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. [...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, on the edge of <b>my</b> <b>seat.</b> And the appearance of the caped figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was as dramatic as could be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{race was}} {{originally}} sponsored by Donald Trump and {{known as the}} [...] "Tour de Trump" [...] in 1989 and 1990. The idea for the race was conceived by CBS Sports reporter John Tesh, who had covered the 1987 Tour de France and on his return suggested holding a race in the United States to the basketball commentator and entrepreneur Billy Packer. Packer originally planned to call the race the Tour de Jersey. He approached representatives of casinos in Atlantic City for sponsorship, and Trump offered to be the race's primary sponsor and Packer's business partner in the venture. It was Packer who suggested the Tour de Trump name. Speaking {{at the time of}} the start of the first Tour de Trump in May 1989, Trump himself stated that [...] "When [...] was initially stated, I practically fell out of <b>my</b> <b>seat.</b> I said, 'Are you kidding? I will get killed in the media if I use that name. You absolutely have to be kidding'". However, Trump reportedly changed his mind within 20 seconds, and was convinced by the commercial value of the name.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were so critical. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed {{awarded the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars. Although {{he noted that}} the episode was [...] "not Gilligan's best work" [...] and that the writing was [...] "a little spotty", he said [...] "the vibe [...] is very well done." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a {{moderately}} positive review, writing [...] "My heart wasn't racing and I wasn't {{sitting on the edge of}} <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> as Mulder and Scully unmasked our two magicians [...] But it was fun to put the clues together to see what it all added up to." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that he [...] "love it". He praised the episode's [...] "good-naturedness", which he felt was due to Mulder and Scully's interaction. Handlen also enjoyed the writing, noting that the [...] "script also does a good job at doling out its secrets in a way that never makes either the magicians or our heroes come off as idiots".

500|$|Writing for Zap2it, Andrea Reiher {{stated that}} this episode {{was the best}} since the pilot, {{explaining}} that [...] "if {{they continue to be}} this good, this show should be in for a long run." [...] Reiher cited Goodwin's [...] "wonderful, captivating" [...] performance and the parallels between the Storybrooke and Enchanted Forest stories as particular highlights. In a review from TV Fanatic, writer Christine Orlando stated that the episode [...] "had me on the edge of <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> and enjoying the ride," [...] giving particular praise to Snow and Charming's chemistry-filled early relationship. Orlando concluded, [...] "Snow White, the character I had the least interest in two weeks ago, held her own and then some. Heck, I was so enthralled by her story that, for the first time ever, I can't wait to learn more." [...] Sound on Sights Ricky D thought it wise that the episode focused on Snow and Charming, [...] "without feeling the need to include multiple stories."

500|$|Several reviewers {{considered}} Middlesex to {{be overly}} verbose. The Economist described the novel as [...] "ponderous" [...] {{and said that the}} main story (that of Cal) does not [...] "get off the ground until halfway through" [...] the book. Times Richard Lacayo concurred; he considered the hundreds of pages about Cal's grandparents and several historical events to be trite, making Middlesexs focus [...] "footloose" [...] in some spots. Several passages in the novel exhibit Eugenides' obsession with [...] "verbose voluptuousness". An example noted by Thea Hillman in her review is an incident in which Cal says, [...] "I sat in <b>my</b> <b>seat,</b> in a state of voluptuous agitation, of agitated voluptuousness, until my stop. Then I staggered out." [...] A contrary opinion is given by Daniel Soar in his article for the London Review of Books. According to Soar, Eugenides did [...] "both background and foreground in all the necessary detail", seamlessly shifting from past to present. Despite the implausible tone of the novel's events, the author successfully makes them [...] "elaborately justified and motivated". The quality of Middlesexs writing was uneven in the opinions of Hillman and another reviewer, Sebastian Smee. The latter pointed out that Eugenides occasionally moves from the heartfelt ("I remember the first time we took off our clothes in front of each other. It was like unwinding bandages") to the [...] "trashily journalistic" [...] ("You've heard of installation artists? Well, the Object [...] was an exhalation artist") on several occasions.|$|E
500|$|According to series creator Pendleton Ward, the show's {{style was}} {{influenced}} by his time attending the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and his experiences working {{as a writer and}} storyboard artist on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack. In an interview with Animation World Network, Ward said he strives to combine the series' subversive humor with [...] "beautiful" [...] moments, using Hayao Miyazaki's film My Neighbor Totoro as inspiration. Ward has also named Home Movies and Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist as influences, largely because both shows are [...] "relaxing" [...] and feature [...] "conversational dialogue that feels natural [...] not over the top [...] cartoony and shrill". Ward described the show as a [...] "dark comedy"; he said [...] "dark comedies are my favorite, because I love that feeling – being happy and scared at the same time. It's my favorite way to feel – when I'm on the edge of <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> but I'm happy, that sense of conflicting emotions. And there's a lot of that in the show, I think." [...] Executive producer Fred Seibert compared the show's animation style to that of Felix the Cat and various Max Fleischer cartoons, but said that its world is also equally inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and video games. Ward intends the show's world to have a certain physical logic instead of [...] "cartoony slapstick"; even though magic exists in the story, the show's writers try to create an internal consistency in how the characters interact with the world.|$|E

500|$|MTV writer Josh Wigler {{thought the}} episode [...] "nearly put [...] to sleep," [...] {{as it was}} [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "a bit of a dud". The episode however did lead Wigler to [...] "start dig" [...] Sam Weiss, and also to enjoying Olivia's subplot, but {{believed}} the episode's monster-of-the-week {{could have been used}} to actually parallel her trauma; Wigler appreciated how the Fringe case tied into Walter and Peter's backstories. He concluded, [...] "It wasn't bad enough to make me concerned for the future of Fringe or anything, but it certainly didn't keep me on the edge of <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> waiting for the next crazy twist like last week. I'm still loving this season, but tonight's episode was one of the weaker outings." [...] Newsarama's Chanel Reeder stated [...] "Dream Logic" [...] "certainly put the brakes on the speed that Fringe had gained in the previous" [...] episode, but praised the connection with Peter's past as [...] "one of the most interesting underlying parts". Reeder's favorite part was Sam Weiss, calling him [...] "a fantastic dimension to the show". Josie Kafka of Open Salon was more positive than other reviewers, and in particular highlighted the episode's humor, [...] "Almost all of the Cambridge scenes were funny: Astrid and Walter have a great rapport, especially when there's a rube in the room for them to play with." [...] She concluded [...] "I liked this one, more for the great Peter/Olivia and Walter/Astrid stuff than the plot of the week," [...] and gave the episode [...] "Three out of four anagrams".|$|E
500|$|... "Blood Ties" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Baltimore Sun television critic David Zurawik {{described it}} as [...] "one of the most serious, frank and compelling discussions of race in any medium" [...] since an episode of NYPD Blue from 1995, in which actor Dennis Franz used the word [...] "nigger". Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press described [...] "Blood Ties" [...] as [...] "explosive (and) riveting", and wrote, [...] "The smart, darkly humorous writing on Homicide is as strong as ever. So are the performances of a superb ensemble of actors." [...] R.D. Heldenfels of the Akron Beacon Journal praised the episodes and called them [...] "a complicated rumination on race and class". David Bianculli of the New York Daily News said the episode had an unpredictability that helped maintain the show's vitality, and said {{of the first two}} episodes, [...] "Except for one moment in tonight's opener, I was on the edge of <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> for the entire two hours; at that moment, a surprise shooting shocked me right onto my feet." [...] Newsday writer Verne Gay described [...] "Blood Ties" [...] as [...] "brilliant drama" [...] and [...] "a superb piece of work (that) appears to be a novel variation on reverse discrimination". Regarding the first of the three episodes, Dallas Morning News writer Ed Bark said Seda and Thorne had [...] "solid first impressions" [...] and that the episode arc [...] "has all the makings of another killer story line". Virginia Rohan of The Record of Bergen County, New Jersey, called the episode [...] "gripping" [...] and [...] "another strong start for a terrific series".|$|E
500|$|From 1968, Ted Kennedy was {{the most}} {{prominent}} living member of the Kennedy family, and the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. John F. Kennedy had said in 1957, [...] "Just as I went into politics because Joe died, if anything happened to me tomorrow, my brother Bobby would run for <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> in the Senate. And if Bobby died, Teddy would take over for him." [...] However, Ted {{was never able to}} carry on the [...] "Camelot" [...] mystique {{in the same way that}} both of his fallen brothers had, with much of it disappearing during his failed 1980 presidential bid. His negligence in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick and his well-documented later personal problems further tarnished his image in relation to the Kennedy name, and significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming president. The Associated Press wrote that, [...] "Unlike his brothers, Edward M. Kennedy has grown old in public, his victories, defeats and human contradictions played out across the decades in the public glare." [...] But Kennedy's legislative accomplishments remained, and as The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "By the early 21st century, the achievements of the younger brother would be enough to rival those of many presidents." [...] His death prompted the realization that the [...] "Camelot era" [...] was truly over. Kennedy's New York Times obituary described him via a character sketch: [...] "He was a Rabelaisian figure in the Senate and in life, instantly recognizable by his shock of white hair, his florid, oversize face, his booming Boston brogue, his powerful but pained stride. He was a celebrity, sometimes a self-parody, a hearty friend, an implacable foe, a man of large faith and large flaws, a melancholy character who persevered, drank deeply and sang loudly. He was a Kennedy." ...|$|E

Portraiture always fascinated me because I love the {{particular}} gesture of a particular expression or stance...Working on the figure, I wanted paint to sweep through as feelings sweep through..." [...] She studied each person [...] "to find the characteristic pose that would define them." [...] A great example of this, is the series of studies and finished portraits of President John F.

500|$|Reviews were positive. James Poniewozik of Time {{thought that}} [...] "Because You Left" [...] {{provided}} a good balance of characterization and mythology and commended {{the character of}} Faraday, partially [...] "because a perfectly-cast Jeremy Davies has {{turned him into a}} likeable, flawed, brusque, slightly-in-over-his-head nebbish-god." [...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide stated that the premiere [...] "offer compelling twists … the foundation is laid for a pivotal penultimate season … it sends the mind reeling and uncorks infinite possibilities." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "it's hard to name a series that is as engaging, surprising and flat-out gorgeous as Lost, or one in which every effort and penny expended seems to be put to shimmering good use. [...] This is an epic big-screen adventure done for the small screen—and done {{in a way that makes}} most big-screen versions pale in comparison." [...] Bianco also commended the characterizations, noting them as realistic and compelling. [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised the opening sequence, calling it [...] "really, really great … nerd-tastic for [...] hardcore Lost fan; it's full of shout-outs and callbacks to classic Lost moments and trivia." [...] She concluded that the premiere is [...] "quite good" [...] (three and a half out of four stars) with [...] "a lot to like", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday summed up that [...] "The season's premiere represents pig-in-the-python storytelling—there's so much to work through, so many details, stories, characters and time dimensions to attend to, that after a while this all starts to feel like a very full meal. [...] A bloated feeling may result." [...] Among other pieces of praise, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle was impressed by the [...] "parallel plotting" [...] of the characters on and off the island in different times. [...] Despite deeming the premiere [...] "riveting" [...] and the script [...] "tantalizing as ever", Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe had a mixed response, for he worried that he would not be able to handle a season's worth of time travel, stating that [...] "I may be alone in this, and I hope I will be proven wrong, but I expected the solution to [...] "Lost" [...] to be more metaphysical, and more original, than simply people being unstuck in time." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger deemed it [...] "really good, in terms of keeping the momentum from last season going, servicing the characters and their emotions, and providing an appropriate number of 'Whoa's per hour." [...] In a three out of four stars review, Thomas Connor of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "the time-travel training wheels are coming off—and the path thus far seems blissfully free of the usual stumbling blocks", due to the previous four seasons of [...] "baby steps" [...] that set up the science fiction driven fifth season. [...] Caryn Kunz of the Honolulu Advertiser said that [...] "This was a great episode to get back into every aspect of our favorite show: relationships, mythology, reunions/cameos, and enough whoa moments to keep me on the edge of <b>my</b> <b>seat</b> throughout." ...|$|E
