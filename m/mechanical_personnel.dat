Sixty-five {{percent of them}} were non-management in various capacities such as building <b>mechanical</b> <b>personnel</b> (electrician, plumbing, HVAC), 20% were construction foreman and unskilled personnel, and 5% were sound and light technicians. They chiefly worked in continuous shifts during the games and were on-call at all other operational times. Waste operation at the venues during those games involved 52 paid staff, 45 volunteers, and 2,800 contractors.|$|E
5000|$|As DoD {{regulations}} require uniforms {{that do not}} melt {{when exposed}} to fire or high voltage for certain AFSCs, a cotton variant is in initial production (2010) for fire fighters, electricians, <b>mechanical</b> <b>personnel</b> who work with electrical power for HVAC, and several other AFSCs. This version is a 100% cotton ABU coat and pant that is Certified to NFPA 1975 Standards for Station/Work Uniforms for Emergency Services (2009 edition) by Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. An additional feature of this NFPA ABU {{is the lack of}} the interior [...] "map pockets" [...] (a common complaint regarding the ABU). The NFPA ABU can be used upon approval by unit commanders by personnel requiring a fire-retardant fabric. The fabric is also NIR Compliant. There is another 100% cotton ABU version that is discontinued but available in limited quantities in both men's and women's sizes but this version is not fire retardant. Since the NFPA ABU's are 100% cotton, they are not nearly as durable, nor as [...] "wash and wear" [...] as the regular ABU's, but they are much cooler in extremely hot weather.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Multispectral {{machine vision}} systems have the {{potential}} to provide <b>mechanical</b> inspection <b>personnel</b> with a tool to automatically assess and monitor the condition of rolling stock. By incorporating the visible and infrared spectra with machine vision algorithms, such a system can analyze physical and thermal condition. If a machine vision algorithm determines that a component is outside its normal operating range, the other spectrum can be analyzed to determine if there is any correlated anomaly. We present preliminary results on a project developing multispectral machine vision technology for inspection of the undercarriage of rolling stock. We have developed a system to record digital video images from a below-track perspective, and several machine vision algorithms to identify and analyze features of interest in these images.

40|$|Abstract. Coal mine {{electromechanical}} equipment {{plays an important}} role in the process of producing coal. For the lack of scientific management philosophy and effective management methods, China’s Coal mine {{electromechanical equipment}} is now facing severer and severer challenges in its way of moving ahead-shortage of investment, hysteresis of management-hazards emerge in every single seconds in the production of coal mine. These hazards, however, does not merely affect the normal production, but will also increase the risks of accidents. Therefore,in order to improve the management level of electromechanical equipment and optimize the utilization of mechanical and electrical equipment, coal mine managers should pay their attentions to the following three aspects: the importance of coal mining equipment, the importance of training <b>mechanical</b> and electrical <b>personnels</b> and the importance of accelerating the construction of mechanical and electrical information management system[1]...|$|R
40|$|Irregular {{operations}} in the Express Shipment Service Delivery industry require real time solutions that can be implemented to determine routings for aircraft and time-sensitive commodities. During inclement weather, crew unavailability, and <b>mechanical</b> failures, operations <b>personnel</b> use various approaches to recover from disruptions, including rescheduling or canceling flight legs, diverting aircraft and commodities, or missing service all together. We present an optimization approach that can capture and evaluate the effects of different operating policies. Specifically, we compare and contrast three different strategies, namely: 1) minimizing schedule delay, 2) minimizing the number of service failures, and 3) minimizing the combined cost of operations and service failures. We provide proof of concept by implementing our optimization models and evaluating them using several representative scenarios and conducting computational experiments. The solutions, which are highly dependent on user-defined parameters, represent tradeoffs between costs of operations and service failures. by Jennifer C. Cheung. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Savannah River Remediation (SRR) is {{preparing}} Tank 6 F for closure. The {{first step in}} preparing the tank for closure is mechanical sludge removal. In <b>mechanical</b> sludge removal, <b>personnel</b> add liquid (e. g., inhibited water or supernate salt solution) to the tank to form a slurry. They mix the liquid and sludge with pumps, and transfer the slurry to another tank for further processing. Mechanical sludge removal effectively removes {{the bulk of the}} sludge from a tank, but is not able to remove all of the sludge. In Tank 6 F, SRR estimated a sludge heel of 5, 984 gallons remained after mechanical sludge removal. To remove this sludge heel, SRR performed chemical cleaning. The chemical cleaning included two oxalic acid strikes, a spray wash, and a water wash. SRR conducted the first oxalic acid strike as follows. Personnel added 110, 830 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic acid to Tank 6 F and mixed the contents of Tank 6 F with two submersible mixer pumps (SMPs) for approximately four days. Following the mixing, they transferred 115, 903 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F. The SMPs were operating when the transfer started and were shut down approximately five hours after the transfer started. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted it to SRNL for analysis. Mapping of the tank following the transfer indicated that 2, 400 gallons of solids remained in the tank. SRR conducted the second oxalic acid strike as follows. Personnel added 28, 881 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic acid to Tank 6 F. Following the acid addition, they visually inspected the tank and transferred 32, 247 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted it to SRNL for analysis. Mapping of the tank following the transfer indicated that 3, 248 gallons of solids remained in the tank. Following the oxalic acid strikes, SRR performed Spray Washing with oxalic acid to remove waste collected on internal structures, cooling coils, tank top internals, and tank walls. The Acid Spray Wash was followed by a Water Spray Wash to remove oxalic acid from the tank internals. SRR conducted the Spray Wash as follows. Personnel added 4, 802 gallons of 8 wt % oxalic acid to Tank 6 F through the spray mast installed in Riser 2, added 4, 875 gallons of oxalic acid through Riser 7, added 5, 000 gallons of deionized water into the tank via Riser 2, and 5, 000 gallons of deionized water into the tank via Riser 7. Following the Spray Wash, they visually inspected the tank and transferred 22, 430 gallons of Tank 6 F material to Tank 7 F. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted it to SRNL for analysis. Following the Spray Wash and transfer, Savannah River Site (SRS) added 113, 935 gallons of well water to Tank 6 F. They mixed the tank contents with a single SMP and transferred 112, 699 gallons from Tank 6 F to Tank 7 F. SRR collected a sample of the liquid from Tank 6 F and submitted to SRNL for analysis. Mapping of the tank following the transfer indicated that 3, 488 gallons of solids remained in the tank. Following the Water Wash, SRR personnel collected a solid sample and submitted it to SRNL for analysis to assess the effectiveness of the chemical cleaning and to provide a preliminary indication of the composition of the material remaining in the tank...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Technology is {{the answer}} to most of our human needs but every {{technology}} is often accompanied by other challenges which often lead to the evolvement of another technology. One of the technologies that have greatly impacted our world is that of energy development out of which the petro–chemical industry is an important one. The petro–chemical industry remains the main energy hub for our world today through ranges of products coming from its ambit but not without its own challenges too. One of which is the issue of breakdown or shut down which always require maintenance. Shutdown, many a times, may be planned (annual, quarterly, condition–based, time–based, preventive and so on) or unplanned (run–to–failure). In any case, maintenance <b>personnel</b> (<b>mechanical,</b> electrical and instrument) must perform their duties to fix it. In the process of fixing the equipment several factors affect the effectiveness of the personnel. To improve maintenance activities, factors affecting its effectiveness should be addressed. Some of the factors that are already been considered are; Overall Equipment Effectiveness(OEE), Precision maintenance, Maintainability, Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS), Work Order management, Equipment, Logistics, Process optimization, Supply chain management, Maintenance strategies, Continuous Improvement Hours and so on. (Taylor, 2000; Siemens. com, 2010) Of those factors, many people hardly think of ergonomics as a factor of reckoning with maintenance activities. Ergonomics is mostly thought of in relation to operators and office workers. According to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in U. S. A (2009), ergonomic injuries are {{the most common cause of}} workplace illness and injury in the United States. Back injuries and cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) such as carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis, bursitis and epicondylitis form the majority of non–fatal occupational injuries and illnesses, costing employers more than 12 billion dollars per year in lost work time, workers compensation payments and medical expenses. Of the cost implication of ergonomics ailment reported above, how much of it is related to maintenance activities? Is there any relationship between maintenance activities andergonomics? In what direction is the relationship? positive or negative? How much is the impact in either direction? If it is negative, how can we mitigate it? Finally, what are the benefits, if any? These are some of the vital questions this dissertation is set to answer in relation to: physical, somatic, medical, overhead cost, production down–time and personnel morale. To achieve the afore–mentioned, several research instruments were employed which include; case studies, questionnaires, physical observations, interviews, literature reviews, internet resources, journals and other sources (industry experts and professionals). Relevant keywords and concepts were thoroughly researched in the literature review which serves as a base for the dissertation. Two hundred technical personnel (maintenance) serve as the population sample and questionnaires were administered to them. Technical personnel with appreciable number of years of experience occupying managerial positions were also interviewed. The outcomes of all the interviews, observations and questionnaires were analysed and interpreted accordingly to verify how ergonomics impact maintenance. This dissertation based on findings, was able to establish that ergonomics impact the activities of maintenance personnel culminated in proposing an E 4 M (Ergonomics for Maintenance) assessor. The assessor alongside utilization guidelines and a training matrix will help to effectively mitigate the impact of ergonomics on maintenance activities. There is room for further development of the tool into a computer based package for real–time assessment and mitigation. The assessor and its instruments cannot work alone without the commitment of stake–holders in the industry. That is why recommendations were included for effective application of the tool. The dissertation did not overlook the good works the industry has been doing in the area of creating awareness about repetitive stress injuries among its workforce but only complement its efforts in areas they might not look into. That is in a bid to improve the effectiveness of its workforce which will directly increase productivity, profit and stakeholders confidence. On the other hand, it will reduce their indirect losses through; production down–time, medical cost and over–head costs. However, the application of the E 4 M assessor is not limited to the petro–chemical industry only but finds its applicability in other industries like; manufacturing, aviation, automobile and any other field where maintenance activities take place particularly in third world countries.
