5|$|The Spirit Fruit Society was a communitarian {{group in}} the United States that was {{organized}} {{after a period of}} repeated business depressions during the 1890s. The society had its beginnings in Lisbon, Ohio and, over the years of its existence moved to Ingleside, Illinois and, finally, to California. Plagued by rumor, suspicion, and attacks in the press during its early years, the group remained active until 1930. Although it never numbered <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of adherents, the Spirit Fruit Society existed longer and more successfully than any other American utopian group.|$|E

He attempted interceptions against the high-flying machines and on 13 June finally got to within range of one. He fired but it swerved and resumed course. He chased the formation 21 miles out to sea but could not get closer than 500 feet. On 7 July he succeeded in hitting the Gotha crewed by Leutnant Erwin Kollberg and Walter Aschoff (of bomber unit Bogohl 3). He damaged a second and narrowly avoided a collision with the machine as he flew by. On one raid a Gotha gunner's bullet struck his windshield.

In contrast, Yugoslav dissidents were relegated to a marginal status due to the extraordinary position of Yugoslavia between two opposing blocs. The expected explosive impact on the Soviet satellites of Yugoslavia's defection from the Soviet orbit in 1948, also turned Tito into an internationally famous dissident. After Tito turned his back on the Soviet Union, Yugoslav dissidents were practically of no interest to Western policy makers. They did not wish to antagonize Tito, because he was much <b>more</b> useful <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of dissidents who potentially could interfere with his role in the cold war game.

50|$|On August 4, 1914, the {{parliamentary}} {{representatives of the}} Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) agreed among themselves to maintain party discipline and voted en bloc {{in support of a}} bill authorizing war credits for the Imperial government in the erupting international conflagration that would be remembered to history as World War I. This stunning reversal of the Second International's position on capitalist war came as a shock to radical internationalist elements in the party, including Jogiches. Rosa Luxemburg's immediate inclination was to publish and clandestinely circulate a manifesto signed by anti-war leaders of the SPD calling for spontaneous resistance — an effort which Jogiches criticized as no substitute for actual political organization. Luxemburg's idea was soon abandoned due to lack of support from the broad circle of party leaders tapped for the effort, of whom no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> small <b>handful</b> responded.|$|R
50|$|RAF Trimley Heath {{is one of}} Suffolk's most {{recognisable}} roadside structures - {{an imposing}} red-brick building set, half hidden by trees, alongside the eastbound A14 carriageway opposite Trimley St Martin. Yet, despite its many millions of passers-by over the last fifty years, its historical significance is known, probably, by no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> comparative <b>handful</b> of people, mainly those who served at the site during wartime or while undergoing post-war national service. Ironically, the most common assumption amongst those who have ever wondered - that the building was once an electricity supply industry substation - {{is also the most}} accurate.

50|$|The {{initials}} of the encyclopedias contributors {{appear at}} the end of selected articles or {{at the end of}} a section in the case of longer articles, such as that on China, and a key is given in each volume to these initials. Some articles were written by the best-known scholars of the time, such as Edmund Gosse, J. B. Bury, Algernon Charles Swinburne, John Muir, Peter Kropotkin, T. H. Huxley, James Hopwood Jeans and William Michael Rossetti. Among the then lesser-known contributors were some who would later become distinguished, such as Ernest Rutherford and Bertrand Russell. Many articles were carried over from the 9th edition, some with minimal updating. Some of the book-length articles were divided into smaller parts for easier reference, yet others much abridged. The best-known authors generally contributed only a single article or part of an article. Most of the work was done by journalists, British Museum scholars and other scholars.

40|$|Though {{known to}} {{financial}} academics for many years, momentum is for most investors the "undiscovered style, ” {{a valuable tool}} in building diversified portfolios with aboveaverage returns. Definition. Momentum is the tendency of investments to exhibit persistence in their relative performance. Investments that have performed relatively well, continue to perform relatively well; those that have performed relatively poorly, continue to perform relatively poorly. Momentum is about much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> buying <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of hot stocks – it is a disciplined, systematic investing style that applies across asset classes. Intuition. Momentum is a phenomenon driven by investor behavior: slow reaction to new information; asymmetric responses to winning and losing investments; and the "bandwagon ” effect. Numerous academic and practitioner studies have confirmed momentum’s existence. Implications. Virtually all investors can expect higher risk-adjusted returns by adding momentum to their portfolios. Growth investors will see that momentum delivers much better performance. Value investors will find momentum {{to be an effective}} complement. Value-growth investors will want to consider momentum as an alternative to their growth allocation. This paper introduces a family of investable momentum indices, and in so doing, opens this powerful strategy to a broad range of investors...|$|R

In these years, at divisions and in the field, the number of persons involved in intelligence work varied enormously.

He asserts that a centrally planned economy could never match the efficiency of the open market because what is known by a single agent is {{only a small fraction of}} the sum total of knowledge held by all members of society. A decentralized economy thus complements the dispersed nature of information spread throughout society. In Hayek's words, [...] "The marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity of one raw material, without an order being issued, without <b>more</b> <b>than</b> perhaps <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of people knowing the cause, tens of thousands of people whose identity could not be ascertained by months of investigation, are made to use the material or its products more sparingly; that is, they move in the right direction."
