40|$|Most of {{the fishing}} gears are {{selective}} for certain length range of fish thus excluding very small and very big fish. This property of fishing gears is termed as gear selectivity. Thompson and Ben-Yami (1984) considered selectivity as the capacity of any method of gear type to capture certain fractions or sections of the fish population whether grouped by species, age, size or behaviour and to exclude others. Gear selectivity needs to be considered when we go for estimation of size composition of fish. The ultimate aim of studies on size selection is to suggest suitable <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> to catch fish of either economically optimum size or an optimum size for the judicial exploitation of the stock.

50|$|Gillnets are {{designed}} to harvest a specific sized fish. For example, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's 2010 Commercial Regulations had a 7 in <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> restriction for Chinook, and a 5 in minimum - 5.5 in maximum for sockeye. Possible problems arising from this selective harvest are smaller reproducing adult fish, {{as well as the}} unexpected mortality of the fish which sustain injuries from the gillnet but are not retained in the fishery. Most salmon populations include several age classes, allowing for fish of different ages, and sizes, to reproduce with each other. A recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of Bristol Bay sockeye to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests. The study found that the larger females (>550 mm) of all age classes were most susceptible to harvest. The study suggests that smaller, younger fish were more likely to successfully traverse the gillnet fishery and reproduce than the larger fish. The study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946-2005 was 8 mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs.|$|E

40|$|Research PaperRecent {{research}} has warned that liberalising trade in capture fishery products originating from inefficient managed fisheries might cause over-exploitation, reduced fish stocks and thereby reduced steady state welfare. This paper qualifies the warning {{in a case}} study of the East Baltic cod market by introducing a quantitative supply model of the fishery with year classes. Welfare effects of trade liberalisation are identified taking minimum <b>size</b> limits and <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> into account and it is shown that even though liberalising trade supplied by such a fishery might cause long steady state welfare reductions in the supplier countries, this welfare reduction is almost solely related to economic over-exploitation through too large fishing costs more than to biological over-exploitation. Thus, the welfare effects of trade liberalisation are generally small and in particular for fishing mortalities well above the maximum sustainable yield. The consequence is that the argument that warns against trade liberalisation in certain situations gains less validity and conventional wisdom following from the Neo-classical theoretical tradition regains validity at several and probably most fish markets globally...|$|R

40|$|Many {{technical}} measures {{aimed at the}} conservation and recovery of fish stocks {{are based on the}} implementation of <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> to guarantee a certain level of fishing gear selectivity. At present, different methods are used to measure mesh opening, according to whether the measurement serves fisheries inspection, fisheries research or the manufacturing of netting for fishing nets. At the very least, this causes confusion but can also have more serious consequences such as the criminalization of well intentioned fishermen or the setting of inappropriate <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> regulations. For example, the measurements made by fishery inspectors using the wedge gauge are generally larger than those made by scientists using the ICES gauge. As a result the cod-ends used by fishermen to satisfy the fishery inspectors will have a selectivity lower than that anticipated by the scientists who provided the advice that informed the relevant legislation. In 1999, owing to the wider range of twines and netting materials used by the fishing industry, ICES established the Study Group on Mesh Measurement Methodology (SGMESH) to refine mesh measurement procedures. At the same time the different stakeholders agreed that there was a need to consider the adoption of a standard mesh measurement method. A major step in the standardization of mesh measurement methodologies was {{the development of a new}} standard mesh gauge (2002 - 2005). In October 2005, it was adopted by ICES as the new standard for mesh measurements and in June 2006 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recommended its use for scientific purposes. This review paper critically examines the different mesh measurement methodologies and their related problems, and introduces and describes a new objective mesh gauge (OMEGA) to replace the former less satisfactory gauges. Its adoption will result in researchers, fisheries inspectors and the netting industry using one standard gauge and one set of standard protocols to achieve consistent mesh-size measurements...|$|R

Since 1983 this has included a system of annual total allowable catches (TACs) for most commercially important stocks within the zone of extended fisheries jurisdiction created by the 200 -mile limits of all the EC Member States with coastlines bordering the North East Atlantic and adjacent seas. The TACs are divided into national catch quotas according to an established allocation mechanism which gives each Member State a fixed percentage share each year (although a number of international quota swaps are regularly undertaken). While the national fishing fleets are subject to certain common input controls under the common fisheries policy (in particular technical conservation measures such as <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes)</b> each Member State is free to determine the means for allocating its quotas and for regulating quota uptake. EC rules do, however, require all vessels of 10 metres or over in length to keep a logbook of their activities which must include details of the quantities of TAC species caught and retained on board and the time and location of capture. Inshore vessels of less than 10 metres long are not obliged to carry logbooks but Member States are still required to monitor their landings to ensure that national quota limits are respected.

Poaching using illegal mesh size nets as small as 5 cm and use of more than 10 nets per boat are common in the lake...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{influencing}} the species composition {{and magnitude of}} landings and discards were evaluated {{based on data from}} at-sea observations of 4 533 otter trawl tows. Data were collected from the USA mixed species otter trawl fisheries of the Georges Bank-Southern New England region, sampled during 1989 – 92. General linear models for main effects have related discard rates, total catch, and indices of species richness, diversity and evenness to temporal, spatial and operational variables associated with the fishing process (year, month, statistical reporting area, primary species sought, cod-end <b>mesh</b> <b>size,</b> vessel size, tow duration, total catch, total discards and depth). Discarding rates (proportion of the catch discarded) varied significantly both for individual species and for aggregated species by year, area, month, and target species. The effects of cod-end <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> were variable, and confounded with year-class strength, particularly in the case of yellowtail flounder. Fisheries regulated by <b>minimum</b> fish and <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> (e. g. for flounders and large gadoids) generally exhibited higher average discard rates and more variation than fisheries directed to species without such restrictions (e. g. for small pelagics, skates and others). The species composition and diversity of catches were significant functions of area, year, target species and month, as well as <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> and tow duration. Year effects were more important for explaining variation in discard rates than total (multispecies) catches. This result is probably because large, partially-recruited year-classes differentially attract effort from other species targets, but most of the fleet landings are composed of mixed catches of species at moderate abundance levels. Multivariate approaches to analysis of sea sampling data offer important insights into the potential effectiveness of technological and area/time management measures for reducing fishery discards. Key words: Bycatch, discards, gear selectivity, species compositio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Nephrops trawl {{fishery is}} one of the most {{important}} fisheries in the Bay of Biscay. The fishery management essentially relies on conservation measures, a total allowed catch (TAC) for Nephrops together with a minimum landing size (MLS) and <b>minimum</b> trawl <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> (70 mm stretched mesh). These measures have failed to prevent high discard levels of many species that characterize the fishery. Nephrops trawlers thus discard about half of their Nephrops catches in numbers (a third in weight) of which only 30 % survive. Nephrops discards mainly occur in younger Nephrops age groups below the MLS. This is a waste for the already overexploited Nephrops stock as well as for the fleet. Based on a bio-economic simulation model, the paper analyses the consequences of several scenarios of improving Nephrops selectivity. The potential impacts of these scenarios on Nephrops biomass, landings, discards and economic indicators (e. g. rent) are examined and a cost–benefit analysis of each scenario is carried out. We show that a better exploitation pattern would benefit fisheries that have high level of discards. Reducing non-commercial Nephrops discards leads to positive net present values of rent with better value realized from the production potential and limited short-term losses for the fishing units. By taking account of the economic dynamics of increasing effort however, we show that selectivity measures are insufficient. Regulating access to the fishery is also required to ensure the sustainability of the fishery and a better exploitation of the production potential...|$|R
