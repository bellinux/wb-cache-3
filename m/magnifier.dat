The oil bath is heated (and stirred) and with the aid of the <b>magnifier</b> (and external light source) melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed. In large/small devices, the sample is placed in a heating block, and optical detection is automated.|$|E

25|$|Another form of {{atmospheric}} diffraction or bending of light occurs when light moves through fine layers of particulate dust trapped {{primarily in the}} middle layers of the troposphere. This effect differs from water based atmospheric diffraction because the dust material is opaque whereas water allows light to pass through it. This {{has the effect of}} tinting the light the color of the dust particles. This tinting can vary from red to yellow depending on geographical location. the other primary difference is that dust based diffraction acts as a <b>magnifier</b> instead of creating a distinct halo. This occurs because the opaque matter does not share the lensing properties of water. The effect is to make an object visibly larger while being more indistinct as the dust distorts the image. This effect varies largely based on the amount and type of dust in the atmosphere.|$|E

2500|$|Columbia’s 'career' {{would have}} started to wind down after STS-118. It was to service the Hubble Space Telescope two more times between 2004 and 2005, but no more {{missions}} were planned for it again except for a mission designated STS-144 where it would retrieve the Hubble Space Telescope from orbit {{and bring it back}} to Earth. Following the Columbia accident, NASA flew the STS-125 mission using Atlantis, combining the planned fourth and fifth servicing missions into one final mission to Hubble. Because of the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet, the batteries and gyroscopes that keep the telescope pointed will eventually fail also because of the <b>magnifier</b> screen, which would result in its reentry and break-up in Earth's atmosphere.

Responsibility for the delay of [...] reforms is not placed on not just the—as yet invertebrate—political class, {{but also on the}} cultural milieus and the media, which favor sterile discussions, world play, obsolete ideologies." [...] He also notes: [...] "The dialogue between Vladimir Tismăneanu and Mircea Mihăieș demonstrates the role of analysis and confrontation of ideas over hasty judgment or temperamental criticism, providing in the end an image as unembellished as possible.

2500|$|A {{more complex}} {{version of a}} Tesla coil, termed a [...] "magnifier" [...] by Tesla, uses a more tightly coupled air-core {{resonance}} [...] "driver" [...] transformer (or [...] "master oscillator") and a smaller, remotely located output coil (called the [...] "extra coil" [...] or simply the resonator) that has {{a large number of}} turns on a relatively small coil form. The bottom of the driver's secondary winding is connected to ground. The opposite end is connected {{to the bottom of the}} extra coil through an insulated conductor that is sometimes called the transmission line. Since the transmission line operates at relatively high RF voltages, it is typically made of 1" [...] diameter metal tubing to reduce corona losses. Since the third coil is located some distance away from the driver, it is not magnetically coupled to it. RF energy is instead directly coupled from the output of the driver into the bottom of the third coil, causing it to [...] "ring up" [...] to very high voltages. The combination of the two-coil driver and third coil resonator adds another degree of freedom to the system, making tuning considerably more complex than that of a 2-coil system. The transient response for multiple resonance networks (of which the Tesla <b>magnifier</b> is a sub-set) has only recently been solved. It is now known that a variety of useful tuning [...] "modes" [...] are available, and in most operating modes the extra coil will ring at a different frequency than the master oscillator.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{high-voltage}} enthusiasts usually build Tesla coils {{similar to}} some of Tesla's [...] "later" [...] 2-coil air-core designs. These typically consist of a primary tank circuit, a series LC (inductance-capacitance) circuit composed of a high-voltage capacitor, spark gap and primary coil, and the secondary LC circuit, a series-resonant circuit consisting of the secondary coil plus a terminal capacitance or [...] "top load". In Tesla's more advanced (<b>magnifier)</b> design, a third coil is added. The secondary LC circuit is composed of a tightly coupled air-core transformer secondary coil driving {{the bottom of a}} separate third coil helical resonator. Modern 2-coil systems use a single secondary coil. The top of the secondary is then connected to a topload terminal, which forms one 'plate' of a capacitor, the other 'plate' being the earth (or [...] "ground"). The primary LC circuit is tuned so that it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary LC circuit. The primary and secondary coils are magnetically coupled, creating a dual-tuned resonant air-core transformer. Earlier oil-insulated Tesla coils needed large and long insulators at their high-voltage terminals to prevent discharge in air. Later Tesla coils spread their electric fields over larger distances to prevent high electrical stresses in the first place, thereby allowing operation in free air. Most modern Tesla coils also use toroid-shaped output terminals. These are often fabricated from spun metal or flexible aluminum ducting. The toroidal shape helps to control the high electrical field {{near the top of the}} secondary by directing sparks outward and away from the primary and secondary windings.|$|E
2500|$|On April 8, 1927, their appeals exhausted, Sacco and Vanzetti {{were finally}} {{sentenced to death}} in the {{electric}} chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the executions and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that an automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and extractor marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Major Calvin Goddard in 1927. [...] Major Goddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted <b>magnifier</b> probe used to inspect gun barrels, to make an examination of Sacco’s [...]32 Savage Model 1907, the bullet that allegedly killed Berardelli, and the spent casings allegedly recovered from the scene of the crime. [...] (Defenders of Sacco and Vanzetti claim that the bullet and cartridge case linked to Sacco's pistol were substituted for genuine evidence by the Massachusetts police.) In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired several test bullets from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and prepared them for a comparative examination. [...] He then put the ejected shell casings on the comparison microscope next to casings recovered at the South Braintree murder scene. [...] Then he analyzed them carefully. [...] The third bullet, designated Bullet III matched the rifling marks found on the barrel of Sacco's pistol, while firing pin marks on a [...]32 spent casing recovered from the murder scene matched a test shell casing known to have been fired from Sacco's pistol. [...] Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions. Nicola Sacco [...] and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were found guilty and executed via electrocution in Massachusetts on August 23, 1927.|$|E
