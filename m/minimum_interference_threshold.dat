40|$|This paper proposes {{adequate}} {{methods to}} improve the interference mitigation capability of a recently investigated switched-based interference reduction scheme in short-range open-access and over-loaded femtocells. It is assumed that the available orthogonal channels for the femtocell network are distributed among operating access points in close vicinity, where each of which knows its allocated channels a priori. For the case when the feedback links are capacity-limited and the available channels can be universally shared and simultaneously used, the paper presents enhanced schemes to identify a channel to serve the desired scheduled user by maintaining the interference power level within a tolerable range. They attempt to either complement the switched-based scheme by <b>minimum</b> <b>interference</b> channel selection or adopt different <b>interference</b> <b>thresholds</b> on available channels, while aiming to reduce the channels examination load.

The objective of RRA is to maximize the average achievable throughput subject to the primary service <b>interference</b> <b>threshold</b> and the secondary service transmit power constraint. RRA is usually implemented based on a time window T over which system parameters are averaged and checked against resource constraints. We use short-term (T = 1 time slot) and long-term (T 1 slots) averaging as approximations to instantaneous and average constraints, re-spectively. RRA is also investigated for this system with long-term <b>interference</b> <b>threshold</b> and short-term <b>interference</b> <b>threshold</b> con-straints.

30|$|The {{attainable}} {{system throughput}} of BB-OFDMA {{is sensitive to}} the selected <b>interference</b> <b>threshold</b> [15, 16]. In this paper, it is demonstrated how the <b>interference</b> <b>threshold</b> can be tuned to tradeoff system throughput to enhance cell-edge user throughput, thereby enhancing fairness. Moreover, by using a variable BB power {{that takes into account}} the quality of the intended link, a favourable tradeoff between system throughput and fairness is achieved. A variable BB power exhibits the further advantage that the sensitivity of the selected <b>interference</b> <b>threshold</b> on the performance is mitigated. Finally, BB-OFDMA with variable BB power is the basis for a novel receiver-driven link adaptation algorithm. System-level simulations demonstrate a significant improvement both in terms of fairness and total system throughput of BB-OFDMA, compared to the system with full-frequency reuse, where attempts to avoid interference are not made.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} techniques offering QoS routing is <b>minimum</b> <b>interference</b> routing. However, it is complex in terms of computation time and is not oriented toward improving the network protection level. In order to include better levels of protection, new <b>minimum</b> <b>interference</b> routing algorithms are necessary. Minimizing the failure recovery time is also a complex process involving different failure recovery phases. Some of these phases depend completely on correct routing selection, such as minimizing the failure notification time. The level of protection also involves other aspects, such as the amount of resources used. In this case shared backup techniques should be considered. Therefore, <b>minimum</b> <b>interference</b> techniques should also be modified in order to include sharing resources for protection in their objectives. These aspects are reviewed and analyzed in this article, and a new proposal combining <b>minimum</b> <b>interference</b> with fast protection using shared segment backups is introduced.

40|$|This paper proposes {{adequate}} {{methods to}} improve the interference mitigation capability of a recently investigated switched-based interference reduction scheme for single downlink channel assignment in over-loaded small-cell networks. The model assumes that the available orthogonal channels for small cells are distributed among access points in close vicinity, where each access point knows its allocated channels a priori. Each cell has a single antenna, employs the open access strategy, and can reuse its allocated channels simultaneously, while scheduling concurrent service requests. Moreover, the access points can not coordinate their transmissions, and can receive limited feedback from active users. The paper presents low-complexity schemes to identify a suitable channel to serve the scheduled user by maintaining the interference power level within a tolerable range.

We then propose a novel mixed access strategy in {{which in contrast to}} the underlay strategy, the secondary service transmits during the idle periods without considering the <b>interference</b> <b>threshold</b> constraint. In contrast to the overlay strategy, mixed strategy makes transmission during the busy periods with a probability pa subject to satisfying the <b>interference</b> <b>threshold</b> constraint. Parameter pa is a secondary service parameter, which can be adjusted based on the spectrum status. Moreover, we show that the secondary service can adjust pa to select appropriate access strategy with the objective of maximizing the achieved capacity based on the interference at the secondary service receiver, I, imposed by the primary service transmitter. The proposed spectrum-sharing technique developed in this paper based on I significantly reduces the system complexity comparing to the system in which for spectrum sharing, the imposed interference at the primary receiver is required. We further suggest a simple power allocation scheme for the mixed strategy that its achieved capacity is very close to the maximum achievable capacity of the secondary service.
