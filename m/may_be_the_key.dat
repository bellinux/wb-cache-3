25|$|Because Callisto and Ganymede are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} Titan, {{it is unclear}} why their atmospheres are insignificant relative to Titan's. Nevertheless, the origin of Titan's N2 via geologically ancient photolysis of accreted and degassed NH3, as opposed to degassing of N2 from accretionary clathrates, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to a correct inference. Had N2 been released from clathrates, 36Ar and 38Ar that are inert primordial isotopes of the Solar System should also {{be present in the}} atmosphere, but neither has been detected in significant quantities. The insignificant concentration of 36Ar and 38Ar also indicates that the ~40K temperature required to trap them and N2 in clathrates did not exist in the Saturnian subnebula. Instead, the temperature may have been higher than 75K, limiting even the accumulation of NH3 as hydrates. Temperatures would have been even higher in the Jovian subnebula due to the greater gravitational potential energy release, mass, and proximity to the Sun, greatly reducing the NH3 inventory accreted by Callisto and Ganymede. The resulting N2 atmospheres may have been too thin to survive the atmospheric erosion effects that Titan has withstood.|$|E

Cells missing BRCA1 and BRCA2 have a decreased rate of homologous recombination and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that decreased homologous recombination leads to increased susceptibility to cancer.

2500|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a yeast of the phylum Ascomycota. [...] During {{vegetative}} {{growth that}} ordinarily occurs when nutrients are abundant, S. cerevisiae reproduces by mitosis as diploid cells. However, when starved, these cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores. [...] Mating occurs when haploid cells of opposite mating types MATa and MATα come into contact. [...] Ruderfer et al. pointed out that, in nature, such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons. The {{first is that}} cells of opposite mating type are present {{together in the same}} acus, the sac that contains the cells directly produced by a single meiosis, and these cells can mate with each other. The second reason is that haploid cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type. [...] An analysis of the ancestry of natural S. cerevisiae strains concluded that outcrossing occurs very infrequently (only about once every 50,000 cell divisions). [...] The relative rarity in nature of meiotic events that result from outcrossing suggests that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of diversity) are unlikely to be sufficient for generally maintaining sex {{from one generation to the}} next. [...] Rather, a short term benefit, such as meiotic recombinational repair of DNA damages caused by stressful conditions (such as starvation) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> to the maintenance of sex in S. cerevisiae.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Neutrophils play {{important}} roles in host defense against all classes of infectious agents but, paradoxically, they are also involved in the pathology of vanous inflammatory conditions. Their microbicidal armory consists of oxidative and nonoxidative processes that are activated simultaneously upon phagocytosis. Although destruction of infectious agents occurs intracellulanly, release of cytotoxic molecules into the extracellulan milieu can damage body tissues. Neutrophils are heterogeneous. Subpopulations exist in various stages from dormant to primed to fully activated. The activities of neutrophils are regulated locally in microenvironments and systemically by a plethora of mediators including cytokines, “classical ” neuroendocrine hormones, and bioactive lipids. The net response depends on a complex balance of stimulatory and inhibitory pathways that are regulated by these mediators. Although some effector and regulatory pathways are vital, considerable redundancy is also evident. Identification of the essential mediators and the unraveling of any interactions <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> to understanding <b>the</b> neutrophil paradox and developing thenapeutic strategies that optimize microbial killing and minimize host tissue damage. Finally, reports that neutrophils can act as drug delivery vectors and that their function is influenced by stress and other lifestyle factors suggest that new homeostatic functions for these cells, outside their traditional roles in host defense and inflammation, remain to be identified: some are speculated o...|$|R
