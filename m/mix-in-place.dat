40|$|Combinations {{in various}} {{proportions}} of milled bituminous concrete and crushed limestone aggregates were mixed {{in the laboratory}} with 5 % by mass cement and 5 % by mass water to simulate some of the materials that can be obtained when <b>mix-in-place</b> recycling with cement is used. The influence of the temperature and {{of the type of}} loading (different rates of stress application of ramp loading and different frequencies of sinusoidal loading) on the modulus of elasticity is examined. It is concluded that as the milled bituminous concrete content in the mix is increased, both the temperature and the rate of stress application increasingly influence the results, and this should be taken into consideration when specifying or designing pavements incorporating cement-bound materials of this type...|$|E

However, {{a number of}} applications with moderate performance requirements (e. g., chat) may require both properties. In this paper, we develop a new architecture that provides provably unlinkable and efficient communications using a single intermediary node. Nodes partici-pating in these <b>Mix-In-Place</b> Networks (MIPNets) exchange mes-sages through a mailbox in an Oblivious Proxy (OP). Clients lever-age Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) to send and receive their messages from the OP while blindly but reversibly modifying the appearance of all other messages (i. e., mixing in place) in the mail-box. While an Oblivious Proxy will know that a client participated in exchanges, {{it can not be}} certain which, if any, messages that client transmitted or received. We implement and measure our pro-posed design using a modified version of Fairplay and note reduc-tions in execution times of greater than 98 % over the naïve applica-tion of garbled circuits. We then develop a chat application on top of the MIPNet architecture and demonstrate its practical use for as many as 100 concurrent users. Our results demonstrate the poten-tial to use SFE-enabled “mixing ” in a single proxy as a means of providing provable deniability for applications with near real-time performance requirements. 1...|$|E
