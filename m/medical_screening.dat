5|$|In {{terms of}} medical issues, lesbians are {{referred}} to as women who have sex with women (WSW) because of the misconceptions and assumptions about women's sexuality and some women's hesitancy to disclose their accurate sexual histories even to a physician. Many self-identified lesbians neglect to see a physician because they do not participate in heterosexual activity and require no birth control, which is the initiating factor for most women to seek consultation with a gynecologist when they become sexually active. As a result, many lesbians are not screened regularly with Pap smears. The U.S. government reports that some lesbians neglect seeking <b>medical</b> <b>screening</b> in the U.S.; they lack health insurance because many employers do not offer health benefits to domestic partners.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{management}} is {{obtained by the}} usual measures of engineering controls, administrative controls and procedures, and personal protective equipment, including hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA), protective equipment, <b>medical</b> <b>screening,</b> training and standardised procedures. Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they {{are an important part}} of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{effectiveness}} {{of the use of}} mammography as a <b>medical</b> <b>screen</b> for women aged 50 - 69 is well-documented; however, there exists much uncertainty in the {{effectiveness of}} mammography screening for women aged 40 - 49. Additionally, much uncertainty lies {{in the use of the}} PSA test as a <b>medical</b> <b>screen.</b> The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the rates of PSA test and mammography test use and (2) to compare and contrast the factors that predict the use of mammography and the PSA test, respectively. Methods The Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 1. 1 was used. It is survey of approximately 133, 300 people and it covers all health regions, provinces and territories. Probit regressions were used to analyze the statistically significant determinants of PSA test in men and mammography uptake in women. Mammography uptake in women aged 40 - 49 was also analyzed independently...|$|R

25|$|Mammography is {{a common}} {{screening}} method, since it is relatively fast and widely available in developed countries. Mammography {{is a type of}} radiography used on the breasts.

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely {{discussed}} false positives in <b>medical</b> <b>screening</b> come from the breast cancer screening procedure mammography. The US rate of false positive mammograms is up to 15%, the highest in world. One consequence of the high false positive rate in the US is that, in any 10-year period, half of the American women screened receive a false positive mammogram. False positive mammograms are costly, with over $100million spent annually in the U.S. on follow-up testing and treatment. They also cause women unneeded anxiety. As {{a result of the}} high false positive rate in the US, as many as 90–95% of women who get a positive mammogram do not have the condition. The lowest rate in the world is in the Netherlands, 1%. The lowest rates are generally in Northern Europe where mammography films are read twice and a high threshold for additional testing is set (the high threshold decreases the power of the test).|$|E

40|$|Subject {{participation}} {{is crucial to}} drug development studies. Numbers of subjects are greatly reduced between the initial recruitment and study completion. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine where major losses of subjects occurred and character ize the reasons why the subjects did or did not participate. All studies were con ducted at The Upjohn Research Clinics, Kalamazoo, Michigan, which comprise a 76 - bed facility that specializes in Phase I and II trials. A 1987 - 1988 retrospective survey of 157 studies showed that of 9, 028 subjects who met protocol entry criteria 5, 906 (65 %) attended the informed consent. Of the areas where subjects were lost, 3, 122 (35 %) subjects failed to attend the informed consent and 2, 073 (35 %) subjects withdrew between the informed consent and the start of the study or during the <b>medical</b> <b>screen.</b> After entry into the study, 247 (6 %) subjects failed to complete the studies due to side effects or withdrawal on their own volition. The subjects popula tion was mainly white (92 %), male (72 %), and between 18 and 55 years of age, with black subjects (5 %) and females (28 %) represented the least. The greatest losses occurred due to failure to attend the informed consent or pass the <b>medical</b> <b>screen.</b> According to our data, we must recruit twice the number of volunteers needed to fulfill study requirements. Future investigation should be directed to identify those characteristics of poten tial volunteers who initially express an interest to participate in a study, but who decline to show up for the informed consent session...|$|R
