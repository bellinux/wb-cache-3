40|$|Abstract: The authors {{confirmed}} the {{high incidence of}} <b>malayan</b> <b>filariasis</b> among the villagers of southern coast of Che-ju Is., Korea. The epidemiological analysis revealed that the inhabitants living in Coast region of Wimi- 1 -Ri village were much more affected by the filarial infection than those in Inland region not only in mf rate and mf density, but even in the skin reactivities in children. This finding will be explained by the ecological behavior of vector mosquito, Aedes togoi, bred in the sea shore. The fall of filarial transmis-sion due to the mass treatment of microfilaria carriers in 1970 resulted in the reduction of average wheal-size in skin-test of children 2 years later. It has been recognized that <b>malayan</b> <b>filariasis</b> was widely and densely endemic all over Che-ju Is., Korea (Senoo and Lincicome, 1951; Seo et al., 1965, 1968; Soh etal., 1968). As to the vector mosquito in this island, Lee et al. (1964) reported that Aedes togoi might be the possible vector of Brugia malayi based on the dissection study of several species of mosquitoes. Recently, Omori and Wada (1970) confirmed that A. togoi was responsible for the transmission of B. malayi in this island. In 1970...|$|E
40|$|Western blot test {{to detect}} {{specific}} IgG 4 and IgE {{was performed to}} 12 microfilaraemic and 13 amicrofilaraemic individuals from <b>malayan</b> <b>filariasis</b> endemic area, Pasir Penyu, Riau. No differences in binding patterns of IgG 4 and IgE antibodies to microfUarial protein components was shown. There was a parallel protein components recognition by IgG 4 and IgE of molecular weight ranging from 158 kd to 14 kd. Protein component of 125 kd was only recognized by IgG 4 and of 112 kd only by IgE. These findings suggest that in filarial infection IgG 4 antibodies play a role as a blocking antibodies to inhibit the spesific reaction of IgE that is usually expressed as an allergic reaction. </p...|$|E
40|$|Based on studies {{carried out}} by the author and his {{associates}} in areas of Japan and South Asia where <b>malayan</b> and bancroftian <b>filariasis</b> is endemic, this paper recommends methods for use in microfilaria surveys and in the analysis of data obtained in such surveys. The author recommends the use of measured blood samples of 30 mm 3, with which 3 linear smears are made on slides. The blood films are then stained with azure II and eosin. Microfilarial counts made with such smears are, it is claimed, simpler, less expensive, and more reliable than those made with round, thick smears. Furthermore, the use of 3 smears from each person permits the calculation of correction factors, by means of which the detection rates that would be obtained by the use of different volumes of blood may be calculated...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of reports on {{mosquitoes}} of Sumatera and neighbouring islands reveal that 198 species have thus far been discovered (Brug & Haga, 1923; Brug, 1931; Brug & Edwards, 1931; Swellengrebel & Rodenwaldt, 1932; Brug, Bonne-Wepster, 1947; Bonne-Wepster & Swellengrebel, 1953; Bonne-Wepster, 1954; Waktoedi, 1954; Reid, 1968; Lien et al., 1975). All these report were based on short-term surveys, and most were from South Sumatera. Longitudinal studies of mosquito vectors of <b>malayan</b> <b>filariasis</b> during this study for a 24 -month period in two villages were carried out. All mosquito species were collec­ted, identified and recorded. The present paper presents the mosquito fauna in the study areas, and discusses (1) the seasonal variations of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Anopheles peditaenia-tus, and An. nigerrimus, and (2) the parous rate of two Anopheles species. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the cellular immune competence of 101 subjects {{living in an}} area of South Kalimantan (Borneo) where <b>Malayan</b> <b>filariasis</b> is endemic. All patients with elephantiasis but none with other clinical stages of filariasis reacted with adult worm antigens. The majority of subjects without clinical or parasitological evidence of filariasis and approximately one-half of those with amicrofilaremic filariasis reacted with microfilarial antigens. In contrast, most patients with patent microfilaremia did not respond to microfilarial antigens. The in vitro reactivity of all patient categories to nonparasite antigens was {{similar to that of the}} distant control group. These results indicate that patent microfilaremia is associated with a state of specific cellular immune unresponsiveness and are consistent with the current hypothesis that the various clinical manifestations of filariasis result from different types of immune responses to distinct antigens associated with different developmental stages of filarial worms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Observations {{were made}} on the exsheathment and {{migration}} of microfilariae of Brugia malayi in mosquitoes. In Aedes togoi and Aedes albopictus, the microfilariae ingested into the midgut commonly exsheathed and migrated to the thorax. The larvae which moved to the thorax in the former mosquito developed to the 3 rd stage, but in the latter the larvae did not grow even to the 2 nd stage. The microfilariae in Armigeres subalbatus also cast off the sheath in the stomach at a moderate rate, whereas, those which moved to the thorax were small in number, and did not develop any further. On the other hand, in Culex pipiens pollens, most of the microfilariae did not exsheathe and died without migrating to the thorax. Therefore, {{it can be said}} that the exsheathment of microfilariae of B. malayi in the midgut of mosquitoes has a close relation with their migration to the thorax. <b>Malayan</b> <b>filariasis</b> is found in the South-and-East Asian countries, such as Ceylon...|$|E
40|$|The immune {{response}} to microfilarial antigen in <b>malayan</b> <b>filariasis</b> was found more prominent in ami-crofilaremic individuals {{than in the}} micro filaremics. It {{has been shown that}} in amicrofilaremic individuals antibody plays a role in reducing micro filaremiae. The targets antigens of antibody (IgG) were shown to be protein components of microfilariae with molecular weight of 75, 70 and 25 Kd. This prospective study was aimed at detecting IgG against microfilariae in transmigrats, who had settled into an filarial endemic area. Sera of 10 individuals at 8, 13, 26, 39 and 52 moths after settling, were examined by ELISA and Wes­tern Blott against microfilaria of B. malayi. Four out of 10 transmigrants showed IgG that recognized the protein components of 77, 70 and 31 Kd and were shown at 39, 52 and 8 months after settling respectively, The IgG against components of 77 and 70 Kd were revealed later than the one against 31 Kd. </p...|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{at present}} {{is still one}} of the {{important}} mosquito-borne diseases in Indonesia. The disease is widespread all over the country and involves nearly all islands. Sixteen Anopheles species have been reconfirmed as malaria vectors. They were distributed geographi­cally as follows: Coastal areas and lagoons [...] - An sundaicus and An. subpictus Cultivated ricefields and swampy areas [...] An. aconitus, An. barbirostris, An. nigerrimus and An. sinensis Forest inland areas in shaded temporary pools, muddy animal wallows and hoof-prints [...] An. balabacensis, An. bancrofti, An. farauti, An. koliensis and An. punctulatus Swamp forest edge in ditches with vegeta- [...] An. letifer and An. ludlowae don Hilly areas in seepages, streams and clear moving water [...] Anflavirostris, An. maculatus and Anminimus.   The species (of most general importance is An. sundaicus, which is restricted) by its preference for brackish water and is prevalent in coastal areas of Java. Their types in behaviour of An. sundaicus appear as follows : 1. An. sundaicus in South Coast of Java in general. This species is essentially anthropophilic, exophagic and rests outdoor. It shows susceptible to DDT. 2. An. sundaicus in Cilacap, Central Java. This mosquito is a pure anthropophilic form. It bites man in houses and outdoors, rests indoors and is known resistant to DDT. 3. An. sundaicus in Yogyakarta and Purworejo, Central Java. This mosquito is a strong zoophilic species. It rests and prefers to bite outdoors and shows tolerance to DDT. Human filariasis in Indonesia is the result of infection by three endemic species, namely, Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. W. bancrofti infection is found in both urban and rural areas. Twenty species of mosquitoes are confirmed as filariasis vectors. The urban type bancroftian filariasis is transmitted by Culex quinquefasciatus, whereas the rural type is transmitted mosdy by Anopheles spp., such as An. aconitus and An. punctulatus complex. The periodic species of Mansonia transmit the subperiodic noctural B. malayi. B. timori which is distributed in the Eastern part of Indonesia (East Nusa Tenggara), is transmitted by An. barbirostris. Some filariasis vectors such as An. aconitus and the An. puctulatus complex may function both as filariasis vector and malaria vector as well. An. barbirostris with is confirmed as a vector of malaria in South Sulawesi, a vector of periodic nocturnal <b>malayan</b> <b>filariasis</b> in Central Sulawesi and as the only vector of timorian filariasis in Timor and Flores, has to be studied further as it has two types of behaviouristic appearance, namely : 1. Anbarbirostris in Java This mosquito is an anthropozophilic species, feeds indoors and outdoors, and rest outdoors. None is found to transmit mosquitoborne disease. 2. Anbarbirostris in Sulawesi and East Nusa Tenggara (outside Java). This mosquito is a zooanthropophilic form, endo and exophagic, and rests outdoors. It is confirmed as a vector of malaria, periodic noctural <b>malayan</b> <b>filariasis</b> and the only vector of timorian filariasis.  </p...|$|E
