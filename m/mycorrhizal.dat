5|$|Like {{many other}} {{strictly}} <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungi, B.edulis has to date eluded cultivation attempts. The results of {{some studies suggest}} that unknown components of the soil microflora might be required for B.edulis to successfully establish a <b>mycorrhizal</b> relationship with the host plant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mycorrhizal</b> {{symbiosis}} between {{plants and}} fungi {{is one of}} the most well-known plant–fungus associations and is of significant importance for plant growth and persistence in many ecosystems; over 90% of all plant species engage in <b>mycorrhizal</b> relationships with fungi and are dependent upon this relationship for survival.|$|E
5|$|The Ericoid <b>Mycorrhizal</b> Fungi Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium {{can grow}} in zinc metalliferous soils.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a <b>mycorrhizal</b> species, {{it does have}} some saprophytic tendencies and {{may be able to}} use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other <b>mycorrhizal</b> types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E
5|$|In a {{molecular}} {{study of the}} large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungi of the orchid Gastrodia confusa, M.inclinata {{was found to be}} closely related to M.aurantiomarginata, M.crocata, and M.leaiana.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus is {{a pioneer}} species that {{typically}} establishes {{itself in the}} early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms <b>mycorrhizal</b> associations with various species of pine, including Scots pine (P.sylvestris), black pine (P.nigra), and Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in Europe, and red pine (P.resinosa) and white pine (P.strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P.halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine (P.contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S.luteus as the sole <b>mycorrhizal</b> partner.|$|E
5|$|The {{branches}} of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's brooms growing among them, caused by the fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus Piptoporus betulinus and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other <b>mycorrhizal</b> associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists {{the growth of the}} tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mycorrhizal</b> {{associations}} of several Sclerodermatineae genera have been established. Studies {{have demonstrated that}} Astraeus, Pisolithus, and Scleroderma form ectomycorrhizal associations with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. Previously thought to be saprophytic, the Calostomataceae were determined to be ectomycorrhizal with Fagaceae and Myrtaceae using isotopic and molecular analyses. Species from the genera Pisolithus and Scleroderma {{have been used in}} forestry as <b>mycorrhizal</b> inocula to help promote the growth and vigor of young seedlings.|$|E
5|$|The proteobacterium Geobacter {{has also}} been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground water. The <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungus Glomus intraradices {{increases}} uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant.|$|E
5|$|Amanita gemmata is a <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungus, {{meaning it}} forms a {{mutually}} beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source, and the fungus provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document <b>mycorrhizal</b> associations of A.gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. The fungus favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ravenelii is a <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungus, {{meaning it}} forms mutualistic {{associations}} with shrubs and trees. Mushrooms grow {{on the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests. Although the specific tree associations preferred by A.ravenelii are unknown, in general, Amanita from section Lepidella tend to associate with diploxylon pine (that is, pines in subgenus Pinus), oak, and hickory.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes is <b>mycorrhizal,</b> {{and fruits}} singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground under {{broadleaf}} trees, especially oak and beech, {{but it has also}} been recorded associating with mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Boletus auripes typically forms fruit bodies between June and November.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes, {{commonly}} known as the butter-foot bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First described from New York in 1898, the fungus is found in eastern Asia, Central America, and eastern North America from Canada to Florida. It is a <b>mycorrhizal</b> species and typically grows in association with oak and beech trees.|$|E
5|$|Boletus subluridellus is a <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungus, {{and grows}} in {{association}} with deciduous trees, especially oak (genus Quercus). Fruit bodies grow scattered or in groups {{on the ground in}} deciduous or mixed forests, and appear from July to October. An eastern North American species, the mushroom is found from New England west to the Great Lakes, north to Quebec in Canada.|$|E
5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. Many {{of these are}} known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish {{in the absence of}} its <b>mycorrhizal</b> associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients from one place to another. The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues. Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius deterrimus {{belongs to}} the section Deliciosi of the genus Lactarius. According to {{molecular}} phylogenetics studies, this section forms a definite phylogenetic group within the milk cap relatives. Deliciosi species mainly have an orange or reddish-coloured latex and taste mild to slightly bitter. They are strict <b>mycorrhizal</b> associates of conifers. The next closest relative of L.deterrimus is L.fennoscandicus.|$|E
5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is a <b>mycorrhizal</b> species. Its fruit bodies grow singly to {{scattered}} in soil under madrone and manzanita. Known to occur only in North America, {{it is commonly}} found from central California to southern Oregon, but has also been reported further north in Washington and British Columbia (Canada). Thiers considered it the most abundant Leccinum in California.|$|E
5|$|Like all Lactarius species, L.argillaceifolius is <b>mycorrhizal.</b> The fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius argillaceifolius grow {{scattered}} or in {{groups on the}} ground under hardwoods, especially oak, from July to October. It is often {{one of the first}} <b>mycorrhizal</b> mushrooms to fruit in forests dominated by oak and hickory. The fruit bodies are slow to develop and are long-lasting. The species is found from eastern Canada south to Florida, and west to Minnesota and Texas. It is common in northeast Mexico. The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil (state of Santa Catarina) growing in association with pine (Pinus elliottii) plantations, where it has probably been introduced with pine seedlings brought by settlers. L.argillaceifolius var. megacarpus has been collected from Baja California, California, Oregon, and Washington, where it grows in association with coast live oak and tanoak.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species have}} {{developed}} specialized hyphal structures for nutrient uptake from living hosts; examples include haustoria in plant-parasitic species of most fungal phyla, and arbuscules of several <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungi, which penetrate into the host cells to consume nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Saproamanita thiersii inhabits lawns, {{pastures}} and prairies throughout the Mississippi River Basin. It often forms fairy rings or arcs but also sometimes fruits as isolated specimens. It {{has been found}} growing in the same lawn as Chlorophyllum molybdites. Analysis using stable carbon isotopes has proved that this mushroom is saprotrophic in nature, unlike the other <b>mycorrhizal</b> Amanitas.|$|E
5|$|Suillus brevipes is a <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungus, and it {{develops}} a close symbiotic {{association with the}} roots of various tree species, especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus can supply the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially lodgepole and ponderosa pine. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus {{has been shown to}} form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole, loblolly, eastern white, patula, pond, radiata, and red pines. In vitro <b>mycorrhizal</b> associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry, western larch, Sitka spruce, and coast Douglas-fir. Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350ppm), lead (200ppm), and nickel (20ppm).|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Aureoboletus mirabilis grow solitarily, scattered, or {{sometimes}} {{in small groups}} {{on the ground or}} on well-decayed conifer logs, especially of western and mountain hemlock, but occasionally also Douglas-fir and western red cedar. The fungus is strongly suspected to form <b>mycorrhizal</b> associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing B.mirabilis mycorrhizae in laboratory culture have failed. Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown cubical rot—a trait suggestive of cellulose-decomposing saprobic fungi—the rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant conifer roots. It has been suggested that B.mirabilis has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungi, and further, that the inability to culture mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown cubical rot are required for fungal growth.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus alboater is a <b>mycorrhizal</b> species, and its fruit bodies grow on {{the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups under {{deciduous}} trees, particularly oak. Fruiting occurs in deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests. Its dark color {{makes it difficult to}} notice in the field.|$|E
5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is a <b>mycorrhizal</b> species, and its fruit bodies grow {{scattered}} or {{in groups}} on the ground under hardwood trees. The fungus fruits in summer and autumn months, and tends to appear after hot weather and heavy rains. Known only from North America, its range extends from New England south to Tennessee, and west to Michigan. It has also been recorded from Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens {{can both}} {{mobilize}} solid copper as a cyanide compound. The ericoid <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungi associated with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper. The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity. A {{sample of the}} fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. The fungus also {{plays a role in}} the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, Hygrophoropsis is a {{widespread}} genus, found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is the most widely distributed species, found on several continents. The other species are not well-known and have more limited ranges. Fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, and peat, and on woodchips. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus, and causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. Some species may be facultatively <b>mycorrhizal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cortinarius iodes forms <b>mycorrhizal</b> {{associations}} with deciduous trees, particularly oaks. The fruit bodies of Cortinarius iodes sometimes grow singly, {{but more often}} scattered or in groups under hardwood trees, in humus and litterfall. Typical habitats include bog edges, swampy areas, and hummocks. Fruiting usually occurs from July to November. In North America, it is common in eastern regions, and rare in the Pacific Northwest. Its distribution extends from eastern Canada south into Central America and northern regions of South America. It also occurs in northern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii (formerly Boletus frostii), {{commonly}} known as Frost's bolete or the apple bolete, is a bolete fungus first described scientifically in 1874. A {{member of the family}} Boletaceae, the mushrooms produced by the fungus have tubes and pores instead of gills on the underside of their caps. Exsudoporus frostii is distributed in the eastern United States from Maine to Georgia, and in the southwest from Arizona extending south to Mexico and Costa Rica. A <b>mycorrhizal</b> species, its fruit bodies are typically found growing near hardwood trees, especially oak.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, <b>mycorrhizal</b> fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection, honey bees, bats and other animals pollinate flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sarcosphaera coronaria {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} saprobic, {{acquiring}} nutrients from breaking down decaying organic matter. The fungus, however, is only found with trees known to form mycorrhiza, and it is often locally abundant where it occurs, year after year in the same location, indicative of a <b>mycorrhizal</b> lifestyle. The results of a 2006 study of Pezizalean fungi further suggest that the species is an ectomycorrhizal symbiont, and more generally, that the Pezizales include more ectomycorrhizal fungi than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fungi are <b>mycorrhizal,</b> and {{are usually}} found in {{coniferous}} and mixed woods. Favored tree hosts include members of the Fagaceae and the Pinaceae. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly Europe and North America, but some species are also found in tropical Asia. Harrison identified a dozen new species from North America in the 1960s. Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus recognized 16 European species in his 1975 treatment of the genus, to which H. dianthifolium has been recently added by Loizides and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckii is an {{inedible}} (though not toxic) fungus, and {{a member}} of the genus Hydnellum of the family Bankeraceae. It is a hydnoid species, producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that hang from the undersurface of the fruit bodies. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). Hydnellum peckii is a <b>mycorrhizal</b> species, and forms mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of coniferous trees, growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses.|$|E
5|$|In North America, it {{is found}} mainly in areas east of the Mississippi River, but similar {{mushrooms}} also occur in the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Texas. Its range also stretches south into Mexico. They are ecologically <b>mycorrhizal,</b> and habitats include hardwood forests and coniferous forests. The mushroom grows alone, scattered, or in groups during summer and autumn. It is primarily eastern in distribution but also reported in the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Texas (with an apparent association with pecan trees).|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} <b>mycorrhizal</b> {{association}} with willow trees, {{and it is}} for this that the species is named. However, particular species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include beech and alder taxa. The mushrooms grow from the ground, often among mosses or detritus. I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, the species {{is a part of the}} section Marginatae. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Like all Tylopilus species, T.felleus is <b>mycorrhizal.</b> It {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. If encountered on calcareous (chalky) soil, {{it will be in}} moist areas that have become waterlogged and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined {{at the base of the}} stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine (a breakdown product of chitin, a major component of fungal cell walls). The <b>mycorrhizal</b> plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.|$|E
5|$|Like many morel species, the {{ecological}} mode of Morchella populiphila {{is not known}} with certainty, but it is suspected of being both saprobic (obtaining its nourishment from nonliving or decaying organic matter) and <b>mycorrhizal</b> (symbiotic with trees) at different stages in its life cycle. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in groups. It is found in Oregon to Nevada and northern California, where it grows on dried-out riverbeds. Fruiting, which occurs in the spring, tends to occur shortly after the emergence of Verpa mushrooms, and before the appearance of other morels.|$|E
