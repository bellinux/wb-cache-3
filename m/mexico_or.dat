5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages {{compared to other}} parts of the Spanish Empire such as <b>Mexico</b> <b>or</b> Peru, which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy.

5|$|The {{beginning}} of the hurricane season is most {{closely related to the}} timing of increases in sea surface temperatures, convective instability, and other thermodynamic factors.

Tropical systems usually form in the Gulf of <b>Mexico</b> <b>or</b> off the east coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|In Mesoamerica, wild {{teosinte}} {{was transformed}} through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize, more than 6,000 years ago. It gradually spread across North America {{and was the}} major crop of Native Americans {{at the time of}} European exploration. Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of locally domesticated squash and beans, while cocoa, also domesticated in the region, was a major crop. The turkey, {{one of the most important}} meat birds, was probably domesticated in <b>Mexico</b> <b>or</b> the U.S. Southwest.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Lactarius, Lactifluus and Russula are valued as {{excellent}} edible mushrooms. This {{is the case}} for example for the north temperate species Lactarius deliciosus, Lactifluus volemus, or Russula vesca, and other species are popular {{in other parts of the}} world, e.g. Lactarius indigo in <b>Mexico,</b> <b>or</b> Lactifluus edulis in tropical Africa. Some species, like Russula vesca, can even be eaten raw. The brittle texture of Russula fruitbodies makes them different from other mushrooms and is not appreciated by some.|$|E
5|$|Olid treated González and Las Casas more as honoured guests than as prisoners. Pedro de Briones' {{abandonment}} of Honduras {{resulted in a}} significant weakening of Olid's forces. Las Casas and González Dávila took advantage of this opportunity, and of Olid's excessive trust in his prisoners, to attack Olid and escape from their confinement. Once free, they expected support from Briones. Seizing their opportunity, González and Las Casas set upon Olid one evening and seriously wounded him. Olid managed to escape and hid in an Indian hut, but he was quickly found, and subjected to a rapid trial. Olid was executed by having his throat cut in the plaza at Naco. After the death of Olid, Spanish relations with the natives of Naco deteriorated notably. The Indians were increasingly unwilling to provide the Spanish with food and other supplies, {{and most of the}} Spanish abandoned the settlement and either returned to <b>Mexico</b> <b>or</b> resettled in other parts of Honduras. A court in Mexico subsequently condemned Las Casas and González Dávila for their execution of Olid, but neither was ever punished.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} peak strength, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted Hurricane Sergio {{to intensify}} further to reach winds of 120mph (195km/h). Shortly after peaking, the hurricane {{turned to the}} north and gradually weakened as wind shear from an upper-level trough to its northwest increased. By early on November 17, the low-cloud circulation became partially exposed {{on the west side of}} the deep convection, and it is estimated that Sergio weakened to a tropical storm later that day. A ridge to its north and northeast turned the storm to the northwest and later to the west as Sergio gradually weakened. Deep convection reformed near the center on November 18, resulting in a slight increase in winds, though vertical shear quickly weakened it again. Later that day, the storm made its closest approach to land, about 225miles (360km) southwest of Michoacán. Early on November 20 it degenerated into a tropical depression, and later that day Sergio dissipated about 360miles (580km) southwest of Manzanillo, <b>Mexico,</b> <b>or</b> about 320miles (515km) west-northwest of where it originally formed. The remnants of Sergio continued westward for about a day before the minimal amount of convection diminished.|$|E
5|$|With {{well-established}} outflow and {{low levels}} of wind shear, Erika strengthened as the circulation became better defined. A high pressure system persisted over the south-central United States, forcing the storm to move just south of due west at 25mph (40km/h). On August 15, convection organized into bands, and as its winds approached hurricane strength, an eye developed within the storm. Erika turned to the west-southwest on August 16, and attained hurricane status just prior to making landfall near Boca San Rafael, Tamaulipas in northeastern <b>Mexico,</b> <b>or</b> about 40miles (70km) south of the United States–Mexico border. The storm rapidly weakened over the mountainous Sierra Madre Oriental, and Erika dissipated early on August 17. The mid-level circulation maintained integrity as it crossed Mexico, and {{led to the formation of}} a tropical disturbance after entering the Gulf of California on August 18. It turned to the northwest and weakened on August 20.|$|E
