5|$|The {{peace treaty}} of the First Kappel War did not define {{the right of}} {{unhindered}} preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The Burgrecht cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Zurich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated {{an attack on the}} Five States. Bern took a <b>middle</b> <b>position</b> which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Zurich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Zurich urged its continuation and the Burgrecht cities began to quarrel among themselves.|$|E
5|$|As Zwingli {{was working}} on {{establishing}} these political alliances, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the Augsburg Diet to present their views {{so that he could}} make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, Memmingen, and Lindau produced the Tetrapolitan Confession. This document attempted to take a <b>middle</b> <b>position</b> between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the Burgrecht cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, Fidei ratio (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the Apostles' Creed. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, Johann Eck, counter-attacked with a publication, Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor.|$|E

As governor of the Union's largest state, Seymour was the most prominent Democratic opponent of the President for the next two years.

25|$|Childhood on the American {{frontier}} is contested territory. One {{group of}} scholars, {{following the lead}} of novelists Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder, argue the rural environment was beneficial to the child's upbringing. Historians Katherine Harris and Elliott West write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. On the other hand, historians Elizabeth Hampsten and Lillian Schlissel offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age.

40|$|Graphemic Output Buffer (GOB) {{disorder}} {{is defined as}} difficulty with the serial output of a sequence of letters in the output stage of the spelling process. In their rehabilitation study with a GOB patient, Sage and Ellis (2006) found that improvement on treated words generalised to untreated words from the same orthographic neighbourhoods as treated items, but not to other unrelated words. GOB patients frequently show a bow-shaped accuracy curve across letter positions, where letters at the <b>middle</b> <b>positions</b> are most error-prone. It may be that consistent letters at these <b>middle</b> letter <b>positions</b> across neighbourhoods modulate this effect. Spelling was treated using an Anagram and Copy Treatment (ACT) and generalisation to three untreated sets was examined: (1) neighbours of treated words with shared middle letters (e. g., clock-block), (2) neighbours with different medial position letters (e. g., clock-click), and (3) unrelated words (e. g., clock-puppy). Improvement was found for untreated neighbours with shared middle letters. There was no effect of training on the unrelated word set, and {{a negative impact on}} untreated neighbours with changed middle letters after the treatment. We attribute these results to top-down support from learned lexical representations, which facilitate spelling of untreated neighbours with shared middle letters but impede neighbours with changed middle letters. This latter result is attributed to interference from neighbours in the trained set strengthening competing letter representations at <b>middle</b> <b>positions...</b>|$|R

25|$|The role of Stephen III {{in these}} events is {{somewhat}} obscure. According to the historian Horace Mann, Stephen was an impotent observer, {{and that the}} responsible agent was in reality the Chartularius, Gratiosus. However, according to Louis Marie DeCormenin, Stephen was the key person responsible for issuing the orders, and took great delight in destroying his rival and his supporters. A <b>middle</b> <b>position</b> {{was taken by the}} historian Ferdinand Gregorovius, who observed that Stephen, while he may not have instigated or ordered the atrocities, did not seek to prevent them either, either through self-interest or the weakness of his position. What is clear however, is that the recent creation of the Papal States had seen the traditional rivalries of the ruling families of Rome transformed into a murderous desire to control this new temporal power in Italy, dragging the papacy with it.|$|E
25|$|Three {{approaches}} {{attempt to}} explain the Reign of Terror imposed by the Jacobins in 1793–94. The older Marxist interpretation argued the Terror was a necessary response to outside threats (in terms of other countries {{going to war with}} France) and internal threats (of traitors inside France threatening to frustrate the Revolution). In this interpretation, as expressed by the Marxist historian Albert Soboul, Robespierre and the sans-culottes were heroes for defending the revolution from its enemies. François Furet has argued that foreign threats {{had little to do with}} the terror. Instead, the extreme violence was an inherent part of the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries – their utopian goals required exterminating opposition. Soboul's Marxist interpretation has been largely abandoned by most historians since the 1990s. Hanson (2009) takes a <b>middle</b> <b>position,</b> recognising the importance of the foreign enemies, and sees the terror as a contingency that was caused by the interaction of a series of complex events and the foreign threat. Hanson says the terror was not inherent in the ideology of the Revolution, but that circumstances made it necessary.|$|E
