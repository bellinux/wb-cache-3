40|$|We {{propose that}} {{localized}} defects in <b>magnetic</b> <b>semiconductors</b> act as deep impurities {{and can be}} described by the Anderson model. Within this model, hybridization of d-orbitals and p-orbitals {{gives rise to a}} non-RKKY indirect exchange mechanism, when the localized d-electrons are exchanged through both conduction and valence bands. For semiconductors with indirect band gap the non-RKKY part of exchange integral is antiferromagnetic, which suppresses ferromagnetism. In case of direct band gap, this exchange mechanism can, under certain conditions, lead to enhancement of ferromagnetism. The indirect exchange intergral is much stronger than RKKY, and can be sufficiently long range. Thus, a potentially new class of high-temperature <b>magnetic</b> <b>semiconductors</b> emerges, where doped carriers are not necessary to mediate ferromagnetism. Curie temperatures in such <b>magnetic</b> <b>semiconductors</b> are determined mostly by the interaction between localized impurities, not Zener mechanism.

Story and co-workers where they demonstrated that the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of Mn2+-doped Pb1−xSnxTe can be controlled by the carrier concentration.

50|$|Gallium {{manganese}} arsenide is a <b>magnetic</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> It {{is based}} on the world's second favorite semiconductor, GaAs, and as such is readily compatible with existing semiconductor technologies. Differently from other dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs), such as the majority of those based on II-VI semiconductors, it is not paramagneticbut ferromagnetic, and hence exhibits hysteretic magnetization behavior. This memory effect is of importance for the creation of persistent devices. In (Ga,Mn)As, the manganese atoms provide a magnetic moment, and each also acts as an acceptor, making it a p-type material. The presence of carriers allows the material to be used for spin-polarized currents. In contrast, many other ferromagnetic DMSs are strongly insulatingand so do not possess free carriers. (Ga,Mn)As is therefore a candidate as a spintronic material.|$|E

50|$|As {{described}} for the mineral pyrite, {{the assignment of}} formal oxidation states (or charges) to the atoms that constitute covellite is deceptive. The formula might seem to suggest the description Cu2+, S2−. In fact the atomic structure shows that copper and sulfur each adopt two different geometries. However photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetic and electrical properties all indicate the absence of Cu2+ (d9) ions. In contrast to the oxide CuO the material is not a <b>magnetic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> but a metallic conductor with weak Pauli-paramagnetism. Thus, the mineral is better described as consisting of Cu+ and S− rather than (Cu2+ and S2−). As happens in the pyrite structure the non-closed shell S− undergoes pairing to form S22−, but interestingly this only holds for 2/3 of the sulfur atoms. The other 1/3 remains unpaired and together with Cu atoms forms hexagonal layers reminiscent of the boron nitride (graphite structure). Thus a description Cu+3S−S22− would seem appropriate with a delocalized hole in the valence band leading to metallic conductivity. Later bandstructure calculations however indicate that the hole is more localized on the sulfur pairs than on the unpaired sulfur. This means that Cu+3S2−S2− with a mixed sulfur oxidation state -2 and -1/2 is more appropriate. There is a precedence for that in the (synthetic) pyrite CuS2 that should also be seen mostly as Cu+S2− producing a Pauli-paramagnetic metallic conductor rather than a semiconductor with strong magnetic properties.
