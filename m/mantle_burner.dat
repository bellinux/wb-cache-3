5|$|Europa Lighthouse {{was inaugurated}} on 1 August 1841 {{in a brief}} {{ceremony}} witnessed by about 10,000 people. The first upgrade of the lighthouse occurred in 1864, when the single-wick lamp was replaced with a Chance Brothers four-wick burner, with further changes in 1875 and in 1894 when the amount of light emitted was increased. A three incandescent <b>mantle</b> <b>burner</b> was added in 1905. Following further modernisation in the 20th century, the lighthouse was fully automated in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent <b>mantle</b> <b>burner</b> in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{light source}} was a concentric six wick kerosene burner with an intensity of 145,000 cd. This was replaced in 1922 by a vapourised kerosene <b>mantle</b> <b>burner</b> with an intensity of 500,000 cd.|$|E
50|$|In 1908, Victor S. Johnson, Sr. a soap salesman, in Chicago, IL, became {{interested}} in kerosene <b>mantle</b> <b>burners.</b> Dissatisfied with the available kerosene lamps of the time, Johnson began selling US made mantle lamps. He incorporated his lamp sales business and called the company the Mantle Lamp Company of America. In 1912 the company began manufacturing mantle lamps that gave off a steady white light without smoke. They called these lamps Aladdin lamps after the magical lamp and wish-granting genie in the childrenâ€™s story.|$|R

5000|$|In 1968, the {{installation}} of a 4th Order electrically operated revolving optic replaced the original 2nd Order optic with a pressurised vapour kerosene [...] "Hood" [...] <b>mantle</b> <b>burner.</b> The light source was changed to a 100-volt/1,000-watt incandescent bulb producing 350,000 candelas of light intensity with a visibility range of [...] The power supply came {{from one of the}} three generators installed in a generator room built close to the keeper's room. As the rotation was electrically driven by motors, the crew was reduced to four men.|$|E

Pulau Satumu means [...] "one tree island" [...] - sa refers to satu ("one") and tumu is the Malay name for the large mangrove tree, Bruguiera confugata. The light source was a wick burner which was replaced in 1905 by a pressurised vapour kerosene <b>mantle</b> <b>burner</b> to increase the light intensity for a greater visible range. A 2nd Order optic was mounted on a roller carriage to allow for smooth rotation. (The Order is a system of classifying the type of lenses used based on the focal length of the lens). This roller carriage was a weight-driven machine {{which had to be}} rewound manually to lift the weight whenever it reached the base. The rewinding was done hourly. A crew of seven men was required to man the lighthouse.|$|E
