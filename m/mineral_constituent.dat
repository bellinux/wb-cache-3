Electrophoresis, the transport of electrically charged particles, immersed in a suspension medium, by a direct current field (Bier, 1959), was employed in this study as a means of separating simulated lunar soil into its <b>constituent</b> <b>minerals.</b> In these tests, conducted in a static analytical cylindrical microelectrophoresis apparatus, samples of simulated lunar soil and samples of pure <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> were placed in the chamber; the electrophoretic mobilities of the lunar soil and the individual <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> were measured.

50|$|Detrital zircon geochronology is {{the science}} of {{analyzing}} the age of zircons deposited within a specific sedimentary unit by examining their inherent radioisotopes, most commonly the uranium-lead ratio. The chemical name of zircon is zirconium silicate and its corresponding chemical formula is Zr SiO4. Zircon is a common accessory or trace <b>mineral</b> <b>constituent</b> of most granite and felsic igneous rocks. Due to its hardness, durability and chemical inertness, zircon persists in sedimentary deposits and is a common constituent of most sands. Zircons contain trace amounts of uranium and thorium and can be dated using several modern analytical techniques. It has become increasingly popular in geological studies from the 2000s mainly due to the advancement in radiometric dating techniques. Detrital zircon age data {{can be used to}} constrain the maximum depositional age, determine provenance, and reconstruct the tectonic setting on a regional scale.|$|E
5000|$|During {{one of his}} voyages to the Alps of Tyrol (today part {{of northeastern}} Italy) De Dolomieu {{discovered}} a calcareous rock which, unlike limestone, did not effervesce with weak hydrochloric acid. He published these observations in 1791 in the well-known French science magazine [...] "Journal de Physique". In March 1792, the rock was named dolomie (or dolomite, in English) by Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure. Today both the rock and its major <b>mineral</b> <b>constituent</b> bear the name of De Dolomieu, as do the Dolomites, the mountain range of northeastern Italy. De Dolomieu {{was not the first}} to describe the mineral dolomite. Most probably it was Linnaeus, who was the first to note the fact that this rock resembled limestone but does not effervesce with dilute acid. In his book [...] "Oryctographia Carniola, oder physikalische Erdbeschreibung des Herzogthums Krain, Istrien und zum Theil der benachbarten Länder", published by J. G. I. Breitkopf, Leipzig in 1778, the Austrian naturalist Belsazar Hacquet also observed this distinction between limestone and a rock that Hacquet described as lapis suillus. The two men met in Laibach in 1784, when De Dolomieu visited Sigmund Zois. However, Hacquet was well {{aware of the fact that}} the description of a limestone that would not effervesce with acid (and therefore had to be different from normal limestone) by the famous Carolus Linnaeus in 1768 preceded his own. On p. 5 of the second volume of his [...] "Oryctographia Carniola", which appeared in 1781, Hacquet stated that the white powder he had found near the town of Vorle ("unterm Teil der Oberkrain") a white powder that strongly resembled limestone but would not react with dilute hydrochloric acid, reminded him of the Marmor Tardum described by Linnaeus.|$|E

30|$|And {{moreover}} different <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> in {{the same}} microwave field are heated to different extent due to their different dielectric properties. And in addition, different <b>mineral</b> <b>constituents</b> have different thermal expansion coefficients and may cause thermal strain on their interfaces and fissures accordingly, which will be helpful for desulfurization agent to penetrate into the coal (Hayashi et al. 1990; Marland et al. 1998). And the response of sulphide minerals to microwaves is much stronger than that of coal matrix and quartz. Pyrites tightly embedded in the coal will tend to have fissures under microwave irradiation to allow the monomers to be dissociated, which will improve the reaction between pyrite and desulfurization agent (Marland et al. 2000).|$|R

Vancomycin HCl did not bind to HA (HA binding index = 0), whereas BT 2 -peg 2 -vancomycin diacetate showed appreciable binding to hydroxyapatite (HA binding index = 57). This suggests that vancomycin does not attach to HA {{but that it is}} the bone-targeting moiety which is attached to the parent vancomycin molecule by polyethelene glycol linkage (Figure  1) which is responsible for BT 2 -peg 2 -vancomycin’s ability to bind to the <b>mineral</b> <b>constituent</b> of bone.|$|E

30|$|The {{ground water}} {{suitability}} for irrigation is {{contingent on the}} effects of their <b>mineral</b> <b>constituent</b> in water on both soil and plants (Richards 1954).
