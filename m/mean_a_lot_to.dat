500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] was {{met with}} mainly {{positive}} reviews from contemporary music critics. Lucy Davis from BBC Music wrote that the song [...] "might <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> some, those with the tiresome self defence lyrics should go [...] when she gets on with the singing, there's nothing to prove". Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani deemed [...] "Oh Mother" [...] a [...] "lovely" [...] piano and string melody [...] "that we're offered a reprieve". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic was also positive toward [...] "Oh Mother", commenting that [...] "another ode to her single mother and middle-finger to her abusive father, is yet more proof that Aguilera works best when the subject matter actually means something to her, when the song {{is more than just}} something to sing". Spence D. for IGN was positive toward the song's meaning, writing that it [...] "resonates with a bittersweet energy that helps it rise above the standard young pop queen fare of the day". musicOMH's John Murray was not impressed with the song, calling it [...] "good" [...] but saying that it would [...] "just make the bad moments feel so much worse". Digital Spy critic Nick Levine provided a negative review, giving it a two out of five stars rating and calling it [...] "tremulous" [...] with a [...] "vibrato-fuelled conclusion". He also compared [...] "Oh Mother" [...] to Madonna's song [...] "Oh Father" [...] (1989) for the same sad melody as well as the same theme of child abuse.|$|E

[...] He explained that Tony is unaware of Cindy's true nature although he did suspect Cindy to be manipulating him for a while. Pickard added that Cindy will [...] "want to get married as soon as possible before Tony can change his mind".

Despite her plans, Pickard felt Cindy has [...] "some feelings" [...] for Tony. He felt that Tony has [...] "fallen for her, yes. It surprises him but she's started to <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> him. Cindy's smart and sexy and they're good together". Pickard felt that if his character discovered Cindy and Darren Osborne's (Ashley Taylor Dawson) plans to scam him he would be [...] "furious but also he'd be really down about it. It would upset him to think they were trying to con him but he'd be angry with himself for being so gullible". He added that [...] "Tony thinks [...] never have agreed to marry him if Darren still meant something to her".|$|E

2500|$|The sixth track, [...] "I", {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "moody-electro" [...] and a [...] "dark pop" [...] track. It opens with an Eastern-style introduction which merges into a [...] "romantic synth" [...] part, with Roberts singing [...] "I’m scared to wake up one day and find out that my bubble's burst" [...] and hoping that [...] "everyone loves" [...] her new direction, as well as mentioning her dislike for [...] "people that leave comments on the internet". The track has been compared to songs by Lily Allen, Goldfrapp and Kylie Minogue. The next track is a cover of The Korgis' [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime". Roberts explained the inclusion of the track on the album saying [...] "The lyrics <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> me. I identified with the song in general. It might not be powerful to everybody, but it's powerful to me. I wanted to do it, I love the song."

The final track [...] "Sticks + Stones" [...] describes a time when she would beg her driver to buy her vodka despite being underage, in relation to the subject matter Roberts explained [...] "How funny that I was too young for so many things, yet you thought I'd cope with being told I'm ugly, Over and over". Roberts explained the concept of the track, noting [...] "What it is with Sticks + Stones is I wanted all the people out there who hurt like that to know that they’re not the only ones in that position. Sometimes there's so many people in the world suffering from the same thing or hurting from the same thing, but they feel like they’re on their own. I wanted a song that could highlight the subject so it was like, actually I’m so not on my own here."

6000|$|Both girls rose {{early that}} last day, {{and went with}} their father to Communion. As Gratian had said to George: [...] "It's nothing to me now, but it will <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> him out there, as a memory of us. So I must go." [...] And he had answered: [...] "Quite right, my dear. Let him have all he can get of you both to-day. I'll keep out of the way, and be back the last thing at night." [...] Their father's smile when he saw them waiting for him went {{straight}} to both their hearts. It was a delicious day, and the early freshness had not yet dried out of the air, when they were walking home to breakfast. Each girl had slipped a hand under his arm. 'It's like Moses or was it Aaron?' Noel thought absurdly Memory had complete hold of her. All the old days! Nursery hours on Sundays after tea, stories out of the huge Bible bound in mother-o'pearl, with photogravures of the Holy Land--palms, and hills, and goats, and little Eastern figures, and funny boats on the Sea of Galilee, and camels--always camels. The book would be on his knee, and they one on each arm of his chair, waiting eagerly for the pages to be turned so that a new picture came. And {{there would be the}} feel of his cheek, prickly against theirs; and the old names with the old glamour--to Gratian, Joshua, Daniel, Mordecai, Peter; to Noel Absalom because of his hair, and Haman because she liked the sound, and Ruth because she was pretty and John because he leaned on Jesus' breast. Neither of them cared for Job or David, and Elijah and Elisha they detested because they hated the name Eliza. And later days by firelight in the drawing-room, roasting chestnuts just before evening church, and telling ghost stories, and trying to make Daddy eat his share. And hours beside him at the piano, each eager for her special hymns--for Gratian, [...] "Onward, Christian Soldiers," [...] "Lead, Kindly Light," [...] and [...] "O God Our Help"; for Noel, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee," [...] the one with [...] "The Hosts of Midian" [...] in it, and [...] "For Those in Peril on the Sea." [...] And carols! Ah! And Choristers! Noel had loved one deeply--the word [...] "chorister" [...] was so enchanting; and because of his whiteness, and hair which had no grease on it, but stood up all bright; she had never spoken to him--a far worship, like that for a star. And always, always Daddy had been gentle; sometimes angry, but always gentle; and they sometimes not at all! And mixed up with it all, the dogs they had had, and the cats they had had, and the cockatoo, and the governesses, and their red cloaks, and the curates, and the pantomimes, and [...] "Peter Pan," [...] and [...] "Alice in Wonderland"--Daddy sitting between them, so that one could snuggle up. And later, the school-days, the hockey, the prizes, the holidays, the rush into his arms; and the great and wonderful yearly exodus to far places, fishing and bathing; walks and drives; rides and climbs, always with him. And concerts and Shakespeare plays in the Christmas and Easter holidays; and the walk home through the streets--all lighted in those days--one on each side of him. And this was the end! They waited on him at breakfast: they kept stealing glances at him, photographing him in their minds. Gratian got her camera and did actually photograph him in the morning sunlight with Noel, without Noel, with the baby; against all regulations for the defence of the realm. It was Noel who suggested: [...] "Daddy, let's take lunch out and go for all day on the cliffs, us three, and forget there's a war." ...|$|E
