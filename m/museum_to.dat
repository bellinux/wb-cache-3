40|$|This paper {{uses the}} UK {{as a case}} study to explore the urgent need for <b>museums</b> <b>to</b> develop {{strategies}} for the retention of 'core' museum audiences – the well-educated professionals and their families and friends who currently represent around 70 % of museum attendance. It is a 'provocation' in four parts: the failure of <b>museums</b> <b>to</b> attract enough of this audience; an out-of-date display model and mind-set; the need for <b>museums</b> <b>to</b> rebrand themselves as social and leisure destinations; and a call for <b>museums</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge through their actions that their relationship with their audiences has changed. The failure of <b>museums</b> <b>to</b> react adequately to incremental change in western society {{since the end of the}} Second World War sits at the heart of the paper. Their response in the past has invariably been piecemeal, but what is required now is root and branch change. The alternative is that many museums will not survive...|$|R

5|$|Also {{on display}} is a burden basket created by basketmaker Sophie George {{in the design}} of the baskets used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley.

A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum and located on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the semaphore signals stop and approach.|$|E
