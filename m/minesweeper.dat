5|$|The , a , {{was named}} {{in his honor}} in 1942. This vessel participated in the European and Pacific theaters of {{operations}} during the Second World War. She was later converted to a high speed <b>minesweeper.</b>|$|E
5|$|By March, {{the newly}} {{converted}} submarine had begun laying mines off the French coast. The French Navy trawler Elisabeth struck one of UB-12s mines off Calais on 13 March and sank. Five days later, the British auxiliary <b>minesweeper</b> Duchess of Montrose sank {{with a loss}} of 12 men after detonating a mine laid by UB-12 off Gravelines.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, the RAN's combat {{strength}} numbered 150 {{ships with}} an additional 200 auxiliary craft with the service reaching its peak in June 1945, when it ranks swelled to 39,650 personnel. During the six years of war, the RAN lost three cruisers, four destroyers, two sloops, a corvette, and an auxiliary <b>minesweeper</b> to enemy action. Casualties included 1,740 personnel from the 19 ships sunk, and another 436 personnel killed aboard other ships or at other posts. By most measures, such losses were heavy for such a small service, representing over half its pre-war strength in ships and one-fifth in men. Against this the RAN destroyed one cruiser, an armed merchant raider, three destroyers or torpedo boats, a <b>minesweeper,</b> many light craft and seven submarines. It also destroyed or captured more than 150,000 tons of Axis merchant shipping and shot down {{more than a hundred}} aircraft. Although difficult to quantify the RAN also played a role in numerous other successes.|$|E

5|$|During March, in {{preparation}} for the landings on the peninsula, Robinson led four sorties into the extensive sea minefields around the beaches and bays of Gallipoli. On one of these, his <b>minesweeper</b> was struck by small calibre shells 84 times and the other operations were scarcely less dangerous but, in spite of the Turkish resistance, Robinson was able to clear wide lanes for the invasion forces.|$|E
5|$|Task Force O, {{commanded}} by Rear Admiral John L. Hall, Jr., was the naval component responsible for transporting the troops across the channel and landing {{them on the}} beaches. The task force comprised four assault groups, a support group, a bombarding force, a <b>minesweeper</b> group, eight patrol craft, and three anti-submarine trawlers, numbering in total 1028 vessels.|$|E
5|$|The RNSB also {{operated}} the 118th <b>Minesweeper</b> Flotilla, composed of MMS-class minesweepers, from Harwich from 1943. The 118th {{served in the}} English Channel and North Sea clearing paths through German minefields. In November 1944, the flotilla was involved in clearing the Scheldt Estuary to the Belgian port of Antwerp to enable it {{to be used by}} the Allies.|$|E
50|$|The Bay-class <b>minesweepers,</b> {{also known}} as the Gaspé-class <b>minesweepers,</b> were a class of <b>minesweepers</b> {{operated}} by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and Canadian Forces (CF) during the Cold War. Their design was similar to the British s.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, River-class <b>minesweepers,</b> , , , and [...] were {{assigned}} to the Northern Ireland Squadron where they replaced Ton-class <b>minesweepers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Port <b>minesweepers</b> were {{organised}} {{into their own}} flotillas. Eleven new Castle-class <b>minesweepers</b> joined the Port flotillas on completion, 1943-1944.|$|R
5|$|The Take Ichi convoy resumed {{its journey}} to New Guinea on 1 May. Its {{composition}} was now eight transports (one of the Manila-bound transports having replaced Yoshida Maru) {{under the protection}} of Shirataka, Asakaze, Shiratsuyu, <b>minesweeper</b> W-22, CH-37 and CH-38. The convoy took a special route planned by the Third Southern Expeditionary Fleet {{to reduce the risk of}} submarine attack.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the treaty}} was signed, German {{soldiers}} had already entered {{the port of}} Klaipėda. Adolf Hitler, on board the cruiser Deutschland, personally toured the city and gave a short speech. The armada sailing to Klaipėda included the cruiser Admiral Graf Spee, the light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, and Köln, two destroyer squadrons, three torpedo boat flotillas, and one tender flotilla. At the time the Lithuanian navy had only one warship, the Prezidentas Smetona, a 580-ton converted <b>minesweeper.</b> While the Germans were celebrating {{the return of the}} city, European politicians expressed fears that the Free City of Danzig would be Hitler's next target.|$|E
5|$|Hessen {{served in}} the fleet from 1925 to 12 November 1934, when she was {{withdrawn}} and converted into a target ship. Conversion work lasted from 31 March 1935 to 1 April 1937, when she was recommissioned as a target. She served in this capacity until 1945; {{at the end of}} World War II, she was renamed Tsel and ceded to the Soviet Union. The ship was eventually scrapped in the 1960s. Preussen saw active service with the fleet as a <b>minesweeper</b> depot ship from 1919 to 5 April 1929, when she was stricken from the navy list. The ship was sold for breaking on 25 February 1931 for 216,800Mark, and scrapped in Wilhelmshaven. A 63m (68.9yd) section of the hull was kept for use as a torpedo target and other explosives. The hull section was bombed and sunk by Allied aircraft in April 1945. The wreck was eventually raised and scrapped in 1954. Lothringen was also converted into a <b>minesweeper</b> depot ship, and she served in this capacity from 1922 to 1926. The ship was stricken on 31 March 1931, sold for scrapping for 269,650Marks, and broken up by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.|$|E
5000|$|... 5th Minesweeping Squadron in Olpenitz, between 1988 and 1991 the squadron's Schütze-class fast <b>minesweepers</b> were {{replaced}} with Hameln-class fast <b>minesweepers</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Starting in mid-1962, the U.S. Navy began {{conducting}} {{electronic surveillance}} operations {{conducted by a}} division of ocean-going <b>minesweepers</b> (MSO) operating {{along the coast of}} North and South Vietnam. The <b>minesweepers</b> were equipped with portable vans containing highly sophisticated electronic surveillance equipment. The <b>minesweepers</b> fueled on occasion at a South Vietnamese fueling station located near the fishing port (DaNang) and took on evidence from CIA operatives which allegedly tended to prove that China and Russia were supplying the Viet Cong with weapons and other material. Occasionally, usually between midnight and 3 am, DRVN gunboats would approach the <b>minesweepers</b> at high speed and then peel off and return to a DRVN naval base operating on an island north of the 30th parallel. The gunboats made threatening maneuvers but never actually attacked the <b>minesweepers.</b> The maneuvers were reported to CINC Pac Fleet and the Pentagon in nightly Top Secret cryptograph messages. The <b>minesweepers</b> were essentially defenseless should an attack occur. In early 1963, the <b>minesweepers</b> were relieved by a division of destroyers (the DESOTO patrols) who appear to have carried out the same electronic surveillance operations conducted by the <b>minesweepers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The initial {{fleet of}} the navy {{consisted}} of two Ham class <b>minesweepers,</b> GNS Yogaga and GNS Afadzato. They were re-commissioned on 31 October 1959. They were joined by four T43-class <b>minesweepers</b> from the Soviet Union between 1961-64, three Komar-class missile boats between 1962-65 and another in 1980, and two Yurka-class <b>minesweepers</b> in 1981-82.|$|R
5|$|It {{was felt}} that too long had elapsed {{in both cases}} between the German {{warships}} being spotted {{and the arrival of}} the strike force, and to rectify matters, it was decided to carry out reconnaissance in force, with formations of bombers being sent out over the North Sea to find and attack German warships. Their orders forbade them from attacking ships in port, infringing neutral airspace or even attacking German warships escorting merchant ships. A patrol on 29 September resulted in five Hampdens being shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109s, of II./JG 77, but an attack by 24 Wellingtons of No. 149, No. 38 Squadron RAF and No. 115 Squadron RAF on 3 December was more successful, claiming a German <b>minesweeper</b> sunk (confirmed by German archives), while defensive fire from the Wellington gun turrets repelled attacks by German fighters, shooting one down without loss to the bombers. The German pilot shot down was future German ace Günther Specht. He was shot down by Corporal Copley of No. 38 Squadron RAF. The German ships were the Brummer and the <b>minesweeper</b> M1407 both sunk by unexploded bombs passing through the ship. A German report stated the attack was cleverly executed from out of the sun and delivered to avoid the nearby civilian areas.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} {{the onset of the}} first World War, four new ships were purchased: Bermagui, Bonandera, Bodalla and Bergalia. Bodalla was requisitioned for the war effort and {{repurposed}} as a <b>minesweeper,</b> and she was lost in 1924. After the war the company purchased another three vessels: Nergalia, Cobargo and Kianga. Two of these three boats, Nergalia and Kianga, were requisitioned during World War II, but while both survived the hostilities, Kianga was not returned to the company after being decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April 1941, Sheean {{enlisted in}} the Royal Australian Naval Reserve. He had {{followed}} in the steps of five of his brothers who had already joined the armed forces—four in the Australian Army {{and one in the}} Royal Australian Navy—for service in the Second World War. Sheean was initially posted to the Hobart naval base HMAS Derwent for training, where he gained a period of seafaring experience aboard HMAS Coombar, an auxiliary <b>minesweeper,</b> from 17–31 December. On finishing his initial training course, Sheean was attached to the Flinders Naval Depot in Western Port, Victoria, for further instruction from 11 February 1942.|$|E
50|$|The company's Inch Yard was {{responsible}} for building both civil and naval vessels, some for the Royal Navy, including Hunt class <b>minesweepers</b> and Racecourse class <b>minesweepers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Kiiski class <b>minesweepers</b> (Ruffe) are {{a series}} of seven small <b>minesweepers</b> of the Finnish Navy. The ships were {{constructed}} in 1975 and were modernized in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|On 24 June, {{during the}} {{preliminary}} bombardment, the minesweeping force of which Thunder was a member, arrived off Point Barfleur in mid-afternoon. German shore-based gunfire began {{to splash down}} around the <b>minesweepers</b> after an hour, leading the escorting United States Navy destroyers to deploy a smokescreen and order the <b>minesweepers</b> to cut sweeps and retire. The following day during the assault, the <b>minesweepers</b> were deployed again. Shore-based gunfire began raining down on the <b>minesweepers</b> again. Thunder was hit by shrapnel from a near miss and the destroyers were once again forced to lay a smokescreen.|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9February, two New Zealand-crewed Beaufighters from No.489 Squadron {{conducted}} a patrol of the Norwegian coast. These aircraft first sighted a 1,500-ton merchant ship in Stong Fjord. Continuing north, they were surprised to find a Narvik-class destroyer accompanied by a <b>minesweeper</b> and two flak ships in Førde Fjord. The aircraft continued their patrol and spotted five large merchant ships in the Nord Gulen and two minesweepers and a flak ship near Bremanger. Despite the pilots' surprise, the Allied command was aware that Z33 was in the area from Ultra signals intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Operation Trident and the {{follow-up}} Operation Python were offensive operations {{launched by the}} Indian Navy on Pakistan's port city of Karachi during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Operation Trident saw the first use of anti-ship missiles in combat in the region. The operation {{was conducted on the}} night of 4–5 December and inflicted heavy damage on Pakistani vessels and facilities. While India suffered no losses, Pakistan lost a <b>minesweeper,</b> a destroyer, a cargo vessel carrying ammunition, and fuel storage tanks in Karachi. Another destroyer was also badly damaged and eventually scrapped. India celebrates its Navy Day annually on 4 December to mark this operation.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{had a few}} anti-shipping naval units such as 4.(St)/TrGr 186 to {{deal with}} Polish naval forces. This unit {{performed}} effectively, sinking the 1540-ton destroyer Wicher and the minelayer Gryf of the Polish Navy (both moored in a harbour). The torpedo boat Mazur (412 tons) was sunk at Oksywie; the gunboat General Haller (441 tons) was sunk in Hel Harbour on 6 September—during the Battle of Hel—along with the <b>minesweeper</b> Mewa (183 tons) and its sister ships Czapla and Jaskolka with several auxiliaries. The Polish naval units trapped in the Baltic were destroyed by Ju 87 operations.|$|E
50|$|By 1930 the s {{which had}} been re-designated as <b>minesweepers</b> in November 1922 were coming {{to the end of}} their {{effective}} service lives. In 1935, all three remaining <b>minesweepers</b> active in the Royal Canadian Navy were laid up. In the naval estimates of the 1936 budget, provision was made to replace two of the Battle class with two new, modern <b>minesweepers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Then on 23 December 1940 the Port <b>minesweepers</b> were separated, and the {{remaining}} <b>minesweepers</b> were organised into the 25th Minesweeping Flotilla. This name aligned with the flotilla names used by the Royal Navy. The makeup of this flotilla changed {{during the course of}} the war, as new <b>minesweepers</b> were commissioned, others sunk or withdrawn for repairs or refitting, and requirements changed.|$|R
50|$|The BYMS {{class was}} {{a class of}} wooden motor <b>minesweepers,</b> part of the US Navy YMS Yard class <b>minesweepers.</b> 150 ships destined for UK were {{launched}} from 1941 to 1943.|$|R
5|$|The Support Group {{operated}} {{a mixture of}} gun, rocket, flak, tank, and smoke landing craft, totaling 67 vessels. The <b>Minesweeper</b> Group comprised four flotillas, the 4th comprising nine Royal Navy minesweepers; the 31st comprising nine minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy; the 104th comprising ten Royal Navy inshore minesweepers; and the 167th comprising ten Royal Navy coastal minesweepers. Bombarding Force C comprised two battleships, three cruisers (two Free French and one Royal Navy), and 13 destroyers (three of which were provided by the Royal Navy).|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{operational}} again in December and {{she returned to}} Norway, together with Lützow, in time to participate in Operation Regenbogen, an attempt to intercept Convoy JW 51B sailing from the UK to the Soviet Union in late December. After the convoy was spotted {{on the morning of}} 31 December. Theodor Riedel, Lützow, and two other destroyers were tasked to engage the convoy while Admiral Hipper and three other destroyers attempted to occupy the attention of the convoy's escort. The Germans failed to press home their attack and only sank one destroyer, a <b>minesweeper</b> and damage one merchantman while losing one of their own destroyers.|$|E
5|$|April {{found two}} more victims added to UB-12s tally. On the 20th, Nepaulin, another British {{auxiliary}} <b>minesweeper</b> was lost {{on one of}} UB-12s mines near the Dyck Lightvessel. Six days later, the British steamer Alhama was mined while loaded with pit props destined for Dunkirk. The 1,744-ton cargo ship was the largest ship sunk by UB-12 since the Silksworth Hall, sunk the previous April. UB-12 sank another two ships under Steindorff's command, one each in June and July. The steamer Dulwich—carrying coal from Seaham for London—was mined and sunk {{with the loss of}} five men on 10 June. One month later, the French patrol vessel Jupiter I was mined off Calais. These were the last two ships credited to mines from UB-12 for the next fourteen months.|$|E
50|$|The Adroit class <b>minesweepers</b> were a {{class of}} United States Navy s {{completed}} as <b>minesweepers.</b> However, they were considered unsatisfactory in this role, and were all eventually converted back into submarine chasers.|$|R
50|$|The Ahven class <b>minesweepers</b> (Perch) was {{a series}} of six <b>minesweepers</b> of the Finnish Navy. The ships were {{constructed}} in 1937 at the Turun veneveistämö shipyard and saw service during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|The M {{class were}} the first <b>minesweepers</b> of the Royal Netherlands Navy. The need for <b>minesweepers</b> for the Dutch marine came during the First World War when sea mines were laid in great numbers.|$|R
