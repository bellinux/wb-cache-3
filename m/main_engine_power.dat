The requirements for the container vessels have been modified and changed compared with the ships built in the eighties of the past century. The ships capacity have been increased up to and even above 10 000 twenty feet containers (TEU) with the service speed above 25 knots. For such a giant sea going vessels with the overall length above 300 meters and draught above 10 meters the ship hull resistance characteristics have been modified. Those conditions bring to the situation where the propulsion power for the seagoing ships reached 80 MW. The estimation of the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> relation in the preliminary design stage is the main aim of the paper. The problem is such important as in that stage the most important design decisions with relatively low investment costs are determined.

40|$|In early 2008 FSG {{has started}} to design a 142 m long RoRo-vessel {{intended}} {{to operate in the}} Irish sea. The layout of the ports of call restrict the length and the draft of the vessel significantly (LOA<= 142 m, T< 5. 2 m). So the hullform design of the twin-screw vessel with it’s four decks and a design speed of 21 knots (FN= 0. 29) was very challenging resulting in a relatively high block coefficient. Using FSG’s potential flow CFD-methods and simulating dozens of hull forms this target has been reached with a <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of 2 x 8000 kW only.

In order to optimise the wake field to achieve an acceptable propeller cavitation pattern and low induced pressure pulses, the appendages have been arranged together with TUHH using RANS-methods. Various arrangements have been simulated in an early design stage before the model tests. The angles of the inner and upper shaft bracket have been aligned to the flow in order to minimise velocity gradients in the propeller plane.

At the time of eight months after undocking in 2009, the ship speed reduced by 0. 5 knot (5 %) at half ahead and reduced by 0. 7 knot (5 %) at full ahead.

The average annual income of a fishing man is much higher than the average personal income on the national scale, corresponding to 156 % in 2007. The offshore gillnet fishery could be attracted labour as well as investment in the future. The analysis has demonstrated that a gillnet vessel in the group of vessels with <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> upper than 90 hp has higher annual gross revenue, income, and net profit than the rest group. Impacts of engine power and hull length have also significant for vessel group with smaller 90 hp engine power.

40|$|AbstractWind is a {{renewable}} energy source that is freely available on the world’s oceans. As shipping faces the challenge of reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and cutting its carbon emissions this paper seeks to explore the potential for harnessing wind power for shipping. Numerical models of two wind power technologies, a Flettner rotor and a towing kite, are linked with wind data along a set of five trade routes. Wind-generated thrust and propulsive power are computed {{as a function of}} local wind and ship velocity. The average wind power contribution on a given route ranges between 193 kW and 373 kW for a single Flettner rotor and between 127 kW and 461 kW for the towing kite. The variability of the power output from the Flettner rotor is shown to be smaller than that from the towing kite while, due to the different dependencies on wind speed and direction, the average power contribution from a Flettner rotor is higher than that from the kite on some routes and lower on others. While for most forms of international cargo shipping wind may not be suitable as the sole source of propulsive energy, a comparison of average output to <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> requirements of typical vessels serving the routes indicates that it could deliver a significant share. For instance, installing three Flettner rotors on a 5500 dwt general cargo carrier could, on average, provide {{more than half of the}} power required by the main engine under typical slow steaming conditions. Uncertainties and simplifying assumptions underlying the model analysis are discussed and implications of the results are considered in light of the urgent need for decarbonisation. This paper demonstrates the significant opportunities for step jump emissions reductions that wind technologies have to offer. It outlines next steps towards realising the potential, highlighting a demand for more detailed studies on socio-economic and technical barriers to implementation, and providing a basis for research into step-change emissions reductions in the shipping sector...|$|E

40|$|Around 90 % {{of global}} trade is {{carried by sea}} 1 due to the reason {{that it is the}} most {{economical}} and fuel efficient mode of cargo transportation. The total trade volume is increasing throughout the last century for the same reason. On the other hand according to the Green House Gas study by IMO, International Maritime Organization in 2000, ships engaged in international trade in 1996 contributed about 1. 8 % of the total world’s CO 2 emissions which is approximated as 2. 7 % in 20072. At the present trend, this percentage could go two or three times higher from the present by 20503. In order to control this CO 2 emission from shipping, IMO has developed the first ever global CO 2 reduction index in the world, known as EEDI, Energy Efficiency Design Index. The basic formulation of EEDI is based on the ratio of total CO 2 emission per tonne. mile. As CO 2 depends upon fuel consumption and fuel consumption depends upon the total power requirements, eventually this EEDI formulation has certain impact on ship design parameters and hydrodynamics. At this point SSPA Sweden AB 4 wanted to have an in depth knowledge about the background of EEDI, other indexes (except EEDI) for reducing CO 2 emission developed by other organizations, formulations of different indexes and working method, impact of EEDI on ship design and the hydrodynamics. In order to find the impact on ship design and hydrodynamics, parametric analyses of ship is accomplished for different ship types such as Bulk Carrier, Tanker, Container vessel etc. A simple tool has been developed to calculate resistance and power with Holtrop & Mennen, 1982 method. Using the tool the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> is predicted after calculating the resistance and finally EEDI is calculated with the current IMO formulation.

An effort was also made to analyse the criticism against the present EEDI formulation, guideline and reference line, as it is quite a heavy debate now, whether this implementation will really reduce the CO 2 emission or not...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{internal}} combustion engines {{fired with natural gas}} offer comparatively low installation costs, long life, good efficiency characteristics, and show reliable performance in power applications. Additional positive {{features such as}} short delivery times, quick start-up, and retained high efficiency at part-loads have made gas engines the preferred choice for many small- to medium-scale power plants. Wärtsilä’s gas engine portfolio offers several well-proven engine models optimised for stationary power applications in the size range from 4 to 8. 7 MWe, and two dual-fuel gas-diesel engine modifications of 6 MWe and 16. 6 MWe.  There is a rising interest in combined cycle mode engines with possibly higher electrical efficiencies, at locations where heat energy is not needed or where electricity prices inspire investments in maximum power production. Various types of bottoming cycles can be applied to utilise the waste energy streams from the main engine and deliver additional power output. The basic hurdle though is the low electrical efficiency of the bottoming cycle due to low temperature levels of the engine waste energy streams, and the consequent low economic performance of the bottoming cycle hardware, which in itself can often require investment costs close to those for the main engine. Therefore, more efficient bottoming cycle alternatives should be examined, as well as a better optimisation and thermodynamic/economic evaluation of those should be performed in order to find an applicable solution.  The work presented herein concentrates on heat-balance simulations and thermodynamic evaluation of conventional cold-condensing steam bottoming cycles optimised for high electrical efficiency utilizing the waste energy streams from the W 20 V 34 SG gas engine of 8730 kWe net power output. Highest possible electrical efficiency for the combined cycle is sought, i. e. the bottoming cycle is configured and designed to match the given topping engine and to utilize the exergy content of the engine’s exhaust streams in the best possible way, while using only conventional steam technology with standard components, and applying a slightly optimistic approach with regards to isentropic efficiencies, generator efficiencies, steam condenser conditions, and heat-exchanger effectiveness. Steam bottoming cycles of varying complexity have been simulated and evaluated with the help of computer simulations based on the heat-balance software product ProSim.  The simulation results show that the net electrical power output of the steam bottoming cycle alone can reach from around 847 kWe (i. e. 9. 7 % of the <b>main</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> output) for the simplest single-pressure cold-condensing configuration, up to 1270 kWe for a very complex yet practical configuration, which is 14. 5 % of the main engine output.
