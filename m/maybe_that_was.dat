500|$|The Daily Star quoted Rowland on {{the theme}} of the song. She said [...] "I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming out on my own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E
2500|$|Debney called Iron Man 2 [...] "odd in {{that there}} were {{not a lot of}} places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a {{full-blown}} superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively." [...] For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with [...] "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen [...] "was less thematic. It was sort of a groove {{with a little bit of}} French horn. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero." [...] He continued, [...] "There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where [...] "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character." [...] Debney felt that this process led to the score being [...] "watered down and mashed up a little bit" [...] from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal [...] "joy". He said that Favreau [...] "gave me a great opportunity to get into [...] scene and learn 's circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave me the opportunity to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film". For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to [...] "capture the dark Russian soul" [...] of the character.|$|E

60|$|But <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> your art. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{what you}} intend {{the reader to}} detect and think {{he has made a}} Columbus-discovery. Then it is well done, {{perfectly}} done. I wrote my last travel book--[Following the Equator.]--in hell; but I let on, the best I could, <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> an excursion through heaven. Some day I will read it, and if its lying cheerfulness fools me, then I shall believe it fooled the reader. How I did loathe that journey around the world!--except the sea-part and India.|$|R

6000|$|Very well, you say, but the {{explanation}} is not complete yet. How did people come to drift into such a strange custom? What was {{the origin of the}} idea? [...] "Well, nobody knows; it was probably a revelation sent down by the gods." [...] One more thing: Why was such a cruel death chosen--why wouldn't a gentle one have answered? [...] "Nobody knows; <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a revelation, too." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{on account}} of Lohier's remark upon that head; {{or maybe it was}} hoped that the reading would kill the {{prisoner}} with fatigue--for, as it turned out, this reading occupied several days. It was also decided that Joan should be required to answer squarely to every article, and that if she refused she should be considered convicted. You see, Cauchon was managing to narrow her chances more and more all the time; he was drawing the toils closer and closer.|$|E
60|$|But it {{was only}} at rare moments that Martin was able to think. The house of thought was closed, its windows boarded up, and he was its shadowy caretaker. He was a shadow. Joe was right. They were both shadows, {{and this was the}} unending limbo of toil. Or was it a dream? Sometimes, in the steaming, sizzling heat, as he swung the heavy irons {{back and forth over the}} white garments, it came to him that it was a dream. In a short while, or maybe after a {{thousand}} years or so, he would awake, in his little room with the ink-stained table, and take up his writing where he had left off the day before. Or <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a dream, too, and the awakening would be the changing of the watches, when he would drop down out of his bunk in the lurching forecastle and go up on deck, under the tropic stars, and take the wheel and feel the cool tradewind blowing through his flesh.|$|E
5000|$|On All About Jazz Budd Kopman noted [...] "Listening to {{this would}} be deliciously {{unbearable}} in a live setting since {{you might not know}} whether to open your arms to the infinite or bang your head, but <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> also the point".|$|R

"It <b>was</b> {{explicit}} <b>that</b> {{she would}} support me in a Ward 3 race, including against Mary Cheh," [...] said Frumin, who has consistently {{said he has}} no interest in running against Cheh next year.

5000|$|Die Knowing {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics. Writing for All About the Rock, Mark Booth said: [...] "This <b>is</b> an album <b>that</b> <b>is</b> full of songs that all seem like they would be perfect live and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what Comeback Kid were looking at getting on record, some of the live intensity and boy have they accomplished that!".|$|R
6000|$|... "Lassiter, you're right. A {{child should}} be told the {{absolute}} truth. But--is that possible? I haven't {{been able to do}} it, and all my life I've loved the truth, and I've prided myself upon being truthful. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> only egotism. I'm learning much, my friend. Some of those blinding scales have fallen from my eyes. And--and as to caring for you, I think I care a great deal. How much, how little, I couldn't say. My heart is almost broken. Lassiter. So now is not a good time to judge of affection. I can still play and be merry with Fay. I can still dream. But when I attempt serious thought I'm dazed. I don't think. I don't care any more. I don't pray!... Think of that, my friend! But in spite of my numb feeling I believe I'll rise out of all this dark agony a better woman, with greater love of man and God. I'm on the rack now; I'm senseless to all but pain, and growing dead to that. Sooner or later I shall rise out of this stupor. I'm waiting the hour." ...|$|E
60|$|Breakfast followed, {{the silver}} kettle making it home-like, the {{children}} chattering, Miss Wells smiling, letters {{coming in to}} perplex or to clear up perplexities, amuse or cheer. The children were then turned out for an hour's hoop-driving on the gravel drive, horse-chestnut picking, or whatever might not be mischief, while Honora was conferring with Jones or with Brooks, and receiving her orders for the day. Next followed letter-writing, then lessons in general, a real enjoyment, unless Lucilla happened to have picked up a fit of perverseness--some reading to them, or rationalizing of play--the early dinner--the subsequent expedition with them, either walking or riding--for Brooks had soon found ponies for them, and they were gallant little riders. Honor would not give up the old pony, long since trained for her by Humfrey, though, <b>maybe,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> her most undutiful proceeding towards him, as he would certainly have {{told her that the}} creature was shaky on the legs. So at last it tumbled down with her, but without any damage, save a hole in her skirt, and a dreadful crying fit of little Owen, who was frightened out of his wits. She owned that it must be degraded to light cart work, and mounted an animal which Hiltonbury agreed to be more worthy of her. Coming in, the children played; she either did her business or found leisure for reading; then came tea-time, then the reading of a story book to the children, and when they were disposed of, of something mildly moral and instructive to suit Miss Wells's taste.|$|E
60|$|The last slow travel of {{his squad}} over dark, barren space and through deep, narrow, winding lanes {{in the ground}} had been a {{nightmare}} ending to the long journey. France had not yet become clear to him; he was a stranger in a strange land; {{in spite of his}} tremendous interest and excitement, all seemed abstract matters of his feeling, the plague of himself made actuality the substance of dreams. That last day, the cumulation of months of training and travel, had been one in which he had observed, heard, talked and felt in a nervous and fevered excitement. But now he imagined he could not remember any of it. His poignant experience with the Blue Devils had been a reality he could never forget, but now this blackness of subterranean cavern, this damp, sickening odor of earth, this presence of men, the strange, muffled sounds--all these were unreal. How had he come here? His mind labored with a burden strangely like that on his chest. A different, utterly unfamiliar emotion seemed rising over him. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> because he was very tired and very sleepy. Sometime that night he must go on duty. He ought to sleep. It was impossible. He could not close his eyes. An effort to attend to what he was actually doing disclosed {{the fact that he was}} listening with all his strength. For what? He could not answer then. He heard the distant, muffled sounds, and low voices nearer, and thuds and footfalls. His comrades were near him; he heard their breathing; he felt their presence. They were strained and intense; like him, they were locked up in their own prison of emotions.|$|E

6000|$|... "Since that {{uprising}} in Russia, and the {{attempt on the}} king in Italy, every nation over here looks with suspicion on all foreigners. But {{there is something else}} to it, I imagine," [...] went on Dave, seriously. [...] "Those fellows acted as if they didn't think much of this expedition which my father has joined. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> under suspicion, too." ...|$|R
50|$|After Emperor's death, Tōchi's husband acceded to {{the throne}} and became the next Emperor (Emperor Kōbun), {{although}} there's no record of his enthronement ceremony. She followed him as the Empress. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the most successful time in her life.|$|E

5000|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a C-, stating [...] "That was too damn long {{to tell a}} story with so little substance and so few real laughs. Kinda like Cloverfield. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the point".|$|E
6000|$|But to-night {{they seemed}} to have drawn nearer in spirit to each other, and <b>that,</b> <b>maybe,</b> it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{prompted}} Valerie to sigh, and in her sweet, unthinking innocence to say again: ...|$|R
5000|$|Erin Markey’s energy, her sensibility, is so {{singularly}} {{constructed for}} herself <b>that</b> it couldn’t <b>be</b> {{transferred to another}} person, <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> one thing people mean in calling her a performance artist. She plays [...] "Erin Markey" [...] as an outsized persona through autobiographical sketches interlaced with musical numbers—a tried and true nightclub strategy. The songs, usually contemporary pop songs, are performed with an intensity that unravels them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor old Fan, she don't {{get much}} petting; <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>'s</b> what she wants. I 'll try it and see, for she stands by {{me like a}} trump.

5000|$|Harvey later said, [...] "People didn't {{mention the}} blues thing until The Bad Seeds. But {{there was a}} lot of it in the later Birthday Party, The Bad Seed. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> due to me, co-writing the songs with Nick. But then, I don't really listen to the blues. It wasn't until later, in the mid-eighties, that Nick was {{listening}} to a bit of John Lee Hooker." ...|$|E
50|$|Ida, however, never {{joined him}} on his trips to America. Nils Oscar really tried to {{convince}} her and the children to come along, but {{this was one of}} the few things he never succeeded in doing.

5000|$|Graber {{was raised}} in Wildwood, New Jersey where she still owns a home. She studied under poet Stephen Dunn {{and went on to}} earn her BA in {{philosophy}} from New York University. She quit teaching middle school English to afford herself the ability to enroll in an MFA program and pursue a career in poetry. Kathleen said of the experience, [...] "Most poets live humble lives, I think, and <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> by temperament or design, or maybe it is just a necessity." ...|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, {{the fact}} that the Major has been reading all of Pinin's letters does {{indicate}} an unusual level of interest in the boy's personal life. <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> just protocol, and the Major happened to notice Pinin's lack of a love life? Or perhaps it wasn't, and the Major pointedly read all of the orderly's letters to assess his sexuality? The Major may have had a hunch based on happenings Hemingway didn't include in the story.|$|E
5000|$|Brownstein {{began playing}} guitar at 15 and {{received}} lessons from Jeremy Enigk. She later said: [...] "He {{lived in the}} neighborhood next to mine, so I would just walk my guitar over to his house. He showed {{me a couple of}} open chords and I just took it from there. I'd gone through so many phases as a kid with my interests that my parents put their foot down with guitar.

5000|$|The {{sessions}} featured {{plenty of}} give-and-take between the young, scrappy band and the older, more-polished producer. Said Adams later: [...] "He Scott {{wanted to make}} something flow. He wanted to make our record work, whereas we wanted our record to get damaged." [...] And for his part, Scott points to a particularly raw-sounding guitar part in the song [...] "Everything I Do" [...] and says, [...] "I listen to that and go, oh my God, we should've redone that guitar because it just is a little rough on such a beautiful song. But that's maybe what they liked about it; they were like, 'No, that's cool'... <b>Maybe</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the bruise on the apple {{that they were looking}} for." ...|$|E
25|$|I do support getting animals out in {{the same}} way I would have {{supported}} getting human slaves out, child labor, sex slaves, the whole lot. But I don't support burning.
