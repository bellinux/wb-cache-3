5|$|<b>Mouthpieces</b> are {{generally}} made of hard rubber, although some inexpensive <b>mouthpieces</b> {{may be made}} of plastic. Other materials such as crystal/glass, wood, ivory, and metal have also been used. Ligatures are often made of metal and plated in nickel, silver, or gold. Other materials include wire, wire mesh, plastic, naugahyde, string, or leather.|$|E

25|$|Most brass {{instruments}} are {{fitted with a}} removable <b>mouthpiece.</b> Different shapes, sizes and styles of <b>mouthpiece</b> {{may be used to}} suit different embouchures, or to more easily produce certain tonal characteristics. Trumpets, trombones, and tubas are characteristically fitted with a cupped <b>mouthpiece,</b> while horns are fitted with a conical <b>mouthpiece.</b>|$|R
40|$|Embouchure dysfunctions, {{including}} those from acute {{injury to the}} obicularis oris muscle, represent potential and serious occupational health problems for trumpeters. Forces generated between the <b>mouthpiece</b> and lips, generally a result of how a trumpeter plays, {{are believed to be}} the origin for such problems. In response to insights gained from new technologies that are currently being used to measure <b>mouthpiece</b> forces, belief systems and teaching methodologies may need to change in order to resolve possible conflicting terminology, pedagogical instructions, and performance advice. As a basis for such change, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate, develop and propose an operational definition of <b>mouthpiece</b> forces applicable to trumpet pedagogy. The methodology for this study included an analysis of writings by selected brass pedagogues regarding <b>mouthpiece</b> force. Finding were extracted, compared, and contrasted with scientifically derived <b>mouthpiece</b> force concepts developed from scientific studies including one done at the UNT Texas Center for Music & Medicine. Results characterized five <b>mouthpiece</b> force principles as the basis for an operational definition of <b>mouthpiece</b> force. This definition recognizes the relationships between average <b>mouthpiece</b> force and <b>mouthpiece</b> force variability. <b>Mouthpiece</b> force principles as presented in this study may contribute to a better understanding of <b>mouthpiece</b> force and its link to lip related injuries. However, additional studies are needed to better understanding the relationships between how the trumpet is taught and learned and the resulting <b>mouthpiece</b> forces produced when playing the trumpet...|$|R
50|$|The cornet <b>mouthpiece</b> has {{a shorter}} and {{narrower}} shank {{than that of}} a trumpet so it can fit the cornet's smaller <b>mouthpiece</b> receiver. The cup size is often deeper {{than that of a}} trumpet <b>mouthpiece.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Germanophile <b>mouthpieces,</b> Seara stated {{its support for}} the Central Powers early on, before such financing could occur—even before its patron Cantacuzino decided which side he supported. In the months of strife which preceded the actual war, the Romanian daily published telegrams and concerned commentary {{about the effects of}} nationalism in Central Europe and the Balkans. These accused the Greek Kingdom and Northern Epirote militias of decimating the Aromanian community in Korçë during April 1914, and urged Romanians to express their indignation. A month later, Seara was taking a stand against Romanian irredentism over Transylvania, as analyzed by the Transylvanian Germanophile Ioan Slavici. Slavici's texts scandalized the nationalist press for supporting Vasile Mangra, the pro-Hungarian priest and suspected agent of influence. However, the newspaper was also criticizing the Hungarian authorities for demanding the extradition of university student Măndăchescu. The latter, Seara reported, was wrongly accused of a bomb attack on the Diocese of Hajdúdorog, when the act was more likely attributable to the revolutionist Ilie Cătărău.|$|E

50|$|A crucial {{element in}} playing the horn {{deals with the}} <b>mouthpiece.</b> Most of the time, the <b>mouthpiece</b> {{is placed in the}} exact center of the lips, but, because of {{differences}} {{in the formation of the}} lips and teeth of different players, some tend to play with the <b>mouthpiece</b> slightly off center. Although the exact side-to-side placement of the <b>mouthpiece</b> varies for most horn players, the up-and-down placement of the <b>mouthpiece</b> is generally two-thirds on the upper lip and one-third on the lower lip. When playing higher notes, the majority of players exert a small degree of additional pressure on the lips using the <b>mouthpiece.</b> However, this is undesirable from the perspective of both endurance and tone: excessive <b>mouthpiece</b> pressure makes the horn sound forced and harsh, and decreases player's stamina due to the resulting constricted flow of blood to the lips and lip muscles. It is the goal of all serious brass musicians to develop their technique such that additional <b>mouthpiece</b> pressure is avoided altogether, or at the very least, minimized.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} <b>mouthpieces</b> {{were usually}} made from natural rubber and could cause {{an allergic reaction}} in some divers. This has been overcome {{by the use of}} hypo-allergenic synthetic elastomers such as silicone rubbers.|$|E

50|$|Horn {{players who}} use the Vienna horn also use a natural horn <b>mouthpiece,</b> which is less concave than a typical double horn <b>mouthpiece.</b> A {{standard}} horn <b>mouthpiece</b> is more concave, partly to facilitate the playing of lower notes because of lower impedance of the double horn.|$|R
50|$|The tenor {{saxophone}} uses {{a larger}} <b>mouthpiece,</b> reed and ligature than the alto and soprano saxophones. Visually, it is easily distinguished by the bend in its neck, or its crook, near the <b>mouthpiece.</b> The alto saxophone lacks this and its neck goes {{straight to the}} <b>mouthpiece.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{saxophone}} <b>mouthpiece</b> {{is larger}} {{than that of the}} clarinet, has a wider inner chamber, and lacks the cork-covered tenon of a clarinet <b>mouthpiece</b> because the saxophone neck inserts into the <b>mouthpiece</b> whereas the clarinet <b>mouthpiece</b> piece is inserted into the barrel. Saxophone and clarinet embouchures differ from each other in firmness, position of the lower lip, and range of entry angles. The [...] "long tones" [...] exercise is used to develop embouchure, along with airstream and breath control.|$|R

Although the exact side-to-side placement of the <b>mouthpiece</b> varies for most horn players, the up-and-down placement of the <b>mouthpiece</b> is generally two-thirds on the upper lip and one-third on the lower lip. Usually, in order to play higher octave notes, the pressure exerted on the lips from the <b>mouthpiece</b> is increased. But, although some pressure is needed, excessive pressure is not desirable. Playing with excessive pressure makes the playing of the horn sound forced and harsh as well as decreases endurance of the player by about half.|$|R
50|$|This {{supports}} {{what was}} written by trombonist and brass pedagogue Donald S. Reinhardt in 1942. In 1972, Reinhardt described and labeled different embouchure patterns according to such characteristics as <b>mouthpiece</b> placement and {{the general direction of}} the air stream as it travels past the lips. According to this later text, players who place the <b>mouthpiece</b> higher on the lips, so that more upper lip is inside the <b>mouthpiece,</b> will direct the air downwards to varying degrees while playing. Performers who place the <b>mouthpiece</b> lower, so that more lower lip is inside the <b>mouthpiece,</b> will direct the air to varying degrees in an upward manner. In order for the performer to be successful, the air stream direction and <b>mouthpiece</b> placement need to be personalized based on individual anatomical differences. Lloyd Leno confirmed the existence of both upstream and downstream embouchures.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of a self-adapted, jaw repositioning <b>mouthpiece</b> and jaw clenching on muscle activity during the countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) and isometric mid-thigh clean pull (MTCP). Methods:  Thirty-six healthy, recreationally trained males (n= 36; age, 23 ± 2. 8 years; height, 178. 54 ± 9. 0 cm; body mass, 83. 09 ± 7. 8 kg) completed maximal CMVJ and MTCP assessments under six experimental conditions:  jaw repositioning <b>mouthpiece</b> plus clenching (MP+C), jaw repositioning <b>mouthpiece</b> with jaw relaxed (MP), traditional mouthguard plus clenching (MG+C), traditional mouthguard with jaw relaxed (MG), no <b>mouthpiece</b> plus clenching (NoMP+C) and no <b>mouthpiece</b> with jaw relaxed (NoMP) while muscle activity of the dominant leg medial gastrocnemius (G), medial hamstring (H), vastus medialis (VMO), and erector spinae (ES) was recorded. Results:  Repeated measures ANOVA revealed no changes in MTCP muscle activation for any <b>mouthpiece</b> or clench condition. Jaw clenching, regardless of <b>mouthpiece</b> condition, significantly improved prime mover muscle activation during CMVJ (p. 05). Conclusion:  These findings support jaw clenching as a viable technique to elicit concurrent activation potentiation (CAP) of prime mover muscle activity during dynamic but not isometric physical activity.
