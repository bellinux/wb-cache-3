Fechner was profoundly interested in establishing a scientific study of the mind-body relationship, which became known as psychophysics.

50|$|The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{asks the}} subject to control {{the level of the}} stimulus, instructs them to alter it until it is just barely {{detectable}} against the background noise, or {{is the same as the}} level of another stimulus. This is repeated many times. This is also called the method of average error.In this method the observer himself controls the magnitude of the variable stimulus beginning with a variable that is distinctly greater or lesser than a standard one and he varies it until he is satisfied by the subjectivity of two. The difference between the variable stimuli and the standard one is recorded after each adjustment and the error is tabulated for a considerable series. At the end mean is calculated giving the average error which can be taken as the measure of sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|A {{difference}} threshold (or just-noticeable difference, JND) is {{the magnitude of}} the smallest difference between two stimuli of differing intensities that the participant is able to detect some proportion of the time (the percentage depending on the kind of task). To test this threshold, several different methods are used. The subject may be asked to adjust one stimulus until it is perceived as the same as the other (<b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment),</b> may be asked to describe the direction and magnitude of the difference between two stimuli, or may be asked to decide whether intensities in a pair of stimuli are the same or not (forced choice). The just-noticeable difference (JND) is not a fixed quantity; rather, it depends on how intense the stimuli being measured are and the particular sense being measured. Weber's Law states that the just-noticeable difference of a stimulus is a constant proportion despite variation in intensity.|$|E

50|$|The classic {{methods of}} {{experimentation}} are often argued to be inefficient. This is because, {{in advance of}} testing, the psychometric threshold is usually unknown and much data is collected at points on the psychometric function that provide little information about the parameter of interest, usually the threshold. Adaptive staircase procedures (or the classical <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment)</b> can be used such that the points sampled are clustered around the psychometric threshold. However, {{the cost of this}} efficiency is that there is less information regarding the psychometric function's shape. Adaptive methods can be optimized for estimating the threshold only, or threshold and slope. Adaptive methods are classified into staircase procedures (see below) and Bayesian or maximum-likelihood methods. Staircase methods rely on the previous response only and are easier to implement. Bayesian methods take the whole set of previous stimulus-response pairs into account and are believed to be more robust against lapses in attention.|$|E
5000|$|Only certain {{sites on}} the crystal surface functioned as {{rectifying}} junctions. The device was very sensitive to the exact geometry and pressure of contact between wire and crystal. It was therefore made adjustable, and a usable point of contact was found {{by trial and error}} before each use. The wire was suspended from a moveable arm and was dragged across the crystal face by the operator until the device began functioning. In a crystal radio, the operator would tune the radio to a strong local station if possible and then adjust the cat's whisker until the station or static was heard in the radio's earphones. This required some skill {{and a great deal of}} patience; even then, a good contact could easily be lost by the slightest vibration. An alternative <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> was to use a battery-operated buzzer to generate a test signal. The spark produced by the buzzer's contacts functioned as a weak radio transmitter whose emissions could be detected when a diode in the crystal had been found and the buzz could be heard in the earphones, at which time the buzzer was turned off. The temperamental, unreliable action of the crystal detector was a barrier to its acceptance as a standard component in commercial radio equipment and was one reason for its rapid replacement by vacuum tubes after 1920.

We used the residual adjusted method on the Framingham Heart Study offspring data, provided for Genetic Analysis Workshop 13, and got mixed results. Conclusion When the genetic effect and environmental effects are independent, a susceptibility residual <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for environmental covariates reduces the power of the association test.

Areas that are influenced by moderate tidal ranges should incorporate a system of regulation consisting of a winch, gearbox with a gear ratio of around 10, 000 : 1, 12 V DC motor, 12 V maintenance free battery, air coiled linear generator and a strain gauge. For areas with large tidal ranges the previous system should be complimented with a horizontally mounted spring, inside the buoy, to lessen the loads on the motor. The statistical analysis found the largest extremes in water level of the three sites to be at Kungsvik and Kungsholmsfort, both exhibiting a range of almost 1. 6 m.
