25|$|In July 1991, {{while visiting}} relatives, Reubens {{was arrested in}} Sarasota, Florida, for masturbating {{publicly}} in an adult theater. Detectives would periodically visit pornographic theaters and observe the audience, arresting those engaged in what these detectives considered indecent exposure. Reubens {{had not been in}} character {{for a year and a}} half, but because CBS was still running reruns of Pee-wee's Playhouse, Reubens' infamous <b>mug</b> <b>shot,</b> which did not depict the clean-cut look Reubens had shown for the last decade, shocked the public, and many thought that the show had been canceled due to the arrest. The arrest was widely covered, and both the character Pee-wee and Reubens became the subject of ridicule. CBS stopped airing Playhouse and Disney-MGM Studios suspended from its studio tour a video that showed Pee-wee explaining how voice-over tracks were made and Toys-R-Us removed Pee-wee toys from its stores. However, his voice work in Disney's Star Tours was not replaced.|$|E

500|$|Portraying {{the head}} guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown {{was given the}} {{opportunity}} to speak with former guards by the production's liaison officer, but declined believing {{it would not be a}} good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers. William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the Tales from the Crypt television series where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. Morgan's son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in <b>mug</b> <b>shot</b> photos, and as a prisoner shouting [...] "fresh fish" [...] as Andy arrives at Shawshank. Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the Reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility.

In mid-July 2006, Posters with a <b>mug</b> <b>shot</b> of Lonsdale appeared in store windows warning {{that he had been}} arrested for sex crimes and was dangerous. The Church of Scientology told Bay News 9 that it did not hand out the fliers, but that they came from an organization calling the [...] "Cleveland Street Safety League". The St. Petersburg Times reported that the man behind the [...] "Cleveland Street Safety League" [...] is [...] "a longtime Scientologist known for confronting critics". The Scientologist behind the Cleveland Street Safety League created a website about Lonsdale and posted his arrest record and comments Lonsdale had made on a swinger site, and also called Lonsdale's family in New England claiming that Lonsdale needed mental help.|$|E
500|$|In October 2002, Trenyce {{auditioned for}} the second season of the reality {{television}} series American Idol. She {{became one of the}} 32 semi-finalists. She was eliminated in the top 30 round, but judge Paula Abdul chose her as a [...] "wildcard selection" [...] {{to become one of the}} twelve finalists. Trenyce's arrest was disclosed to the public during an appearance on the show, but she was not removed from the series, as had happened with some former contestants. Producer Nigel Lythgoe clarified that Trenyce informed the producers of her criminal history from the outset. Trenyce placed fifth during the season finals. Jim Cantiello of MTV News connected the disclosure of Trenyce's <b>mug</b> <b>shot</b> and felony theft charges to her elimination from the show by public voting. Entertainment Weekly also concluded that the news relating to her criminal record reduced her appeal with voters. Several media commentators suggested that racism may have played a role in Trenyce's elimination, as she was one of only two dark-skinned finalists during the season (the other was winner Ruben Studdard).|$|E
500|$|Noriega {{used the}} moniker [...] "El Man" [...] {{to refer to}} himself, but was also known by the {{nickname}} [...] "Pineapple Face", a name which Noriega detested, and {{which would be the}} subject of a later lawsuit. He had a lavish lifestyle during his time as the de facto ruler of Panama, described in an obituary as a [...] "libertine life off drug-trade riches, complete with luxurious mansions, cocaine-fueled parties and voluminous collections of antique guns." [...] His bravado during public speeches was remarked upon by commentators; for instance, after his indictment by the U.S., he made a public speech while brandishing a machete, and declaiming [...] "Not one step back!" [...] The attitude of machismo that Noriega adopted {{has been described as a}} reaction to the persecution his brother Luis faced as an openly homosexual man in Panama and Peru. This image contrasted sharply with the impact of a <b>mug</b> <b>shot</b> taken of him after his capture, and which became a symbol of his fall from power. He was reported to have been a deeply superstitious man, who placed trust in a number of talismans he carried with him.|$|E

500|$|On 6 January 1998, {{starting}} with [...] "Hard Cash", the third {{episode of the}} show's fourteenth series, the title sequence and theme used for nearly ten years were scrapped. This time, the title sequence consisted of various police procedural images, including a suspect being shown into a police cell, another suspect being interviewed, and a third posing for <b>mug</b> <b>shot</b> photographs. Clips {{of any of the}} actors featured were removed, as was the initial sequence involving the police car racing down the street. Pask and Morgan [...] revamped [...] "Overkill", giving it a jazz feel, with the majority of the theme played by a saxophone. The end credits of the series were also completely revamped. This time, the credits featured various images of the Metropolitan Police uniform, combined with images of a feet tapping on a kerb. A longer version of [...] "Overkill" [...] was also used in the final credits, this time composed by Mark Russell. These opening and closing sequences were used for nearly three years, although both saw minor updates in 1999. The text sequence at the very start of the opening sequence was changed into a different font, and the images of the police uniform and feet tapping on a curb were removed from the closing sequence {{to make way for a}} preview of the next episode. The closing sequence remained this way until 2001, but the opening titles were once again updated in 2000 to remove certain images from the sequence to make it shorter. It is also noted that during this period, a 'previously on The Bill segment was aired before the title sequence, to inform views what had occurred in the last episode.|$|E

In Detroit Free Press, the Sixth Circuit recognized a privacy interest in <b>mug</b> <b>shots</b> under Exemption 7 (C). The practical impact of the decision is to uphold the general policy of the U.

Furthermore, this article critiques three key reasons why the Sixth Circuit in 2016 reversed its ruling from twenty years ago in which it held there was no privacy interest in <b>mug</b> <b>shots.</b> Troublingly for access advocates, courts are justifying expansion of the meaning of “personal privacy” within Exemption 7 (C) as a mechanism for counteracting the ease and permanence of accessibility to information on the Internet...|$|R
