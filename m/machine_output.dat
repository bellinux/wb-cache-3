30|$|Feed outputs to {{identical}} device: After verifying the <b>machine</b> <b>outputs,</b> {{they are}} ready to be implemented in a cryptographic device. The testing device must be identical to the original target device. However, the implementation should utilize a single Eve machine that receives the calculated <b>machine</b> <b>outputs</b> in matrix V. The internal input nodes xk,n are publicly available in the standard architecture of the TPM, which can be used in conjunction with the <b>machine</b> <b>outputs</b> to emulate the learning steps. Selecting a learning method for the Eve machine is entirely reliant on knowledge of the target device. The Eve machine is trained posing as either the Alice machine or the Bob machine. Its final synaptic weights represent the target key for a single session of the key exchange. It {{is important to note that}} the initial weights play a large factor in determining an accurate key.|$|R
30|$|A {{total of}} three {{different}} cases are studied in which the Eve machine tries to fully synchronize with the Alice and Bob machines: case 1 deals with the mutual syncing of the Alice and Bob <b>machine</b> <b>outputs,</b> case 2 focuses on syncing solely with Alice <b>machine’s</b> <b>outputs,</b> and case 3 is a direct intercept of the communication channel to sync acting as Alice or Bob. For all three cases, 1000 different iterations of synchronizations run between Alice and Bob using three different learning rules as depicted in Eqs. (3)–(5): Hebbian, anti-Hebbian, and random walk.|$|R
30|$|A {{conditional}} operation is performed {{to determine whether}} or not to update the synaptic weights. For the unsupervised training method, the adaptation step requires that the <b>machines</b> <b>output</b> an equal value. Even if both outputs are equal, another condition is set comparing the <b>machine’s</b> <b>output</b> to the value of a hidden node’s output. This ensures that only the hidden node, whose weights are mismatched to the <b>machine’s</b> <b>output,</b> are updated. Additionally, the adaptation step uses a learning rule to modify and update the weights. The result of the learning rule is clipped to satisfy the specified boundaries L of the weights. After complete synchronization of the machines, the weights are used as keys for a cryptosystem. A special case is seen when determining the sign of a zero value. For the machine that initiates the key exchange y_A_k = sgn(0) = 1, for the responding machine y_B_k = sgn(0) = - 1 is held.|$|R

50|$|The light/full classification, {{developed}} in the nineties when machine translation still came on a CD-ROM, may not suit advances in machine translation at the light post-editing end either.

50|$|Post-editing (or postediting) is {{the process}} whereby humans amend machine-generated {{translation}} to achieve an acceptable final product. A person who post-edits is called a post-editor. The concept of post-editing is linked to that of pre-editing. In the process of translating a text via machine translation, best results may be gained by pre-editing the source textfor example by applying the principles of controlled languageand then post-editing the <b>machine</b> <b>output.</b> It is distinct from editing, which refers {{to the process of}} improving human generated text (a process which is often known as revision in the field of translation).

40|$|Evaluation {{is a major}} {{driving force}} in {{advancing}} {{the state of the}} art in language technologies. In particular, methods for automatically assessing the quality of <b>machine</b> <b>output</b> is the preferred method for measuring progress, provided that these metrics have been validated against human judgments. Following recent developments in the automatic evaluation of machine translation and document summarization, we present a similar approach, implemented in a measure called Pourpre, an automatic technique for evaluating answers to complex questions based on n-gram co-occurrences between <b>machine</b> <b>output</b> and a human-generated answer key. Until now, the only way to assess the correctness of answers to such questions involves manual determination of whether an information “nugget ” appears in a system’s response. The lack of automatic methods for scoring system output is an impediment to progress in the field, which we address with this work. Experiments with the TREC 2003, TREC 2004, and TREC 2005 QA tracks indicate that rankings produced by our metric correlate highly with official rankings, and that Pourpre outperforms direct application of existing metrics. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{material}} removal rate (MRR), along with the electrode wear rate (EWR), {{plays an important role}} in analysing <b>machine</b> <b>output</b> during electrical discharge machining. This work focuses on the improvement of <b>machine</b> <b>output</b> by introducing an induced magnetic field on the workpiece during rotary electrical discharge machining (REDM) of EN- 8 steel with a rotary copper electrode. The workpiece was placed inside the induced magnetic field, wherein polarity of the magnetic field gets reversed periodically. Using Taguchi’s recommended design of experiments, we initially conducted experiments with eight input parameters at different levels. Significant parameters were identified with the help of the signal-tonoise ratio and ANOVA. Finally, another set of experiments was conducted for analysis of the process and development of empirical expressions for MRR and EWR. Experimental results established that rotary electrical discharge machining with a polarity reversal magnetic field delivers better machining output than machining in a non-magnetic field. Thus, this work benefits the EDM process by reducing the machining costs and by producing better geometrical trueness on workpieces, as MRR increased and EWR decreased...|$|E
