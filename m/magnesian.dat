5|$|In June 1838 Barry {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} Britain to locate a supply of stone for the building, eventually choosing <b>Magnesian</b> Limestone from the Anston quarry of the Duke of Leeds. Work started on building the river frontage on 1 January 1839, and Barry's wife laid the foundation stone on 27 April 1840. The stone was badly quarried and handled, and with the polluted atmosphere in London {{it proved to be}} problematic, with the first signs of deterioration showing in 1849, and extensive renovations required periodically.|$|E
25|$|Mid-7th century BC: In the war {{waged by}} the Ephesians against Magnesia on the Maeander, the <b>Magnesian</b> {{horsemen}} were each {{accompanied by a}} war dog and a spear-bearing attendant. The dogs were released first and broke the enemy ranks, followed by an assault of spears, then a cavalry charge. An epitaph records the burial of a <b>Magnesian</b> horseman named Hippaemon with his dog Lethargos, his horse, and his spearman.|$|E

25|$|The {{source of}} the Poulter is {{in a region where}} the {{underlying}} geology is an extensive water-bearing porous rock structure called the <b>Magnesian</b> Limestone aquifer. <b>Magnesian</b> limestone is named because if contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium. Where this rock reaches the surface, springs often occur, and the Poulter starts at such a spring. Further to the east, the <b>Magnesian</b> Limestone is covered by a layer of porous rock called the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer, which is the major geological component of the area. Continuing eastwards, both are covered by a layer of Mercia mudstone. The groundwater levels in these aquifers affect whether they supply water to the river system, or take water from it, and levels are lower than they have historically been, {{as a result of the}} extraction of groundwater, particularly for public water supply, and by fracturing of the aquifers as a result of subsidence caused by deep coal mining.|$|E

5|$|Philip, {{disappointed}} by the spoils in Mysia, proceeded south and plundered the towns and cities of Caria. He invested Prinassus, which held out bravely at first, but when Philip set up his artillery, he sent an envoy into the city offering to let them leave the city unharmed or {{they would all be}} killed. The citizens decided to abandon the city. At this stage in the campaign, Philip's army was running out of food, so he seized the city of Myus and gave it to the <b>Magnesians</b> in return for food supplies. Since the <b>Magnesians</b> had no grain, Philip settled for enough figs to feed his whole army. Subsequently, Philip turned north in order to seize and garrison the cities of Iasos, Bargylia, Euromus and Pedasa in quick succession.|$|R
25|$|The {{channel and}} sheeted flows are then covered by high-magnesian basalts and tholeiitic basalts as the {{volcanic}} event evolves to less <b>magnesian</b> compositions. The subsequent magmatism, being higher silica melts, tends {{to form a}} more typical shield volcano architecture.|$|E
25|$|Another line of {{evidence}} {{is that the}} MgO content of olivines formed in komatiites is toward the nearly pure MgO forsterite composition, {{which can only be}} achieved in bulk by crystallisation of olivine from a highly <b>magnesian</b> melt.|$|E

5000|$|Bularchus' [...] Battle of the <b>Magnesians,</b> is the {{earliest}} picture {{of which the}} ancient writers have left a description. The artist appears to have flourished in the late 8th century BC, as, according to Pliny, this picture was purchased for as much gold as would cover its surface by Candaules, King of Lydia, who died in about 700 B.C.|$|R
50|$|His {{father was}} Broteas, {{the brother of}} Niobe and Pelops. Broteas carved the image of Cybele, a Phyrgian {{equivalent}} of the Titaness Rhea. The image was sacred to the <b>Magnesians.</b> Broteas, like his son, also ruled over Pisa. Since he was a hunter and did not honor Artemis, he was sacrificed on a pyre.

25|$|The region {{through which}} the river flows is underlaid by an {{extensive}} water-bearing porous rock structure called the <b>Magnesian</b> Limestone aquifer, which is near the surface {{in the west and}} dips downwards to the east. <b>Magnesian</b> Limestone is so called because it contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium.

25|$|Euthydemus I was, {{according}} to Polybius a <b>Magnesian</b> Greek. His son, Demetrius, {{founder of the}} Indo-Greek kingdom, was therefore of Greek descent from his father at minimum. A marriage treaty was arranged for Demetrius with a daughter of Antiochus III the Great, who had partial Persian descent. The ethnicity of later Indo-Greek rulers is less clear.|$|E
50|$|He {{was said}} to have carved the most ancient image of the Great Mother of the Gods (Cybele), an image that in Pausanias' day (2nd century CE) was still held sacred by the <b>Magnesians.</b> The {{sculpture}} was carved into the rock-face of the crag Coddinus, north of Spil Mount-Mount Sipylus, whose daemon was one of the mythographers' candidates for Broteas' grandfather.|$|R
40|$|In 221 / 20 the {{citizens}} of Magnesia on the Maeander sought to create crowned games in honor of Artemis Leukophryene. The goddess had appeared to them and Delphi instructed that "it is more agreeable and better for those who revere Apollo Pythios and Artemis Leukophryene and treat the city and territory of the <b>Magnesians</b> on the Maeander as sacred and inviolable. " But why it took Magnesia {{more than a decade}} to secure asylia and inaugurate the enhanced games has remained a puzzle. It has been thought since Kern (1901) that the <b>Magnesians</b> first attempted to win acceptance of inviolability and the games in 221 / 20, that their invitations were almost universally snubbed, and that the city did not succeed in securing international recognition until 208 / 7. This paper argues that there was no failed campaign of invitations in 221, that Magnesia did not canvass the Greek world until 208 / 7...|$|R
25|$|Among the Jewish {{practices}} {{abandoned by}} proto-orthodox Christianity, Circumcision was rejected as a requirement at the Council of Jerusalem, c. 50, Sabbath observance was modified, perhaps {{as early as}} Ignatius' Epistle to the <b>Magnesians</b> 9.1.

25|$|Typical {{metamorphic}} mineralogy is tremolite-chlorite, or talc-chlorite mineralogy in {{the upper}} spinifex zones. The more magnesian-rich olivine-rich flow base facies tend {{to be free from}} tremolite and chlorite mineralogy and are dominated by either serpentine-brucite +/- anthophyllite if hydrated, or talc-magnesite if carbonated. The upper flow facies tend to be dominated by talc, chlorite, tremolite, and other <b>magnesian</b> amphiboles (anthophyllite, cummingtonite, gedrite, etc.).|$|E
25|$|In {{all cases}} these {{alteration}} zones are metasomatism {{effects in the}} strictest sense, resulting in addition of potassium, silica, magnesium, and depletion of sodium. Chlorite minerals are usually more <b>magnesian</b> in composition within the footwall alteration zone of a VMS deposit than equivalent rocks within the same formation distally. The hangingwall to a VMS deposit is often weakly sodium depleted.|$|E
25|$|A {{common and}} {{distinctive}} texture {{is known as}} spinifex texture and consists of long acicular phenocrysts of olivine (or pseudomorphs of alteration minerals after olivine) or pyroxene which give the rock a bladed appearance especially on a weathered surface.

25|$|The often rarely {{preserved}} flow top breccia and pillow margin {{zones in}} some komatiite flows are essentially volcanic glass, quenched {{in contact with}} overlying water or air. Because they are rapidly cooled, they represent the liquid composition of the komatiites, and thus record an anhydrous MgO content of up to 32% MgO.

50|$|Early Christian {{observance}} {{of both the}} spiritual seventh-day sabbath and a Lord's Day assembly is evidenced in Ignatius's letter to the <b>Magnesians</b> ca. 110. The Pseudo-Ignatian additions amplified this point by combining weekly {{observance of}} spiritual seventh-day sabbath with the Lord's assembly. If Pseudo-Ignatius dates as early as 140, its admonition must be considered important evidence on 2nd-century sabbath and Lord's Day observance. According to classical sources, widespread seventh-day sabbath rest by gentile Christians was also the prevailing mode in the 3rd and 4th centuries.|$|R
5000|$|Hetaeridia or Hetairidia (...) was a name of {{a festival}} among Macedonians and <b>Magnesians</b> (Athenaeus XIII. 572, quoting Hegesander).
