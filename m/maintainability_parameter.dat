40|$|The paper aims {{to suggest}} a {{methodology}} able to support the analyst in the assessment process of items {{on the base of}} a criterion inspired to the <b>maintainability</b> <b>parameter</b> and in the successive assignment phase of the items in the predefined classes. The maintainability involves the continuous improvement of a system in order to improve the ability to maintain or improve the reliability of the analyzed system. In particular, the last one is the probability that a failed system will be restored to specified conditions within a given period of time when maintenance is performed according to prescribed procedures and resources. The faced case in this research regards the software maintenance, field in which the maintainability can be defined as the probability that a program will be restored to working conditions in a given period of time when it is being changed, modified or enhanced. Furthermore, the maintainability can be subdivided into diverse sub criteria as Analysability (how easy or difficult is to diagnose the system for deficiencies or to identify the parts that need to be modified), Changeability (how easy or difficult is to make adaptations to the system), Stability (how easy or difficult is to keep the system in a consistent state during the modification process), Testability (how easy or difficult is it to test the system after modifications). Thus, with respect to aforementioned sub criteria the present research wants to propose the ELECTRE TRI method in order to assign the different analyzed items, with relation to the maintainability criterion, into the different predefined classes. With the aim to illustrate the method validity, a numerical application is shown with relation to the classification, under the maintainability criterion, of different modular Enterprise Resource Planning software systems...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{mathematical}} modeling {{for the purpose}} of analyzing and optimizing the performance of repairable systems is widely studied in the literature. In this dissertation, we study two different scenarios on the maintenance modeling and optimization of repairable systems. First, we study the long-run availability of a traditional repairable system that is subjected to imperfect corrective maintenance. We use Kijima 2 ̆ 7 s second virtual age model to describe the imperfect repair process. Because of the complexity of the underlying probability models, we use simulation modeling to estimate availability performance and meta-modeling to convert the reliability and <b>maintainability</b> <b>parameters</b> of the repairable system into an availability estimate without the simulation effort. As a last step, we add age-based, perfect preventive maintenance to our analysis. Second, we optimize a preventive maintenance policy for a two-component repairable system. When either component fails, instantaneous, minimal, and costly corrective maintenance is performed on the component. At equally-spaced, discrete points during the system 2 ̆ 7 s useful life, the decision-maker has the option to perform instantaneous, imperfect, and costly preventive maintenance on {{one or both of the}} components, to instantaneously replace one or both of the components, or to do nothing. We use a Genetic Algorithm in an attempt to find a cost-optimal set of preventive maintenance and replacement decisions...|$|R

40|$|During air-attack {{operations}}, i. e., air-to-air and land-air {{operations in}} battles, maintaining {{a high level}} of availability of weapon systems (aircraft and weapons) becomes important {{from the point of view}} of winning the battle. Availability may depend on severity of combat operations, attrition factors (battle damage failures and reliability related failures), and logistic delays in weapons deployment and in the repair process. In this paper, a simulation model is developed for availability of weapon systems considering air-to-air and land-air combat operations, multiple failures causing aircraft failure and logistic delays in weapons deployment, and in the repair process. The availability of aircraft and the availability of weapons are separately derived from simulation and the product of them is denoted as combined availability for analysis. The results are analyzed in terms of fluctuations in availability on specified days of battle such as 1, 7, 14, and 21 days from the graphical output. The simulation procedure employs discrete event simulation technique using Monte Carlo methods. The time to failure distribution and the time to repair distribution for the major subsystems of the aircraft and helicopters is considered to be Weibull and exponential respectively. The logistic delay time distribution for weapons replenishment and for logistic factors, spares, crew, and equipment, is considered to be lognormal. Assuming a certain range of values for air-attack missions and for the number of sorties to be generated and a set of reliability and <b>maintainability</b> <b>parameters</b> for the considered major subsystems of the aircraft, the simulation for availability is analyzed.

40|$|Abstract. In modern {{distributed}} object systems, {{reference parameters}} are passed {{to a remote}} method based on their runtime type. We argue that such type-based parameter passing is limiting with respect to expressiveness, readability, and <b>maintainability,</b> and that <b>parameter</b> passing semantics should be decoupled from parameter types. We present declarative parameter passing, an approach that fully decouples parameter passing semantics from parameter types in distributed object systems. In addition, we describe DeXteR, an extensible framework for transforming a type-based remote parameter passing model to a declaration-based model transparently. Our framework leverages aspect-oriented and generative programming techniques to enable adding new remote parameter passing semantics, without requiring detailed understanding of the underlying middleware implementation. Our approach is applicable to both application and library code and incurs negligible performance overhead. We validate the expressive power of our framework by adding several non-trivial remote parameter passing semantics (i. e., copy-restore, lazy, streaming) to Java RMI...|$|R

40|$|The goal {{of every}} public {{transport}} operator {{is to not}} only provide high-quality service, but also to minimize investment and operating costs. A {{significant proportion of the}} costs are associated with the acquisition, operation and maintenance of reserve vehicles. If the number of vehicles held in reserve is too high, an operator will incur economic losses because vehicles are underused. Conversely, if the number of reserve vehicles is too low, the quality of service will be reduced due to disruptions in the timetable. To determine the number of vehicles to hold in reserve, a coefficient of availability is commonly used. The coefficient of availability is determined by two parameters: reliability and <b>maintainability.</b> Both <b>parameters</b> have the same physical dimensions, the mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair, and they are expressed in hours. Vehicle wear, which results during the emergence of failures, is not very dependent on the time of operation but is strongly dependent on the distance travelled. It is therefore appropriate to use mean distance between failures (MDBF) instead of MTBF, because it better describes the reliability of vehicles. Using MDBF, however, means that the coefficient of availability is not considered, because MDBF and MTTR have different physical dimensions. This problem is solved by using a random vector that makes it is possible to determine the number of vehicles to hold in reserve based on the distance travelled and maintenance time. This original approach allows the acquisition of better and more authentic data necessary for an operator’s decision-making process. Therefore, the number of required reserve vehicles can be much better planned. Ultimately, this positively affects the quality of services and also the investment and operating costs of the operator.

Their reliability and maintainability directly affect the capacity and availability of the railway network, {{in terms of both}} infrastructure and trains, as a line cannot be fully operative until a failure has been repaired. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose a data-driven decision support model that integrates the various parameters of corrective maintenance data and to study maintenance performance by con-sidering different reliability, availability, <b>maintainability</b> and safety <b>parameters.</b> This model is based on failure analysis of historical events in the form of corrective maintenance actions. It has been validated in a case study of railway signalling systems and the results are summarised. The model allows the creation of maintenance policies based on failure characteristics, as it integrates the information recorded in the various parameters of the corrective maintenance work orders. The model shows how the different failures affect the dependability of the system: the critical failures indicate the reliability of the system, the corrective actions give information about the maintainability of the components, and the relationship between the corrective maintenance times measures the efficiency of the corrective maintenance actions. All this information can be used to plan new strategies of preventive maintenance and failure diagnostics, reduce the corrective maintenance and improve the maintenance performance...|$|R
