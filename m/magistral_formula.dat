40|$|Free {{radicals}} {{formed by}} UV irradiation {{of the two}} magistral formulas applied on the skin, salicylic acid and urea, were examined by X-band (9. 3 [*]GHz) EPR spectroscopy. The influence {{of the time of}} UVA (315 – 400 [*]nm) irradiation on free radical properties and concentrations in the drug samples was determined. The nonirradiated <b>magistral</b> <b>formula</b> did not contain free radicals. Amplitudes (A) and linewidths (ΔBpp) of EPR spectra were analysed. Fast spin-lattice relaxation process existed in the tested drugs. UV irradiation did not change spin-lattice interactions in the tested <b>magistral</b> <b>formula.</b> Concentrations of free radicals formed by UV irradiation in salicylic acid and urea were ~ 1017 – 1018 [*]spins/g. The strongest formation of free radicals under UV irradiation was observed for salicylic acid than for urea. Free radical concentration in salicylic acid increased with the increase of UV irradiation time from 15 minutes to 30 minutes, and after its value remained unchanged. The increase of free radical concentration in urea with UV irradiation time was stated. Salicylic acid is characterized with higher photosensitivity than urea. Salicylic acid, urea, and the skin treated by them should not be stored on UV exposure. The usefulness of EPR spectroscopy to optimize storage conditions of recipe drugs was conformed...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} has focused on in vitro and in vivo evaluations of a new Carmustine (BCNU) -loaded clinoptilolite-based delivery system. Two clinoptilolite ionic forms—hydrogen form (HCLI) and sodium form (NaCLI) —were prepared, allowing a loading degree of about 5 – 6 mg BCNU/g of zeolite matrix due to the dual porous feature of clinoptilolite. Clinoptilolite-based delivery systems released 35. 23 % of the load in 12 h for the BCNU@HCLI system and only 10. 82 % for the BCNU@NaCLI system. The BCNU@HCLI system was chosen to develop gel and cream semisolid dosage forms. The cream (C_BCNU@HCLI) released 29. 6 % of the loaded BCNU after 12 h in the Nylon synthetic membrane test and 31. 6 % in the collagen membrane test, higher by comparison to the gel. The new cream was evaluated in vivo in a chemically induced model of skin cancer in mice. Quantitative immunohistochemistry analysis showed stronger inhibition of B-cell lymphoma- 2 (bcl- 2) and cyclooxygenase 2 (cox- 2) protein expression, known markers for cancer survival and aggressiveness, after the treatment with C_BCNU@HCLI by comparison to all the control treatment types, including an off-label <b>magistral</b> <b>formula</b> commercially available Carmustine cream as reference, bringing evidence that a clinoptilolite-based delivery systems {{could be used as a}} cancer drug carriers and controlled release systems (skin-targeted topical delivery systems) ...|$|E
30|$|The European Parliament and the European Commission now {{recently}} have issued a legal act that regulates {{the requirements for}} clinical trials within the European Union (EU regulation No 536 / 2014). The overall purpose of this regulation was to facilitate and harmonise clinical research in the member states and therefore the regulation has very clearly exempted the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals from the requirements of GMP (Decristoforo et al. 2014) if it “is carried out in hospitals, health centres or clinics, by pharmacists or other persons legally authorised in the Member State concerned to carry out such process, and if the investigational medicinal products are intended to be used exclusively in hospitals, health centres or clinics {{taking part in the}} same clinical trial in the same Member State”, thereby specifying the framework in which it should be applied, not being intended for radiopharmaceuticals manufactured industrially and being distributed. In a similar way a number of European member states have set up a regulatory framework in which radiopharmaceuticals for routine use (i.e. not for clinical trials) can be prepared on site without the requirements of a marketing authorisation. These exemptions can be derived from the definitions in Article 3 of Directive 2001 / 83 (The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union 2001), the so called <b>magistral</b> and officinal <b>formulae.</b>|$|R
