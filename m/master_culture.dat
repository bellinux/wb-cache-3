30|$|The sulphate-reducing {{consortium}} (SRC) used in {{this research}} was derived from sludge of an electroplating industry SKH metals LTD., Manesar, Gurgaon district, Haryana, India. Sample was stored at anaerobic conditions in sealed plastic bag and was instantly brought to lab. From the sample, 5  g of sludge was added to 500  ml <b>master</b> <b>culture</b> flask filled with culture media containing modified Postgate media (g/L): Na 2 SO 4 1.0; KH 2 PO 4 0.5; NH 4 Cl 2.0; FeSO 4 0.005; CaCl 2 0.06; sodium citrate 0.3; yeast extract 0.1; sodium lactate 15  ml at pH 7 (Singh et al. 2011). Then <b>master</b> <b>culture</b> flask was purged with high-purity nitrogen to curtail the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The consortium was incubated for 2  months at 37  °C. The presence of black precipitates and foul odour of hydrogen sulphide was examined which indicates the presence of sulphate-reducing microbial consortia proficient in precipitating metal ions.|$|E
30|$|The {{microbiological}} assay {{is based}} upon a comparison of inhibition of growth of micro-organisms by measured concentrations of test compounds with that produced by known concentration of a standard antibiotic. Two methods generally employed are turbidometric (tube-dilution) method and cylinder plate (cup-plate) method. In the turbidometric method, inhibition of growth of microbial culture in a uniform solution of antibiotic in a fluid medium is measured. It is compared with the synthesized compounds. Here, {{the presence or absence}} of growth is measured. The cylinder plate method depends upon diffusion of antibiotic from a vertical cylinder through a solidified agar layer in a Petridish or plate to an extent such that growth of added micro-organisms is prevented entirely in a zone around the cylinder containing solution of the antibiotics. The cup-plate method is simple and measurement of inhibition of microorganisms is also easy. Here, we have use this method for antibacterial screening of the test compounds. The media was prepared from nutrient agar 2 %, peptone 1 %, beef extract 1 %, sodium chloride 0.5 %, and distilled water up to 100 mL. All the ingredients were weighed and added to water. This solution was heated on water bath for about one and half-hour till it became clear. This nutrient media was sterilized by autoclave. The antibacterial and antifungal activity was measured against Bacillus subtillis (MTCC- 212), Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC- 737) were used as Gram-positive bacteria, Escherichia coli (NCLM- 2066) were used as Gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans (MTCC- 227) was used as fungi for this study. The <b>master</b> <b>culture</b> was prepared on agar slant of the above nutrient media and kept in refrigerator. The working culture was prepared from it by weekly transferred in nutrient agar medium [5, 6].|$|E

40|$|Translation {{involves}} {{two or more}} {{languages in}} practice. This undoubtedly activates {{the conflict between the}} source and target language. When translator tries to help readers understand fully the concept of the source text, he will sacrifice the source language to maintain the target. In this terms translator will have diffciculties to balance between those two languages. Maintaining both is much more problematic in tranlsation practice. Shifting between theories of translations does not automatically help translator to mantain the contents of the text tranfered into target language. Distorting as well as inserting translator‘s idea then is impossible to avoid. <b>Mastering</b> <b>culture,</b> history, sociology an many other disciplines in both source and target language will then help very much the action of translating. The next problem then occurs if it is related to law and religious teaching. Since holy text is sacredly honoured by the believers, translator is potentially sentenced to be sinful and to lose his profession. The alternative solutions are leaving the original text (Arabic) put {{side by side with the}} translation, undertaking borrowing and calque, and annotating on the target text. ...|$|R

Although Christian religion from its beginning was embedded in the Hellenic world, its attitude towards Greek literature and learning, especially rhetoric and philosophy, was marked by ambivalence: on the one hand, it increasingly recognized the enormous benefits of using classical genres and discourses for defending and spreading belief; on the other hand, pagan elements continued to pose serious threats to Christian doctrine. This challenge resulted in a sophisticated, selective appropriation of traditional forms and techniques, until, after a complex interplay, Christian literature became co-extensive with Greek literature...|$|R
