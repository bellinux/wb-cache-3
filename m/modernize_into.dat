25|$|Fukuzawa {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} people ever that helped Japan <b>modernize</b> <b>into</b> the country it is today. He never accepted any high position and remained a normal Japanese citizen for his whole life. By the time of his death, he was revered as one of the founders of modern Japan. All of his work was written and was released at a critical juncture in the Japanese society and uncertainty for the Japanese people about their future after the signing of the Unequal treaties, their realization in the weakness of the Japanese government at the time (Tokugawa Shogunate) and its inability to repel the American and European influence. It should also be noted that there were bands of samurai that forcefully opposed the Americans and Europeans and their friends through murder and destruction. Fukuzawa was in danger of his life as a samurai group killed one of his colleagues for advocating policies like those of Fukuzawa. Fukuzawa wrote at a time when the Japanese people were undecided on whether they should be bitter about the American and European forced treaties and imperialism, or to understand the West and move forward. Fukuzawa greatly aided the ultimate success of the pro-modernization forces.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the first}} {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) mission being flown on Aug 22 1849 to bomb Venice UAVs have only recently began to <b>modernize</b> <b>into</b> sophisticated tools beyond simple aerial vehicles. With {{an increasing number of}} potential applications, such as cargo delivery, communications, search and rescue, law enforcement, and homeland security, the need for appropriate UAV technology advancement also arose. Here, the development of a low-cost collision avoidance system is described. Hardware was tested and selected based on predetermined constraints and goals. Additionally, a variety of potential functions were explored and assessed at their effectiveness in preventing a collision of a UAV with mountainous terrain. Simulations were conducted using Cloud Cap’s Piccolo autopilot in conjunction with Matlab. Based on these simulations, a set of potential functions was selected to be used with the chosen hardware on subsequent UAV-development-related projects...|$|E
