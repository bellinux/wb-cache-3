500|$|In 1835, Clifford {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts legislature, where he sat on a {{committee}} that revised the state's statutes. [...] In 1836 he served as an aide to Governor Edward Everett, a position he held until Everett lost the 1839 election. [...] Everett rewarded Clifford for his service by naming him district attorney for the southern district of the state in 1839, a post he held for ten years. [...] He was concurrently elected state senator representing Bristol County in 1845. [...] In 1849 he was appointed state attorney general by Governor George N. Briggs. [...] He was the only major appointed Whig official retained by Democrat George S. Boutwell after he took office in 1851. [...] Boutwell explained in his memoirs that Clifford [...] "was a good officer and an upright man, but he lacked the quality which enables a man to reach conclusions. [...] This peculiarity made him useful to me. He would investigate a subject, give me the authorities and precedents, and leave the conclusions to <b>me.</b> <b>Next,</b> {{there was no one in}} the administration party whom I wished to appoint. Mr. [...] Hallett was the candidate most generally supported. He was full of prejudices and he was not well instructed as a lawyer. In these respects Clifford was his opposite." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 28, 2015, the Dodgers announced—via {{a series}} of cue cards {{presented}} by comedian Jimmy Kimmel on the Dodger Stadium video board—that Scully would be back for the 2016 season, his 67th with the Dodgers. At a press conference August 29, Scully said 2016 would probably be his final year. [...] "I mean, how much longer can you go on fooling people? So yeah, I would be saying, 'Dear God, if you give <b>me</b> <b>next</b> year, I will hang it up.|$|E

2500|$|Puyi {{noted that}} {{to travel from}} just one {{building}} to another in the Forbidden City or for a stroll in the gardens, he was always surrounded by [...] "large retinue" [...] of eunuchs and that:"In front went an eunuch whose function was roughly that of a motor horn; he walked twenty or thirty yards ahead of the party intoning the sound “...chir ... chir...” {{as a warning to}} anyone who might be waiting in the vicinity to go away at once. Next came two Chief Eunuchs advancing crabwise {{on either side of the}} path; ten paces behind them came the centre of the procession. If I was being carried in a chair there would be two junior eunuchs walking beside me to attend to my wants at any moment; if I was walking they would be supporting <b>me.</b> <b>Next</b> came an eunuch with a large silk canopy followed by a large group of eunuchs, some empty-handed, others holding all sorts of things: a seat in case I wanted to rest, changes of clothing, umbrellas and parasols. After these eunuchs of the Imperial Presence came eunuchs of the Imperial tea bureau with boxes of various kinds of cakes and delicacies ... They were followed by eunuchs of the Imperial dispensary ... at the end of the procession came the eunuchs who carried commodes and chamberpots. If I was walking, a sedan-chair, open or covered according to the season, would bring up the rear. This motley procession of several dozen people would proceed in perfect silence and order".Puyi never had any privacy and had all his needs attended to at all times, having eunuchs open doors for him, dress him, wash him, and even blow air into his soup to cool it. Puyi delighted in humiliating his eunuchs, at one point, saying that as the [...] "Lord of TenThousand Years" [...] it was his right to order an eunuch to eat dirt, recalling: [...] "‘Eat that for me’ I ordered, and he knelt down and ate it". At his meals, Puyi was always presented with a huge buffet containing every conceivable dish, the vast majority of which he did not eat, and everyday Puyi wore new clothing as Chinese emperors never reused their clothing. The eunuchs had their own reasons for presenting Puyi with buffet meals and new clothing every day, as Puyi's used clothes made from the finest silk were sold on the black market while the food that Puyi did not eat was either sold or eaten by the eunuchs themselves.|$|E
