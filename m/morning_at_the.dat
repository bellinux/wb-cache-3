5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Others, the Simpson family find unexplained frosty {{chocolate}} milkshakes and that their TV only shows Married... with Children. After a ghost attacks him in his sleep, Homer summons the ghosts, who are the family's former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show. Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge who prefers him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost. The ghost Homer becomes jealous and bludgeons the living Homer {{to death with a}} toaster while he is in the bathtub. Bart fakes suicide to join the ghosts, tricking Lisa into actually killing herself, her ghost then murders Bart as revenge. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost.

A similar fate befell many of his supporters that night, while others were captured and tortured to extract {{the names of all}} the conspirators. Alexios Mourtzouphlos was likely put in prison for his role in this affair (he is known to have been in prison in 1203), and the two Komnenos brothers, Alexios and David, seem to have fled the capital immediately after the coup's failure.|$|E

He survived for 29 hours after the shooting before succumbing to his injuries.|$|E
25|$|Draws are {{conducted}} soon after all tickets {{are sold at}} the NSW Lotteries offices, and prizes can be claimed the day after; summaries are often printed in major newspapers. For Super Jackpot, on average one draw occurs each <b>morning</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> NSW Lotteries offices, and sometimes more than one.

Due to the delay between selling tickets and drawing them (particularly for Super Jackpot), a ticket purchased today may drawn several days from today; by that time, the jackpot amount advertised may have already been won by an earlier draw. NSW Lotteries now adds a disclaimer to this effect when advertising these lotteries.|$|E
