50|$|A freight {{forwarder}} offering a consolidation service, will issue its own air waybill or bill of lading. From now on AWB {{will be used}} to refer to both. This is called a Forwarder's or House AWB with its equivalent House BL. These act as contracts of carriage between the shipper and the forwarder, who in this case becomes a Deemed Carrier. The forwarder in turn enters into contracts with one or more carriers, often using more than one mode of transportation. The contract of carriage between the forwarder and carrier is called a <b>Master</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Waybill</b> (MAWB or MBL). A House Air Waybill (HAWB) or Bill of Lading (HBL) could act as a multimodal transport document.|$|E
50|$|International <b>air</b> <b>waybills</b> {{that contain}} {{consolidated}} cargo are called <b>master</b> <b>air</b> <b>waybills</b> (MAWB). MAWBs have additional papers called house <b>air</b> <b>waybills</b> (HAWB). Each HAWB contains information {{of each individual}} shipment (consignee, contents, etc.) within the consolidation. International AWBs that are not consolidated (only one shipment in one bill) are called simple AWBs. A house <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> can also be created by a freight forwarder. When the shipment is booked, the airline issues a MAWB to the forwarder, who in turn issues their own house <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> to the customer.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to complete an <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> through a computerised system. Agents {{all over the world}} are now using their own in-house computer systems to issue airlines' and freight forwarders' own <b>air</b> <b>waybills.</b> IATA cargo agents usually hold <b>air</b> <b>waybills</b> of several carriers. However, it gradually became difficult to accommodate these pre-numbered <b>air</b> <b>waybills</b> with the printed identification in the computer system. Therefore a neutral <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> was created.Both types of <b>air</b> <b>waybills</b> have the same format and layout. However, the neutral <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> does not bear any pre-printed individual name, head office address, logo and serial number.|$|R
5000|$|The {{format of}} the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> has been {{designed}} by IATA and these {{can be used for}} both domestic as well as international transportation. These are available in two forms, viz. the airline logo equipped <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> and the neutral air waybill.Usually, airline <b>air</b> <b>waybills</b> are distributed to IATA cargo agents by IATA airlines.The <b>air</b> <b>waybills</b> show: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is a {{contract}} - {{an agreement between}} the shipper and the carrier. The agent only acts as an intermediary between the shipper and carrier. The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is also {{a contract}} of good faith. This means that the shipper {{will be responsible for}} the haul also be liable for all the damage suffered by the airline or any person due to irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of insertions on the <b>air</b> <b>waybill,</b> even if the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> has been completed by an agent or the carrier on his behalf.|$|R
50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> (AWB) or <b>air</b> {{consignment}} note is a receipt issued {{by an international}} airline for goods and an evidence of the contract of carriage, {{but it is not}} a document of title to the goods. Hence, the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is non-negotiable.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> {{may be used}} as a bill or invoice {{together}} with supporting documents since it may indicate charges to be paid by the consignee, charges due to the agent or the carrier. An original copy of the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is used for the carrier's accounting ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is a contract, i.e. an {{agreement}} enforceable by law. To become a valid contract {{it has to}} be signed by the shipper or his agent and by the carrier or its authorised agent. Although the same individual or organisation may act on behalf of both the carrier and the shipper, the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> must be signed twice one each in the respective carrier and shipper boxes. Both signatures may be of the same person. This also implies that the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> should be issued immediately upon receipt of the goods and letter in instructions from the shipper.|$|R
50|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} document issued by a carrier either directly or through its authorised agent. It is a non-negotiable transport document. It covers transport of cargo from airport to airport. By accepting a shipment an IATA cargo agent is acting on behalf of the carrier whose <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is issued.|$|R
5000|$|Behind every {{original}} of the <b>Air</b> <b>Waybill</b> are {{conditions of}} contract for carriage.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{purposes}} that an <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> serves, but its main functions are: ...|$|R
50|$|As {{long as the}} <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> {{is neither}} dated nor signed twice, the goods do not fall within {{the terms of the}} {{conditions}} of contract and therefore the carrier will not accept any responsibility for the goods. The validity of the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> and thus the contract of carriage expires upon delivery of the shipment to the consignee (or his authorised agent).|$|R
50|$|IATA airline designators {{are used}} to {{identify}} an airline for commercial purposes in reservations, timetables, tickets, tariffs, <b>air</b> <b>waybills</b> and in telecommunications.|$|R
50|$|Waybills are {{non-negotiable}} documents unlike {{bills of}} lading which are negotiable. The words non-negotiable are printed clearly {{at the top}} of the <b>air</b> <b>waybill.</b> This means that the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> is a contract for transportation only and does not represent (the value of) merchandise mentioned in the box nature and quantity of goods. The ocean bill of lading, if negotiated, may represent (the value of) the goods and must be endorsed by the party ultimately accepting the goods.Although the AWB is a non-negotiable document, it can be used as a means of payment. This can be done only through the intermediary of a bank and only when the carriage is subject to a letter of credit. The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> executed according to the terms of a letter of credit allows the shipper to present the original of the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> to the bank and collect the billed value of the shipped goods from the bank. The amount paid by the bank to the shipper will be debited to the consignee who ordered the goods. At the destination the carrier will only hand over the goods to the consignee on receipt of a bank release order from the consignee's bankers.|$|R
50|$|Most {{airlines}} use {{a different}} form called an <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> which lists additional items such as airport of destination, flight number, and time.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>waybills</b> have eleven digit numbers {{which can}} be used to make bookings, check the status of delivery, and current {{position}} of the shipment.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> {{may also}} serve as an {{evidence}} if the carrier {{is in a position}} to insure the shipment and is requested to do so by the shipper.|$|R
5000|$|Although customs {{authorities}} require various documents like a commercial invoice, packing list, etc. the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> too is {{proof of the}} freight amount billed for the goods carried and {{may be needed to}} be presented for customs clearance ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>waybills</b> {{are issued}} in 8 sets of {{different}} colours. The first three copies {{are classified as}} originals. The first original, Green in colour, is the Issuing Carrier's copy. The second, coloured Pink, is the Consignee's Copy. The third, coloured Blue, is the Shipper's copy. A fourth Brown copy acts as the Delivery Receipt, or proof of delivery. The other three copies are white.|$|R
50|$|On 4 January 2011, {{the cargo}} {{division}} of the airline, Cathay Pacific Cargo, became the first airline operating out of Hong Kong to fully switch to e-air waybill. This {{eliminates the need for}} all paper documents when issuing <b>air</b> <b>waybills.</b> The International <b>Air</b> Transport Association (IATA) selected nine countries and territories and airlines in which to run the e-AWB pilot program, including Hong Kong and Cathay Pacific.|$|R
50|$|The rise of {{internet}} during {{in the years}} that followed contributed to increase the reliability and accessibility to the air cargo industry. Most airlines now offer to their customers real-time flight status and the booking and tracking options. In addition, the industry is adopting electronic procedures, such as the electronic <b>air</b> <b>waybill,</b> to reduce the amount of paper documentation accompanying each shipment and increasing the security and safety of the transportation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> must {{indicate}} that the goods have been accepted for carriage, {{and it must be}} signed or authenticated by the carrier or the named agent for or on behalf of the carrier. The signature or authentication of the carrier must be identified as carrier, {{and in the case of}} agent signing or authenticating, the name and the capacity of the carrier on whose behalf the agent signs or authenticates must be indicated.|$|R
5000|$|When the shipper {{delivers}} {{goods to}} be forwarded, {{he will get}} a receipt. The receipt is proof that the shipment was handed over in good order and condition and also that the shipping instructions, as contained in the Shipper's Letter of Instructions, are acceptable. After completion, an original copy of the <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> {{is given to the}} shipper as evidence of the acceptance of goods and as proof of contract of carriage ...|$|R
50|$|The {{rights of}} the {{consignee}} under an <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> are regulated by the Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, 1929 and the Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air 1999 and the relevant state laws (which may be one law chosen as the proper law by the parties, or any combination of laws representing the seller, buyer, consignor, and carrier.)This is very important as per export documents.|$|R
50|$|Imported {{goods are}} {{generally}} {{accompanied by a}} bill of lading or <b>air</b> <b>waybill</b> describing the goods. For purposes of customs duty assessment, they must also be accompanied by an invoice documenting the transaction value. The goods on the bill of lading and invoice are classified and duty is computed by the importer or CBP. The amount of this duty is payable immediately, and must be paid before the goods can be imported. Most assessments of goods are now done by the importer and documentation filed with CBP electronically.|$|R

50|$|Not all cadets who {{join the}} ATC {{can expect to}} receive promotion. However, all cadets can {{progress}} through the training system and, by passing exams, achieve different classifications. The classification levels are Junior Cadet, Second Class Cadet (this is automatically achieved on enrolment), First Class Cadet, Leading Cadet, Senior Cadet and <b>Master</b> <b>Air</b> Cadet. In order to achieve these qualifications, cadets study a variety of subjects through tuition from the instructors and/or self-study from Ultilearn. Each successive qualification generally allows a cadet greater participation in ATC activities. Cadets who have achieved the <b>Master</b> <b>air</b> cadet classification have completed their academic training and can attain a BTEC Level 2 in Aviation Studies (Equivalent to 4 GCSEs A-C).|$|R
