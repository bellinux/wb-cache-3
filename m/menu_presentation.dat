Some early efforts have been made to utilize both technologies in food ordering system implementations. However, the food ordering systems that have been proposed earlier exhibit limitations, primarily in cost effectiveness, allowing customizations and supporting real-time feedback to customers. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a customizable wireless food ordering system with real-time customer feedback for a restaurant (CWOS-RTF). The CWOS-RTF enables restaurant owners to setup the system in wireless environment and update <b>menu</b> <b>presentations</b> easily. Smart phone has been integrated in the CWOS-RTF implementation to facilitate real-time communication between restaurant owners and customers. A preliminary testing suggests that the CWOS-RTF has the potential to eliminate the limitations of existing food ordering systems...|$|R

40|$|Designers of {{computer}} programs have opinions on psychological issues. Humans are so flexible that they finally {{are able to}} work with computers they design. This thesis compares common design practice with psychology based designs. Several simple tasks of passengers are analysed in depth: •	Finding a station in a list of stations; •	Noticing that a ticket vending machine is out of order; •	Inserting a card for payment; •	Finding a train on a trains indicator; •	Finding a train on a destinations indicator. Misunderstandings and errors that passengers make using conventional information were observed and explained. Presentations that do not induce misunderstandings and errors are suggested and tested. The suggested unconventional designs induce fewer errors, require less time to understand the provided information, are cheaper and reduce travel time substantially. The knowledge obtained can also be used for time tables on paper, drink vending machines, sign posting, presentation {{of computer}} directories, computer <b>menu’s</b> and <b>presentations</b> for professionals such as drivers of high speed trains.

40|$|Food {{quality is}} one of the most sought for when a {{customer}} visit a restaurant. It is the most important element that will satisfy the needs and expectations of restaurant customers. Given the importance of food quality to every restaurant, it is still difficult to constitute the consensus of individual attributes that contribute to food quality. A thorough review of the literature revealed that the general description of food quality attributes are (a) freshness, (b) taste, (c) healthy options, (d) variety of <b>menu,</b> (e) <b>presentations,</b> and (f) temperature. In relation to that, the Malaysian government has come up with the idea of 1 Malaysia Menu that is supposedly to be affordable and desirable for all Malaysians. However, to date, no studies were found to have examined whether Malaysians are satisfied with the quality of food related to the 1 Malaysia Menu. For that purpose, questionnaires have been distributed among students from Universiti Utara Malaysia to see about their perception about the quality of food from the 1 Malaysia Menu. Results from the survey were examined to see whether there is any relationship between the six food quality attributes and the customers‘ satisfaction about the 1 Malaysia Menu...|$|R

30|$|About {{their food}} truck {{business}} being innovative, most answers were affirmative and, again, justified by differences in <b>menu</b> and product <b>presentation.</b> This indicates a predominantly divergent understanding of “innovation” proposed by Schumpeter (1961), the main assumption underlying this research. For the public studied in this research, innovating can be simply having a “different recipe from others”, “bringing something new” or “seeing {{what the market}} wants {{and what is not}} available”. Such propositions are much more aligned with the concepts of Hawk (2013) and Kregor (2015), or essentially the search for viable and cost-effective economic alternatives, especially considering a crisis scenario, as can be found in GEM (2013; 2015). Nevertheless, as proposes Doody, Chen & Goldstein (2016) and Johnston (2008) such characteristics refer to the communication of these products as artisanal and local, and it is essential to the success of these ventures.|$|R
50|$|The Editing Model is a {{specialization}} {{of grammar}} based UIMS. They present all interaction as direct presentations of underlying presentation objects. Essentially, using the grammar of the programming language as the grammar for the GUI. A scroll bar may present an integer, a check box may present a boolean, a function {{is presented as}} a button or menu item. A dialog box or a <b>menu</b> is a <b>presentation</b> of a complex object containing properties and functions. A controller layer automatically synchronizes the object with the presentation and vice versa through a two way connection provided by an Observer pattern. Enable/disable and validation present special challenges under the editing model, but they can be dealt with. A commercial program, ViewSoft Internet, was briefly available in the 1990s that implemented a general purpose GUI builder based upon the Editing Model.|$|R
40|$|Designing {{an agent}} to {{participate}} in natural conversation requires more than just adapting a standard agent model to perceive and produce language. In particular, the model must be augmented with social attitudes (including mutual belief, shared plans, and obligations) and a notion of discourse context. The dialogue manager of the TRAINS- 93 NL conversation system embodies such an augmented theory of agency. This paper focuses on the representation of mental state and discourse context and the deliberation strategies used in the agent model of the dialogue manager. 1 INTRODUCTION A dialogue manager {{is that part of}} a dialogue system that connects the I/O devices and translators (whether they be spoken or typed language, a command language, <b>menu</b> selection, graphical <b>presentation,</b> etc.) to the parts that do the domain task reasoning and performance.

40|$|CAD systems {{offer new}} and {{improved}} techniques for the presentation of designs. This paper presents several of these techniques that are based upan computer-generated images of a 3 -dimensional computer model of a design. These new techniques include holography, animating and virtual reality. Some of the techniques that can be improved by CAD systems are paper scale modelling and stereoscopy. The paper describes: - presentation purposes, such as showing a design or explainingfunctional or technical - presentation activities, such as modelling a design or generating images; - presentation techniques, as mentioned above. There exists {{a relationship between the}} purpose of a presentation, the presentation techniques employed and the production activities. Because production activities can be very time consuming, the purpose of the presentation and the preferred techniques should normally be well specified {{at the beginning of a}} presentation production to make the latter creative productive. However, since most of the comnputer-basedpresenlatian techniques are still new to most designers, ii will be verry difficult to make the right specifications of purpose, techniques and activities at the beginning of the production process. That means that there is a need for a better understanding ofthe techniques and for a more flexible way of producing presentations of designs. Calibre has developed tools to make the production ofpresentations more flexible. One of the tools is a program (ModelCom) that converts different 3 -dimensional computer models of designs (design models) into models for different prograins that are able to generate images. Another tool is a program (ImageCom) for converting different generated images into image descriptions for different presentation techniques. These tools are of great importance for Calibre's exploration of various techniques for the presentation of design models. This exploration gives Calibre the unique opportunity to present a varied <b>menu</b> of <b>presentation</b> techniques and related future expectations...|$|R
5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for €30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game is targeted to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, <b>menu,</b> and <b>presentation.</b> Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game are new to the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; after a few seconds, a house falls on top of them, and then several people leave and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation of this game is available in Brain Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak the correct answer into the microphone as soon as possible.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three essays {{under the}} umbrella of behavioral research on price partitioning. The first essay examined consumers' responses to financially equivalent prix fixe menu prices with a built-in gratuity, a separately listed percentage gratuity or a separately listed dollar gratuity at surcharge levels different from the 15 % tipping benchmark. I demonstrated that surcharge level moderated the relationship between <b>menu</b> price <b>presentation</b> and consumers' deal perception and this moderating effect {{can be explained by the}} evaluability of the individual price components within a partitioned price. The second essay further explored surcharge framing by studying the differential effects of voluntary versus mandatory service gratuity on consumers' menu price perception and demand. Findings from three experiments indicated that a Sunday brunch price with 15 % customary tipping led to a lower perceived expensiveness and higher patronage intent than the same price with a 15 % mandatory service gratuity. More importantly, through process measure analyses and mediation tests, the studies provided converging evidence that participants' use of surcharge and perceived surcharge fairness acted in parallel and with similar strengths as mediators of the relationship between surcharge policy and menu price perception. I also found that participant's patronage intent was mediated by both surcharge fairness perception and price expensiveness perception, although the impact of the former mediator was significantly stronger. As an extension of my empirical work using a multi-process approach to studying price partitioning effects, the third dissertation essay described an integrative framework on the psychological mechanisms for processing partitioned prices. Based on a review and synthesis of extant research, I identified seven processing routes and suggested that an individual will take a particular route to process a partitioned price depending on five key characteristics of its secondary price component. This integrative model can adequately yet parsimoniously differentiate among the various psychological mechanisms underlying the price partitioning effects and potentially resolve some inconsistent findings in the literature. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} a nutrition education program for men on healthy eating when dining out. The Health Belief Model provided the basic framework to identify factors that would potentially motivate men over 40 to change their dietary behavior to reduce heart disease risk. Roundtable discussions were held to identify nutrition needs. A 10 minute "Dine Right with MENu Insight" slide program on low-fat eating away from home was developed. Three educational messages were the key concepts of the program: 1) relationship between diet and health, 2) proportionality, variety and moderation as themes of the Food Guide Pyramid and 3) low-fat food choices at home and away. A four page handout was developed to supplement the slide show presentation. Four programs were presented to a total of 148 people (136 males, 12 females) at Rotary and Kiwanis groups in Corvallis and Albany, Oregon in January and February, 1994. Each program included a pretest, the "Dine Right with <b>MENu</b> Insight" slide <b>presentation</b> and a group discussion. Of the 136 males, forty-eight volunteered (aged 40 - 60 years) and completed the 10 - 15 minute follow-up phone post-test 3 - 4 weeks after attending the program.

40|$|The central {{cultural}} contradiction of capitalism, argued Bell some 25 years ago, was {{the existence}} of rationalized, disciplined production alongside free and hedonistic consumption. This paper argues that this thesis, although overstated, has resonance within contemporary capitalism. The paper then considers {{the question of how}} this contradiction is managed when production and consumption meet directly within the service interaction. On the production-side rationalization is joined by customer-orientation, and on the consumption-side management promotes consumption of the enchanting myth of sovereignty. Here the customer is meant to experience a sense of being sovereign. At the same time the space is created for the customer to be, potentially, substantively directed and influenced to follow the requirements that flow from the rationalized elements of production. Key aspects of the service interaction, including the <b>menu</b> and its <b>presentation,</b> the display of empathy and aesthetic labour, and the use of naming within the service interaction, are analysed in terms of the promotion of the enchanting myth of sovereignty. Consumption, however, is a fragile process, and remains, to an important degree, 'unmanageable'. The analysis, therefore, also examines how the promotion of the enchanting myth of sovereignty systematically creates the conditions for the myth's negation.

40|$|This thesis {{builds on}} {{previous}} research on effects of price presentation order on consumer choice. Previous research has used primarily offline stimuli, such as restaurant <b>menus</b> and sequential <b>presentation</b> of apartments to examine price order effects. This study adds online SaaS plan pricing tables as a new entry to that set of stimuli. Further, no previous study has examined the price order effect {{and the effect of}} a free choice in the same experiment, which is a novel contribution from this thesis to the area of research. A mixed factorial experiment design was employed, in which participants were randomly assigned to 4 treatments differing on the price presentation order and the presence of a free choice. Respondents had to choose a plan on two pricing tables. The two pricing tables differed on product category familiarity, the within-subjects factor, which tested results from previous research in the new SaaS context. Effects of price presentation order, presence of a free choice, and product category familiarity were tested against plan choice. The results confirm that price presentation order affects consumer choice, as found in previous research. Contrary to previous research, product category familiarity did not moderate the effect of price presentation order on plan choice, which may be a consequence of a weaker than expected manipulation. The presence of a free choice was not found to have an effect on plan choice...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} an educational and environmental intervention on the availability and consumption {{of fruits and vegetables}} in workplace cafeterias. Design: This was a randomized intervention study involving a sample of companies that were divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention, which focused on change in the work environment, was based on an ecological model for health promotion. It involved several different aspects including <b>menu</b> planning, food <b>presentation</b> and motivational strategies to encourage the consumption of fruits and vegetables. The impact of the intervention was measured by changes (between baseline and follow-up) in the availability of fruits and vegetables that were eaten per consumer in meals and the consumption of fruits and vegetables in the workplace by workers. We also evaluated the availability of energy, macronutrients and fibre. Settings: Companies of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Subjects: Twenty-nine companies and 2510 workers. Results: After the intervention we found an average increase in the availability of fruits and vegetables of 49 g in the intervention group, an increase of approximately 15 %, whereas the results for the control group remained practically equal to baseline levels. During the follow-up period, the intervention group also showed reduced total fat and an increase in fibre in the meals offered. The results showed a slight but still positive increase in the workers` consumption of fruits and vegetables (about 11 g) in the meals offered by the companies. Conclusions: Interventions focused on the work environment can be effective in promoting the consumption of healthy foods. National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} precise UML-based {{authoring}} method for Web applications. This authoring method {{is part of}} the UML-based Web Engineering (UWE) approach. Starting with a requirement analysis done by use cases technique, it focuses on the design phase. The conceptual model of the application is used as guideline for modeling the navigation space. From the navigation space model we derive, in a next step, a navigation structure model which shows how to navigate through the navigation space using access elements like indexes, guided tours, queries and <b>menus.</b> Finally, a <b>presentation</b> model is constructed based on the navigation structure model. It provides an appropriate UML notation to support sketching and storyboarding. In addition, we suggest to use UML interaction diagrams to represent the presentation flow. During the whole development process we identify steps that can be performed in an automatic way thus providing the basis for a generation mechanism for Web application design. The different models of the design process are represented by using a UML conform extension of UML for Web applications (UML profile). The authoring process is illustrated with an example: a Web [...] based conference review system. The strength of the presented Web engineering approach is given by the fact that we use exclusively the UML notation and techniques. Moreover, our specification of constraints with OCL (part of UML) allows augmenting the exactitude of the models. In the same way our methodology has a high degree of precision in the description of guidelines of the authoring process of Web application, which can even partially be automated.

40|$|Since 1986 Data Communications {{has been}} taught to both {{internal}} and external students of the Central Queesland University(CQU), formerly Capricorn Institute of Advanced Education(CIAE). Throughout this period, staff have struggled to meet the challenge of creating an engaging educational experience that can be delivered to all students. In an effort to transport the classroom to the external student we have developed a set of multimedia resource materials, appropriate for flexible delivery, to be distributed to students studying Data Communications in their second year of a Bachelor of Information Technology or Bachelor of Information Systems. In recent years internal students have been exposed to physical materials in the lecture and tutorial environment. Their reaction has been very positive and outcomes include enhanced understanding and reasoning. In contrast, external students have little or no opportunity for this type of exposure through their distance study program. The objective of the project we have undertaken is to provide all students, especially external students, with a virtual laboratory environment where they can be exposed to the physical and technical aspects of electronic communications equipment. Many of the other virtual laboratories or classrooms that have been developed by other Australian or overseas Universities have been developed to be delivered via the Internet and sometimes include interactivity [4], or simulations/animations [2]. The majority of topic areas that have been transformed into virtual laboratories have come from the areas of Science, Engineering or Mathematics. In these areas the ability to test theories or perform experiments is crucial to knowledge formation and assessment. The project is constructed of a <b>menu</b> based Multimedia <b>presentation</b> to be distributed on CD-ROM that leads students through photographs, audio and video that would normally be seen in lectures, laboratories and tours enabling us to effectively disseminate this otherwise inaccessible experience to all students.
