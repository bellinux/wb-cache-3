I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved a}} very {{suitable}} and happy connexion, my wife {{being a woman}} of an excellent understanding, much improved by reading, of great fortitude and strength of mind, and of a temper in the highest degree affectionate and generous; feeling strongly for others, and little for herself. Also, greatly excelling in every thing relating to household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all concern of that kind, which allowed me to give all <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> the prosecution of my studies, and the other duties of my station.|$|E
500|$|Once Texas {{switched}} to the zone read offense, they quickly started gaining yards and points. Charles ran for a career-high 290yards, including 216yards and threelong touchdown runs in the fourthquarter. [...] His tally also set a new record for rushing against the Cornhuskers, surpassing the old record of 247yards by Oklahoma’s Billy Simms. [...] Charles explained [...] "It was <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> show everyone what I can do. [...] When I saw a hole, I blasted through it."

500|$|Danie Pienaar, {{now head}} of South African National Parks Scientific Services, survived the bite of a black mamba without {{antivenom}} in 1998. Although no antivenom was administered, Pienaar was in a serious condition, despite the hospital physicians having declared it a [...] "moderate" [...] black mamba envenomation. At one point, Pienaar lapsed into a coma and his prognosis was declared [...] "poor". Upon arrival at hospital Pienaar was immediately intubated, given supportive drug therapy, put on mechanical ventilation and placed on life support for three days, until the toxins were flushed out of his system. He was released from hospital on the fifth day. Pienaar believes he survived for several reasons. In an article in Kruger Park Times he said [...] "Firstly, it was not <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> go." [...] The article went on to state, [...] "The fact that he stayed calm and moved slowly definitely helped. The tourniquet was also essential." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{establishing}} {{a friendship with}} recording artist Miley Cyrus in 2013, Gregory E. Miller from the New York Post noted that the media and general public would continue [...] "following her every move". Ferreira commented that [...] " [...] obviously way bigger and all eyes [...] on her, but I feel like we're kind of going through a similar thing where everyone's {{trying to say that}} we're trying to make ourselves objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that—sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It's nice to have someone that gets it." [...] Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for Night Time, <b>My</b> <b>Time,</b> <b>to</b> which she responded [...] "there's nothing about that photo that's pornographic; we came on this earth nude." [...] Ferreira is also a feminist, which has influenced her work; she has said [...] "I feel like I'm doing a bad job of being a feminist if I'm not making someone angry." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since I have my own studio I was able to perfect it and take <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that {{had a lot to do}} with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E

Days later, Ljungberg agreed to terminate his contract only after one year into the four-year deal for a sum of £6 million. Ljungberg stated afterward, [...] "I gave my all at West Ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us.

2500|$|Henry {{remained}} a first-team regular during the 2011–12 season, {{playing in the}} club's first ever League One match, a 0–0 draw with Exeter City. He went on to make 40 appearances during the campaign, with the Stevenage defence being particularly strong once again. However, he suffered an injury following the club's 1–1 home draw against Preston North End on 9 April 2012. The game ultimately {{turned out to be}} Henry's last match for the club. After spending seven years at Stevenage, Henry left the club when his contract expired in May 2012. On leaving Stevenage, he stated — [...] "I have had an absolutely unbelievable time with the club and I couldn't have wished to have spent seven years anywhere else. I just feel that now is <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> move on". He made a total of 329 appearances during his seven-year tenure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{skepticism}} on Wikipedia effort grew after presentations at SkeptiCalcon and a Sunday paper {{presentation at}} The Amaz!ng Meeting and she created a blog on the subject. She {{stated that the}} formal beginning of GSoW is May 2010, yet its birthday is celebrated in June. Gerbic is often asked about her Wikipedia contributions and edits: [...] "I discovered {{that there are people}} in our community that have been {{looking for a way to}} become more involved but need more structure, support, and training." [...] When people ask how they can help the skeptical movement, Gerbic is quick to suggest that they, too, learn to edit Wikipedia: [...] "We rewrite Wikipedia, and proof the pages, we remove citations that are not noteworthy, we add citations, we do just about everything in Wikipedia to improve content." [...] Emery Emery asked Gerbic: [...] "This was a need right?" [...] Gerbic responded: [...] "I was trying to find something to do. It was <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> step up and take on some responsibility... I'd attended the lectures, I'd read the books, it was my time." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 31, 1968, {{following}} the New Hampshire primary and Kennedy's {{entry into the}} election, the president announced to the nation in a televised speech that he was suspending all bombing of North Vietnam in favor of peace talks. Johnson concluded his speech and startled the nation by announcing [...] "With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes {{for peace in the}} balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of <b>my</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office—the presidency of your country. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President." [...] Not discussed publicly at the time was Johnson's concern he might not survive another term—Johnson's health was poor, and he had suffered a serious heart attack in 1955 while serving in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, he died on January 22, 1973, only two days after the new presidential term concluded. Bleak political forecasts also contributed to Johnson's withdrawal; internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly.|$|E
