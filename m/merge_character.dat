50|$|During the event, {{pairs of}} Marvel and DC <b>characters</b> were <b>merged</b> into single <b>characters.</b> The same {{was done with}} teams and fictional locations. Usually the <b>merged</b> <b>characters</b> had {{something}} in common (for example, the four-member Jack Kirby creations of the Fantastic Four and Challengers of the Unknown, or water-themed heroes Namor the Sub-Mariner and Aquaman), or their names or themes allowed for clever combinations (such as Superman and Captain America's amalgamation, Super-Soldier, {{a reference to the}} Super Soldier serum that created Captain America; Bat-Thing, an amalgamation of Man-Bat and Man-Thing; or Shatterstarfire, the amalgamation of Shatterstar and Starfire).|$|R

In condensing the script, Fell used considerably fewer characters and locations. This included resetting the location from a radio telescope to a signals intelligence ground station. Fell also <b>merged</b> several <b>characters</b> - for instance, Judy Adamson and Christine were <b>merged</b> into the <b>character</b> of Christine; the Madeline Dawnay character combined the roles of both the original Dawnay character and that of Rheinhart while General Vandenberg took {{on the role of}} many of the authority figures from the original.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper studied {{character}} recognition on medicine bottle label containing batch number, production date and expiry date. It mainly consisted of character location, character segmentation and {{character recognition}}. Firstly, it preprocessed {{the image of}} medicine bottle label for the following procedures; secondly, it obtained the general character region by contour tracing and realized the precise location by horizontal projection algorithm; then it located character adhesion region by vertical projection algorithm and segmented the <b>merged</b> <b>characters</b> by drop fall algorithm; finally, it adopted Karhunen-Loeve transform to extract character features from the subclasses of coarse classification and accurately recognized characters by the improved BP algorithm. Experiments show that the system can recognize the bottle label characters quickly and accurately, it is of great practical value.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a document image processing system implemented {{on a set}} of parallel processors. A preprocessing stage is first used to correct skew from scanned document images. The corrected image is segmented and labelled in a two-step Minimum Containing Rectangle (MCR) detection stage. Text Block Filtering (TBF) is then done heuristically and the filtered blocks are submitted to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for recognition of characters. Smoothing of the document image is done during MLPbased character recognition to reduce the preprocessing time. It also reduces the formation of <b>merged</b> <b>characters,</b> a main source of recognition errors in conventional approaches. The MLP identifies the bold words during recognition which are used for automatic indexing of documents. Data is partitioned exploiting the inherent parallelism in a document image data. Communication overhead is small compared to the computation time so that a high degree of parallelization is achieved, reducing the to [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In optical {{character}} recognition of very old books, the recognition accuracy drops mainly due to the merging or breaking of characters. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to segment <b>merged</b> Kannada <b>characters</b> by using a hypothesis to select the positions to be cut. This method searches for the best possible positions to segment, by {{taking into account the}} support vector machine classifier's recognition score and the validity of the aspect ratio (width to height ratio) of the segments between every pair of cut positions. The hypothesis to select the cut position is {{based on the fact that}} a concave surface exists above and below the touching portion. These concave surfaces are noted down by tracing the valleys in the top contour of the image and similarly doing it for the image rotated upside-down. The cut positions are then derived as closely matching valleys of the original and the rotated images. Our proposed segmentation algorithm works well for different font styles, shapes and sizes better than the existing vertical projection profile based segmentation. The proposed algorithm has been tested on 1125 different word images, each containing multiple <b>merged</b> <b>characters,</b> from an old Kannada book and 89. 6 % correct segmentation is achieved and the character recognition accuracy of merged words is 91. 2 %. A few points of merge are still missed due to the absence of a matched valley due to the specific shapes of the particular characters meeting at the merges...|$|R

40|$|Segmentation of {{handwritten}} text in Gurmukhi {{script is}} an uphill task {{primarily because of}} the structural features of the script and varied writing styles. The presence of a horizontal line connecting characters of a word (i. e. head line), half characters and overlapping of some vowel between middle and lower zone of a word make the task even more difficult. Handwritten text is also prone to the problem of overlapped, connected and <b>merged</b> <b>characters</b> with in a word. Structural features are helpful in segmentation of machine printed text but these are of little help for segmentation of handwritten words. The proposed technique segments the words in an iterative manner by focusing on presence of headline, aspect ratio of characters and vertical and horizontal projection profiles. The proposed approach of segmentation can be used for handwritten text of Indian language scripts like Devnagri, Bangla etc. having structural feature similar to Gurmukhi script. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} system that {{segments}} machine-printed text of various fonts, styles and sizes for the Roman alphabet and numerals. The system consists of four major computational modules: multiline processing, single line processing, structural analysis, and merged-character splitting. The multiline process is designed to segment fixed-pitch text and is especially effective for broken and dot matrix characters. The process {{is based on the}} inherent property of fixed-pitch fonts that gaps must occur at fixed intervals in lines of text. The single line processing, structural analysis and the splitting modules are designed for segmenting proportional pitch text. The single line processing consists of procedures such as vertical projection based segmentation and grouping broken characters. The structural analysis is designed to segment kerned characters, punctuation marks, and also to group broken characters and characters with more than one component. The splitting module is designed to split touched and <b>merged</b> <b>characters</b> in proportional and/or serif fonts. The proposed segmentation system is evaluated using actual address block images from the U. S. mail stream. 1...|$|R

Here, Ororo is a mutant with superpowers who nearly drowns as a child, but is rescued by Queen Hippolyta of the Amazons. Whereas her mainstream counterpart develops acute claustrophobia, this Ororo develops a fear of drowning. Hippolyta raises young Ororo as an Amazon princess beside her own daughter Diana (see Wonder Woman) {{on the island of}} Themiscyra.

50|$|Highlander: Endgame, first {{released}} on September 1, 2000, {{was an attempt}} to <b>merge</b> <b>characters</b> from both the original film and from the Highlander TV series. The story follows Duncan MacLeod as he confronts Jacob Kell, an evil Immortal who has assembled a group of fellow warriors, as well as an impressive body-count. Kell, who holds a centuries-old grudge against the elder Connor MacLeod, has slain Connor's dearest loved ones, and he does not follow the traditions of single combat. Connor has spent a decade trying to escape the Game in a hidden Watcher fortress known as the Sanctuary, but he and Duncan are forced to confront this new threat that neither one of them alone can succeed against. As the two MacLeods will not break the single-combat tradition, Connor convinces Duncan to decapitate him, thus gaining the power that he needs to defeat Kell. This directly contradicts Highlander 2: The Quickening, in which Connor MacLeod, is seen in the future, as an old man. However, Highlander 2 also features a method whereby one Immortal can resurrect another so it does not necessarily create a paradox.|$|R
