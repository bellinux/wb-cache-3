500|$|Notwithstanding Eisenhower's {{estimation}} of Patton's abilities {{as a strategic}} planner, his overall view of Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe can best be seen in Eisenhower's refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, [...] "Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] As Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy told Eisenhower: [...] "Lincoln's remark after they got after Grant comes to <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think of Patton– 'I can't spare this man, he fights'." [...] After Patton's death, Eisenhower would write his own tribute: [...] "He {{was one of those}} men born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader... It is no exaggeration to say that Patton's name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Bono was {{influenced}} by the work of Delmore Schwartz when writing the lyrics of [...] "Acrobat", to whom the song is dedicated. The title of one of his short stories, In Dreams Begin Responsibilities, is quoted in the final verse. Bono noted the book [...] "was on my <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was writing the words... It's hard to wrap the book up in a few lines, but Delmore Schwartz is kind of a formalist... I'm the opposite. I'm in the mud as a writer, so I could do with a bit of , and that's why I enjoy him." [...] The song was developed from a riff guitarist The Edge developed during a soundcheck in Auckland, New Zealand, on the Lovetown Tour in 1989. He noted that the beat is unusual for a U2 song, saying it [...] "was the jumping off point, to try and do something with an unusual beat." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{a writing}} session at McCartney's house in north London, Lennon and McCartney {{fine-tuned}} the lyrics, using {{an approach that}} author Howard Sounes likens to the cut-up technique popularised by William Burroughs. [...] "I didn't copy the accident," [...] Lennon said. [...] "Tara didn't blow his mind out, {{but it was in}} my <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the song—not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene—were similarly part of the fiction." [...] McCartney expounded on the subject: [...] "The verse about the politician blowing his mind out in a car we wrote together. It has been attributed to Tara Browne, the Guinness heir, which I don't believe is the case, certainly as we were writing it, I was not attributing it to Tara in my head. In John's head it might have been. In my head I was imagining a politician bombed out on drugs who'd stopped at some traffic lights and didn't notice that the lights had changed. The 'blew his mind' was purely a drugs reference, nothing to do with a car crash." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my <b>mind.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 23 December 2016, a {{day before}} her return, it was {{reported}} that Michelle would be returning, but that the part had been recast to Jenna Russell. Of her casting, Russell said: [...] "It is a great honour to play such an iconic character. I know the audience loved Michelle Fowler so much, and even though she hasn’t been on our screen for 20 years, she’s very much in the fans’ psyche. When I used to watch EastEnders all those years ago, she was one of my favourite characters. I’m extremely excited for what is in store for Michelle." [...] Executive producer Sean O'Connor said he is [...] "thrilled to have secured Jenna Russell to play Michelle Fowler, one of the show’s most celebrated characters" [...] and [...] "the Square really has missed her over the past twenty years." [...] O'Connor added, [...] "Jenna was always in <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> [...] first started planning for Michelle’s return". O'Connor also said Michelle is [...] "still flawed, complicated and infuriating after two decades away, but still loveable all the same. It’s going to be appointment TV watching Michelle’s car crash of a life unravel all over again." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Loser" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} in March 1993 as a 12" [...] vinyl single on Bong Load, with only 500 copies pressed. Beck felt that [...] "Loser" [...] was mediocre, and only agreed to its release at Rothrock's insistence. [...] "Loser" [...] unexpectedly received radio airplay, starting in Los Angeles, where college radio station KXLU {{was the first}} to play it, followed by modern rock station KROQ-FM. The song then spread to Seattle through KNDD, and KROQ-FM began playing the song on an almost hourly basis. By the time stations in New York were requesting copies of [...] "Loser", Bong Load had already run out. Beck was soon beset with offers to sign with major labels. Convinced that the song was a potential hit, Rothrock gave a vinyl pressing of the single to his friend Tony Berg, who had been working in the A department for Geffen Records. Berg said, [...] "I just lost my <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard it. He left my office, and I swear, {{by the time he got}} home, I had left a message asking him to introduce me to [...] ". Beck, in spite of his hesitance to be on any major label, signed with Geffen subsidiary DGC. He explained, [...] "I wasn't going to do anything for a long time, but Bong Load didn't have the means to make as many copies as people wanted. Geffen were involved and they wanted to make it to more of an organized place, one with a bigger budget and better distribution." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a topical}} 1973 storyline, Erica aborts the baby she conceives {{with her first}} husband, Jeff Martin (Charles Frank). This is the first legal {{abortion}} aired on American television since the landmark Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling. However, Maude Findlay had an abortion on Maude the year before, after New York legalized the practice. Erica was chosen for this storyline {{as a way to}} prevent controversy. Since she was a bad girl and not one of the heroines, her choice would not be viewed as something the show supported. The show also protected themselves from controversy by writing Erica as mentally blocking out the abortion and, for a time, believing she miscarried. Viewers loved the story and Erica became a symbol of free choice. Erica develops a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion. [...] "Erica's abortion was simply because she didn't want to have a child, and I think if you do that now, you would perhaps hurt your character," [...] said former All My Children head writer Megan McTavish. McTavish later rewrote the story so the doctor, Greg Madden (Ian Buchanan), transplants the aborted fetus into his infertile wife. They raise the child, Josh Madden (Colin Egglesfield), as their son without Erica's knowledge. Inkling Magazine pointed out how unrealistic this storyline was because [...] "the techniques by which abortion is performed don't exactly lend themselves to excising an embryo viable enough to survive in another woman's womb." [...] The magazine said more likelihood existed in the possibility that Madden harvested Erica's eggs during the procedure, though an invasive surgery like that going unnoticed appeared unlikely as well. Egglesfield gained different information on the probability of the story. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, he said, [...] "Actually, my father is an obstetrician/gynecologist and my brother is a doctor, as is one of my best friends, and their collective opinion is that this is possible; it is possible to take a fetus out of one woman and place it into the womb of another woman, but it's only possible within the first week of pregnancy, before the fetus actually starts attaching itself to the uterine lining." [...] In the storyline, Greg harbors an obsession with Erica, which motivates him to choose her for the transplant in the first place. Greg and Josh make their first appearances in 2005. Greg's wife recently died and he moves to Pine Valley for closer proximity to Erica under the guise of opening a clinic. Josh follows him soon afterward and, not knowing Erica is his mother, attempts to destroy Erica in order to steal her fame for himself. Erica discovers the truth and is eventually able to form a relationship with him. In 2009, All My Children let Egglesfield go and killed off Josh. Zach Slater (Thorsten Kaye) shoots him and Erica is then forced {{to decide whether or not}} to donate Josh's heart to a seriously ill Kendall. [...] "The first thought that came to my <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was told the storyline and read the script was Sophie's Choice," [...] said Lucci. Erica reluctantly agrees to the transplant. Lucci said she believed this decision would [...] "haunt" [...] Erica because, if Kendall's life was not in the balance, she would have put more effort into saving Josh.|$|E
