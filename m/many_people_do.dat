25|$|Although {{ubiquitous}} in typeset material, the typographic apostrophe (’) is rather difficult to enter on a computer, since {{it does not}} have its own key on a standard keyboard. Outside the world of professional typesetting and graphic design, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not know how to enter this character and instead use the typewriter apostrophe ('). The typewriter apostrophe has always been considered tolerable on Web pages because of the egalitarian nature of Web publishing, the low resolution of computer monitors in comparison to print, and legacy limitations provided by ASCII.|$|E
25|$|Human {{rights groups}} have also {{reported}} widespread {{sexual abuse of}} indigenous women in the conflict-ridden eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite these risks, Pygmy populations generally have poor access to health services and information about HIV. The British medical journal, The Lancet, published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse {{access to health care}} than neighboring communities. According to the report, even where health care facilities exist, <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not use them because they cannot pay for consultations and medicines, {{they do not have the}} documents and identity cards needed to travel or obtain hospital treatment, and they are subjected to humiliating and discriminatory treatment.|$|E
25|$|Originating {{from the}} 12-Step Program of Alcoholics Anonymous, {{the use of}} the concept in mental health emerged as deinstitutionalization {{resulted}} in more individuals living in the community. It gained impetus as a social movement due to a perceived failure by services or wider society to adequately support social inclusion, and by studies demonstrating that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> recover. A recovery approach has now been explicitly adopted as the guiding principle of the mental health or substance dependency policies of a number of countries and states. In many cases practical steps are being taken to base services on a recovery model, although a range of obstacles, concerns and criticisms have been raised both by service providers and by recipients of services. A number of standardized measures have been developed to assess aspects of recovery, although there is some variation between professionalized models and those originating in the psychiatric survivors movement.|$|E

25|$|D. sylvestris is {{generally}} not considered a pest {{despite the fact that}} it is widespread in many regions and lives in urban areas nesting in areas such as the ground, in hedges, or hanging from eaves of houses. This is mostly due to the fact that this species of wasp does not like to enter buildings and is not interested in the types of food that are consumed by humans. It normally is not a problem around humans unless it builds a nest where people do not want it or where there is risk of children encountering the nest. The tree wasp is not very aggressive compared to other species of wasps, but can sting if it feels its nest is threatened. On the other hand, many of the reported pest problems for wasps in Scotland have been found to be D. sylvestris suggesting that <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> consider it a pest. Whether this was just from the presence of the nest or aggression of the wasps is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Health psychologists {{promote health}} through {{behavioral}} change, as mentioned above; however, {{they attempt to}} prevent illness in other ways as well. Health psychologists try to help people to lead a healthy life by developing and running programmes which can help people {{to make changes in}} their lives such as stopping smoking, reducing the amount of alcohol they consume, eating more healthily, and exercising regularly. Campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. Those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. Tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive emotional states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals. Practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. Moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. A common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is anti-smoking campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Kwanusila the Thunderbird, is an {{authentic}} Kwagu'ł totem pole, carved in Red Cedar by Tony Hunt of Fort Rupert, British Columbia. The crests carved upon the totem pole represent Kwanusila the Thunderbird, a whale {{with a man}} on its back, and a sea monster. <b>Many</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not realize that totem poles were only regionally used by First Nations along the coastal areas of British Columbia. Kwanusila is an exact replica of the original Kraft Lincoln Park totem pole, which was donated to the City of Chicago by James L. Kraft on June 20, 1929, and which stood on the spot until October 9, 1985. It was discovered some years before the pole was moved, that a pole of this type {{did not exist in}} the types at the Provincial British Columbia Museum located in Victoria, B.C., Canada. Arrangements were made for a duplicate of the Chicago original to be made by the same Amerindian tribe that made the original. A request was made and approved by the Chicago Park District for the original totem pole which existed here to be presented back to British Columbia. Kwanusila is dedicated to the school children of Chicago, and was presented to the City of Chicago by Kraft, Inc. on May 21, 1986.|$|E

It is Eminem's best-selling single and ranked number one on several record charts, including the United States' Billboard Hot 100 for sevenweeks. The single sold sixmillion copies in the US and was the best-selling song of 2010 in the United Kingdom. [...] Musical acts such as Cher Lloyd and The Band Perry have performed cover versions. Rihanna {{has said that the}} theme of domestic violence, a topic on which she claims <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not have insight, is what makes the song effective.

Bernard had been conducting research on an oceanographic ship, examining how different social actors interrelated and knew one another. Killworth proposed applying the 'Baltimore traffic problem algorithm' to the research challenges this presented. Over the next few years, the partnership would work extensively on the so-called [...] "small world", examining differences in the answers to questions such as [...] "how <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>does</b> the average person think they know?"

[...] In addition to his White House visits, Graham would visit Johnson at Camp David and occasionally met with the President when he retreated to his private ranch in Stonewall, Texas.
