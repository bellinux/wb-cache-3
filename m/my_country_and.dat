500|$|Despite a {{perceived}} decline in his work's quality, the 1840s {{were the most}} financially successful of Etty's career. His income increased with further opportunities for patronage from a growing industrial class, and with few costs and all his earlier debts cleared, Etty {{was in a position}} to invest money for the first time. By 1841 Etty had around £300 invested, rising to £8500 in 1845 and £17,000 in 1849. He continued to have difficulty forming relationships with any woman other than Betsy Etty, writing in his diary in 1843 that [...] "being in sound Mind and Body I declare it to be my Firm Intention NEVER TO MARRY.

[...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of <b>my</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> my honour, {{to listen to your}} proposals"). In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was a horse-flesh soup.|$|E
500|$|Aboard Guillaume Tell, the British found {{evidence}} {{of the severity of}} the food shortages in Valletta: [...] "the only thing found in La Guillaume Tell was the leg of a mule, hung for safety and his especial use of the admiral's stern-galley". News of the capture of Guillaume Tell was immediately passed to Vaubois by the British besiegers, along with a demand that he surrender the island. The French general, despite dwindling food supplies, refused, stating [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, pour écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of <b>my</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> my honour, to listen to your proposals"). Despite Vaubois' defiance, the garrison was rapidly starving, and although the French commander resisted until 4 September, he was eventually forced to surrender Valletta and all of its military equipment to the British.|$|E

In the first match of the tournament, against the Netherlands, he again won a penalty, conceded by Stefan de Vrij and converted by Xabi Alonso for a 1–0 lead but in an eventual 1–5 defeat; he was booed by Brazilian fans during the match, to which he reacted by saying, [...] "I have confirmed that Spain is <b>my</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> the Spanish people are behind me, the criticism of my decision does not affect me."
