500|$|During {{the years}} he was working at Hutchinson's in Widnes, Brunner was {{developing}} his political interests. [...] He joined the Widnes chapter of the National Education League and became its secretary in 1872. [...] This gave {{him the opportunity to}} come into contact with Liberals from Liverpool {{and other parts of the}} country. [...] Soon after moving to Northwich Brunner became more practically involved with education locally, in particular with the British School in the town. [...] He later served on its board of governors and also on the local sanitary authority. [...] As a result of the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 the parliamentary constituency of Northwich was created and Brunner offered himself as a candidate for the Liberal Party. In his speech for the position he expressed support for the disestablishment of the Church of England, for reform of property laws, for Irish Home Rule and for compensation for those whose properties had been damaged by the pumping of brine from the salt mines in the area. During the campaign he was heckled because he had a foreign-sounding name. He responded [...] "My father was a Swiss, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Manx woman, I was born in Liverpool, my nurse was Welsh: is that Cheshire enough for you?" [...] At the general election on 1 December 1885 Brunner beat William Henry Verdin, his Conservative rival, with a majority of 1,028.|$|E

2500|$|Reflecting on his childhood, Fritzl {{initially}} {{described his}} mother as [...] "the best {{woman in the}} world" [...] and [...] "as strict as it was necessary". Later, he expressed a negative opinion {{of his mother and}} claimed that [...] "she used to beat me, hit me until I was lying {{in a pool of blood}} on the floor. It left me feeling totally humiliated and weak. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> servant and she used to work hard all her life, I never had a kiss from her, I was never cuddled although I wanted it – I wanted her to be good to me." [...] He also claimed that she called him [...] "a Satan, a criminal, a no-good", that he [...] "had a horrible fear of her". In 1959, after Fritzl had married and bought his house, his mother moved in with them. Over time, their roles reversed, and his mother came to fear him. Eventually, he also admitted he had later locked his mother in the attic and bricked up her window after telling neighbors that she had died, and kept her locked up until her death in 1980. It is unknown how long Fritzl kept his mother locked up in his attic, but newspapers have speculated that it may have been up to 20 years.|$|E
