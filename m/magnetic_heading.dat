Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses, though {{no one on the}} ground is known to have witnessed the plane hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive geyser of water rising above the hangars, and one guard—at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over—saw the plane roll over.|$|E

Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to be empty and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy. The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General. The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace, after listening to the flight crew's conversations recorded by the CVR, and confirming that either the aircraft had flown on a constant <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> instead of activating the INS and following its assigned waypoints, or, if it had activated the INS, it had been activated when the aircraft had already deviated beyond the 7½-nautical mile Desired Track Envelope within which the waypoints would have been captured.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{hard disk}} drives (HDD) {{technology}} {{are being developed}} continuously {{in order to increase}} the capacity, and reduce the size of HDD to meet user requirements. To increase the capacity which is equivalent to increasing read/write ability, the flying clearance must be reduced. Current new HDD models show that the fly height is lower than 0. 3 µm. If the height of a particle or contamination is higher than 0. 3 µm, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> will scratch the magnetic disk surface. However the process of cleaning in the HDD industry cannot remove particles with size smaller than 0. 3 µm[1]. Therefore laser cleaning is selected first because this method can remove small particles [2]. and it does not damage the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head.</b> This research compares the range of temperature needed for cleaning the <b>magnetic</b> <b>head</b> between two types of heat source’s profile. The technique used is the heat transfer by finite element: FEM[3]. This technique provides an important factor of the laser cleaning method that increases the efficiency of particle removal.

50|$|Runway designations {{change over}} time because the {{magnetic}} poles slowly drift on the Earth's surface and the magnetic bearing will change. Depending on the airport location and how much drift takes place, {{it may be necessary}} over time to change the runway designation. As runways are designated with headings rounded to the nearest 10 degrees, this will affect some runways more than others. For example, if the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> of a runway is 233 degrees, it would be designated Runway 23. If the <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> changed downwards by 5 degrees to 228, the Runway would still be Runway 23. If on the other hand the original <b>magnetic</b> <b>heading</b> was 226 (Runway 23), and the heading decreased by only 2 degrees to 224, the runway should become Runway 22. Because the drift itself is quite slow, runway designation changes are uncommon, and not welcomed, as they require an accompanying change in aeronautical charts and descriptive documents. When runway designations do change, especially at major airports, it is often changed at night as taxiway signs need to be changed and the huge numbers {{at each end of the}} runway need to be repainted to the new runway designators. In July 2009 for example, London Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom changed its runway designations from 05/23 to 04/22 during the night.|$|E
