The [...] "Amoco" [...] lead-free gasoline was sold at American's stations in the eastern and southern U.S. alongside American Regular gasoline, which was a leaded fuel. Lead-free Amoco {{was introduced in the}} Indiana Standard <b>marketing</b> <b>area</b> in 1970.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To use Medicaid claims data to {{construct}} patient origin-based <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> for dental services and compare constructed <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> with those {{based on the}} practice county. DATA SOURCES: North Carolina Medicaid claims, eligibility, and provider files, the Cooperative Health Information Systems' dentist licensure files, and the Log Into North Carolina data. STUDY DESIGN: A visit-level file was created from the Medicaid claims data and aggregated by provider practice county and patient county of residence. Using the aggregated file and an algorithm based on the Elzinga-Hogarty approach, patient travel patterns were used {{to construct}} mutually exclusive patient origin <b>market</b> <b>areas.</b> DATA ANALYSIS: <b>Market</b> <b>area</b> characteristics were compared across definitions using Pearson correlation coefficients. In addition, estimations of provider participation were performed using <b>market</b> <b>area</b> characteristics as control variables. The beta coefficients associated with <b>market</b> <b>area</b> characteristics were compared across <b>market</b> <b>area</b> definitions. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Medicaid claims data, when combined with provider licensure files, {{can be used to}} construct <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> based on patient origin data. However, measures of <b>market</b> <b>area</b> characteristics are correlated highly between the two types of <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> studied. Furthermore, beta coefficients on <b>market</b> <b>area</b> variables in models of provider participation are similar in sign, significance, and magnitude across market definitions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> constructed using patient origin data, county-based <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> adequately proxy for dental markets. Using the county as the <b>market</b> <b>area</b> also avoids the time and computational costs associated with using a patient origin-based approach and facilitates the use of widely available data...|$|R

40|$|Although {{a variety}} of {{modifications}} of classical central place theory has been proposed, one area that remains unexplored {{is the effect of}} relaxing the nearest centre assumption for the purchase of a specified basket of goods within a given hierarchical level. This article examines the effect of such a relaxation on central place <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> by using higher-order Voronoi diagrams. When used to model <b>market</b> <b>areas,</b> higher-order Voronoi diagrams can be interpreted as overlapping and probabilistic regions. These diagrams construct <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> {{based on the assumption that}} consumers choose from a set of k (k = 1, 2, [...] ., n) nearest centres of the same hierarchical level. If consumers are assumed to be indifferent between the k centres, the appropriate <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> are given by the order-k Voronoi diagram. In this case, it is shown that sales potentials are consistent with those that result when the nearest centre assumption is in effect. If consumers are assumed to have a preference for nearer centres, <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> are defined by the ordered, order-k Voronoi diagram. This situation generates sales potentials which can vary between centres. Central place theory, choice rules, generalised Voronoi diagrams, <b>market</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{geographic}} scope of rural hospital markets. DATA SOURCES. The study uses 1988 Medicare patient discharge records (MedPAR) and hospital financial information (HCRIS) for all rural hospitals participating in the Medicare Program. STUDY DESIGN. Hospital-specific <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> are compared to county-based <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> using a series of geographic and socioeconomic-demographic dimensions as well as indicators of market competitiveness. The potential impact of alternative market configurations on health services research is explored by estimating a model of rural hospital closure. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS. Hospital-specific <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> were defined using the zip code of patient origin. Zip code-level data were subsequently aggregated to the market level. FINDINGS. Using the county as the hospital <b>market</b> <b>area</b> results not only in the inclusion of areas from which the hospital does not draw patients but also in the exclusion of areas from which it does draw patients. The empirical estimation of a model of rural hospital closure shows that the definition of a hospital <b>market</b> <b>area</b> does not jeopardize the ability to identify major risk factors for closure. CONCLUSIONS. <b>Market</b> <b>area</b> definition may be key to identifying and monitoring populations at risk from rural hospital decisions to downsize or close their facilities. Further research into the <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> of rural hospitals that have closed would help to develop alternative, and perhaps more relevant, definitions of the population at risk...|$|R
