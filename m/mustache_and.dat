5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini. She depicted the saint with a <b>mustache</b> <b>and</b> short beard, wearing a cloak and a crown inscribed with lilies, holding a cross in his right hand, and his severed head in his left hand. A portable icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} that Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) was flashed in the parking lot, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) opens an investigation. He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a <b>mustache</b> <b>and</b> without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav's {{appearance}} {{has been}} described very clearly by Leo the Deacon, who himself attended the meeting of Sviatoslav with John I Tzimiskes. Following Deacon's memories, Sviatoslav was a blue-eyed male of average height but of stalwart build, much more sturdy than Tzimiskes. He shaved his blond head and his beard but wore a bushy <b>mustache</b> <b>and</b> a sidelock {{as a sign of}} his nobility. He preferred to dress in white, and it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors. He wore a single large gold earring bearing a carbuncle and two pearls.|$|E

5|$|As {{the city}} prepares for the {{memorial}} service, Leslie and Ben are caught making {{out by a}} maintenance worker named George (Biff Yeager), so they send him home with a gift certificate {{in exchange for his}} silence. Unfortunately, George had the propane for Li'l Sebastian's eternal flame, which results in later confusion behind the scenes, that Leslie and Ben struggle to fix throughout the night. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge fireball to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his <b>mustache</b> <b>and</b> hair. Leslie and Ben are relieved, however, when the crowd applauds in the belief the fireball was staged. Entertainment 720's show also proves to be a hit with the crowd, which makes Tom further contemplate quitting his job.|$|E

25|$|The greasepaint <b>mustache</b> <b>and</b> eyebrows {{originated}} spontaneously {{prior to}} a vaudeville performance in the early 1920s {{when he did not}} have time to apply the pasted-on mustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the mustache every night because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint mustache, a quick glance in the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too undertoned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to his eyebrows and headed for the stage. The absurdity of the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in Duck Soup, where both Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) disguise themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got his <b>mustache</b> <b>and</b> eyebrows.|$|E

Their tails are naturally thin and short, and may be docked (where permitted). They will also have very straight, rigid front legs, and feet that are short and round (so-called [...] "cat feet") with thick, black pads.|$|E
500|$|Mary Galbraith makes a {{connection}} between Mulberry Street and Geisel's fears about the spread of Nazism.

[...] She argues that the horse and wagon {{at the beginning of the}} story evokes the peaceful German Americans of Springfield, and by extension the non-threatening actions of Germany. As Marco's story evolves, the horse and wagon transform into a parade, which Galbraith equates with [...] "a military monolith... marching down main street as an airplane drops confetti." ...|$|E
