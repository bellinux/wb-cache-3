40|$|THE nutritive {{requirements}} of grow-ing turkeys usually parallel and ex-ceed those of growing chickens. Hammond and Titus (1943) {{have found it}} possible to obtain rapid growth in chickens by feed-ing diets containing no animal protein. Hunter, Marble, and Knandel (1935) found that soybean meal or corn gluten meal could be substituted for {{a part of the}} fish meal, <b>meat</b> <b>scrap,</b> and dried skim-milk ordinarily included in turkey start-ing and growing diets. Funk and Kempster (1940) found cottonseed meal and corn gluten meal equal in value in turkey start-ing and growing diets, and soybean meal to be superior to either corn gluten meal or cottonseed meal. Their starting and. grow-ing mashes contained 10 percent of <b>meat</b> <b>scrap</b> and S percent of dried skimmilk, hence did not provide a critical test {{of the value of the}} vegetable protein supplements. The high protein requirement of turkeys together with the shortage of animal pror tein supplement made it imperative to find vegetable protein combinations that, with little or no animal protein supplement, could be fed to turkeys satisfactorily.

40|$|Agar slants of a {{selected}} Alternaria tenuissima strain were illuminated to give conidia suitable for further propagation. For production of protease with an optimal caseolytic {{activity in the}} region of pH 8 to 10, the fungus was cultivated in steel fermentors with 6 - and 60 -liter working capacity. Maximal activity, 1. 5 enzyme units per liter, was attained in a medium based on liver after about 60 hr of cultivation. The protease was secreted parallel with, or slightly after, the main growth phase. The process could be run favorably with a relatively low aeration rate. The pH of the culture decreased during the process from 7. 0 to about 6. 3. This was the optimal region also when pH was kept constant by automatic pH control. Optimal temperature was about 28 C, which resulted in a maximal productivity of 0. 057 enzyme units per liter per hr during the protease secretion phase. Replacement of the liver in the medium with skim milk, <b>meat</b> <b>scrap,</b> or rapeseed oil meal resulted in a decrease of the protease yield...|$|E
40|$|Ten insect-pathogenic {{species of}} Entomophthora showed wide {{variation}} {{in their ability}} to produce alkaline protease in surface culture. E. coronata, the most active producer, was selected for studies in submerged culture together with E. virulenta. All media tested appeared suitable for mycelial growth of these two organisms, but a liver medium was superior for the production of protease. The effect of the constituents of the liver medium upon yield was investigated. The lag between growth and the production of protease was 24 to 40 hr, and only very small amounts of protease were obtained from sonically treated mycelium. The pH values during growth rose from ranges of 4. 5 to 7. 5 in the initial medium to 7. 2 to 7. 9, and did not affect the final yields. The optimal temperature for the production of protease by E. coronata was 24 to 32 C, and good growth was observed at temperatures as low as 16 C. The process with E. coronata was scaled up to fermentors without a decrease in yield; 5 enzyme units/liter were obtained after approximately 33 hr. This corresponds to a maximal productivity of 0. 45 enzyme unit per liter per hr during the protease-producing phase. The process was insensitive to changes in aeration rate. The liver in the medium was replaced by various agricultural by-products, <b>meat</b> <b>scrap,</b> rapeseed oil meal, cottonseed nutrients, milk powder, and meat hydrolysate, with approximately the same or higher yields of protease...|$|E
40|$|NUMEROUS {{workers have}} {{reported}} on the growth-depressing effect of linseed meal in chick rations. Bethke and co-workers (1928) reported poor growth in chicks on a linseed supplement, com-pared with cottonseed meal and <b>meat</b> <b>scraps.</b> Ackerson and co-workers (1938) compared cottonseed meal and linseed meal with other protein supplements in the chick ration. Linseed meal produced less growth than cottonseed meal, and both protein sources were inferior to dried buttermilk or soybean meal. Slinger and co-workers (1943) showed that as linseed meal replaced <b>meat</b> <b>scraps</b> in the diet growth became successively poorer, and with the total protein supplement in the diet as linseed meal, growth was approxi-mately 50 percent of that obtained with <b>meat</b> <b>scraps</b> as the supplement. McGinnis and Polis (1946) and Kratzer (1946) re-ported the improvement of linseed meal by a 24 hour water treatment at room temperature followed by drying.

40|$|The {{proteins}} of {{the entire}} wheat kernel and of the bran and shorts are apparently utilized with equal efficiency by growing chicks when used with a base of corn, barley, oats, <b>meat</b> <b>scraps,</b> fish meal, and soybean meal. The relatively higher protein levels of bran and shorts, as compared to ground wheat, should be considered by the poultry producer in deciding which product or products {{can be used with}} greatest economy. A good concentration of a feather-growth factor is found in wheat bran. Other common feedstuffs carry the same essential, and the amount of bran which should be used in poultry rations will depend upon price relationships and certain well recognized palatability factors.

40|$|The {{presence}} of the salmonellae as contaminants of animal feeds and feed ingredients has been recognized for over 40 years. In his extensive review of Salmonella in poultry feeds, Williams (1981) traced the first reports of finding Salmonella in feed in the U. S. and Great Britain back to 1948. Attention was first focused on animal by-products used in feeds such as meat and bone meal, fishmeal, and <b>meat</b> <b>scraps,</b> when {{it was found that}} feed made from such products contaminated by Salmonella had the potential of introducing and spreading salmonellosis to domestic animals (Muller, 1952). As early as 1954, Denmark required that all imported meat and bone meal was to be resterilized before sale due to an association between the occurrence of Salmonella in poultry and the importation of large quantities of meat, bone, blood, and fish meal and bones (Muller, 1957).

5000|$|The {{practice}} of mechanically harvesting leftover <b>meat</b> <b>scraps</b> {{dates to the}} 1950s, when mechanical hand tools were developed to help remove the remaining pieces of meat and connective tissue from animal carcasses to minimize waste, although said tissues were not automatically or necessarily [...] "wasted" [...] when used for other purposes. Primarily MSM was developed in and produced in countries with agriculture industries insufficiently productive to provide mass quantities of regularly processed meat for widespread and affordable consumption. By the 1960s, machines that did this more efficiently, and automatically, were developed. This allowed companies to use previously wasted materials and, in turn, sell the derived meat products {{to the public for}} a lower price. During the 1970s, these techniques became more common {{in other parts of the}} world, as well.
