40|$|The {{motivation}} for this MA work {{is based on}} the challenge to the preconception of hand-tufting through material, colour and light. When imagining a rug, a very specific image appears in our mind. Some details of that image could vary from person to person, but what is almost certain, dense and heavy, probably made out of wool, woven textile will pop up in front of our eyes. This work suggests a possibility of creating new expressions in design by the material driven approach. The investigation was led by practice based research including set up of experiments, experimental work and evaluation complementing the whole process. The exploration proved that qualities of <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarn</b> have a great ability to enhance colours as well as add certain kind of lightness to the hand-tufted piece. Furthermore, due to the transparency of <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarn</b> an interplay between the loops and the backing was possible, opening up for changes in colour perception. The outcome of the research is collection of woven and hand-tufted textiles contributing to the field of textiles by bringing new qualities to the hand-tufting technique...|$|E

40|$|In {{twisting}} a yarn {{running over}} a guide surface, the twist {{inserted into the}} part {{in front of the}} guide is frequently accumulated so as to transmit freely to the part behind the contact zone and cause downstream twist blockage. A new device was set up here for investigating the twist blockage and yarn torque-twist simultaneously. Measurements on the relationship between twist and different parameters were carried out by using a <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarn</b> and a multifilament yarn. The influencing factors being taken into consideration include the wrap angle, yarn tension and input twist. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the prediction of goniophotometric curves (distribution curves of specularly reflected light) based on our mathematical model developed earlier for single-jersey knitted fabrics made from <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarns.</b> The theory is extended to include fabrics from multifilament yarns. Four physical and optical parameters related to the fabric and the light source are investigated: fiber refractive index, yarn cross section, incident light angle, and fiber ellipticity. Their effects on the goniophotometric curves and luster index of knitted fabrics are determined. In addition, the great difference is high-lighted between light reflected from knitted fabrics and light received by the goniophotometer. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Knitted {{products}} have a flexibility that offers many attractive possibilities. Combined with technical fibres, this gives interesting and innovative possibilities. Many technical fibres and yarns has however properties {{such as high}} stiffness and brittleness which are difficult to process {{in the practice of}} weft knitting. This paper is about the experimental product development of a light radiating textile lamp in which optical fibres are used as the only illumination source. The lampshade is produced on an electronic flat knitting machine with special equipment suitable for the feeding of yarn with high stiffness. The work was divided in two parts: exploring the possibilities to knit the desired shape on one hand and experimenting about knitting with optical fibres as a weft insertion on the other hand. The method is an inductive approach; a literature survey, information from suppliers of knitting production equipment and experimental work on a flat knitting machine at The Swedish School of Textiles, Borås, Sweden. Results show that the diamond shaped structure can be knitted in one piece with transparent <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarns.</b> Furthermore it also shows that difficulties occur when knitting with stiff and brittle optical fibres therefore the paper ends with a discussion with suggestions of how to overcome these challenges...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{knitting}}, the binding weave knitting is mainly used for technical textiles, where the textiles have a high performance require- ment. Weave knit is constructed by placing an inlay thread between the knitting rows {{in a similar manner}} as a weft thread in a woven tex- tile. This work sets out to design three-dimensional weave-knitted tex- tiles in combination with intarsia and partial knit with the intention to develop surface pattern on three-dimensional shapes. The material used are effect <b>yarn,</b> <b>monofilament</b> and chenille <b>yarn,</b> which improve the properties of the textile. The three techniques enhance each other by their characteristics and give the possibility of formability. The re- sult shows an installation of textiles with three-dimensional character- istics, meant for spatial contexts which have the ability to function with light. The value of this work lies in the combination of the techniques and the application area in which the work is set...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} for calculating specular reflection of single-jersey knitted fabrics using a three-dimensional analysis. A computer simulation program based on the model is developed to generate goniophotometric curves using Cartesian coordinates and Euler angles derived from the geometry of a knitted loop. Two correction factors are introduced by taking into consideration the sensor and sample geometry. The theoretical work is verified with a black <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarn</b> with nine different values of tilted and rotated angles and two black single-jersey knitted fabrics made from monofilament yarns. There is good agreement between the simulated and measured curves for both cases. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Air {{drag force}} on a nylon <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarn</b> in a {{confined}} jet was measured {{as a basic}} study for operating yarn by airflow, for example; for weft-insertion, for holding the yarn end, for adjusting yarn tension and for drawing yarn into a hollow spindle. The relative velocity of airflow around a yarn was expanded up to 300 m/s. Previously, this had been investigated up to 100 m/s. Both the supplying air pressure and combinations of nozzles and pipes changed diffusion of the flow in a pipe. Air drag force increased extremely if the primary stream acted on the yarn directly when the jet from the nozzle was directed at very high speed (around sonic velocity). Yarn was often stuck inside the pipe by the airflow when very thin pipes were used. When this occurred, air drag force was reduced to half. The air drag coefficient Cf for <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarn</b> has been arranged using the radius Reynolds number, Rea, for suction flow with lower than 100 m/s. The formula, Cf = KRea-n, has been applied for suction flow under 500 in Rea. Cf could be arranged {{in the same manner}} for annular jet or confined jet if airflow acted on a yarn in the pipe uniformly. This formula, then, is also available even for very high velocity over 100 m/s. According to these results, we were able to calculate air drag force on monofilament yam. We anticipate applying this to the other kinds of yarn, and expect air power savings and improvement in yarn operation...|$|E

The standard dimensions of the net are : length : 300 - 500 m, width : 4 m for 'nylon vala' and 7. 5 m for 'Joga vala and mesh : 50 mm.

40|$|The sensors {{commonly}} used today to measure human physiological parameters are hard and discrete and {{not suitable for}} long term monitoring. A wearable garment with integrated fabric sensors incorporated in an unobtrusive way is highly desirable for long term physiological monitoring, particularly in a non-clinical environment. The aim of this work is to investigate fabric sensors which can be integrated into a garment to allow the unobtrusive monitoring of physiological parameters, primarily for measuring the electrocardiograph (ECG) and respiration. The work focuses on using only dry fabric electrodes where skin preparation {{and the use of}} chemical gels or adhesives are not employed. The textile structure used in {{this study was designed to}} provide controlled contact pressure, enable construction using common textile processing methods, allow accurate placement of electrodes on the body, allow comfortable fit and be unobtrusive to wear. It was decided to use the knitting method to make bands which incorporated conductive electrodes in order to evaluate different fabric electrodes materials. The detection of respiration using fabric strain sensors did not require electrical contact with the skin. Preliminary experiments were conducted on a single subject to develop a device and methodology. Galvanic skin response and ECG was initially investigated to determine the effectiveness of electrode materials. ECG was established as a more reliable measure and was subsequently used to evaluate the initial performance of the fabric electrodes, and further refine the test methodology on a single subject. Experiments were then conducted on 10 male volunteer participants of reasonable general health having no known heart conditions, with ages 30 - 55 and BMI 20 - 30. It was found that fabric sensors which were soft, pliable and flexible have advantages in terms of ability to provide better quality ECG signals and a comfortable bio-interface. Variation in the pressure applied to the electrode directly affects the acquired signal level and a pressure of 2. 5 KPa is preferred. Multifilament conductive yarns are more easily processed into fabric than <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarns</b> and are generally preferred. Electrodes comprising a conductive polymer treated fabric gave better performance than metal or metal coated yarns. Fabric strain sensors were tested and used to detect respiration on a single subject. It was found that human respiration can be measured using strain sensors such as those comprised of a conductive polymer treated fabric or a fabric incorporating a rigid conductive monofilament fibre...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose a finite element {{approach}} which simulates the mechanical behaviour of beam assemblies that are subject to large deformations and that develop contact-friction interactions. We focus on detecting and modeling contact-friction interactions within the assembly of beams. Contact between beams [...] or between parts of the same beam in the case of self-contact, is detected from intermediate geometries defined within proximity zones associating close parts of beam axes. The discretization of contact-friction interactions is performed on these intermediate geometries by means of contact elements, constituted of pairs of material particles which are predicted to enter into contact. A 3 D finite strain beam model is used to represent the behaviour of each beam. This model describes the kinematics of each beam cross-section using nine degrees of freedom, and is therefore able to represent plane deformations of these cross-sections. Algorithms are proposed to solve the global nonlinear problem using an implicit scheme, under quasi-static assumptions. Simulation results of the tightening and releasing of knots made on <b>monofilament</b> and multifilament <b>yarns</b> are shown as an application. Straight fibers are first twisted together to make a yarn, before suitable conditions are applied to their ends to form and tighten the knot. Tightening forces are finally released to obtain an equilibrium configuration of the knot without external forces...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{documented in}} this thesis investigates the potential of leno woven fabrics to be developed for outdoor seating use, and to understand the influence that hand-­‐weaving of these fabrics has on the design process for the commercial textile designer. It investigates the potential of hand woven leno fabrics to be aesthetically pleasing and yet meet the physical requirements for a seating material exposed to the external climatic conditions. Themes of, material change over time and fabrics that blend into the landscape are explored {{through a series of}} samples produced on a handloom using a range of manmade and natural fibres. Contemporary weave practitioners, artists, product designers and an analysis of the current uses of leno fabrics has informed and guided the direction of this research. The hand weaving of doup-­‐controlled leno fabrics employing a mix of <b>monofilament</b> and wool <b>yarns</b> has resulted in the creation a range of dynamic, stable and open net-­‐likeructures that could be suspended within a seating frame. It has been demonstrated that this method of fabric production is capable of producing strong yet flexible substrates whose design successfully reflects the beauty in colour and forms found within the landscape. Reflection on the relationship between the handcraft of weaving, and the decision-­‐making process and knowledge of the textile designer has been recorded. The resulting knowledge of the design process and the insight into the mechanics of leno weaving on a table loom, are to be built into a programme of undergraduate workshop and weave theory lectures. This research has grown out of an interest in the slow decay of abandoned textiles in the landscape and forms a starting point for the exploration of how climatic conditions might affect the physical and visual appearance of a fabric used outdoors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{research in the}} areas of knitting technology and optical fibres. The aim is to explore the possibilities to knit stiff monofilament optical fibres in flat knitting machines. The yarns used were transparent monofilament of polyester and optical fibres of PMMA (Polymethyl Metacrylate). Result shows that a hexagon shaped flat knitted prototype can be produced but also difficulties to knit <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarn</b> with optical fibres. The optical fibres was put into the structure in straight angles as weft insertion, to avoid bending and breakage of the monofilaments. Another problem was the take down device on the knitting machine but a solution of this is presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} were investigated between the structural and dyeing properties of different structurally modified PA 6 fibers. PA 6 <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarn</b> samples were applied having different crystalline degrees and different content of alpha, respectively gamma crystalline modification. The diffusion coefficients {{of two different}} acid dyes were determined together with the content of dyestuff absorbed (under specific conditions) by fiber samples. In order to estimate colorimetry method {{from the viewpoint of}} polymer structural change detection, the colors of the dyed PA 6 samples were determined (L*, a*,b*, C*, h coordinates) and the color differences (L*, a*, b*, C*, H*, E*) were calculated between untreated standard and structurally modified samples. The dyeability of PA 6 fibers depended mainly on the way in which crystallinity had been achieved, i. e. on the materialćs history. Different crystalline modifications caused different sorption properties and fiber dyeability. Smaller increases (app 20 %) of crystallinity degree caused a decrease in diffusion coefficients. Contrary to expectations, the significant increase of crystallinity degree (app 50 %) had an influence on the increase ofdyeability, presumably owing to the formation of larger empty spaces in the structure. The results achieved by colorimetry were in good correlation with dye absorption measurements. The colorimetry of dyed fiber samples was sensitive enough to detect even small differences in the quantities of absorbed dyestuff...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Bursting {{strength}} {{is a standard}} method for evaluating mosquito net strength. This article suggests that tension strength with one grab and one hook better represent how holes are generated in bed nets in real life. Methods Measurements of bursting strength and tension strengths in the two directions are analysed for eight model nets created for the study. The nets {{were made in the}} most commonly used denier (75 and 100 D) and mesh (156 holes/inch 2) for multifilament polyester yarns, texturized or not, and with 4 or 6 sided holes. All were made from one polyester quality. Data was arranged in a randomized, complete block design and analysed for significant variables and their interactions. Data was then subjected to regression analyses using net square metre weight as a weighting factor with stepwise removal of variables. This revealed how the four textile variables interacted and allowed for making predictions for the strength of commercial nets in polyester or polyethylene. Results For the model nets, higher denier provided higher bursting strength and tension strengths, texturizing weakened nets and four-sided holes were stronger than six-sided holes. Even when compensating for square metre weight, 100 D nets are stronger than 75 D nets. Results for the commercial polyester net nets are less clear, probably because of different qualities of polyester. Tensile strength: a 75 denier net knitted tightly to provide the same square metre weight as a standard 100 denier net therefore does not obtain the same strength. Polyethylene nets are made of mono-fibre yarns and, therefore, have higher tension strength in both directions than multifilament polyester nets. For bursting strength results overlap for 100 denier yarns of both yarn types. As a class, commercial polyethylene nets are stronger than commercial polyester net whatever method is used for evaluation. Conclusion Tension strength measured in the length and width directions of the net using one hook and one clamp provide new relevant data as this method more closely imitates the cause of tear holes in nets as they occur in real life use. Using this methodology, the commercial <b>monofilament</b> <b>yarn</b> polyethylene nets are significantly stronger than the commercial multifilament polyester nets. This test method should be applied for nets used for years in the field. </p...|$|E
