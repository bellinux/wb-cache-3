Some have open cabs and compartments that visitors can climb in and walk through, including a <b>mail</b> <b>car,</b> railroad executives' passenger car (with dining room and sleeping / lounge areas), a boxcar, two cabooses, and a recreated DL station with ticket window.

25|$|The {{original}} Gulf Coast Rebel used {{a heavyweight}} consist which received some streamlining and other cosmetic enhancements. Two consists {{were necessary to}} protect the service. Each had a <b>mail</b> <b>car,</b> baggage car, coach, buffet-coach, and sleeping car (Tower-series 8-section 1-drawing room 3-double bedroom cars Show Me and Deep South). As mentioned above American Car and Foundry delivered new lightweight cars to the GM in 1947–1948 which were used throughout the system. These included 68-seat coaches, 31-seat parlor cars, and four 4-section 8-roomette 1-compartment 3-double bedroom sleeping cars. Originally ALCO DL-105s (styled by Otto Kuhler) handled the Gulf Coast Rebel. Later motive power included the ALCO PA-1 and the uncommon Baldwin DR-6.|$|E
25|$|He and his {{brothers}} then became outlaws and, with other occasional partners, formed a criminal gang. In 1915, he and Bob Ashley robbed an FEC passenger train with Chicago mobster Kid Lowe. Their first attempt was less than successful as they failed to agree on who would collect valuables from the passengers and who would rob the <b>mail</b> <b>car.</b> That same year, they stole $45,000 in silver and cash in a daring daylight bank robbery in Stuart, Florida. During their getaway however, Lowe accidentally shot John Ashley in the jaw, costing him the sight {{in one of his}} eyes. When Ashley attempted to get medical attention for his eye, he was captured and held in the Dade County jailhouse to await trial. He was taken to Miami to stand trial for the murder of Desoto Tiger. However, the state's attorney believed that that had a better chance of prosecuting Ashley for the Stuart robberies in West Palm Beach.|$|E

50|$|On June 26, all Pullman {{cars were}} cut from trains. When union members were fired, entire rail lines were shut down, and Chicago was besieged. One {{consequence}} was a blockade {{of the federal}} mail, and Debs agreed to let isolated <b>mail</b> <b>cars</b> into the city. Rail owners mixed <b>mail</b> <b>cars</b> into all their trains however, and then called {{in the federal government}} when the mail failed to get through.|$|R

2500|$|Between 1946–1948 the Santa Fe {{increased}} {{the length of}} the El Capitan and added new cars built during and after World War II. The new El Capitan included a storage <b>mail</b> <b>car,</b> baggage-dormitory, eight 44-seat [...] "leg-rest" [...] coaches, two lunch counter-dining cars, a club-lounge, and a coach-observation car. Most of the coaches were built by Pullman-Standard. The reduced seating in the coaches was given over to improved leg room for passengers.|$|E

Levin is said to have become [...] "dangerous and unmanageable" [...] on the train to Richmond, whereupon friends and railway workers subdued him and detained him in the <b>mail</b> <b>car.</b> The nature of his madness is unclear, but one newspaper, expanding on a wire-service story, speculated, [...] "His insanity is supposed to have been brought about by an immoderate use of opium." [...] He was returned to the Philadelphia Hospital for the Insane [...] and died there of [...] "Insanity" [...] in March 1860. Levin was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery, in Philadelphia.|$|E

50|$|Until Amtrak {{discontinued}} all mail-hauling {{operations in}} 2005, the postal distribution center in Springfield, MA, {{was a significant}} customer. Up until about the year 2000, Springfield was served by a dedicated mail train which would run overnight up the Inland Route to Springfield. After this train was canceled, <b>mail</b> <b>cars</b> were instead added to the early morning Train 190, to make pickups at large cities along the Northeast Corridor. At New Haven these <b>mail</b> <b>cars</b> would {{be removed from the}} rear of Train 190 and added to Shuttle Train 490, sometimes sandwiching the locomotive {{in the middle of the}} train.|$|R

60|$|The {{real work}} of their {{sinister}} night ride was over. Fritz and his mail bag and his mules came as gentle relaxation, grateful after the arduous duties of their profession. Twenty {{miles to the}} southeast stood a train with a killed engine, hysterical passengers and a looted express and <b>mail</b> <b>car.</b> That represented the serious occupation of Hondo Bill and his gang. With a fairly rich prize of currency and silver the robbers were making a wide detour to the west through the less populous country, intending to seek safety in Mexico by means of some fordable spot on the Rio Grande. The booty from the train had melted the desperate bushrangers to jovial and happy skylarkers.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he wrote}} a letter to his own Kate. It {{was the first time he}} had {{addressed}} her in this fashion, and though he was somewhat of a gallant gay Lothario, the writing of the letter was an excitement to him. If so, what must the receipt of it have been to Kate O'Hara! He had promised her that he would write to her, and from the moment that he was gone she was anxious to send in to the post-office at Ennistimon for the treasure which the <b>mail</b> <b>car</b> might bring to her. When she did get it, it was indeed a treasure. To a girl who really loves, the first love letter is a thing as holy as the recollection of the first kiss. [...] "May I see it, Kate?" [...] said Mrs. O'Hara, as her daughter sat poring over the scrap of paper by the window.|$|E
6000|$|To her {{my story}} was [...] "true." [...] She {{believed}} {{in me and}} all my family, and she was filled with solicitude for the dangerous journey I must make ere I won to Salt Lake City. This solicitude nearly brought me to grief. Just as I was leaving, my arms full of lunch and my pockets bulging with fat woollen socks, she bethought herself of a nephew, or uncle, or relative of some sort, {{who was in the}} railway mail service, and who, moreover, would come through that night on the very train on which I was going to steal my ride. The very thing! She would take me down to the depot, tell him my story, and get him to hide me in the <b>mail</b> <b>car.</b> Thus, without danger or hardship, I would be carried straight through to Ogden. Salt Lake City was only a few miles farther on. My heart sank. She grew excited as she developed the plan and with my sinking heart I had to feign unbounded gladness and enthusiasm at this solution of my difficulties.|$|E
50|$|To combat this, the ARU {{launched}} a boycott on Pullman, where ARU {{would refuse to}} run trains with the cars. The extensive use of Pullman cars across the country further crippled the railroad industry and stymied rail traffic. The twenty-four Chicago railroads represented by the General Managers' Association rallied together against the boycott. They used strikebreakers to replace striking workers and convinced lines to run Pullman <b>cars</b> with their <b>mail</b> <b>cars.</b> If strikers shut down lines with <b>mail</b> <b>cars,</b> {{the federal government would}} have to intervene as it threatened interstate commerce. Indeed, lines were closed and the government found the boycott in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.|$|R

6000|$|Now, I {{will give}} you a sort of general {{synopsis}} of my idea--of course, everything is subject to your own revision and change. The article, we will say, is written by a TYPICAL train hoister--one without your education and powers of expression (bouquet) but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from HIS STANDPOINT--not from John Wanamaker's. Yet, in order to please John, we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess. Comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible. Do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in, and, on the contrary, do not depreciate a profession that is really only financiering with spurs on. Describe the FACTS and DETAILS--all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a Pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see. Here is a rough draft of my idea: Begin abruptly, without any philosophizing, with your idea of the best times, places and conditions for the hold-up--compare your opinions of this with those of others--mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others, giving your opinion why--as far as possible refer to actual occurrences, and incidents--describe the manner of a hold-up, how many men is best, where they are stationed, how do they generally go into it, nervous? or joking? or solemnly. The details of stopping the train, the duties of each man of the gang--the behavior of the train crew and passengers (here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of). Your opinions on going through the passengers, when is it done and when not done. How is the boodle gotten at? How does the express clerk generally take it? Anything done with the <b>mail</b> <b>car?</b> UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL A TRAIN ROBBER SHOOT A PASSENGER OR A TRAIN MAN--suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands? Queer articles found on passengers (a chance here for some imaginative work)--queer and laughable incidents of any kind. Refer whenever apropos to actual hold-ups and facts concerning them of interest. What could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try? Why don't they try? How long does it take to do the business. Does the train man ever stand in with the hold-up? Best means of getting away--how and when is the money divided. How is it mostly spent. Best way to manoeuvre afterward. How to get caught and how not to. Comment on the methods of officials who try to capture. (Here's your chance to get even.) ...|$|E
