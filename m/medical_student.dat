40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if there was any change in the attitudes of final year <b>medical</b> <b>students</b> before and after completing a posting in psychiatry. A vignette and two dependent measures (the social distance scale and the dangerousness scale) were used in this study to determine the attitudes of <b>medical</b> <b>students</b> towards mental patients. These were given to 94 final year <b>medical</b> <b>students</b> at the start and once again upon completion of their posting. Results showed no statistically significant difference in the scores of the Social Distance Scale (SDS) and the Dangerousness Scale among the <b>medical</b> <b>students</b> before and after completion of their 6 week psychiatric clerkship. There was a significant difference between the male and female <b>medical</b> <b>students</b> in the social distance at the beginning of the posting, with the female <b>medical</b> <b>students</b> keeping a greater social. However there was no significant difference in terms of social distance between the male and female <b>medical</b> <b>students</b> at the end of the posting.
