The federal government uses both voluntary partnerships with private industry and requirements in federal laws, regulations, and <b>mandatory</b> <b>standards</b> to assist in the security of privately owned information technology (IT) systems and data within critical infrastructure sectors. As agreed, our objectives were to (1) identify, for each critical infrastructure sector, the federal laws, regulations, and <b>mandatory</b> <b>standards</b> that pertain to securing that sector's privately owned IT systems and data and (2) identify enforcement mechanisms for each of the above laws, regulations, and <b>mandatory</b> <b>standards.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the implications for the international trade environment {{of public and private}} standards for food safety and food quality. Public (<b>mandatory)</b> <b>standards</b> are a response to a perceived market failure and include mandatory risk assessment procedures, restrictions on harmful products, and labelling requirements. Disparate public standards create challenges for international trading partners and are dealt with through the WTO SPS and TBT Agreements. Private standards for food safety and quality are becoming a prominent feature of international food markets and include proprietary, consensus and third-party standards. The WTO has no jurisdiction over private standards. Key questions include whether private standards divert or reduce trade or whether they can be trade enhancing, and under what conditions. The implications for the WTO are discussed, and future trade policy research needs pertaining to the co-existence of public and private standards for food safety and quality are identified. food safety, GLOBALGAP, HACCP, <b>mandatory</b> <b>standards,</b> private standards, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
