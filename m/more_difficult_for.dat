5|$|By refraining {{from the}} advance a2-a3 White tries {{to gain a}} tempo on {{the lines of the}} {{previous}} section, making it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Black to initiate the Re8–e6–h6 or Ra8–a6–h6 lifts. After the moves 6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 White has tried two different plans.|$|E
5|$|Every year it is {{becoming}} more and <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches. The consequence is that at the last moment, through cup-tie interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like {{extensions}} of the body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota may allow millipedes to wedge more securely into crevices, protect the legs, or make the millipede <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> predators to swallow.|$|E

50|$|Bilateral {{transform}} requirements <b>for</b> convergence are <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than <b>for</b> unilateral transforms. The {{region of}} convergence will be normally smaller.|$|R
50|$|The {{long line}} or ray {{can even be}} {{equipped}} with {{the structure of a}} (real) analytic manifold (with boundary {{in the case of the}} closed ray). However, this is much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than <b>for</b> the differentiable case (it depends on the classification of (separable) one-dimensional analytic manifolds, which is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> than <b>for</b> differentiable manifolds). Again, any given C&infin; structure can be extended in infinitely many ways to different C&omega; (=analytic) structures.|$|R
5|$|Similar to graphite, various molecules, such as NH3 or alkali metals, can be {{intercalated}} into hexagonal boron nitride, that {{is inserted}} between its layers. Both experiment and theory suggest the intercalation is much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> BN than for graphite.|$|E
5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, making it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> squirrels {{to get at the}} seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E
5|$|Weather for {{the game}} was {{appropriate}} to the winter setting {{it was intended to}} evoke, with game-time temperatures around the freezing mark and snow falling for much of the time, especially during the third period. The weather conditions made play somewhat <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> players but were well received by fans.|$|E

5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities {{grew in the}} 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and {{tens of billions of}} items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E
5|$|Daily {{life became}} <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the family: Priestley was burned in effigy along with Thomas Paine; vicious {{political}} cartoons {{continued to be}} published about him; letters were sent to him from across the country, comparing him to the devil and Guy Fawkes; tradespeople feared the family's business; and Priestley's Royal Academy friends distanced themselves. As the penalties became harsher for those who spoke out against the government, Priestley examined options for removing {{himself and his family}} from England.|$|E
5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Johnson ended with 1/85 from 21 overs and was the most uneconomical of the Australian bowlers, conceding runs {{at a rate of}} 4.04 per over while the others averaged 3.26. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket, make it more likely to spin and therefore <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Australia to bat on.|$|E
50|$|This {{variation}} of leg raise allows the pelvis to freely rotate. It is generally the <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> variation <b>for</b> the abdominal muscles due to having {{to support the}} pelvic weight as opposed to simply stabilizing its alignment.|$|R
50|$|Some {{classification}} {{systems are}} {{more suitable for}} aiding subject access, rather than for shelf location. For example, Universal Decimal Classification, which uses a complicated notation of pluses and colons, is <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to use <b>for</b> the purpose of shelf arrangement but is more expressive compared to DDC in terms of showing relationships between subjects. Similarly faceted classification schemes are <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to use <b>for</b> shelf arrangement, unless the user has knowledge of the citation order.|$|R
25|$|The 1800 English cricket {{season is}} one of the <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> years <b>for</b> {{analysis}} because of several matches involving prominent town clubs like Rochester, Woolwich, Homerton, Richmond, Storrington, Montpelier and Thames Ditton. All of these were of minor status.|$|R
5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States {{pursued a}} policy of trying to prevent wars among Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region. This was not {{strictly}} for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare made it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. On August 19, 1825, U.S. officials finalized a multi-tribal treaty at Prairie du Chien, which defined {{the boundaries of the}} region's tribes.|$|E
5|$|For 24-year-old Hanshin Tigers fan Masaya Shitababa, the 2003 celebration was a tragedy. He {{drowned in}} the canal, with all reports being {{that he had been}} shoved in by the revelers. To prevent future incidents, the Osaka city council ordered the {{construction}} of a new Ebisubashi bridge beginning in 2004, which will make it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> fans to take the celebratory leap should the Curse of the Colonel be broken and the Tigers win again.|$|E
5|$|Haas and Creamer {{were cleared}} of the {{plagiarism}} charge by their institutions. The Chicago Field Museum of Natural History’s science advisory council rebuked Haas for press releases and web pages that gave too little credit to Shady and inflated the couple’s role as discoverers. The dispute remains heated. Scholars have concerns {{that it could}} make it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> United States archaeologists to gain permission to work in Peru.|$|E

5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two games of his Air Force career, DeBerry's Falcons jumped to an {{excellent}} start. In the team's 1984 opener, the Falcons defeated San Diego State, 3417. The following week, the Falcons blew out , 757. But after those two victories, things became <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the Falcons. Air Force lost its next two games (at Utah and Wyoming) before defeating , Navy, and traditional football powerhouse Notre Dame.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} innings, Loxton took 0/29 from ten overs, and England batted on {{for five minutes}} on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller. This would help {{to break up the}} wicket and make the surface more likely to spin, therefore making life <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Australia’s batsmen.|$|E

50|$|Due to the German victory, {{the next}} Challenge 1932 was {{organized}} in Germany as well.

50|$|On 28 March 2011, the International Federation for Human Rights {{reported}} that the military prosecutor general of Bahrain decreed it unlawful to publish any information about investigations by military prosecutors.

5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli {{found himself}} in {{political}} isolation. The triumvirate and the newspaper La Gazeta blamed him for the defeat at Huaqui, and sought punishment as a deterrent. His former supporters were divided between those who supported {{the ideas of the}} Triumvirate and those no longer able to help. Castelli suffered from tongue cancer during the long trial, which made it progressively <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to speak. He died on October 12, 1812, while the trial was still underway.|$|E
5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|Some pugs {{are also}} born with {{stenotic}} nares {{which can also}} inhibit their breathing. In serious cases, the pinched nostrils make breathing even <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog could pass out from blocked airways. If this happens, one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not surgery is needed to modify the breathing passages.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on {{the first}} match of Leicester's 2017–18 season, a close-fought 4–3 loss to Arsenal, The Guardian {{newspaper}} reported that Vardy was extremely well-suited to the current Leicester team – the [...] "embodiment of pure Leicester-ism" [...] – but a much <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> fit <b>for</b> other teams.|$|R
50|$|Being a {{comparatively}} well-off {{country in the}} Eastern bloc, Hungary was the destination for tourists from other communist nations for whom visits to the West were much <b>more</b> <b>difficult.</b> Queues <b>for</b> groceries, for instance, were virtually non-existent, unlike in other communist countries in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Countries such as Zambia, Tanzania and the Soviet Union {{provided}} {{military support}} for the ANC and PAC. It was <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> though, <b>for</b> neighbouring states such as Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, because they were economically dependent on South Africa. Still, they did feed the struggle underground.|$|R
