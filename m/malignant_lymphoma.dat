[...] A series of poor performances after that saw him demoted to jūryō for the first time since 2005, but he secured an immediate return to the top division with a 10–5 at the rank of jūryō 3 in March 2014. He repeated this achievement once again when he was demoted in September 2014 and bounced back with a jūryō championship to again return to the top division.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionOn rare occasions, an {{apparently}} spontaneous regression of unknown etiology is {{observed in a}} neoplasm. We report a series of 4 patients with apparent spontaneous regression of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphomas</b> after radiography. Presentation of caseAll four of the tumors were <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> The regressions occurred between 1 and 2 months after the radiographic examinations. All four patients later underwent relapse and needed additional treatments: surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation. DiscusssionFour cases had the following features in common: (1) the neoplasms were radiosensitive, (2) the regression occurred after radiography, (3) none of the neoplasms was in the advanced stage, and (4) the doses received through radiographic exposure were a little higher than usual because CT was included {{for most of the}} patients.

40|$|For {{the first}} time the {{presence}} of a consistent number of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (95 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 35 with Hodgkin's disease) among persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection has been documented in Europe.

Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas had an increased incidence of high-grade subtypes and presented an advanced stage with frequent CNS (25 patients) but not anorectal or oral involvement. Patients with Hodgkin's disease had an increased incidence of mixed cellularity and lymphocytic depletion subtypes and stage III and IV disease.
