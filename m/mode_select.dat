50|$|The camera {{had many}} {{operational}} <b>modes</b> available, <b>selected</b> by the dial on the left-hand {{side of the}} camera. These <b>modes</b> <b>selected</b> whether the exposure settings were set automatically, semiautomatically or fully manually. This dial also doubled as an on/off switch.|$|R
5000|$|Aside from {{changing}} the language the characters speak to English, several announcer voice overs were still changed though they're already in English (e.g. the voice {{over in the}} <b>Mode</b> <b>Select</b> screen). Most likely because of the mentioning of [...] "Bust A Move" [...] which is the Japanese title.|$|E
5000|$|Dicer (2010) {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} hardware button sets [...] - [...] five large operational buttons and three <b>mode</b> <b>select</b> buttons [...] - [...] designed to attach to the corners of a turntable or laptop and allow users of DJ applications such as Traktor and Serato the ability to control loops, cues and effects.|$|E
50|$|Mode S, or <b>mode</b> <b>select,</b> despite {{also being}} called a mode, is {{actually}} a radically improved system intended to replace ATCRBS altogether. A few countries have mandated mode S, and many other countries, including the United States, have begun phasing out ATCRBS {{in favor of this}} system. Mode S is designed to be fully backward compatible with existing ATCRBS technology.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{difficulty}} <b>modes.</b> <b>Selecting</b> easy <b>mode</b> {{results in the}} last few levels being skipped, and being unable to view the real ending.|$|R

50|$|Stage {{selecting}} {{are almost}} the same, {{only with a}} little difference. Any player can decide the song that will be played in the match, and each player <b>selects</b> his/her own <b>modes,</b> items, or skins. However, EXTRA <b>mode</b> <b>selecting</b> goes {{in a very different}} way. If the songs that contains EXTRA <b>mode</b> were <b>selected</b> by the player that has already unlocked the mode, then all the player can <b>select</b> EXTRA <b>mode.</b> If not, then only the player who has already unlocked the <b>mode</b> can <b>select</b> it.|$|R
50|$|On January 2013, the Lexus HS {{received}} a facelift. The front receives the Lexus signature Spindle Grille first {{seen on the}} Lexus GS. Other changes include lowering the height by 10 mm, refined interior, {{and the addition of}} SPORT MODE on the Drive <b>Mode</b> <b>Select.</b> While it still retains the 2.4 L petrol engine, the fuel economy is now 20.6 km/L, based on JC08 Mode cycle.|$|E
50|$|TEST RUN - This mode is {{designed}} for beginners to practice by test-driving. Only one vehicle (4WD) and one nameless course is playable in this mode.

30|$|Skip mode is a {{distinctive}} situation in Merge 2 N× 2 N, {{which means the}} transformed residual is 0 and with low distortion and required bitrate. As a result, if the RD-cost of the current PU is smaller than the average RD-cost of previous coded Skip modes, it indicates that the prediction is fairly precise and the succeeding PU modes may be omitted. We average the latest five RD-costs of the Skip modes [13, 22] and Merge <b>modes</b> which are <b>selected</b> as the best mode and denoted as JSkip_d and JMerge_d by (1)(2). d means the CU depth, n is denoted {{as the number of}} Skip <b>modes</b> <b>selected</b> as best <b>modes,</b> and m indicates the number of Merge <b>modes</b> <b>selected</b> as the best mode.|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, Song Previews from Dance Dance Revolution are {{presented}} in Beatmania IIDX Lincle; hovering over a song will automatically plays the preview of the song before the background music is played back. There is also a new feature, Help Display. This can be accessed by holding the VEFX button to display help on <b>MODE</b> <b>SELECT</b> and MUSIC SELECT screen. In addition to this release, PASELI users can now purchase a new pass known as [...] "DJ VIP PASS" [...] {{that can be done}} before playing the first stage.|$|E
50|$|SCSI target devices {{provide a}} number of SCSI mode pages. These can be interrogated by a MODE SENSE command and set by a <b>MODE</b> <b>SELECT</b> command. The MODE SENSE {{commands}} and the mode page formats include a 6-bit page code field, allowing for 64 possible mode pages. When the number of pages approached this limit, an eight-bit subpage code field was added. A description {{of many of these}} page codes is included below. Note that any given SCSI device type will only support a subset of the possible page codes, and some page codes may have different meanings for different devices.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "chibi" [...] {{version of}} the player's Mobilsuit, called [...] "Mobichan", appears in the game as a {{power-up}} item that gives the player an extra life. Mobichan has appeared in many console games released by Capcom during the early 1990s as a <b>mode</b> <b>select</b> cursor {{such as in the}} Super Nintendo Entertainment System {{version of the}} original Street Fighter II. The arcade game Warriors of Fate features a hidden ending sequence for completing the game on one credit which shows Mobichan and its Player 2 counterpart fighting against each other dressed Ryu and Ken and using their special techniques against each other.|$|E
50|$|Other {{functions}} {{controlled by}} the remote can include putting a device into sleep <b>mode,</b> <b>selecting</b> a partition to boot from on startup, and ejecting optical disks. A device can be configured to respond only to a particular remote.|$|R

50|$|The {{amount of}} memory used for display {{depends on the}} video <b>mode</b> <b>selected.</b> A {{graphics}} screenrequires 16000 bytes of memory and an 80 x 25 text screen requires 4000 bytes. A 40 x 25 text screen requires 2000 bytes.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{the type}} of interrogation, the {{transponder}} sends back a transponder code (or [...] "squawk code", Mode A) or altitude information (Mode C) to help air traffic controllers to identify the aircraft and to maintain separation between planes. Another mode called Mode S (<b>Mode</b> <b>Select)</b> is designed to help avoiding over-interrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. Mode S transponders are backward compatible with Modes A and C. Mode S is mandatory in controlled airspace in many countries. Some countries have also required, or are moving towards requiring, that all aircraft be equipped with Mode S, even in uncontrolled airspace. However, in the field of general aviation there have been objections to these moves, because of the cost, size, limited benefit to the users in uncontrolled airspace, and, in the case of balloons and gliders, the power requirements during long flights.|$|E
50|$|The LC {{interior}} is {{split into two}} zones — the driver side has access to functionality, while the passenger side is shielded and much simpler. The center of the interior experience is the steering wheel, which has a varying circumference to accommodate for different driving styles. In order to allow for easier grip and improve the feel, the paddle shifters are made from magnesium alloy. The 8-inch Thin Film Transistor LCD circular dial embedded in the instrument panel is a direct descendent of the LFA design — it moves side-to-side as the driver moves through the various menus and settings, and the appearance will change depending on the selected drive mode. Also borrowed from the LFA is the Drive <b>Mode</b> <b>Select</b> control, which is placed {{to the side of}} the instrument panel.The LC is the first car to be developed on the new Lexus front-engine/rear-wheel drive platform, dubbed the Global Architecture - Luxury (GA-L) platform. The GA-L platform will serve as the starting point for all future rear-wheel drive Lexus vehicles of the future, and it’s meant to provide lower overall mass, improved front/rear weight distribution (54/46 front/rear balance for the gas model, 52/48 for the hybrid), and a low center of gravity. The platform design allowed engineers to push the wheels out further towards the corners of the vehicle, reducing the height of the hood while still accommodating the new multilink suspension. The engine position is also lowered 10 mm and pushed 50 mm closer to the center of the vehicle — this centers the weight of the engine and brings it closer to the drive, mitigating the load shifting from side to side. Run-flat tires are also used to avoid the need for a spare, and the vehicle battery has been relocated to the trunk to help with the overall balance.|$|E
40|$|This {{proposal}} {{was created to}} address conflicting statements in SATr 8 found during letter ballot resolution regarding the Mode Page Policy VPD page and to not force the SATL to provide only a shared policy. During the last letter ballot resolution call, {{it was decided to}} make implementation of the Mode Page Policy VPD page a “should”, and leave the policies unspecified. Suggested Changes to SATr 08 : 8. 3. 1 <b>MODE</b> <b>SELECT</b> (6) command overview The <b>MODE</b> <b>SELECT</b> (6) command provides a mechanism for application clients to change the operating parameters of the target or a logical unit. Parameters specified by the <b>MODE</b> <b>SELECT</b> (6) command may be retrieved with the MODE SENSE (6) command. The application client should send a MODE SENSE (6) command before issuing a <b>MODE</b> <b>SELECT</b> (6) command for the same mode page, to determine the format, length changeable field etc. The Mode Page Policy VPD page (see 10. 3) should be implemented (see 10. 3). The MODE PAGE POLICY shall be set to 'Shared', and only one copy of 'current ' mode page values shall maintained for all logical units of a target. After a logical unit reset, the SATL shall set all mode page values to default values. See clause 10 for supported mode pages. > 10. 3 Vital product data parameters 10. 3. 1 Vital product data parameters overview Table 77 provides a summary of the VPD page translations defined in this standard...|$|E

40|$|The MC 34161 /MC 33161 are {{universal}} voltage monitors {{intended for use}} {{in a wide variety of}} voltage sensing applications. These devices offer the circuit designer an economical solution for positive and negative voltage detection. The circuit consists of two comparator channels each with hysteresis, a unique <b>Mode</b> <b>Select</b> Input for channel programming, a pinned out 2. 54 V reference, and two open collector outputs capable of sinking in excess of 10 mA. Each comparator channel can be configured as either inverting or noninverting by the <b>Mode</b> <b>Select</b> Input. This allows over, under, and window detection of positive and negative voltages. The minimum supply voltage needed for these devices to be fully functional is 2. 0 V for positive voltage sensing and 4. 0 V for negative voltage sensing. Applications include direct monitoring of positive and negative voltages used in appliance, automotive, consumer, and industria...|$|E
