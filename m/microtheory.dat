40|$|A {{computational}} {{enterprise model}} representing key facets {{of an organization}} {{can be an effective}} tool to consider when planning an enterprise information architecture. For example, a specific organization's quality management business processes and organizational structures can be represented using such a model, and then compared to a reference model of &quot;good&quot; processes and structures, such as the ISO 9000 standards. The specific and reference models can be represented using common entities, attributes, and relationships— comprising general schema or data model—which are then formally defined and constrained. These definitions and constraints can be used as inference rules applied to the models. Hence identification of differences between the models as quality problems can be automatically inferred, as can the analysis and correction of problems. In this paper, the TOVE ISO 9000 Micro-Theory is presented as a formal reference model of quality goodness. ISO 9000 requirements represented as inference rules in the <b>microtheory</b> are applied to facts about an organization's quality management processes and structures, and conformance or nonconformance to requirements is automatically inferred. TOVE Ontologies for Quality Modeling are the common data and logical (formal definitions and constraints) models of the reference and specific organization's models. The example use of the <b>microtheory</b> demonstrates enterprise model use for a pre-audit, which lowers the cost and time for improving quality through achieving ISO 9000 compliance. Since these enterprise models are constructed using ontologies, benefits of using ontologies such as model re-usability and sharability can be reaped...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of building a}} mathematical theory of a system or of simulating that system {{does not depend on}} having an adequate <b>microtheory</b> of the natural laws that govern the system components. Such a <b>microtheory</b> might indeed be simply irrelevant. Herbert A. Simon, The Sciences of the Artificial, p. 19. Three phenomena - the disparity between the assumed and observed attributes of economic man, the link between nature and artifacts, and the use of computers as a source of knowledge - fascinated Herbert A. Simon. He built a new paradigm for each field-bounded rationality to deal with the disparity, the science of the artificial as its link to nature, and artificial intelligence for creation of knowledge. In this paper we show that the sciences of the artificial and computer intelligence also hold the key {{to an understanding of the}} disparity between individual behavior and market outcomes. When seen as human artifacts, a science of markets need not be built from the science of individual behavior. We outline how, in the nineties, computer simulations enabled us to discover that allocative efficiency - a key characteristic market outcomes - is largely independent of variations in individual behavior under classical conditions. The Sciences of the Artificial suggests such independence and points to its benefits: This skyhook-skyscraper construction of science from the roof down to the yet unconstructed foundations was possible because the behavior of the system at each level depended on only a very approximate, simplified, abstracted characterization of the system at the level next beneath. This is lucky, else the safety of bridges and airplanes might depend on the correctness of the "Eightfold Way" of looking at elementary particles (Simon 1996, p. 16). efficiency of markets, zero intelligence, decision making, bounded rationality, minimal rationality economics...|$|E

But {{as a basis for}} discussion I offer the term citationology as the theory and practice of citation, including its derivative disciplines citation analysis and bibliometrics. Several maxims, commandments if you will, have been enunciated. References are the result of a specialized symbolic language with a citation syntax and grammar. References, like words, have multiple meanings which are related to the aposteriori quality of citation indexes. Therefore, citation relevance cannot be predicted. Mathematical <b>microtheories</b> in bibliometrics abound, including the apposite laws of scattering and concentration. Citation behavior is a vast sub-set of citation theory, which like citation typology, can never be complete.

40|$|Abstract. The {{categorization}} of our environment into feature types {{is an essential}} prerequisite for cartography, geographic information retrieval, routing applications, spatial decision support systems, and data sharing in general. However, there is no a priori conceptualization {{of the world and}} the creation of features and types is an act of cognition. Humans conceptualize their environment based on multiple criteria such as their cultural background, knowledge, motivation, and particularly by space and time. Sharing and making these conceptualizations explicit in a formal, unambiguous way is at the core of semantic interoperability. One way to cope with semantic heterogeneities is by standardization, i. e., by agreeing on a shared conceptualization. This bears the danger of losing local diversity. In contrast, this work proposes the use of <b>microtheories</b> for Spatial Data Infrastructures, such as INSPIRE, to account for the diversity of local conceptualizations while maintaining their semantic interoperability at a global level. We introduce a novel methodology to structure ontologies by spatial and temporal aspects, in our case administrative boundaries, which reflect variations in feature conceptualization. A local, bottom-up approach, based on non-standard inference, is used to compute global feature definitions which are neither too broad nor too specific. Using different conceptualizations of rivers and other geographic feature types, we demonstrate how the present approach can improve the INSPIRE data model and ease its adoption by European member states. ...|$|R

These differences are often "a matter of perspective," and perspective can be taken to be the set of beliefs held by a person {{as a result of their}} background, culture, tastes, and experience. Understanding perspective is often pivotal in resolving disputes, and such an understanding is useful for estimating the opinions a person would have on a matter, making recommendations to the person, and even understanding the language the person uses. Traditionally, perspectives are studied through the use of questionnaires and surveys that rarely leave people feeling like their opinions have been properly represented. In this paper, I propose a system for discovering distinct communities of people with coherent belief patterns, while providing a means to characterize those patterns. This system utilizes data on how people agree or disagree on assertions that they themselves have expressed. This system, called PerspectiveSpace, is an approach whereby elementary linear operations are used to perform calculations on user models and <b>microtheories.</b> PerspectiveSpace has applications ranging from discovering subcultures in a larger society to building community-driven web sites that adapt to individual perspectives, and three such applications are illustrated here.
