However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a <b>magnetised</b> plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E
25|$|A {{magnetic}} rod is required when constructing a compass. This {{can be created}} by aligning an iron or steel rod with Earth's magnetic field and then tempering or striking it. However, this method produces only a weak magnet so other methods are preferred. For example, a <b>magnetised</b> rod can be created by repeatedly rubbing an iron rod with a magnetic lodestone. This <b>magnetised</b> rod (or magnetic needle) is then placed on a low friction surface {{to allow it to}} freely pivot to align itself with the magnetic field. It is then labeled so the user can distinguish the north-pointing from the south-pointing end; in modern convention the north end is typically marked in some way.|$|E

40|$|Master of Science in Engineering - EngineeringAn {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the failures of 88 kV line surge arrestors at an Eskom Distribution substation. The surge arrestor failed when one phase of the transmission line was open circuited and all three phases were not isolated by the protection relays. The transformer was lightly loaded and a surge arrestor blocked the neutral path to the ground. The investigation used a modified version of an equivalent circuit proposed by Marti [1]. Transformer <b>magnetising</b> losses, the non-linear resistance of the neutral surge arrestor and the transformer <b>magnetising</b> reactance of the closed-circuit phases were all included. The investigation revealed that the failure of the arrestor was due to the combined volt drops across the open circuited phase of the transformer <b>magnetising</b> reactance and the neutral surge arrestor. A resonance condition lowered the <b>magnetising</b> reactance of the open circuited phase of the transformer and forced the transformer into saturation. This resonance is characteristic of the fundamental frequency ferroresonance condition [2]...|$|R

500|$|Although {{an ancient}} {{hematite}} artifact from the Olmec era in Mexico dating to roughly 1000 BC indicates the possible {{use of the}} lodestone compass long before it was described in China, the Olmecs did not have iron which the Chinese would discover could be <b>magnetised</b> by contact with lodestone. Descriptions of lodestone attracting iron {{were made in the}} Guanzi, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals and Huainanzi. The Chinese by the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) began using north-south oriented lodestone ladle-and-bowl shaped compasses for divination and geomancy and not yet for navigation. The Lunheng, written by Han dynasty writer, scientist, and philosopher Wang Chong (27– c. 100 AD) stated in chapter 52: [...] "This instrument resembles a spoon and when it is placed on a plate on the ground, the handle points to the south". There are, however, another two references under chapter 47 of the same text to the attractive power of a magnet according to Needham (1986), but Li Shu-hua (1954) considers it to be lodestone, and states that there is no explicit mention of a magnet in Lunheng. Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) was the first to accurately describe both magnetic declination (in discerning true north) and the magnetic needle compass in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, while the Song dynasty writer Zhu Yu (fl. 12th century) was the first to mention use of the compass specifically for navigation at sea in his book published in 1119. Even before this, however, the Wujing Zongyao military manuscript compiled by 1044 described a thermoremanence compass of heated iron or steel shaped as a fish and placed in a bowl of water which produced a weak magnetic force via remanence and induction; the Wujing Zongyao recorded that it was used as a pathfinder along with the mechanical south-pointing chariot.|$|E
2500|$|A {{conductor}} cable was laid {{in a trench}} between the rails. At [...] intervals a box was fitted between the rails that contained a stud (which protruded about [...] above the road) and a bell crank. A magnet on a passing tram attracted this crank which then moved to make contact between the {{conductor cable}} and stud; once the tram moved away the crank dropped away and the stud was no longer connected to the cable. A long skate was suspended beneath each tramcar which was <b>magnetised</b> by electro-magnets and so both operated the cranks and collected the current that both moved the tram car and powered the electro-magnets. A small battery was carried to charge the electro-magnets should the power be interrupted. The negative return current passed through the rails.|$|E
40|$|The {{rotating}} arc welding of the pipes (ROTARC) use a rotating electric arc for heating the extremities of two pipes, which turns {{due to the}} electromagnetic force created between the arc column (which is equivalent to a non-fixed wire through which an electric current passes along an axial direction) and a magnetic field having a constant intensity conducted along the radial direction. Within the “Pressure Welding Technologies ” laboratory in “Dunărea de Jos ” University- Galaţi both <b>magnetising</b> systems have been manufactured and tested, redesigned and experimented for several variants and original technical solutions have been found. First the work presents the principle of ROTARC welding and several original equipment developed by the team. Then, a classic longitudinal <b>magnetising</b> system and some results and conclusions of the experiments are presented. It is pointed out the classic displacement of the arc into {{the gap between the}} extremities; the only obvious disadvantage of this <b>magnetising</b> system is the pull out of the pipes into the fixing systems, which is only possible along the axial direction. The results lead to the conclusions that the transversal <b>magnetising</b> systems present both constructive and practical utility problems. The lateral displacement of the system against the gap is not enough due to the low value of the magnetic field. Beside the doubling of the transversal system (the symmetrical left-right arrangement against the gap) it is also necessary: to increase the <b>magnetising</b> current; and the number of the coil turns or to decrease the shunt magnetic fields through the fixing system which forms the support of the <b>magnetising</b> system.

40|$|Cage {{induction}} motors {{are widely}} used in industries because of their rugged construction and low cost. The drawback with an induction motor is that, it draws high <b>magnetising</b> current. The <b>magnetising</b> current drawn by an induction motor depends on air gap length between stator and rotor, and shape of stator slots. Air gap length in an induction motor is already very less; therefore it is not reduced below a certain level. There are three shapes of stator slots- parallel sided, tapered and circular; generally, the tapered or parallel sided shape of stator slot is adopted by manufacturers of induction motors. Here, a comparative study on performance of 3 KWinduction motor with different shape of stator slots is presented. It is shown that, the induction motor with circular shape of stator slots shows better efficiency, reduced <b>magnetising</b> current and better overload capacity, than the motors with other shapes of stator slots.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new three-limb three-phase electromagnetic transformer {{model in the}} Harmonic Domain. It is a composite model, with the linear circuit represented by the short-circuit impedances, and the non-linear magnetic circuit represented in a linearised form by means of Norton equivalents. The proposed Norton equivalents accurately represent the magnetic circuit, as they are derived from the linearisation (in the Harmonic Domain) of individual <b>magnetising</b> characteristics for the magnetic branches and the magnetic circuit laws. A Newton-Raphson iterative procedure is also developed to accurately determine the non-linear distribution of the magnetic fluxes. The influence of the <b>magnetising</b> characteristic approximation upon the harmonic solution is investigated. The adequacy of several approximations, including cubic splines, are assessed and Singular Value Decomposition have been explored to determine the equation parameters. The widely accepted assumption of equally distributing the <b>magnetising</b> currents between the primary and secondary terminals is also investigated. For single-phase transformer models this assumption is shown to be inaccurate, at harmonic frequencies, and inadequate, for star-connected three-phase transformer models and improved harmonic distribution factors for the <b>magnetising</b> currents are proposed. Three-phase three-limb electromagnetic transformer models for {{the most commonly used}} winding electrical configurations are derived, and the simulations results analysed by means of sensitivity analysis and comparisons with the practical and theoretical knowledge reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Localised {{magnetic}} flux density, <b>magnetising</b> field and power loss {{are believed to}} distribute non-uniformly in grain oriented electrical steel. Understanding {{of the causes of}} their variation can help reduce the overall power loss of the material. In this investigation, magnetic domain observation was often used in the study of domain configuration and crystal orientation of the test specimens. Methods of domain observation have been studied and compared in order to select the appropriate method for different parts of the investigation and to improve the understanding of the image observed. A less destructive local loss measurement sensor has been built for the measurement of localised flux density, <b>magnetising</b> field and power loss. The sensor was tested and evaluated specifically for the measurement of localised magnetic power loss of the high permeability grain oriented electrical steel. The results obtained from local loss scanning measurements indicated that localised flux density and <b>magnetising</b> field can vary substantially in grain oriented electrical steel under AC magnetisation of 50 Hz. The variation of localised flux density has been found mainly resulted by grain misorientation and local grain arrangement. The transverse component of flux density was detected and has been found increases with increasing grain misorientation. The variation of localised <b>magnetising</b> field has been found mainly influenced by the localised demagnetising field due to formation of free magnetic poles at grain boundaries. It has been proved that both flux density and <b>magnetising</b> field have strong influence on the distribution of localised power loss. The study of the effect of domain refinement on distribution of localised flux density showed that domain refinement by means of ball scribing on one surface of grain oriented electrical steel can improve the uniformity of distribution of flux density. However, results also inferred that excessive scribing in a confined area can cause obvious uneven distribution of flux density {{in the direction of the}} specimen’s thickness...|$|R
