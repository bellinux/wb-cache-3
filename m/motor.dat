5|$|Along {{with getting}} the <b>motor</b> patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} <b>motor</b> publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the <b>motor)</b> and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current <b>motor</b> on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC <b>motor</b> and related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction <b>motor</b> developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E

5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the <b>motor</b> cortex, divided into three parts: the primary <b>motor</b> cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary <b>motor</b> cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary <b>motor</b> area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a <b>motor</b> cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the <b>motor</b> cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower <b>motor</b> neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E

This innovative electric <b>motor,</b> patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.|$|E
