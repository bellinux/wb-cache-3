5|$|In an {{interview}} Lidle gave about a <b>month</b> <b>earlier,</b> he stated {{he had been}} a pilot for seven months and had flown about 95 solo hours. The crash garnered extra attention because of superficial similarities to the September 11 attacks in New York City, which had occurred five years and one <b>month</b> <b>earlier.</b> U.S. officials said that NORAD scrambled fighter aircraft over numerous American and Canadian cities for Combat Air Patrol, and that U.S. President George W. Bush was informed about the situation, but that these were precautionary measures only. The FBI quickly announced {{there was no reason to}} suspect that the crash was an act of terrorism.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe had {{suffered}} heavy attrition since {{the opening of}} the Battle of Britain. Just over a <b>month</b> <b>earlier,</b> it possessed 2,226 operational aircraft on 17 August.

Luftflotte 5 in Norway had sent most of its Messerschmitt Bf 110 and medium bomber units (Kampfgeschwader or Bomber Wings) to Luftflotte 2 and 3. Luftflotte 3 then passed most of its Messerschmitt Bf 109 units to Luftflotte 2 which was based in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.|$|E
5|$|The two clubs {{were due}} to meet a <b>month</b> <b>earlier,</b> but the stadium {{disaster}} at Hillsborough, which killed 96 of Liverpool's supporters, meant the fixture was postponed out of respect. It was moved to late May, days after the FA Cup Final which Liverpool won. Arsenal manager George Graham prepared for the match by giving his squad a minibreak and created a calming atmosphere in their training sessions. He adjusted his usual formation to a defensive one to stop Liverpool's attacking threat; David O'Leary was employed as a sweeper in a back five.|$|E
