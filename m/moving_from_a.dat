5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the promotional}} period, Burger King {{received}} numerous complaints from fans of Chicken Fries through social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One of the major ways the company responded was through personalized responses to these posts. Instead of using an automated response that would paste a standardized message on people's Twitter feeds, the company instead employed several staff to personally respond to customers voicing displeasure on the LTO nature of the 2014 introduction. The entire 2014 Chicken Fries promotion represented a major shift in the attitude towards advertising for Burger King, <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> more traditional advertising structure to one focused almost entirely on digitally-based media. This change happened fairly quickly, falling into place over the twelve to eighteen-month period preceding the reintroduction of Chicken Fries to the chain's menu. Along with the new advertising firm, a new director of digital marketing and social media was newly hired from cosmetics firm L'Oréal was added, increasing the clout of the digital advertising team within the chain.|$|E
5|$|Early on, {{the economy}} {{depended}} greatly upon the railroads in the area. The city {{was the largest}} in Mississippi around {{the start of the}} 20th century, with five major rail lines and 44 trains coming in and out daily. The city's economy not only depended on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} the Blue Jackets' approach to building their team changed, <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> team of young developing players into one with established players. The first deal General Manager Scott Howson made was {{the acquisition of}} All-Star forward Jeff Carter on June 23, 2011. The deal sent Jakub Voracek, Columbus' first-round draft choice, the eighth overall, and their third-round pick in the 2011 Draft to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Carter. The trade received a positive response in Columbus from fans and management who felt they finally had a number one center to play alongside of their best player, Rick Nash. Next, they traded for the negotiating rights of soon to be free agent James Wisniewski. Wisniewski scored a career high 51 points during the 2010–11 season, splitting time between the New York Islanders and Montreal Canadiens. The point total was fifth-highest in the league for defenseman scoring, tying Tobias Enstrom. The Blue Jackets came to terms with Wisniewski, just an hour {{prior to the start}} of free agency, signing him to a six-year, $33 million deal.|$|E

40|$|We use a vector {{autoregressive model}} to examine the {{relationship}} between monetary policy and labor market transitions. We use these impulse response functions in a Markov chain to examine the link between monetary policy and the unemployment rate. We find that an increase in the federal funds rate increases the probability of <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> employed to an unemployed status, and causes the probability of <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> unemployed to an employed status to decrease. The probability of transitioning from unemployed to not-in-the-labor-force decreases, but the same shock increases the probability of <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> not-in-the-labor force to unemployed.

The result of a merger around 300 million years ago, the Cartwheel Galaxy has a core of older, yellow stars, and an outer ring of younger, blue stars, which has a diameter of 100,000 light-years. The smaller galaxy in the collision is now incorporated into the core, after <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> distance of 250,000 light-years.

25|$|<b>Moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tourist-based queer {{culture to}} more of a bar-based community, The Black Cat bar {{specifically}} received much recognition for its creation of a protected, safe place for gay patrons. Jose Sarria, a drag entertainer at The Black Cat, staged satirical operas that would collect a crowd of more than three-hundred people. Audiences enjoyed watching him because his performances were spontaneous. They included outrageous female attire, political commentary, and gay humor, which inherently created a cultural pride between the bar-based gay and transgender community.|$|E
25|$|The Department is {{updating}} or reconstructing {{many of its}} stations. In 2016, {{plans were}} released for a brand new fire station 51 and 52. Stations 54, 55 and 57 would be dramatically remodeled. While this is happening, many new apparatus have been acquired, <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> yellow color scheme to a more classic, red. The department took delivery of a Pierce arial ladder truck in 2016, and two Pierce engines in 2017. These appuruatus are red, consistent with two 2013 KME engines, and four 2011/2012 Chevy ambulances.

With polls showing the Conservatives <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 15-point deficit to a tie in public opinion with the Liberals, the media praising Eves' political reorientation of the government, and the opposition Liberals reeling from the seizure {{of some of their}} political turf, the time seemed ripe for a snap election call.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War {{the army}} could {{mobilise}} 13 brigades, although 10 of them were less well equipped. It has been downsized after {{the end of the}} Cold War, with the biggest changes taking place in the middle of the 1990s, when a number of garrisons and units were discontinued. This restructuring focused on <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> fairly static invasion army to a flexible rapid reaction army. The Parliament in 1994 and 1995 approved a series of major organizational changes, for the Army in particular. To ensure a cost-efficient implementation, it is necessary to focus the activities in the Army on the process of transforming the army from a large mobilization army to a smaller, professional army.|$|E
25|$|Karol Szymanowski wrote {{only two}} operas, both {{completely}} breaking {{away from the}} model of Moniuszko. The first, Hagith, was influenced by Richard Strauss's Salome and was a failure at its premiere in 1922. Much more important was King Roger (1926). This work was slow to gain a reputation and was considered marginal until the 1990s. It has now been performed with great success in the United Kingdom and France. Formally, King Roger draws on the tradition of oratorio as it much as it does that of opera; the chorus is a constant presence throughout almost its entire length. It is a varied work, <b>moving</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> style influenced by the singing of the Eastern Orthodox Church to dense chromatic harmony, and is considered the most important Polish opera of the 20th century.|$|E

Despite this, individual income tax revenue only dropped from 8.7 to 8.5% of GDP over that time, and total federal revenue was 18.5% of GDP in both 1979 and 2007, above the postwar average of 18%. Tax code changes have dropped millions of lower earning people from the federal income tax rolls in recent decades. Those with zero or negative liability who were not claimed as dependents by a payer increased from 14.8% {{of the population in}} 1984 to 49.5% in 2009.|$|E
