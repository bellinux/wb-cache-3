An integrated robotic team for the collection of subsurface Martian water ice was designed, based on the 2001 Mars Odyssey discovery of the signatures of a significant amount of water ice on Mars. Gamma-ray spectrometer readings indicate that in large regions near the Martian poles, the soil between 60 and 100 cm beneath the surface contains 40 % to 73 % water ice by volume. The extraction and transport of this water would enable human habitation and exploration on Mars because water can be consumed by humans and chemically transformed into hydrogen and oxygen fuel. This study adopted the philosophy that a team of small robots can perform this collection task more efficiently and more reliably than one large, <b>multi-task</b> <b>robot.</b> A concept was designed for a team of small autonomous robots that traverse the Martian soil to detect, extract, and transport ice to a central holding and processing location. The team consists of drilling rovers that penetrate the Martian surface, collect frozen water and soil, and deliver this ice/soil mixture to quicker, less massive transporting rovers. A top-level design of the entire robotic team was produced. For the drilling rover, initial specifications were determined for the structure, drive train, command and data handling, navigation, communication, and powe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Although many {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} to form robot coalitions that can achieve a multirobot task, no general methods exist to execute these coalitions, especially when the coordination among the robots is tightly coupled. In this paper, we propose a coordination mechanism as the first step to address coalition execution; it provides a flexible method to reason about synergies with overlapping coalitions (thus enabling <b>multi-tasking</b> <b>robots</b> in multi-robot tasks), which not only improves efficiency, but also reduces resource requirements in task execution. This means that our approach enables tasks that cannot be easily handled before, especially when critical resources are rare but commonly required. Our approach is based on the concept of sensor constraint, which is introduced by the tight coupling (e. g., information sharing) between the robots. We show that our algorithm is sound and complete in finding a coordination solution given a few assumptions, and discuss a distributed implementation. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of this new approach. I...|$|R

The Supervisor even has the potential power to run every robot, computer system, nuclear power plant and military on the planet simultaneously if it needed to, although it wisely has no connection to outside the complex.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this dissertation is mostly concerned {{with the problem of}} controlling robots. While {{a large part of the}} scientific literature in Robotics is dedicated to this problem, there still exists a gap between what has been proposed using advanced control techniques and the majority of existing applications. Indeed, in simulation or in lab conditions, ad hoc environment and situations can be generated in order to simplify the control problem and only address one of its sub-parts. This can be necessary in the preliminary stages of research, when trying to address a challenging problem. However, the risk is to provide solutions which are intrinsically incompatible with real life constraints. These constraints often constitutestrong non-linearities which have to be accounted for to maintain the robot and its surrounding environment in proper working conditions. Nevertheless, these limits have often been dealt with as exceptions or secondary objectives. If these approaches make sense in cases where all motions can be pre-planned, they do not apply to situations where motions have to be generated in reaction to the environment. In that sense,there is still a need for advanced control techniques that intrinsically account for real world constraints. These constraints both lie in the actuation and configuration spaces of the robot but also in the tasks spaces, i. e. in spaces where the tasks assigned to the robot can be expressed in a straightforward way by the programmer or by the user through interactive programming. Thus, robotics control paradigms have toprovide the means to naturally express and optimally perform concurrent tasks while natively accounting for constraints in a computationally efficient way. In an attempt to tackle this general problem, the first research direction {{presented in}} this dissertation describes some work performed in constraints compatible, <b>multi-tasks</b> <b>robot</b> control. The proposed contribution in that domain leads to the formulation of the robotics control problem as a constrained optimisation one. This formulation provides the benefit of computing locally optimal solutions intrinsically compatible with the constraints. This is particularly suitable for applications in constrained and dynamic environments. While the first chapter advocates for the formulation of the reactive control problem as an optimisation one, the limits of reactive approaches are quite tangible when dealing with the constraints compatibility problem. Global optimality has to be tackled despite its complexity. This complexity reaches its climax with humanoid robots and the second contribution {{presented in this}} dissertation is centred on a review of optimisation-based control approaches for balanced humanoid behaviours. Control is the central focus of the presented work. Nonetheless, designing the right robot for a given application is also a very interesting and important research topic if one envisions less traditional use of robots with respect to standard manufacturing applications. Thus, the final contribution presented in this document is related to the performance based design and evaluation of robots with collaborative applicationsin mind...|$|R

The mechatronics design of the robots has followed a minimalist approach, where {{the structure of the}} robot is maximally simplified. As a solution to compensate the obvious limitations derived from minimalism, the multiplicity and the cooperation of the robots have been exploited. On a systems level, this produces fault tolerant, flexible, and cost-effective engineering solutions for application. Altogether over 90 logged experiment runs with physical robots have been completed to elucidate the functioning and reveal the factors affecting the performance of the system. The testing has been performed in a laboratory environment in a special demonstration process. In these experiment series, the searching and destroying of distributed dynamic targets were tested. Furthermore, the meaning of communication in the development of robot consciousness during the mission has also been analyzed. As a result of the research work and systems development, profound knowledge has been gained and new solutions presented for the required technology for a minimalist mobile robot operating in a liquid process environment. SUBMAR Robot Society forms a technological basis for the development of real-world applications in the future. reviewe...|$|R
