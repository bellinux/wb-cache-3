25|$|During LH IIIA1, {{there are}} many stylistic changes. Most notably, the Mycenaean goblet begins to {{lengthen}} its stem and have a more shallow bowl. This stylistic change {{marks the beginning of}} the transformation from goblet to kylix. The vapheio cup also changes into an early sort of <b>mug</b> <b>and</b> becomes much rarer. Also during this period, the stirrup jar becomes a popular style and naturalistic motifs become less popular.|$|E
25|$|Dido was {{followed}} by The Îles of St Tropez (1860), Fair Rosamond (1862) and The Deal Boatman (1863), among many others. His most memorable early success was another musical burlesque, Ixion, or the Man at the Wheel (1863), starring Lydia Thompson in the title role, which found audiences {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. By this time Burnand was a skilled negotiator with theatre managements, and he was among the first authors to insist on profit-sharing instead of fixed royalties. For Ixion this brought him a total of around £3,000. Other notable early works included an opéra bouffe, Windsor Castle (1865), with music by Frank Musgrave, and more pun-filled burlesques, including Helen, or, Taken from the Greek, and Guy Fawkes, or The Ugly <b>Mug</b> <b>and</b> the Couple of Spoons, both in 1866. Later in 1866 Burnand had a huge success with the burlesque The Latest Edition of Black-Eyed Susan; or, the Little Bill that Was Taken Up, parodying the three-act melodrama by Douglas Jerrold, Black-Eyed Susan; the show ran for 400 nights at the Royalty Theatre, was played for years provincially and in the US, and was twice revived in London.|$|E

Himself and one squaw and one [...] stayed all night; and being in English clothes, the governor set him at his own table, where he behaved himself as soberly ... as an Englishman. The next day after dinner he returned home, the governor giving him cheese, and pease, and a <b>mug,</b> <b>and</b> other small things.|$|E

500|$|The Mr. Hankey {{character}} {{was based on}} an idea Trey Parker's father created when he was toilet-training Trey as a child. Parker said he refused to flush the toilet as a child, so his father told him if he did not flush down his stool, which he called [...] "Mr. Hankey", it would come to life and kill him. The concept stayed with Parker throughout his childhood; starting in elementary school and throughout his entire education, he would often draw the character in class, wearing a sailor's hat instead of the Santa Claus hat he would later wear in South Park. Parker shared the concept with future South Park co-creator Matt Stone when the two met at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the duo immediately knew they wanted to create a film or production involving Mr. Hankey. The two discussed filming a three-minute short film involving a boy who befriended the talking stool, but Mr. Hankey would not come alive for anybody else, prompting others to believe the boy was crazy. They planned for the boy's parents to find him holding a stool in the bathroom and blame the child for smearing feces along the walls when it was actually Mr. Hankey's fault; they also planned to have him visit a school counselor, where Mr. Hankey would leap into the counselor's coffee <b>mug</b> <b>and</b> the boy would be blamed. At the end, it would turn out that the boy was indeed crazy and Mr. Hankey was not real at all, but a figment of the boy's imagination. Parker and Stone never made the short film, but practically all of its elements were included in the future South Park episode [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", with the notable exception of the ending.|$|E

2500|$|... 1925: On 21 August, the Ilkley Gazette {{received}} a letter of complaint that the collection was just a curiosity shop, and {{this led to the}} reduction of the collection in favour of its local heritage items. [...] However the letter did include a description of the exhibits of the time. [...] There was the Ellison collection of classified geological specimens. [...] There were photographs of the local great and good, a stuffed albatross and Japanese armour. There were valuable coins, a Queen Victoria <b>mug,</b> <b>and</b> the Anglo-Saxon cross shaft carvings, unlabelled. [...] The [...] "famous Roman triple vase [...] found near the Assembly Hall in Weston Road" [...] was still there with a serpent, boomerangs and a sawfish. The existence of superfluous paintings was bemoaned, with special attention being paid to the portraits of the Rombalds Moor hermit, and of James Fletcher (his name now changed to Metcalfe) the local 18th century blind fiddler - this latter was in the Museum's foundation collection, and possibly held some sentimental value for Ilkley residents. [...] It might also be worth noting that Mr Woodward, the classifier of the Roman artefacts, was absent in Greece when this article was written - so there may have been some political element involved in the publication of this piece. [...] The primary complaint is that items were intermixed and were not all labelled or classified, and the secondary complaint is that there was insufficient space to separate and classify them all properly. It appears well-intentioned, but there are possibly intimations of an administrative power-struggle in the background.|$|E
