25|$|There is also {{a theory}} that the younger lady is Meritaten, {{daughter}} of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and wife of Smenkhare, based on {{a study of the}} alleles inherited by Tutankhamun. The theory goes that Meritaten married Smenkhare, believed to be her uncle. Thereby making Tutankhamun a maternal grandson of Akhenaten. The theory holds weight as inbreeding <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> distinguish the generations, but there is one problem with this theory. Meritaten must be a mitochondrial descendant of Queen Tiye, or her mother Thuya, as the younger lady's mitochondrial DNA fits with her being Tiye's daughter. Nefertiti's lineage is nowhere specified, and if Meritaten is the younger lady, Nefertiti must be a mitochondrial relation of Thuya.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller {{from the front of the}} tabletop to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of the tabletop to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by the table in front of the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of these degradation products in the fuel tank, fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> start the engine or causes reduced engine performance. On resumption of regular engine use, the buildup {{may or may not}} be eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline. The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle. Some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits, isopropyl alcohol, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, or other additives. Fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines, such as lawnmower and tractor engines, especially when their use is seasonal (low to no use for one or more seasons of the year). Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure, to avoid storage at high temperatures, to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage, and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor.|$|E

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{expectations}} placed on women {{by their own}} religions, society also holds certain biases against women of certain religions that causes them to have less success in the job market. [...] This is seen most often among Muslim women who express their religion by [...] wearing modest clothing and traditional female Muslim accessories such as henna and hijabs. This was proven by {{a study by the}} Bristol school of Sociology that showed that Muslim women were 70 percent more likely to be unsuccessful in looking for work than Christian and nonreligious women. [...] These numbers stem from discriminatory actions on various levels of society that often lead Muslim women to lose their jobs or have trouble finding jobs. For example, on the local level, a woman was fired from a Jiffy Lube for wearing her hijab to work because it apparently violated the company's [...] "no hat" [...] rule. The company suffered no repercussions for this action. [...] On the federal level, the court case Webb v Philadelphia ruled that an officer wearing her hijab with her uniform, which is a requirement for women in her religion, was in violation of the states' standard of neutrality and therefore could be terminated for her choice to wear it. This ruling makes this type of discrimination precedent for similar situations and <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> traditional Muslim women to find and hold professional careers. There are laws against this type of discrimination, such as America's Title XII of their Civil Right's Act of 1964 which makes it illegal for businesses to discriminate against their employees [...] based on their sex, race, color, national origin, and religion, but even so this sort of religious and gender discrimination often intersect and lead to the feminization of poverty within certain communities.|$|E

60|$|All that we {{have learned}} of the blacks during the war makes the plan of arming a part of them to help {{maintain}} the master's tyranny over the rest seem so futile, and the arguments urged against it by Mr. Gholson and Mr. Hunter are so convincing, that we can hardly persuade ourselves that the authors of it did not intend it to make the way easier, not to independence, but to reunion. It is said to argue desperation {{on the part of}} the chief conspirators at Richmond, and it undoubtedly does; but we see in what we believe to be the causes of their despair something more hopeful than the mere exhaustion it indicates. It is simply incredible that the losses of a four years' war should have drained the fighting men of a population of five millions, or anything like it; and the impossibility of any longer filling the Rebel armies even by the most elaborate system of press-gangs proves to our mind that the poorer class of whites have for some reason or other deserted the cause of the wealthy planters. The men are certainly there, but they have lost all stomach for fighting. Here again we see something which is likely to make a final settlement more easy than it would have been even a year ago. Though the fact that so large a proportion of the Southern people cannot read <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> reach them, yet our soldiers have circulated among them like so many Northern newspapers, and it is impossible that this intercourse, which has been constant, should not have suggested to them many ideas of a kind which their treacherous guides would gladly keep from them. The frantic rage of Southern members of Congress against such books as Helper's can be explained only by their fear lest their poorer constituents should be set a-thinking, for the notion of corrupting a field-hand by an Abolition document is too absurd even for a Wigfall or a Charleston editor.|$|E

We allus managed to ride 'em close an' drive 'em back an' keep 'em bunched. Honest, Miss Withersteen, them steers was thin. They was thin when water and grass was everywhere. Thin at this season--thet'll tell you how your steers was pestered. Fer instance, one night a strange runnin' streak of fire run right through the herd. That streak was a coyote--with an oiled an' blazin' tail! Fer I shot it an' found out. We had hell with the herd that night, an' if the sage an' grass hadn't been wet--we, hosses, steers, an' all would hev burned up. But I said I wasn't goin' to tell you any of the tricks.... Strange now, Miss Withersteen, when the stampede did come it was from natural cause--jest a whirlin' devil of dust. You've seen the like often. An' this wasn't no big whirl, fer the dust was mostly settled. It had dried out in a little swale, an' ordinarily no steer would ever hev run fer it. But the herd was nervous en' wild. An' jest as Lassiter said, when that bunch of white steers got to movin' they was as bad as buffalo. I've seen some buffalo stampedes back in Nebraska, an' this bolt of the steers was the same kind.|$|E
60|$|You {{will want}} to know how the {{situation}} is viewed at this moment in India itself, by those who are responsible for the Government of India. This view is not a new view at all. It is that the situation is not gravely dangerous, but it requires serious and urgent attention. That seems for the moment to be the verdict. Extremists are few, but they are active; their field is wide, their nets are far spread. Anybody who has read history knows that the Extremist often beats the Moderate by his fire, his heated energy, his concentration, by his very narrowness. So be it; we remember it; we watch it all, with that lesson of historic experience full in our minds. Yet we still hold that it would be the height of political folly for us at this moment to refuse to do all we can, with prudence and energy, to rally the Moderates to the cause of the Government, simply because the policy will not satisfy the Extremists. Let us, if we can, rally the Moderates, and if we are told that the policy will not satisfy the Extremists, so be it. Our line will remain the same. It is the height of folly to refuse to rally sensible people, because we do not satisfy Extremists. I am detaining you unmercifully, but I doubt whether--and do not think I say it because it happens to be my department--of all the questions that are to be discussed perhaps for years to come, any question can be in all its actual foundations, and all its prospective bearings, more important than the question of India. There are many aspects of it which it is not possible for me to go into, as, for example, some of its Military aspects. I repeat my doubt whether there is any question more commanding at this moment, and for many a day to come, than the one which I am impressing upon you to-night. Is all that is called unrest in India mere froth? Or is it a deep rolling flood? Is it the result of natural order and wholesome growth in this vast community? Is it natural effervescence, or is it deadly fermentation? Is India with all its heterogeneous populations--is it moving slowly and steadily to new and undreamt of unity? It is the vagueness of the discontent, which is not universal--it is the vagueness that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> understand, harder to deal with. Some of them are angry with me.

60|$|A {{great deal}} is said, to be sure, {{about the rights}} of the South; but has any such right been infringed? When a man invests money in any species of property, he assumes the risks to which it is liable. If he buy a house, it may be burned; if a ship, it may be wrecked; if a horse or an ox, it may die. Now the {{disadvantage}} of the Southern kind of property is--how shall we say it so as not to violate our Constitutional obligations?--that it is exceptional. When it leaves Virginia, it is a thing; when it arrives in Boston, it becomes a man, speaks human language, appeals to the justice of the same God whom we all acknowledge, weeps at the memory of wife and children left behind,--in short, hath the same organs and dimensions that a Christian hath, and is not distinguishable from ordinary Christians, except, perhaps, by a simpler and more earnest faith. There are people at the North who believe that, beside meum and tuum, there is also such a thing as suum,--who are old-fashioned enough, or weak enough, to have their feelings touched by these things, to think that human nature is older and more sacred than any claim of property whatever, and that it has rights at least as much to be respected as any hypothetical one of our Southern brethren. This, no doubt, <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> recover a fugitive chattel; but the existence of human nature in a man here and there is surely one of those accidents to be counted on at least as often as fire, shipwreck, or the cattle-disease; and the man who chooses to put his money into these images of his Maker cut in ebony should be content to take the incident risks along with the advantages. We should be very sorry to deem this risk capable of diminution; for we think that the claims of a common manhood upon us should be at least as strong as those of Freemasonry, and that those whom the law of man turns away should find in the larger charity of the law of God and Nature a readier welcome and surer sanctuary. We shall continue to think the negro a man, and on Southern evidence, too, so long as he is counted in the population represented on the floor of Congress,--for three fifths of perfect manhood would be a high average even among white men; so long as he is hanged or worse, as an example and terror to others,--for we do not punish one animal for the moral improvement of the rest; so long as he is considered capable of religious instruction,--for we fancy the gorillas would make short work with a missionary; so long as there are fears of insurrection,--for we never heard of a combined effort at revolt in a menagerie. Accordingly, we do not see how the particular right of whose infringement we hear so much is to be made safer by the election of Mr. Bell, Mr. Breckinridge, or Mr. Douglas,--there being quite as little chance that any of them would abolish human nature as that Mr. Lincoln would abolish slavery. The same generous instinct that leads some among us to sympathize with the sorrows of the bereaved master will always, we fear, influence others to take part with the rescued man.|$|E
