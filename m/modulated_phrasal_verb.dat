There are three types of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in this research, namely; transitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> intransitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> and separable <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> The field {{of this paper is}} literature. The approach used in this paper is library research. The analysis of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in the three books namely; “The Hotel Mystery” books and “The Diamond Mystery” books by. Martin Widmark and “Peebee Has Awish” by Rudy Corrent is the construction and the function of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> The purposes of this paper are to analyze and knowing the construction and the function of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> of books that chosen. The writer uses the library research to analyze the <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> of children’s books and it’s contain. The writer uses library research, the source which is relevance with the title and kinds grammar books to complete her research. After analyzing the construction and functions of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> the writer concluded that there three kinds of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in these books namely; transitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> intransitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> and separable <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> In “The Hotel Mystery” books there 20 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> that can be constructed are 12 transitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> and 8 intransitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> In “The Diamond Mystery” books there 16 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> that consist of 10 transitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> 5 intransitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> and one separable <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> The last book is “Peebee Has Awish”. In this book there 19 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> that can be constructed are 9 transitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> 8 intransitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> and 2 separable <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> For the function of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> in each word of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> have functions such as: there as an adverb, as a verb and as a preposition.

Advisor: (I) Dr. Saifuddin Ahmad Husin, MA (II) Rahmila Murtiana, MA This {{research}} is conducted {{to find out}} the <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> appeared in the films: Bratz, Princess Protection Program and The Clique, along with their patterns and meanings. This research used qualitative research method. The data in this research are collected through procedures which consist of watching the films, listening and transcribing the dialogue, identification, classification, and analysis. Then the data are analyzed based on the objectives of the study. The result of the research shows that there are five patterns found in the films: Bratz, Princess Protection Program and The clique. The writer found about 124 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in Bratz, namely: <b>Verb</b> Adverb (47 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs),</b> verb adverb object (25 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs),</b> verb object adverb (19 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs),</b> verb preposition object (24 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs)</b> and verb adverb preposition object (9 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs).</b> The most <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> frequently appeared in this film is “come on” about seventeen times. The meaning of “come on” is to persuade someone to do something or show annoyance of something. The writer found about 88 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in Princess Protection Program, namely: <b>Verb</b> Adverb (44 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs),</b> verb adverb object (8 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs),</b> verb object adverb (19 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs),</b> verb preposition object (15 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs)</b> and verb adverb preposition object (2 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs).</b> The most <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> frequently appeared in this film is “come on” about eleven times. The meaning of “come on” is to persuade someone to do something or show annoyance of something. The writer found about 93 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in The Clique, namely: <b>Verb</b> Adverb (26 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs),</b> verb adverb object (18 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs),</b> verb object adverb (12 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs),</b> verb preposition object (32 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs)</b> and verb adverb preposition object (5 <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs).</b> The most <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> frequently appeared in this film is “look for” about four times. The meaning of “look for” is to try to find. Therefore, it is suggested for the learners that learning <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> with their meanings is very important to do because it can help them to speak natural English like native speakers. Also the learners indirectly can learn the way native speakers speak, their pronunciation, intonation, expression and the moral values of the films. Then, the teacher can use English films in teaching <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> because many <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> appeared in English films...|$|R
40|$|<b>Phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> is a verb {{combination}} {{consists of}} a verb and particle(s).

In contrast, ESL learners still get difficulty in using <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> both in writing and speaking.

5000|$|<b>Phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> - <b>Phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> (also {{known as}} multiple-word verbs) in English can cause {{difficulties}} for many learners {{because of their}} syntactic pattern and because they often have several meanings. There are also a number of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> differences between American and British English.|$|R
40|$|<b>Phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are ‘one of {{the most}} {{notoriously}} challenging aspects of English language instruction’ (Gardner & Davies 2007 : 339). Moon (1997 : 46) gives several reasons for this, including the frequency of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> their specialised meanings and, sometimes, opaqueness, their syntactic behaviour (in particular {{the placement of the}} object), and their stylistic heterogeneity (some <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are unmarked, whereas others are informal or jargonistic). What adds to the complexity is that, for most learners, there will be no equivalent to <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in their mother tongue. As a consequence, learners will often misuse <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> and underuse them (or avoid them altogether, cf. Dagut and Laufer 1985). In this presentation, I will be interested in L 2 learners’ use of English <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> and more particularly <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> that contain what is, according to the ‘Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English’ (Biber et al. 1999), the most frequent particle in <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> namely ‘up’. The focus will be on learners who learn English as a foreign language. We will see how factors such as mother tongue (L 1), knowledge of other foreign languages, exposure to the target language and medium (speech vs. writing) affect the use of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in learner English. Preliminary studies of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> with ‘up’ in ICLE (International Corpus of Learner English) and LINDSEI (Louvain International Database of Spoken English Interlanguage) have already confirmed the importance of some of these factors. Thus, Spanish students, who do not have any <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in their L 1, are among the learners who use the fewest <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> with ‘up’, whereas German students, who do have <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in their L 1, are among the top users. It also appears that, while most learners underuse <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> with ‘up’, this underuse is even more striking in speech than in writing (in fact, learners tend to use fewer <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in speech than in writing, whereas in native English <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are actually more common in speech than in writing, cf. Biber et al. 1999). It {{is also one of the}} aims of this presentation to compare the use of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> by foreign learners and second language learners, thus following a recent and promising trend which seeks to bridge the gap between Learner Englishes (foreign learner varieties) and World Englishes (institutionalised varieties). Some studies have revealed similarities between the two types of varieties (Nesselhauf forthcoming; see also the recent workshop organised at the ISLE conference on ‘Second-language varieties and learner Englishes’) and we will see whether this tendency is also noticeable in the field of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> This will lead us to a discussion about the distinction between errors and creative uses...|$|R

40|$|This article follows up on a {{study by}} Dagut and Laufer (1985), who found that Hebrew {{learners}} of English avoid <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> such as ‘let down’, while preferring one-word verbs, such as ‘;disappoint’, since <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> do not exist in Hebrew. A corollary derived from Dagut and Laufer's study is that Dutch learners of English would tend not to avoid English <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> since <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> also exist in Dutch. It was hypothesized, however, that Dutch learners of English {{as a second language}} (ESL) would avoid <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> too, not for structural, but for semantic reasons. Three tests (multiple choice, memorization, and translation) were administered to intermediate and advanced Dutch learners of English. Each test contained 15 sentences, eliciting preference for either a <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> or an equivalent one-word verb. The results show that, as expected, Dutch learners of English do not avoid <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> categorically. However, they seem to avoid those idiomatic <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> that they perceive as too Dutch-like (lack of contrast {{between the first and second}} language). Furthermore, they exhibit a tendency to adopt a play-it-safe strategy, preferring one-word verbs with general, multi-purpose meanings over <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> with specific, sometimes idiomatic, meanings. It is argued that this semantic play-it-safe strategy may have also played a causal role in the avoidance behavior of the Hebrew ESL learners observed by Dagut and Laufer...|$|R

40|$|<b>Phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are verbs that, unlike {{ordinary}} verbs in English, {{are accompanied}} by particular particles, and as such, they function as a whole. The original and primary meaning of the verb in such use varies, depending on the particle {{and the number of}} particles located after the <b>verb.</b> <b>Phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are very common in English (especially in speaking). In informal use, they are more present and used than their synonyms. English grammarians point out that the number of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> has increased significantly since the mid- 19 th century, especially in mid- 20 th, mostly in American English. Many <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> can be replaced with another word with little change in meaning.

40|$|<b>Phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> {{are said}} {{to be one of the}} {{greatest}} indicators of linguistic competence for speakers of English as a foreign language. A <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> consists of a verb and a preposition, a verb and an adverb, or a verb and an adverb as well as a preposition. Multi-word phrases such as <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are characterised by degrees of opacity of meaning, where some are quite literal and some are completely idiomatic. This can cause learners to avoid using <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> Conflicting definitions of what  <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are make them even harder to learn. This study employs a combination of methods, which together are intended to shed light on the use, teaching, and perception of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> through quantitative studies of student texts, the British National Corpus, teacher surveys, and textbooks of English as a foreign language (EFL). The primary sources for this study consisted of 30 national tests written by students in upper secondary school, five textbooks used in upper secondary school, and 33 survey replies from English teachers in upper secondary schools. This study shows that <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are only taught explicitly in one of the textbooks studied. Still, the essays written by the Swedish students show that they are quite commonly used. In fact, the frequency of use is quite near to that of native speakers, with a <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> appearing almost twice a page. The students rarely use the <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> incorrectly in a grammatical sense; that is they usually conjugate them correctly. There are several instances, however, when the wrong <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> is used, and particle movement is not as common in the Swedish text as in texts written by authors from the United Kingdom and Ireland. <b>Phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are used more often by students whose essays received a higher grade This can be seen both when looking at absolute numbers and when factoring in the length of the essays.

Research indicates that <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are highly polysemous, having on average 5. 6 meaning senses, although many of these are infrequent and peripheral. Thus practitioners also need guidance about which meaning senses are the most useful to address in instruction or tests. In response to this need, the <b>PHrasal</b> <b>VErb</b> Pedagogical List (PHaVE List) was developed. It lists the 150 most frequent <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs,</b> and provides information on their key meaning senses, which cover 75 %+ of the occurrences in the Corpus of Contemporary American English. The PHaVE List gives the percentage of occurrence for each of these key meaning senses, along with definitions and example sentences written to be accessible for second language learners, in the style of the General Service List (West, 1953). A users’ manual is also provided, indicating how to use the list appropriately...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} metaphor’s central {{position}} in the memorization, retention and prediction {{of the meaning of}} <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> To this end, 45 Iranian EFL learners from Chabahar Maritime University were divided into three groups. In control group, the <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> were presented with their Farsi (students' mother tongue) equivalents and students were asked to memorize them on their own as it is the traditional method of teaching <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> Experimental group I received the <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> {{in the context of a}} sentence, and students were asked to make new sentences with them in the class. And the experimental group II received the orientational metaphors underlying the meaning of the particles of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> All the three groups took three tests in which the correct particles of the <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> had to be provided. The first test, carried out just two hours after the instructions, dealt with the taught <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> The same test was conducted five weeks later to measure the long term retention of phrasal verbs' meaning. But the third test dealt with 20 untaught <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> which had the same particles as the taught ones. One-way ANOVA results revealed that the difference between the groups’ performances on the immediate test was not statistically significant, while the efficiency of metaphorical conceptualization, and sentential contextualization on the delayed test, and untaught test was considerable. There was a slight difference between the two experimental groups, but it was not statistically significant. The study ends with some suggestions for the teaching of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> and the possible factors contributing to their difficulty...|$|R

Then it attempts to describe as fully as possible what is being observed. The object {{of the study is}} English <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb,</b> that is verb made up of verb and preposition or an adverb. The writer collects the data from documentary sources, namely Hot Chord magazine. Then the steps in collecting data are: reading the text of the song in magazine, and selecting the <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> in a song to support the analysis process. In analyzing the data, the writer applies a descriptive method. After the data are collected, the writer analyzes it by using structural analysis in Chinese box, then she describes it as fully as possible. To analyze the type of meaning, the writer uses Leech’s theory about seven types of meaning. After the writer analyzes the <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> by using structural analysis, she comes to the conclusion that: (a) The immediate constituents in <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> are: verb + preposition + object,it forms transitive <b>phrasal</b> verb; <b>verb</b> + adverb; verb + pronoun object + adverb, those form intransitive <b>phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> and (b) Based on Seven Types of Meaning by Leech, <b>Phrasal</b> <b>verb</b> has five types of meaning, those are: Denotative Meaning, Connotative Meaning, Social Meaning, Reflective Meaning,,and Affective Meaning...|$|R

40|$|Introduction <b>Phrasal</b> <b>verb,</b> in both English and Arabic {{languages}} can {{be defined}} as a type of verb consisting of a sequence of a lexical elements. English <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> could be transitive or intransitive e. g. come in, get up, look out for, subtype may be distinguished on syntactic grounds into separable and inseparable. The particles may be classified into prepositional or adverbial types. Arabic language includes a linguistic item that shares some features of English <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> (often called prepositional <b>verbs).</b> Arabic <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> are classified as a subtype of transitive verbs. Transitive verbs in Arabic are classified into two types: transitive by itself such as يلقي in ﴿وَأَلْقِ عَصَاكَ﴾ (النمل: 10); and transitive through a preposition such as يعشو in وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَانًا فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِين﴾) (الزخرف: 36) this later type is parallel to the English <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> The present study is an attempt to show the syntactic and semantic aspects of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> in both English and Arabic to find out the similarities and differences between the two languages in relation to this type of verbs. ...|$|R

40|$|ESL/EFL {{learners}} tend to {{have difficulty}} in having clear images of <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> since both basic verbs and adverbs have various functions and meanings. Consequently, they have to memorize each expression by rote. To solve this problem it would be effective to develop and practice digital teaching materials based on “Prototype Theory ” with graphic schematization (i. e. visualized moving images with GIF animations). The author developed an “Electronic <b>Phrasal</b> <b>Verb</b> Wordbook with GIF animations ” and investigated its effects on Japanese EFL learners in acquiring <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs.</b> The result shows GIF animations tend to work as graphic schematization devices effectively for Group-A <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> (e. g. take down, give off, take in, etc.) but not for Group-B (e. g. go over, go down, come off, etc.), which suggests graphic schematization works effectively in acquiring <b>phrasal</b> <b>verbs</b> to a certain extent. 1...|$|R
