40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{effectiveness}} of four instruments in terms of predicting the capability of telephone hotline volunteers. The four components of the evaluation package included values, listening skills, personality trait type, and telephone behaviors. The instruments to measure these components were the Rokeach Value Survey, the Jones-Mohr Listening Test, the <b>Myers-Briggs</b> Trait <b>Type</b> <b>Indicator,</b> and the Crisis Call Behavior Checklist. The subjects used in this study came from the COPE Hotline located in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin. The 25 subjects were all volunteers to the hotline, primarily female, who had undergone a 26 -hour training program. The subjects first ranked 36 values on the Rokeach Value Survey. Secondly, they completed the 126 -item <b>Myers-Briggs</b> Trait <b>Type</b> <b>Indicator.</b> Third, they took the Jones-Mohr Listening Test, which is a 30 -item tape-recorded test in which the volunteer must listen to a statement and then select a phrase from a written list of four which best represents the intended meaning of the statement. The dependent variable was the Crisis Call Behavior Checklist. In this case, the volunteer was evaluated on the basis of an actual phone call to the hotline by the director of the hotline. The results of the study were evaluated on the basis of correlation and multiple regression.

The terms introversion and extraversion were popularized by Carl Jung, although both the popular understanding and psychological usage differ from his original intent.

Virtually all comprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms.

Those students preferring structured learning environments may prefer less open ended virtual learning gaming environments. Since the game incorporated multiple choice questions and rewarded correct choices made quickly, those students with personality styles in which questions are carefully considered before answering suffered in points scored compared to those used to making fast intuitive choices in exam settings.
