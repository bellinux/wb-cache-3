Since all wheels travel the same distance, the diameter of each wheel is proportional to its number of rotations compared to the <b>master</b> <b>wheel.</b> This calibration must be done while coasting at a fixed speed to eliminate the possibility of wheel slip/slide introducing errors into the calculation. Automatic calibration of this type is used to generate more accurate traction and braking signals, and to improve wheel slip detection.|$|E

Introduction: The {{mechanical efficiency}} of any machine or {{power is the}} useful work obtained, or in other words it is the work left after {{the function of the}} machine parts has been over come. It has become important at this day and age to know the efficiency of machines and powers, because those that are called for are the ones that will do the greatest amount of work with the least friction possible. The object of determining the efficiency of a sweep horse power was to find what percent of the work put into the power was lost by the gearing and bearings of the power. A one horse sweep power was secured and a series of tests made. The power selected was simple in construction, consisting of a <b>master</b> <b>wheel</b> or large bevel gear, which drove a small bevel gear or pinion to which a tumbling rod was attached. The object of the tumbling rod was to transmit the energy to some suitable place where it could be used. A dynamometer was attached to the sweep or lever arm of the power, and the horse allowed to pull on the dynamometer. A dynamometer is a device for measuring the power or force of any motor...|$|E

40|$|Myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (OLs) {{are formed}} {{continuously}} in the healthy adult brain. In this work, we study {{the function of}} these late-forming cells and the myelin they produce. Learning a new motor skill (such as juggling) alters {{the structure of the}} brain’s white matter, which contains many OLs, suggesting that late-born OLs might contribute to motor learning. Consistent with this idea, we show that production of newly formed OLs is briefly accelerated in mice that learn a new skill (running on a “complex wheel ” with irregularly spaced rungs). By genetically manipulating the transcription factor myelin regulatory factor in OL precursors, we blocked production of new OLs during adulthood without affecting preexisting OLs or myelin. This prevented the mice from <b>mastering</b> the complex <b>wheel.</b> Thus, generation of new OLs and myelin is important for learning motor skills.

6000|$|No; {{the real}} {{objection}} to equality and self-rule {{has nothing to}} do with any of these free and festive aspects of mankind; all men are democrats when they are happy. The philosophic opponent of democracy would substantially sum up his position by saying that it [...] "will not work." [...] Before going further, I will register in passing a protest against the assumption that working is the one test of humanity. Heaven does not work; it plays. Men are most themselves when they are free; and if I find that men are snobs in their work but democrats on their holidays, I shall take the liberty to believe their holidays. But it is this question of work which really perplexes the question of equality; and it is with that that we must now deal. Perhaps the truth can be put most pointedly thus: that democracy has one real enemy, and that is civilization. Those utilitarian miracles which science has made are anti-democratic, not so much in their perversion, or even in their practical result, as in their primary shape and purpose. The Frame-Breaking Rioters were right; not perhaps in thinking that machines would make fewer men workmen; but certainly in thinking that machines would make fewer men <b>masters.</b> More <b>wheels</b> do mean fewer handles; fewer handles do mean fewer hands. The machinery of science must be individualistic and isolated. A mob can shout round a palace; but a mob cannot shout down a telephone. The specialist appears and democracy is half spoiled at a stroke.|$|R
60|$|At {{that instant}} Captain Dunlop arrived, and his spear pierced the animal's flank. His aim was, however, disconcerted by his horse, {{at the moment}} he struck, leaping over the fallen ensign; the wound, therefore, was but a glancing one, and in a moment the boar was round upon his new assailant. Fortunately the horse was a well-trained one, and needed not the sharp touch of his <b>master's</b> rein to <b>wheel</b> sharp round on his hind legs, and dart off at full speed. The boar swerved off again, and {{continued}} his original line of flight, his object being to gain a thick patch of jungle, now little over {{a quarter of a mile}} distant; the detention, however, was fatal to him, for the doctor, who was close on Captain Dunlop's heels, now brought up his horse with a rush and, with a well-aimed thrust, ran the animal through, completely pinning him to the earth. The honor of his death was therefore divided between the doctor and Captain Dunlop, for the latter had drawn first blood, or, as it is termed, had taken first spear, while the former had scored the kill.|$|R
60|$|The {{people of}} Velez Malaga had beheld the camp of Muley Abdallah {{covering}} {{the summit of}} Bentomiz and glittering in the last rays of the setting sun. During the night they had been alarmed and perplexed by signal-fires on the mountain and {{by the sound of}} distant battle. When the morning broke the Moorish army had vanished as if by enchantment. While the inhabitants were lost in wonder and conjecture, a body of cavalry, the fragment of the army saved by Reduan de Vanegas, the brave alcayde of Granada, came galloping to the gates. The tidings of the strange discomfiture of the host filled the city with consternation, but Reduan exhorted the people to continue their resistance. He was devoted to El Zagal and confident in his skill and prowess, and felt assured that he would soon collect his scattered forces and return with fresh troops from Granada. The people were comforted by the words and encouraged by the presence of Reduan, and they had still a lingering hope that the heavy artillery of the Christians might be locked up in the impassable defiles of the mountains. This hope was soon at an end. The very next day they beheld long laborious lines of ordnance slowly moving into the Spanish camp--lombards, ribadoquines, catapults, and cars laden with munitions--while the escort, under the brave <b>master</b> of Alcantara, <b>wheeled</b> in great battalions into the camp to augment the force of the besiegers.|$|R
60|$|It was {{too early}} yet for the work to have begun in the dock. The water gleamed placidly, no {{movement}} anywhere in the long straight lines of the quays, no one about to be seen except the few dock hands busy alongside the Ferndale, knowing their work, mostly silent or exchanging a few words in low tones as if they, too, had been aware of that lady `who mustn't be disturbed.' The Ferndale was the only ship to leave that tide. The others seemed still asleep, without a sound, and only {{here and there a}} figure, coming up on the forecastle, leaned on the rail to watch the proceedings idly. Without trouble and fuss and almost without a sound was the Ferndale leaving the land, as if stealing away. Even the tugs, now with their engines stopped, were approaching her without a ripple, the burly-looking paddle-boat sheering forward, while the other, a screw, smaller and of slender shape, made for her quarter so gently that she did not divide the smooth water, but seemed to glide on its surface as if on a sheet of plate-glass, a man in her bow, the <b>master</b> at the <b>wheel</b> visible only from the waist upwards above the white screen of the bridge, both of them so still-eyed as to fascinate young Powell into curious self-forgetfulness and immobility. He was steeped, sunk in the general quietness, remembering the statement `she's a lady that mustn't be disturbed,' and repeating to himself idly: `No. She won't be disturbed. She won't be disturbed.' Then the first loud words of that morning breaking that strange hush of departure with a sharp hail: `Look out for that line there,' made him start. The line whizzed past his head, one of the sailors aft caught it, and there was an end to the fascination, to the quietness of spirit which had stolen on him at the very moment of departure. From that moment till two hours afterwards, when the ship was brought up in one of the lower reaches of the Thames off an apparently uninhabited shore, near some sort of inlet where nothing but two anchored barges flying a red flag could be seen, Powell was too busy to think of the lady `that mustn't be disturbed,' or of his captain--or of anything else unconnected with his immediate duties. In fact, he had no occasion to go on the poop, or even look that way much; but while the ship was about to anchor, casting his eyes in that direction, he received an absurd impression that his captain (he was up there, of course) was sitting {{on both sides of the}} aftermost skylight at once. He was too occupied to reflect on this curious delusion, this phenomenon of seeing double as though he had had a drop too much. He only smiled at himself.|$|R
