40|$|The endemic Sardinian <b>chalk</b> <b>hill</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly, Polyommatus coridon gennargenti, is {{considered}} vulnerable to extinction {{because of its}} low genetic variation and restricted distribution. The species also has a fragmented distribution, which follows the patchy distribution pattern of its larval host-plant. A preliminary investigation of the population structure of P. coridon gennargenti was carried out on a small network of four local populations by means of capture-recapture methods. Estimated population sizes and movement rates among the four adjacent local populations suggest that this taxon has a metapopulation structure composed of loosely connected small local populations. Natural fragmentation, isolation, and traditional land use contribute to the vulnerability of P. coridon gennargenti to extinction. Low effective population sizes and restricted movement between habitat patches lead to inbreeding and an increased vulnerability to extinction of this island population. © 2004 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|AbstractTaxonomic {{confusion}} {{exists in}} several sibling species groups. The Polyommatus coridon species complex (<b>Chalk</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>Blues)</b> {{serves as a}} model group of sibling species in which genetic analyses provide suitable means for taxonomic clarification. We studied the allozyme patterns of the two described bivoltine species of this complex, Polyommatus hispana and Polyommatus slovacus, and compared them to the two genetic lineages of the univoltine P. coridon. P. hispana is well distinguished from P. coridon (genetic distance: 0. 081), and most probably is a sibling species that has evolved during glacial isolation on the Iberian Peninsula. P. slovacus is genetically indistinguishable from the eastern, Pontic–Mediterranean lineage of P. coridon; therefore we suggest that it represents a local bivoltine population only. Since the spring generation of P. slovacus was much less common than the summer generation and showed less genetic diversity, {{it is probable that}} uni-/bivoltinism is a dimorphism affecting only part of the whole population. We suggest that the higher genetic diversity of the second generation may be a consequence of gene flow from adjacent single-brooded populations...|$|R
