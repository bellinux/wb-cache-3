The baseband modem is implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array and uses 294, 939 2 -input NAND gates with a clock frequency of 128 MHz. The Frequency Adaptive Modulation algorithm is 6 % of the entire baseband modem which means {{that it is of}} low complexity. The baseband modem is then integrated with a RF Front End. The maximum transmit power of the RF Front End is 7. 5 dBm. This prototype takes 128 MHz of bandwidth and divides it into 128 1 -MHz bins. The carrier frequency is at 5. 25 GHz. Measurements are taken with this prototype to investigate the concept of Frequency Adaptive Modulation. With a target uncoded Bit Error Rate of 10 − 3, it is found at distances of 1. 0 m to 10. 8 m, the data rate varies from 355 Mbps to 10 Mbps.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the wavelet packet transform (WPT) modulation scheme for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) band-limited systems is presented. The implementation involves using the WPT as the base <b>multiplexing</b> technology at <b>baseband,</b> instead of the traditional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) common in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{explores the}} design of time-limited {{input-output}} waveforms, the outputs being orthogonal, for band-limited channels, whose characteristics are known a-priori. Hence, the channel can support <b>baseband</b> <b>multiplexed</b> transmission without Intersymbol Interference. The problem has been worked out for two cases of channel modeling- the rational transfer function channel model and the distributed parameter channel model, using three methods of signal orthogonalization. For the rational function channel model, the signaling interval can be made arbitrarily small, thus permitting high signaling rates. For the distributed parameter channel model, the signaling rate works {{out to be a}} function of the line parameters and line length. At the receiving end, since the signals are orthogonal, a bank of matched filters separates the signals. The system performance has been evaluated in the presence of channel noise...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this book}} is fourfold: (1) to develop the {{mathematical}} theory behind signal processing as used in modern digital communication systems, (2) to extend these theoretical signalling concepts into information transmission links which are robust {{in the presence of}} noise and other impairment mechanisms, (3) to investigate how these transmission links can be developed into fixed and mobile data communication systems for voice and video transmission, and (4) to develop queuing theory techniques and explore their development in small and large scale data transmission networks such as ISDN. In Chapter 1, we discuss in general terms the history behind communication systems and introduce the basic concepts of accessing, modulation, switching for line and radio transmission. The next 18 chapters are organised in four parts. Specifically Chapters 2 through 4 are devoted to basic theory of periodic and transient signals, the statistics behind random processes and the concept of linear transmission systems. Chapters 5 through 13 cover the fundamentals of digital communications and include sampling and <b>multiplexing,</b> <b>baseband</b> transmission over metallic lines, decision and information theory and error control coding. This second part also includes a description of the many sophisticated bandpass modulation schemes, the calculation of the received power and associated signal-to-noise ratio in a practical communications link, and an indication how the performance of a system can be accessed by simulation, before the actual construction is attempted. The third part, Chapters 14 through 16, extends the previous link budget analysis to fixed point-to-point terrestial and satellite based microwave communication systems as well as mobile and cellular radio communication and video (TV) transmission and storage. The fourth part, Chapters 17 through 21, is devoted to communication networks. This starts with a discussion of network topologies, access techniques and their signalling and routing protocols and architectures before moving on to queueing theory. It then progresses naturally to public networks, SDH and ISDN, the internationally agreed standard for the worldwide digital telecommunications network before finally concluding with broadcast networks, both wired and wireless local area networks. This completely revised and extended networks section in the second edition introduces the reader to a range of rapidly evolving wireless networking techniques. This book is aimed at readers who are completing a graduate level B. Eng. /M. Eng. first degree course in Communications, Electronics or Electrical Engineering. It is assumed that these readers will have competence in the mathematical concepts explored in earlier courses in basic mathematical techniques, to handle comfortably the material in Part One. We have deliberately extended our coverage of digital communications to include the practical aspects of the implementation of digital PCM, SDH, packet speech systems as well as examining the capability of optical and microwave long-haul communication systems. With this balance between theory, applications and systems implementation we hope that this text will be readily used both in academia and in the rapidly growing mobile communications industry...|$|R

Also it offers variety of services for the wide range of applications. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is becoming widely applied in wireless communications system due to its high rate transmissions capability with high bandwidth efficiency and its robustness with regard to multipath and delay. It has been used in digital audio broadcasting systems (DAB), digital video broadcasting (DVB) systems, digital subscriber line (DSL) standards, and wireless LAN standards such as the American IEEE std. 802. 11 (WiFi) and WiMAX (stands for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), are one of the standards of IEEE which utilizes the idea of OFDM, and is aimed to provide high-throughput broadband connections over long distances. Conventially we use discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in OFDM system.
