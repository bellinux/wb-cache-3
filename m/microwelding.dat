50|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} {{of what is}} known as the imperfect junction coherer. The principle of operation (<b>microwelding)</b> suggested above for the filings coherer may be less likely to apply to this type because there is no need for decohering. An iron and mercury variation on this device was used by Marconi for the first transatlantic radio message. An earlier form was invented by Jagdish Chandra Bose in 1899. The device consisted of a small metallic cup containing a pool of mercury covered by a very thin insulating film of oil; above the surface of the oil, a small iron disc is suspended. By means of an adjusting screw the lower edge of the disc is made to touch the oil-covered mercury with a pressure small enough not to puncture the film of oil. Its principle of operation is not well understood. The action of detection occurs when the radio frequency signal somehow breaks down the insulating film of oil, allowing the device to conduct, operating the receiving sounder wired in series. This form of coherer is self-restoring and needs no decohering.|$|E

40|$|Microstructures {{and failure}} {{mechanisms}} of friction stir spot <b>microwelds</b> in 300 -mu m thin sheet of aluminum 1050 alloy were investigated. As {{an alternative to}} conventional soldering and welding in joining thin metals for electronic, medical and microdevices, friction stir welding may be utilized in order to limit the excessive heat damage. Transmission electron microscopy micrographs of the cross sections of friction stir spot <b>microwelds</b> in lap-shear specimens were examined. These <b>microwelds</b> showed the failure mode of nugget pullout under lap-shear loading conditions. The experimental observations suggested that under lap-shear loading conditions, the failure was initiated near the possible original notch tip in the stir zone and the failure propagated along the circumference of the nugget to final fracture. Microindentation hardness data of base metal, heat affected zone, thermal-mechanical affected zone and stir zone were obtained. The interface between the heat affected zone and the thermal-mechanical affected zone was the softest region, where the cracks of friction stir spot <b>microwelds</b> in the lap-shear specimens under the loadings initiated and leaded to fracture of the specimens.

40|$|The first finding {{from the}} AO 138 - 10 is that cold welding never occurred, and that microwelds didn't even affect the {{reference}} (presumably microweld prone) pairs of metals consisting of gold, silver, and chromium. The scientific disappointment from these results must be tempered by {{the notion of a}} static AO 138 - 10 experiment, reflecting the passive character of the global Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) flight. Thus far, it has been theorized that cold welding results from the peeling of the oxide layer, that is formed in an earth environment, by the space environment since such a layer no longer grows in space. In fact, such stripping of the oxide layer supposes relative motion of the contacting materials. In the absence of such motion, as in this experiment, oxidation will preserve its integrity and continue to prevent <b>microwelding.</b> More bewildering is that there was no <b>microwelding</b> of the reference pairs. Even though AO 138 - 10 failed scientific expectations, as did the LDEF structure with cold welding, the positive, functional aspect {{to keep in mind is}} the safe operation of single-shot (appendage releasing and/or latching) mechanisms, unhindered by <b>microwelding</b> in a space vacuum, as now demonstrated by the statically representative pairs of materials.

Then, the feasibility of laser shock peening using ultrafast laser pulses was experimentally investigated. A zinc coating was used for the thermo-protective effect, and a water confining layer was considered in the investigation. A high numerical aperture focusing lens was used to avoid optical breakdown of the water layer. Laser fluence and feed rate were selected as experimental parameters. Microhardness measurements were made on the top surface of the shock peened specimen and compared with the original material hardness.

In this paper, a new method for rapidly fabricating metallic micromold masters for manufacturing large volumes of polymeric microfluidic devices is presented. Polymers are preferred over silicon as the device material due to their better compatibility with biological and chemical substances. The manufacturing method involves laser micromachining of the desired imprint features from thin metallic sheets and then <b>microwelding</b> them onto a substrate to form the final mold master. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer is then poured over the mold and cured to produce the microfluidic device. The proposed method involves fewer processing steps than the soft lithography, electroplating and molding (LIGA) process. To verify the method, a metallic mold for a passive Y-channel microfluidic mixer was fabricated. The mold master was made from low-cost steel and the mold manufacturing process can be completed within an hour. PDMS elastomer is then poured over the mold and cured to produce the mixer.

40|$|Laser welding {{of copper}} is gaining {{more and more}} {{importance}} to create electrical contacts due to the high temperature resistance and high achievable mechanical loads. However, laser welding of copper in the past was always associated with low process stability. By using high brightness fiber laser sources, small laser spots can be generated which allows keyhole-based deep penetration welding even in copper with high quality. Unfortunately, a small spot size and keyhole welding lead to a small connection area between the two joining partners. To avoid this, spatial power modulation - a linear feed with superposed circular motion - has been introduced. By using an additional parameter, oscillation frequency, and amplitude, in conjunction with spatial power modulation, we can increase not only the connection area but also {{the stability of the}} laser welding process and quality characteristics of the welds. In addition to the conformity of the weld depth, the surface roughne ss of the weld {{is a measure of the}} quality. Especially in interconnection of lithium ion cells and high power electronics, the consistency of the weld depth influences the connection area, which is essential for the current-carrying capacity. The quantity of weld defects and irregularities has a direct impact on the surface roughness of the weld. This paper presents recent results on the influence of the spatial power modulation on quality characteristics during laser <b>microwelding</b> by analyzing the weld via three-dimensional longitudinal cross sections and via laser measuring of the weld surface. Experimental investigations are supplemented by finite element simulations which enable a detailed analysis of the influence of the laser scanning strategy on the geometry of the fusion zone...|$|E
