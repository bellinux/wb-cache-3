25|$|A {{physical}} examination, {{including a}} pelvic examination, and a pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. An adnexal mass {{is a significant}} finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, nodular, irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13–21% of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of adnexal masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, leiomyoma, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, dermoid cyst, cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, ureteral or bladder diverticulum, benign cystic <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum,</b> peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis.

40|$|Potassium bromate (KBrO 3) is an {{oxidizing}} agent {{that has been}} used as a food additive, mainly in the bread-making process. Although adverse effects are not evident in animals fed bread-based diets made from flour treated with KBrO 3, the agent is carcinogenic in rats and nephrotoxic in both man and experimental animals when given orally. It has been demonstrated that KBrO 3 induces renal cell tumors, <b>mesotheliomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum,</b> and follicular cell tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thyroid. In addition, experiments aimed at elucidating <b>the</b> mode <b>of</b> carcinogenic action have revealed that KBrO 3 is a complete carcinogen, possessing both initiating and promoting activities for rat renal tumorigenesis. However, the potential seems to be weak in mice and hamsters. In contrast to its weak mutagenic activity in microbial assays, KBrO 3 showed relatively strong potential inducing chromosome aberrations both in vitro and in vivo. Glutathione and cysteine degrade KBrO 3 in vitro; in turn, the KBrO 3 has inhibitory effects on inducing lipid peroxidation in the rat kidney. Active oxygen radicals generated from KBrO 3 were implicated in its toxic and carcinogenic effects, especially because KBrO 3 produced 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine in the rat kidney.

40|$|Background: Cancer is <b>the</b> third cause <b>of</b> {{death in}} Iran. Approximately 5 - 10 % {{of all human}} cancers {{are thought to be}} caused by {{occupational}} exposure to carcinogens.

There is also evidence that nonasbestos agents can induce malignant mesotheliomas. So, we need to study <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> exposure to asbestos in patients suffering from mesothelima to determine relationship between them in Iran, especially in occupational settings. Methods: We received <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> 272 <b>mesothelioma's</b> patients having been registered in 1385 to 1389 in Cancer Bureau, in Ministry of Health. One hundred fifty four of them had telephone number. Finally we could interview with 60 families and gathered data of patient's history of occupation, cigarette smoking and residence place interred in the designed questionnaire. Then we brought out <b>the</b> variants <b>of</b> age, sex, <b>the</b> province <b>of</b> birth place and the involved organs from <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> Cancer Bureau. Analysis of frequency of variants was carried out and compared once in 272 patients being registered in Cancer Bureau and then in the interviewed 60 patients.

40|$|Abstract—Asbestos {{appears not}} {{to act as a}} potent gut {{carcinogen}} in humans or other animals.

The amounts of asbestos naturally occurring in potable waters or added during the passage of such waters through asbestos-cement pipes are so small that one would not expect them to induce gut cancer; all epidemiological studies are consistent with this view. THE PROBLEM IN THE light of our present knowledge this question resolves itself into two questions: Does the ingestion of asbestos lead to cancer of the gut or <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum?</b> If so, does the use of asbestos-cement pipes increase to any significant extent the asbestos content of potable waters passing through it?

40|$|Abstract Introduction Well-differentiated {{papillary}} <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum</b> (WDPMP) {{is a rare}} subtype of epitheloid mesothelioma, {{which is}} usually seen in young women. WDPMP is generally considered of low malignant potential, however the long-term nature of the tumor remains poorly defined. Case presentation We describe the long-term follow-up of a 60 -year-old woman of West African descent who has survived 24 years with WDPMP after receiving extensive local and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy. Her clinical course has included three exploratory laparotomies with intraperitoneal and intravenous chemotherapy over two decades. Her course was complicated by anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, for which she underwent an orthotopic heart transplant. Our patient is alive with stable radiological evidence of peritoneal disease, and continues to suffer from chronic abdominal pain. Conclusion No consensus exists regarding optimal treatment strategies for WDPMP. However, given the low malignant potential of the tumor, careful consideration should be made before proceeding with aggressive interventions. Further, long-term follow-up reports are required to fully characterize this tumor. </p...|$|E

Among patients treated with chemotherapy, we determined chemotherapy regimen and OS by line of therapy. Results: <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 1, 625 patients considered eligible for this investigation, the median age at diagnosis was 78 years. Nearly a third of patients (30 %) had surgery as part of their treatment and 45 % were given chemotherapy. The median OS was 8 months (range 1 – 69 months). Among chemotherapy patients, the most commonly (67 %) prescribed regimen for first-line therapy was cisplatin or carboplatin (Ca/Ci) combined with pemetrexed (Pe). Among those prescribed Ca/Ci + Pe as first-line therapy, retreatment with Ca/Ci + Pe (28 %) or treatment with gemcitabine (30 %) were the most common second-line therapies.

A 69 -year-old man with histologically proven pleural mesothelioma on the right side and no past medical history of asbestos exposure received palliative treatment consisting of a talc pleurodesis. After a 6 -month interval of stable disease, a local progressive tumor of the right pleura was seen on a CT scan. Eleven months later, during follow-up, the patient presented at our emergency department with a sudden onset of diffuse abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a mass within the greater omentum and the coexistence of free fluid. Subsequent abdominal CT scans demonstrated tumor infiltration from the right pleura by a transdiaphragmatic route into the abdomen, where diffuse infiltration of the greater omentum was observed. Aspiration of the ascites and the biopsy of the greater omentum confirmed the diagnosis of secondary malignant <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum.</b> In conclusion, we present the extremely rare diagnosis of secondary malignant mesothelioma of the abdomen, which arose as a result of local progression from the right pleura into the abdomen...|$|E
40|$|As {{knowledge}} of the etiology of a disease increases, the disciplines seeming to have the greatest potential for producing further advances change. In the development of {{knowledge of}} the infectious diseases, centuries of clinical and pathologic study devoted to definition preceded a phase of productive epidemiologic investigation that itself has now given way to an era of laboratory predominance. In a more primitive state of investigation are concepts, for example, "positive health " and some psychiatric illnesses, that hardly seem to have achieved sufficient definition to be measured and have their distribution in the population described. Cancer, on the other hand, seems ripe for epidemiologic investigation. Its many components are reasonably well-defined, reasonably easy to diagnose and even, in many areas, reasonably well-reported. And yet, the state of {{knowledge of the}} etiology of cancer in man is to primitive {{that we do not}} know whether the major etiologic factors {{are most likely to be}} found among genetic, hormonal, infectious, chemical, physical, or psychologic agents. Nor do we know to what degree etiologic factors are likely to be found common to the many clinical and pathologic components of the category. For other diseases, in the past, this is the state of ignorance in which epidemiologic methods have provided some useful direction signals. PAST ACCOMPLISHMEMS AND METHODS What do we know of the etiology of cancer in man? Let us stick to wellestablished facts. We know that exposure to cigarette smoke accounts for about 90 per cent of the present lung cancer incidence. We know that lung cancer can also be induced by prolonged exposure to some product or products of chromate ore processing and that asbestosis is associated with lung cancer and with <b>mesothelioma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum.</b> We know that ionizing radiation can produce leukemia, cancer of the lung, skin and bone, and, at least in the fetus, a variety of other neoplasms. The cancerogenic properties of ionizing radiation are shared by short as well as prolonge...|$|E
25|$|Carcinosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum</b> {{may cause}} pain through inflammation, disordered visceral motility, or {{pressure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metastases on nerves. Once a tumor has penetrated or perforated hollow viscera, acute inflammation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum</b> appears, inducing severe abdominal pain. Pleural carcinomatosis is normally painless.|$|R
30|$|Last but not least, the {{segmentation}} and visualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdominal {{organs are}} critical for clinical application, such as diagnosis and surgical planning [9 – 12]. <b>The</b> visualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdominal organs is currently achieved with <b>the</b> used <b>of</b> volume rendering technique, available on standard console in radiological department. Due to <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum,</b> which consists <b>of</b> fat, muscle, and bone, a practical solution is to modify <b>the</b> opacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum</b> to view <b>the</b> inside organs using the transfer function. Although <b>the</b> transparency setting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum</b> enables to view the abdominal organs much more clearly, it simultaneously makes some part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organ transparent since the intensity value between <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum</b> and abdominal organs are very similar. Thus, a preliminary segmentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum</b> can effectively remove or eliminate this issue.|$|R

40|$|Malignant <b>mesotheliomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{abdominal}} cavity are rare tumors that primarily involve <b>the</b> <b>peritoneum,</b> mesentery, and omentum. Involvement of viscera is usually secondary to bulky and extensive serosal disease. We studied 7 cases <b>of</b> <b>mesothelioma</b> in which <b>the</b> initial manifestation {{was that of}} an ovarian mass. All patients underwent surgery with a primary diagnosis of ovarian cancer. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 7 cases, 4 were predominantly cystic and 3 were solid. Histologically, all cystic tumors were multicystic <b>mesotheliomas.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 3 solid tumors, one resembled ovarian serous and clear cell carcinoma, but had <b>the</b> immunoprofile <b>of</b> malignant meso-thelioma (Figure 1).
