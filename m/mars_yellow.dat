5000|$|Yellow ochre (also {{known as}} <b>Mars</b> <b>yellow,</b> Pigment yellow 42, 43), {{hydrated}} ferric oxide (...) , is a naturally occurring pigment found in clays {{in many parts}} of the world. It is non-toxic and has been used in painting since prehistoric times.|$|E
40|$|Extremely high {{atmospheric}} wind velocities {{are needed}} to erode particulate matter on Mars. Settling velocities are roughly equivalent to terrestrial settling velocities for clay to fine sand-size particles; suspension transport may be dominant for fine particles on <b>Mars.</b> <b>Yellow</b> clouds suggest that required threshold erosion velocities are reached and that {{a great deal of}} fine-grained material is carried in suspension. Yellow cloud origins are concentrated over the southern latitudes and areas of major topographic relief. The cloud distribution pattern suggests that high threshold velocities are attained by transient atmospheric disturbances such as slope winds and dust devils. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiography}} {{performed on}} the painting There Is No Yes without a No—The Hermit (1985) by António Dacosta revealed one of his lost works. The last and only record of the lost painting is {{a black and white}} photograph taken during the exhibition L'Artiste du Mois at Centre Culturel Portugais de la Fondation Calouste Gulbenkian in Paris, 1985. The chromatic reconstruction of the artwork would be of extreme importance for its dissemination as it was conceived. For this purpose, portable x-ray fluorescence analyses were carried out directly on the paintings for preliminary elemental identification and to determine the most favorable sampling areas for μ-Raman and SEM–EDS evaluation. Cross sections were observed under optical microscope for better discernment of the chromatic layers used in each painting. In both artworks, titanium white (rutile), Mars red, Mars black, ultramarine blue, phthalocyanine blue and dioxazine violet were identified. <b>Mars</b> <b>yellow</b> and Mars black were found on superficial layers from the latest painting; phthalocyanine green, chrome-based green and cadmium red/orange was found on deeper layers, belonging to the hidden painting...|$|E
50|$|The Kansas City Wizards {{put an end}} {{to their}} two-game losing streak, and Houston Dynamo got another point, as the two teams battled to a 1 - 1 draw in a game <b>marred</b> by <b>yellow</b> cards and missed {{opportunities}} at Robertson Stadium. Dynamo picked up a point on FC Dallas, who fell to D.C. United, but for the second consecutive game, they were unable to fully take advantage in extending their lead in the Western Conference.|$|R

He made a total of nine starts during their campaign as the Falcons disappointingly finished bottom of the log.|$|R
