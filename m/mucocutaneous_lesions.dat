25|$|Visual acuity, {{or color}} vision loss with {{concurrent}} <b>mucocutaneous</b> <b>lesions</b> or systemic Behçet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Behçet's disease and prompt a work-up for Behçet's disease if not previously diagnosed {{in addition to}} an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Behçet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy.|$|E

[...] The term [...] "reactive arthritis" [...] is increasingly used {{as a substitute for}} this designation because of Hans Conrad Julius Reiter's war crimes with the Nazi Party. The manifestations of reactive arthritis include the following triad of symptoms: an inflammatory arthritis of large joints, inflammation of the eyes in the form of conjunctivitis or uveitis, and urethritis in men or cervicitis in women. Arthritis occurring alone following sexual exposure or enteric infection is also known as reactive arthritis. Patients can also present with <b>mucocutaneous</b> <b>lesions,</b> as well as psoriasis-like skin lesions such as circinate balanitis, and keratoderma blennorrhagicum.

40|$|Abstract Exophytic gingival lesions {{represent}} some of {{the more}} frequently encountered lesions in the oral cavity. Some of these lesions are reactive in nature. Pyogenic granuloma is a relatively common benign <b>mucocutaneous</b> <b>lesion</b> occurring intra orally or extra orally. The exact etiopathogenesis remains unknown, although contributory factors include trauma, inflammation and infectious agents. Intraoral lesions are sometimes associated with pregnancy. Typically, pyogenic granuloma presents as an exuberant, red painless mass that easily bleeds, ulcerates and grows rapidly and is frequently seen on the gingiva. Treatment is surgical excision to exclude angiomatous proliferation. The condition is frequently associated with recurrence, and has more predilections towards females. Here by, presenting a case of pyogenic granuloma in a 40 years old male patient...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA {{structure}} and gene expression were analyzed in tissue specimens from {{oral hairy leukoplakia}} (HLP), a <b>mucocutaneous</b> <b>lesion</b> that develops in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The structure of the terminal restriction enzyme fragments of EBV revealed that HLP is a permissive infection without a predominant, detectable population of EBV episomal DNA. In RNA preparations from this uniquely permissive infection, EBV replicative mRNAs could be identified by Northern analysis; however, the virally encoded small nuclear RNAs, the EBERs, were not detected in most HLP RNA preparations. In situ hybridization detected EBER expression in very rare cells. These data indicate that unlike other viral small nuclear RNAs, the EBERs are not expressed during viral replication and must participate in the complex maintenance of latent EBV infection...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} a possible pathogenic role of cytokines in Behçet's disease (BD) {{by focusing on}} the analysis of cytokine gene expression within <b>mucocutaneous</b> BD <b>lesions.</b> METHODS: The study group comprised 20 patients with active BD. In this group, a set of chemokines as well as Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines in biopsy specimens obtained from oral and genital ulcers, pseudofolliculitis lesions, and lesions at the site of pathergy testing were studied using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We observed important increases in the expression of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) (approximately 700 -fold), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (approximately 65 -fold), interferon-gamma (approximately 71 -fold), and IL- 12 (approximately 69 -fold) messenger RNA in BD lesions compared with normal skin. Except for IL- 10 (approximately 75 -fold increase), Th 2 cytokines (i. e., IL- 4 and IL- 13) were absent.

40|$|Pyogenic {{granuloma}} (PG) is {{a benign}} non-neoplastic <b>mucocutaneous</b> <b>lesion.</b> It is a reactional response to constant minor trauma {{and might be}} related to hormonal changes. In the mouth, PG is manifested as a sessile or pedunculated, resilient, erythematous, exophytic and painful papule or nodule with a smooth or lobulated surface that bleeds easily. PG preferentially affects the gingiva, but may also occur on the lips, tongue, oral mucosa and palate. The most common treatment is surgical excision. This paper describes a mucocutaneous PG on the upper lip, analyzing the clinical characteristics and discussing the features that distinguish this lesion from other similar oral mucosa lesions. The diagnosis of oral lesions is complex and leads the dentist to consider distinct lesions with different diagnostic methods. This case report with a 4 year-follow-up calls the attention to the uncommon mucocutaneous labial location of PG and to the fact that surgical excision is the safest method for diagnosis and treatment of PG of the lip, even when involving the mucosa and ski...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} review the prevalence, {{incidence}} and disease presentation of lupus patients in Asian populations. The database of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE) through PUBMED up to September 2009 was searched for relevant articles using the search terms ‘systemic lupus erythematosus’, ‘epidemiology’, and ‘Asia’. Articles on lupus prevalence, incidence, and clinical manifestations were retrieved and their bibliogra-phies further screened for relevant articles. Proceedings of national, regional, and interna-tional rheumatology and SLE conferences were likewise searched for relevant abstracts. Retrieval rate of relevant articles was approximately 80 %. Prevalence and incidence figures are expressed per 100, 000 populations. Among the articles reviewed, epidemiologic informa-tion was usually obtained through population surveys or hospital cohorts. Prevalence data are available from 24 countries, and generally fall within 30 – 50 / 100, 000 population. However, one survey showed a higher prevalence of 70 (Shanghai), while three others showed a lower prevalence of 3. 2 – 19. 3 (India, Japan, Saudi Arabia).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pyogenic {{granuloma}} (PG) is {{a relatively}} common benign <b>mucocutaneous</b> <b>lesion.</b> The term is a misnomer as the lesion does not contain pus nor it is granulomatous. Etiology of the lesions is unknown, but predisposing factors that have been reported include pregnancy, trauma, vascular malformation and chronic inflammation. PG are usually solitary lesions. The most common intraoral site is marginal gingiva, but lesions have been reported on palate, buccal mucosa, tongue, and lips. Extraoral sites commonly involve the skin of face, neck, upper and lower extremities, and mucous membrane of nose and eyelids. In this report, we seek to highlight the therapeutic advantages achieved with diode laser in intraoral PG treatment compared with surgical excision. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report the cases of 85 patients presenting intraoral dull red, sessile, or pedunculated smooth surfaced nodule that may easily bleed, crust, or ulcerate. 62 were treated with surgical excision and 23 with diode laser treatment. The laser session consisted in diode laser photocoagulation ensued by diode laser excision of the lesion, preceded by treated areas cooling to avoid the tissue demage. According to the literature were used the following specification: wavelength 808 nm, 10 W power. Histological evaluation showed hyperplastic stratified squamous epithelium with stroma consisted {{of a large number}} of budding and dilateted capillaries and a dens chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. Diagnosis of PG was confirmed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Rapid healing can be observed within a few days of treatment, and as blood vessels are sealed, there is an improvement of haemostasis and coagulation compared with surgical excision. Post-operative pain discomfort, edema and bleeding are notably reduced. In conclusion, the use of diode laser offers a new tool that can change the way in which existing treatments are performed...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundLittle {{is known}} about the {{characteristics}} of patients who visit the emergency department (ED) due to food allergy in Taiwan. This study aims to assess the triggers, clinical presentations, and management of patients presenting to a tertiary ED for food allergy. MethodsThis is a retrospective study of 369 visits presenting to the ED of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan for food allergy over a 2 year period. Patients' demographics, food allergens, presenting features, and management were addressed and analyzed. Adult and pediatric cases were also compared. ResultsThe patients had an average age of 32. 9 years [standard deviation (SD)  ±  20. 6]; the cohort was 66. 9 % adult and 53. 7 % male. Seafood (67. 5 %), fish (6. 2 %), and fruits (4. 3 %) were the major foods eliciting acute allergic reactions. Overall itchy <b>mucocutaneous</b> <b>lesion</b> was the most common presentation (85. 6 %), followed by anaphylaxis (12. 2 %), respiratory distress (1. 4 %), and anaphylactic shock (0. 8 %). Mucocutaneous involvement was more common in the pediatric population (92. 6 % vs. 82. 2 %, p =  0. 007), whereas anaphylaxis was more prevalent in adults (15. 4 % vs. 5. 7 %, p =  0. 0068). Antihistamines (98. 6 %) and systemic corticosteroids (63. 1 %) were commonly used medications. Only 2. 2 % of patients with anaphylaxis received epinephrine. The average duration in the ED was 1. 6 hours (SD ±  1. 8). No death was documented in the current study. ConclusionSeafood, fish, and fruits are common foods which cause acute allergic reactions in Taiwan. Although most food allergies are mild, anaphylactic shock still presents in about 1 % of patients. Only a minority of patients with anaphylaxis receive epinephrine. As anaphylaxis may be life-threatening, prompt education and use of an epinephrine auto-injector deserves further concern...|$|R
