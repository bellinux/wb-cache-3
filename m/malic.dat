5|$|Acids in wine: tartaric, <b>malic</b> and citric are the {{principal}} acids in wine.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds with potential biological activities {{are found in}} sundews, including flavonoids (kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin and hyperoside), quinones (plumbagin, hydroplumbagin glucoside and rossoliside (7–methyl–hydrojuglone–4–glucoside)), and other constituents such as carotenoids, plant acids (e.g. butyric acid, citric acid, formic acid, gallic acid, <b>malic</b> acid, propionic acid), resin, tannins and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).|$|E
5|$|Fungi {{are used}} {{extensively}} to produce industrial chemicals like citric, gluconic, lactic, and <b>malic</b> acids, and industrial enzymes, such as lipases used in biological detergents, cellulases used in making cellulosic ethanol and stonewashed jeans, and amylases, invertases, proteases and xylanases. Several species, most notably Psilocybin mushrooms (colloquially known as magic mushrooms), are ingested for their psychedelic properties, both recreationally and religiously.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus agathosmus is edible, but {{considered}} bland. A {{study of}} the antioxidant capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five organic acids: oxalic, citric, <b>malic,</b> quinic, and fumaric acids. Using a standard laboratory test to determine antimicrobial activity, Hygrophorus agathosmus was shown to inhibit the growth of various pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis; it also inhibits {{the growth of the}} yeast Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring {{the sweetness of the}} wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting <b>malic</b> acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having a higher level of ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies have}} a high antioxidative capacity, due {{probably}} {{to a combination of}} various organic acids (such as oxalic, citric, <b>malic,</b> succinic and fumaric acids), tocopherols, phenolic compounds and alkaloids; the highest antioxidant activity is in the mushroom caps. Furthermore, fruit bodies were determined to have 528mg of the antioxidant compound ergothioneine per kilogram of fresh mushroom; this value was the highest among many food items tested in one study. Porcini were thought to have anti-cancer properties according to Hungarian research conducted in the 1950s, but later investigations in the United States did not support this.|$|E
5|$|Various authors regard Suillus collinitus as edible with a sour odor and nondescript taste. It is advisable, as for {{all species}} of Suillus, to pick only young {{specimens}} and to peel the cuticle before preparation. The mushroom contains several tocopherols, {{a class of}} chemical compounds collectively known as vitamin E, and which confer antioxidant activity. They also contain several organic acids, most predominantly the pairs <b>malic</b> and quinic acids, and citric and ketoglutaric acid, which respectively make up 42% and 30% of total organic acids. The composition and concentration of organic acids in mushrooms are major factors in influencing their flavour; some organic acids contribute to antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in <b>malic</b> acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Malic</b> acid can {{be further}} reduced during the {{winemaking}} process through malolactic fermentation or MLF. In this process, bacteria convert the stronger <b>malic</b> acid into the softer lactic acid; formally, <b>malic</b> acid is polyprotic (contributes multiple protons, here two), while lactic acid is monoprotic (contributes one proton), and thus has only half the effect on acidity (pH); also, the first acidity constant (pKa) of <b>malic</b> acid (3.4 at room temperature) {{is lower than the}} (single) acidity constant of lactic acid (3.86 at room temperature), indicating stronger acidity. Thus after MLF, wine has a higher pH (less acidic), and a different mouthfeel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Malic</b> acid, {{along with}} tartaric acid, {{is one of}} the {{principal}} organic acids found in wine grapes. It is found in nearly every fruit and berry plant, but is most often associated with green (unripe) apples, the flavor it most readily projects in wine. Its name comes from the Latin malum meaning “apple”. In the grape vine, <b>malic</b> acid is involved in several processes which are essential for the health and sustainability of the vine. Its chemical structure allows it to participate in enzymatic reactions that transport energy throughout the vine. Its concentration varies depending on the grape variety, with some varieties, such as Barbera, Carignan and Sylvaner, being naturally disposed to high levels. The levels of <b>malic</b> acid in grape berries are at their peak just before veraison, when they can be found in concentrations as high as 20g/l. As the vine progresses through the ripening stage, <b>malic</b> acid is metabolized in the process of respiration, and by harvest, its concentration could be as low as 1 to 9 g/l. The respiratory loss of <b>malic</b> acid is more pronounced in warmer climates. When all the <b>malic</b> acid is used up in the grape, it is considered “over-ripe” or senescent. Winemakers must compensate for this loss by adding extraneous acid at the winery in a process known as acidification.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacteria}} {{behind this}} {{process can be}} found naturally in the winery, in cooperages, which make oak wine barrels that will house a population of the bacteria or they can be introduced by the winemaker with a cultured specimen. For some wines, the conversion of <b>malic</b> into lactic acid can be beneficial, especially if the wine has excessive levels of <b>malic</b> acid. For other wines, such as Chenin blanc and Riesling, it produces off flavors in the wine (such as the buttery smell of diacetyl) {{that would not be}} appealing for that variety. In general, red wines are more often put through MLF than whites, which means a higher likelihood of finding <b>malic</b> acid in white wines (though notable exceptions, such as oaked Chardonnay, are often put through MLF).|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} convert L-malic acid found {{naturally in}} wine grapes. Most commercial <b>malic</b> acid additives are {{a mixture of}} the enantiomers D+ and L-malic acid.|$|E
25|$|Saliva stimulants – {{organic acids}} (ascorbic acid, <b>malic</b> acid), chewing gum, {{parasympathomimetic}} drugs (choline esters, e.g. pilocarpine hydrochloride, cholinesterase inhibitors), and other substances (sugar-free mints, nicotinamide).|$|E
25|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} {{tends to}} create a rounder, fuller mouthfeel. <b>Malic</b> acid is typically associated with the taste of green apples, while lactic acid is richer and more buttery tasting. Grapes produced in cool regions tend to be high in acidity, much of which comes from the contribution of <b>malic</b> acid. Malolactic fermentation generally enhances the body and flavor persistence of wine, producing wines of greater palate softness. Many winemakers also feel that better integration of fruit and oak character can be achieved if malolactic fermentation occurs during the time the wine is in barrel.|$|E
25|$|The enzymatic method {{allows for}} a {{quantitative}} measurement of both <b>malic</b> and lactic acids, but requires the expense of reagent kits and a spectrophotometer that can measure absorbance values at 334, 340, or 365 nm.|$|E
25|$|In winemaking, a {{bacterial}} process, natural or controlled, {{is often used}} to convert the naturally present <b>malic</b> acid to lactic acid, to reduce the sharpness and for other flavor-related reasons. This malolactic fermentation is undertaken by the family of lactic acid bacteria.|$|E
25|$|A much milder acid than tartaric and <b>malic,</b> {{lactic acid}} is often {{associated}} with “milky” flavors in wine and is the primary acid of yogurt and sauerkraut. It is produced during winemaking by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which includes three genera: Oenococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus. These bacteria convert both sugar and <b>malic</b> acid into lactic acid, the latter through MLF. This process can be beneficial for some wines, adding complexity and softening the harshness of <b>malic</b> acidity, but it can generate off flavors and turbidity in others. Some strains of LAB can produce biogenic amines, such as histamine, tyramine and putrescine, which may be a cause of red wine headaches in some wine drinkers. Winemakers wishing to control or prevent MLF can use sulfur dioxide to stun the bacteria. Racking the wine quickly off its lees will also help control the bacteria, since lees are a vital food source for them. The winemakers must also be very careful of what wine barrels and winemaking equipment to which the wine is exposed, because of the bacteria's ability to deeply embed themselves within wood fibers. A wine barrel that has completed one successful malolactic fermentation will almost always induce MLF in every wine stored in it from then on.|$|E
25|$|The {{organic acids}} are mainly <b>malic</b> and tartaric acids. Tartaric acid is a {{characteristic}} of grapes; in its leaves its content ranges from 5 to 7 grams per litre. <b>Malic</b> acid is present in green grapes and its ratio decreases with maturation to give between 2 and 7 grams per litre at harvest. The range is very wide depending on the variety and soil with hot climates giving lower rates as the heat accelerates its degradation. There are many other acids in small quantities: citric acid, ascorbic acid, α-ketoglutaric, fumaric acid, galacturonic acid, coumaric acid, etc. Their variable quantity varies the pH of the wort. The must of white wine is generally more acidic than red grape must simply because the grape maturity is less advanced.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Southeast Asia, {{the fruit}} of the {{tamarind}} is used as a poultice applied to foreheads of fever sufferers. The fruit exhibits laxative effects due to its high quantities of <b>malic</b> acid, tartaric acid, and potassium bitartrate. Its use for the relief of constipation has been documented throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Organic acids {{comprise}} {{most of the}} {{acids in}} honey, accounting for 0.17–1.17% of the mixture, with gluconic acid formed {{by the actions of}} an enzyme called glucose oxidase as the most prevalent. Other organic acids are minor, consisting of formic, acetic, butyric, citric, lactic, <b>malic,</b> pyroglutamic, propionic, valeric, capronic, palmitic, and succinic, among many others.|$|E
25|$|Tartaric acid is, from a {{winemaking}} perspective, {{the most}} important in wine due to the prominent role it plays in maintaining the chemical stability of the wine and its color and finally in influencing {{the taste of the}} finished wine. In most plants, this organic acid is rare, but it is found in significant concentrations in grape vines. Along with <b>malic</b> acid, {{and to a lesser extent}} citric acid, tartaric is one of the fixed acids found in wine grapes. The concentration varies depending on grape variety and the soil content of the vineyard. Some varieties, such as Palomino, are naturally disposed to having high levels of tartaric acids, while Malbec and Pinot noir generally have lower levels. During flowering, high levels of tartaric acid are concentrated in the grape flowers and then young berries. As the vine progresses through ripening, tartaric does not get metabolized through respiration like <b>malic</b> acid, so the levels of tartaric acid in the grape vines remain relatively consistent throughout the ripening process.|$|E
25|$|Sea {{buckthorn}} berries are edible and nutritious, though astringent, sour and oily, unpleasant to eat raw, unless 'bletted' (frosted {{to reduce the}} astringency) and/or mixed as a drink with sweeter substances such as apple or grape juice. Additionally, malolactic fermentation of sea buckthorn juice reduces sourness, thus in general enhances sensory properties. The mechanism behind this change is transformation of <b>malic</b> acid into lactic acid in microbial metabolism.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, butyric, linoleic, linolenic, <b>malic,</b> myristic, oleic and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E
25|$|Diacetyl can be {{produced}} by the LAB through metabolism of sugar or of citric acid. While citric acid is naturally present in grapes, {{it is in a}} very small amount with most of it coming from deliberate addition by the winemaker to acidify the wine. In the presence of both <b>malic</b> and citric acids, the LAB use both, but use the <b>malic</b> much more quickly, with the rate of citric use/diacetyl formation influenced by the particular bacterial strain (with most strains of O. oeni producing less diacetyl than Lactobacillus and Pediococcis species), as well as the redox potential of the wine. In wine conditions that have a low redox potential (meaning it is more oxidative such as in a barrel that is not fully topped up), more citric acid will be consumed and diacetyl formed. In more reductive conditions, such as in alcoholic fermentations where yeast populations are at their peak and the wine is heavily saturated with carbon dioxide, the formation of diacetyl is much slower. The yeasts also help keep levels low by consuming diacetyl and reducing it to acetoin and butylene glycol.|$|E
25|$|Another method uses {{a compost}} sock. Plants grown in compost socks {{have been shown}} to produce {{significantly}} higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), flavonoids, anthocyanins, fructose, glucose, sucrose, <b>malic</b> acid, and citric acid than fruit produced in the black plastic mulch or matted row systems. Similar results in an earlier 2003 study conducted by the US Dept of Agriculture, at the Agricultural Research Service, in Beltsville Maryland, confirms how compost plays a role in the bioactive qualities of two strawberry cultivars.|$|E
25|$|With wines {{that have}} {{excessive}} levels of diacetyl, some winemakers use sulfur dioxide to bind with the compound {{and reduce the}} perception of diacetyl by 30 to 60%. This binding is a reversible process and {{after only a few}} weeks aging in the bottle or tank, the high levels of diacetyl return. However, sulfur dioxide added earlier in the malolactic fermentation process limits diacetyl production by inhibiting the bacteria and limiting their activity in its entirety, including the conversion of <b>malic</b> to lactic acid.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} are fastidious organisms that cannot synthesize {{on their own}} all of their complex nutritional requirements. For LAB to grow and complete malolactic fermentation, {{the constitution of the}} wine medium must provide for their nutritional needs. Like wine yeast, LAB require a carbon source for energy metabolism (usually sugar and <b>malic</b> acid), nitrogen source (such as amino acids and purines) for protein synthesis, and various vitamins (such as niacin, riboflavin, and thiamine) and minerals to assist in the synthesis of enzymes and other cellular components.|$|E
25|$|Winemakers will {{sometimes}} add acids to the wine (acidification) {{to make the}} wine more acidic, most commonly in warm climate regions where grapes are often harvested at advanced stages of ripeness {{with high levels of}} sugars, but very low levels of acid. Tartaric acid is most often added, but winemakers {{will sometimes}} add citric or <b>malic</b> acid. Acids can be added either before or after primary fermentation. They can be added during blending or aging, but the increased acidity will become more noticeable to wine tasters if added at this point.|$|E
25|$|Diacetyl in wine is {{produced}} by lactic acid bacteria, mainly Oenococcus oeni. In low levels it can impart positive nutty or caramel characters, however at levels above 5mg/L it creates an intense buttery or butterscotch flavour, where it {{is perceived as a}} flaw. The sensory threshold for the compound can vary depending on the levels of certain wine components, such as sulfur dioxide. It can be produced as a metabolite of citric acid when all of the <b>malic</b> acid has been consumed. Diacetyl rarely taints wine to levels where it becomes undrinkable.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} have {{a useful}} role in winemaking converting <b>malic</b> acid to lactic acid in malolactic fermentation. However, after this function has completed, the bacteria {{may still be}} present within the wine, where they can metabolise other compounds and produce wine faults. Wines that have not undergone malolactic fermentation may be contaminated with lactic acid bacteria, leading to refermentation of the wine with it becoming turbid, swampy, and slightly effervescent or spritzy. This can be avoided by sterile filtering wine directly before bottling. Lactic acid bacteria can also be responsible for other wine faults such as those below.|$|E
25|$|Merlot grapes are {{identified}} by their loose bunches of large berries. The color has {{less of a}} blue/black hue than Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and with a thinner skin and fewer tannins per unit volume. It normally ripens up to two weeks earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon. Also compared to Cabernet, Merlot grapes {{tend to have a}} higher sugar content and lower <b>malic</b> acid. Ampelographer J.M. Boursiquot has noted that Merlot has seemed to inherit some of the best characteristics from its parent varieties—its fertility and easy ripening ability from Magdeleine Noire des Charentes and its color, tannin and flavor phenolic potential from Cabernet Franc.|$|E
25|$|The grape {{clusters}} {{receive some}} benefit from receiving direct sunlight through enhanced ripening of various phenolic compounds that {{can contribute to}} a wine's aroma and quality. In addition to having decreased physiological ripeness, excessive shade will negatively impact a grape's quality by causing increases in the levels of potassium, <b>malic</b> acid and pH in the grapes while decreasing the amount of sugar, tartaric acid and color producing anthocyanins. Beyond a lack of sunlight, excessive shading limits the amount of air circulation that can take place within a vine's canopy. In wet, humid climates poor air circulation can promote the development of various grape diseases such as powdery mildew and grey rot.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} {{fermentation}}, {{the wine}} may also have malolactic fermentation or FML. This second fermentation carried out by bacteria deacidifies the wine: it transforms the <b>malic</b> acid, which has two carboxyl groups, into lactic acid. This operation, which reduces the biting acidity of the wine, is not always desirable nor practiced. In southern areas the acidity is carefully preserved to give the wine its liveliness for refreshing Aroma of wine. During the fermentation of the grapes varietal aromas are reduced in favour {{of an increase in}} roundness and volume in the mouth of the wine during ageing in oak barrels. It gives a better biological stability in champagne wines.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} convert <b>malic</b> acid into {{lactic acid}} as an indirect means of creating {{energy for the}} bacteria by chemiosmosis which uses the difference in pH gradient between inside the cell and outside in the wine to produce ATP. One model on how this is accomplished notes that the form of L-malate most present at the low pH of wine is its negatively charged monoanionic form. When the bacteria move this anion from the wine into higher pH level of its cellular plasma membrane, it causes a net-negative charge that creates electrical potential. The decarboxylation of malate into L-lactic acid releases not only carbon dioxide, but also a proton that generates the pH gradient which can produce ATP.|$|E
25|$|Acidity {{is highest}} in wine grapes {{just before the}} start of veraison, which ushers in the {{ripening}} period of the annual cycle of grape vines. As the grapes ripen, their sugar levels increase and their acidity levels decrease. Through the process of respiration, <b>malic</b> acid is metabolized by the grape vine. Grapes from cooler climate wine regions generally have higher levels of acidity due to the slower ripening process. The level of acidity still present in the grape is an important consideration for winemakers in deciding when to begin harvest. For wines such as Champagne and other sparkling wines, having high levels of acidity is even more vital to the winemaking process, so grapes are often picked under-ripe and at higher acid levels.|$|E
25|$|Instead of yeast, {{bacteria}} play {{a fundamental}} role in malolactic fermentation {{which is essentially}} the conversion of <b>malic</b> acid into lactic acid. This has the benefit of reducing some of the tartness and making the resulting wine taste softer. Depending on the style of wine that the winemaker is trying to produce, malolactic fermentation may take place at the very same time as the yeast fermentation. Alternatively, some strains of yeast may be developed that can convert L-malate to L-lactate during alcohol fermentation. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ML01 (S. cerevisiae strain ML01), which carries a gene encoding malolactic enzyme from Oenococcus oeni and a gene encoding malate permease from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. cerevisiae strain ML01 has received regulatory approval in both Canada and the United States.|$|E
