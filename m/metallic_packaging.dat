40|$|This paper {{describes}} a newly-developed of an electromagnetic induction fluid heating appliance using a heatedflow-through <b>metallic</b> <b>package</b> {{incorporated into the}} nonmetallic vessel in the pipeline, which is composed of series-loaded resonant phase-shift PWM high-frequency inverter using IGBT modules and their optirum driver modules {{in addition to an}} auto-tuning PID controller for temperature regulation. This efficient inverter-fed type fluid heating appliance is more acceptable for high-quality heat energy transfer and delivery processing plants operated under a precise temperature control scheme as well as heat-energy storage and heat exchange processing plants because of clean, safty and high-efficient energy conversion, compactness in volumetric size, and ease to control. In particular, the series capacitor-compensated resonant PWM inverter with a power factor correction and active sinewave line current-shaping functions is introduced for induction-heated pipeline fluid healing. The original structure of electromagnetic induction-heated <b>metallic</b> <b>package</b> in the nonmetallic vessel or tank for high-efficient fluid heating is demonstrated from a practical point of view, in which specially-designed fluid-through induction-heating <b>metallic</b> <b>package</b> assembly with a huge heating surface to induce the eddy current is incorporated into the nonmetallic cylindrical vessel with a working coil connected to a high-frequency AC power supply.

30|$|During last decades, sensor {{elements}} {{based on the}} fiber Bragg grating (FBG) have been widely studied and developed due to the advantages of immunity to electromagnetic interference, compact size, high precision, and so on. The FBG itself is sensitive to axial strain and temperature variation directly and can indirectly measure these complex physical parameters, such as pressure, displacement, and vibration, by using some specially designed elastic structures to convert them into the axial strain of the FBG. Whether the FBG is fixed on the measured object to measure the strain directly or fixed on an elastic structure body to measure other physical quantities, these types of FBGs could be collectively called as strain sensing FBGs. The packaging of the FBG has important influence on FBG characteristics that directly affect the measurement accuracy, such as strain transfer, temperature characteristic, and spectral shape. This paper summarizes the packaging methods and corresponding temperature compensation methods of the currently reported strain sensing FBGs, focusing especially on fully pasted FBG, pre-stretched FBG with double-end fixed, and <b>metallic</b> <b>packaging.</b> Furthermore, the advantages and drawbacks of different packaging methods have been analyzed, which can provide a reference for future researches.|$|E

Nowadays, plastic packaging has gained worldwide spread forthe storage of olive oil. However, plastics are not inert and interaction phenomena may occur betweenpackaging materials and olive oil. In this study, extra virgin olive oil samples were submitted to acceleratedinteraction conditions, in contact with polypropylene (PP) andpolylactide (PLA) plastic packaging materials. 3 D-front-face fluorescence spectroscopy, being a simple, fast and non destructive analytical technique, wasused to study this interaction. Independent components analysis (ICA) was used to analyze raw 3 D-front-face fluorescence spectra of olive oil. ICA was able to highlight a probable effect of a migration of substanceswith antioxidant activity. The signals extracted by ICA corresponded to natural olive oil fluorophores(tocopherols and polyphenols) as well as newly formed ones which were tentatively identified asfluorescentoxidation products. Based on the extracted fluorescent signals, olive oil in contact with plastics had sloweraging rates in comparison with reference oils.

40|$|One of the {{limitations}} {{to the development of}} <b>metallic</b> <b>package</b> in industry is the high cost associated with the launching of new models. This cost is due to the large number of prototype tests that must be done until a solution that satisfies functioning requirements with the least cost is found. This work presents a systematic methodology for designing optimized <b>metallic</b> <b>packages</b> based on Response Surface Method (RSM) associated with Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of products homologation tests, using LS-DYNA explicit time integration algorithm to solve a Transient Dynamic Analysis with plasticity and geometrical nonlinearities. The proposed method is applied to a cylindrical water filled can that can not present leakage after being submitted to a fall test. Thus, to increase impact energy absorption, circumferential beads are added to body can and its dimensions and position are defined as design variables. The objective function is defined as the p-norm of the values of the Von Mises stress at the seams of the body with the cover. Concerning industry application the problem was solved by using tools commonly available at the industrial environment. An optimal design package was obtained, using Central Composite Design (CCD) to determine the design points for the RSM, and parameters of the methodology are discussed. To demonstrate the methodology efficiency, results are compared with standard configurations, showing reduction of around 50 % in the stress levels at the critical area of the can. 2.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} application of additive manufacturing to novel microwave components, including a dielectric-loaded antenna, an antenna solution for intra-chip wireless interconnects, an all-dielectric wave-bending structure for Ka-band and a compact multiband antenna for mobile device applications. First, a novel methodology is proposed to control antenna radiation pattern based on 3 D printing of specially-designed dielectric material, which realizes spatially-dependent dielectric constants around the antenna. As a proof of concept, we design a quarter-wavelength monopole antenna surrounded by a 3 D-printed polymer structure with an optimized dielectric property distribution. Unlike the conventional donut-shaped pattern of a quarter-wavelength monopole antenna, one-beam and multiple-beam patterns are obtained using a genetic-algorithm-based optimization. Different dielectric constant spatial distributions are realized by changing {{the ratio of the}} dielectric to air at the unit cell level in the entire antenna volume. A two-beam monopole prototype is designed, fabricated and tested. Second, we introduce a novel antenna design enabled by 3 D printing technology for future wireless intra-chip interconnects with applications to multicore architectures and system-on-chips (SoCs). In the proposed design, vertical quarter-wavelength monopoles at 160 GHz on a ground plane are used to avoid low antenna radiation efficiency caused by the silicon substrate. The monopoles are surrounded by a specially-designed dielectric distribution. This additional degree of freedom in design enabled by 3 D printing technology is used to tailor wave propagation path. Simulation results show that the proposed dielectric loading approach improves the desired link gain by 8 - 15 dB and reduces the undesired link gain by 9 - 23 dB from 155 to 165 GHz. As a proof-of-concept, a 60 GHz prototype is designed, fabricated and characterized. The measurements match the simulation results and demonstrate 10 - 18 dB improvement of the desired link gain and 10 - 30 dB reduction in the crosstalk from 55 to 61 GHz. The demonstrated path loss of the desired link at a distance of 17 mm is only 15 dB, which is over 10 dB better than the previously reported work. Moreover, based on liquid crystal material, we can achieve reconfigurable antennas for intra-chip wireless interconnects. Third, a 90 ° wave-bending structure at Ka-band (26. 5 - 40 GHz) based on 3 D-printed metamaterial is designed, fabricated and measured. The wave-bending effect is realized through a spatial distribution of varied effective dielectric constants. Based on the effective medium theory, different effective dielectric constants are accomplished by special, 3 D-printable unit cells, which allow different ratios of dielectric to air at the unit cell level. In contrast to traditional, metallic-structure-included metamaterial designs, the reported wave-bending structure here is all dielectric and implemented by the polymer-jetting technique, which features rapid, low-cost and convenient prototyping. Lastly, a compact multi-band antenna compatible with a <b>metallic</b> <b>packaging</b> for mobile devices is proposed. The antenna covers band- 1 698 - 787 MHz and band- 2 1710 - 2155 MHz, enabling LTE 2 / LTE 4 / LTE 12 / LTE 13 / GSM 1900 applications. The current distribution shows that the quarter-wavelength, half-wavelength and one-wavelength modes together contribute to the radiation in both bands. A four-element LC circuit is utilized for antenna bandwidth matching. The antenna is fabricated and measured. Close agreement between the measurement results and simulation results is observed...|$|E

40|$|Resonant sensors with nanostructured {{surfaces}} {{have long}} been considered as an emergent platform for high-sensitivity transduction because of the potentially very large sensing areas. Nevertheless, until now only complex, time-consuming, expensive and sub-optimal fabrication procedures have been described; in fact, especially with reference to in-liquid applications, very few devices have been reported. Here, we first demonstrate that, by immersing standard, ultra-low-cost quartz resonators with un-polished silver electrodes in a conventional zinc nitrate/HMTA equimolar nutrient solution, the gentle contamination from the <b>metallic</b> <b>package</b> allows direct growth on the electrodes of arrays of high-density (up to 10 μm− 2) and well-separated (no fusion at the roots) ZnO nanowires without any seed layer or thermal annealing. The combination of high-density and good separation is ideal for increasing the sensing area; moreover, this uniquely simple, single-step process is suitable for conventional, ultra-low-cost and high-frequency quartzes, and results in devices that are already packaged and ready to use. As an additional advantage, the process parameters can be effectively optimized by measuring the quartz admittance before and after growth. As a preliminary test, we show that the sensitivity to the liquid properties of high-frequency (i. e. high sensitivity) quartzes can be further increased by nearly one order of magnitude and thus show the highest ever reported frequency shifts of an admittance resonance in response to immersion in both ethanol and water...|$|R

The two main components of the package (base and cover) may either be glued or soldered. Each of these techniques has its advantages and drawbacks, and the choice should be driven by the functionality of the microsystem. The advantage of gluing {{is that it is}} quite an easy production process. The drawback is that glue, like all polymers, is not hermetic on the long term. This is a problem when the package should protect the microsystem from oxygen or water vapour, an example being OLED displays (Organic Light Emitting Diodes). The advantage of soldered <b>metallic</b> <b>packages</b> is that they are hermetic. The drawback is that the welding process takes place in an oven, and that the whole microsytem is heated to the fusion temperature of the joint.

Fortunately, spinal cord stimulation has shown great potential for improving motor function after spinal cord injury and other pathological conditions. Many animal studies have shown stimulation of the neural networks in the spinal cord can improve motor ability so dramatically that the animals can even stand and step after a complete spinal cord transaction. This thesis presents work to successfully provide a chronically implantable device for rats that greatly enhances {{the ability to control}} the site of spinal cord stimulation. This is achieved {{through the use of a}} parylene-C based microelectrode array, which enables a density of stimulation sites unattainable with conventional wire electrodes. While many microelectrode devices have been proposed in the past, the spinal cord is a particularly challenging environment due to the bending and movement it undergoes in a live animal. The developed microelectrode array is the first to have been implanted in vivo while retaining functionality for over a month. In doing so, different neural pathways can be selectively activated to facilitate standing and stepping in spinalized rats using various electrode combinations, and important differences in responses are observed. An engineering challenge for the usability of any high density electrode array is connecting the numerous electrodes to a stimulation source. This thesis develops several technologies to address this challenge, beginning with a fully passive implant that uses one wire per electrode to connect to an external stimulation source. The number of wires passing through the body and the skin proved to be a hazard for the health of the animal, so a multiplexed implant was devised in which active electronics reduce the number of wires. Finally, a fully wireless implant was developed. As these implants are tested in vivo, encapsulation is of critical importance to retain functionality in a chronic experiment, especially for the active implants, and it was achieved without the use of costly ceramic or <b>metallic</b> hermetic <b>packaging.</b> Active implants were built that retained functionality 8 weeks after implantation, and achieved stepping in spinalized rats after just 8 - 10 days, which is far sooner than wire-based electrical stimulation has achieved in prior work. </p...|$|R
