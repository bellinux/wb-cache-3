25|$|An AC load {{only can}} be applied to a non-polarized capacitor. Capacitors for AC {{applications}} are primarily film <b>capacitors,</b> <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors,</b> ceramic capacitors and bipolar electrolytic capacitors.|$|R
25|$|Most EMI/RFI {{suppression}} film capacitors are metallized {{polypropylene film}} capacitors. However, {{some types of}} <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> (MP) are still used for this application, because they still have some advantages in flame resistance.|$|R
25|$|Film power {{capacitors}} mostly use {{polypropylene film}} as the dielectric. Other types include <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> (MP capacitors) and mixed dielectric film capacitors with polypropylene dielectrics. MP capacitors serve for cost applications and as field-free carrier electrodes (soggy foil capacitors) for high AC or high current pulse loads. Windings can {{be filled with}} an insulating oil or with epoxy resin to reduce air bubbles, thereby preventing short circuits.|$|R
25|$|AC loads {{can occur}} in AC motor run capacitors, for voltage doubling, in snubbers, {{lighting}} ballast and for power factor correction PFC for phase shifting to improve transmission network stability and efficiency, {{which is one of}} the most important applications for large power capacitors. These mostly large PP film or <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> are limited by the rated reactive power VAr.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the great}} {{advantages}} of plastic films for capacitor fabrication is that plastic films have considerably fewer defects than paper sheets used in <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors.</b> This allows the manufacture of plastic film capacitors with only a single layer of plastic film, whereas <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> need a double layer of <b>paper.</b> Plastic film <b>capacitors</b> were significantly smaller in physical size (better volumetric efficiency), with the same capacitance value and the same dielectric strength as comparable <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Then-new plastic materials also showed further advantages compared with paper. Plastic is much less hygroscopic than paper, reducing the deleterious effects of imperfect sealing. Additionally, most plastics are subject to fewer chemical changes over long periods, providing long-term stability of their electrical parameters. Since around 1980, <b>paper</b> and <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> (MP capacitors) have almost completely been replaced by PET film capacitors for most low-power DC electronic applications. Paper is now used only in RFI suppression or motor run capacitors, or as a mixed dielectric combined with polypropylene films in large AC and DC capacitors for high-power applications.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, {{the first}} “film” type <b>capacitors</b> were <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> of film/foil configuration. They were fairly bulky, and not {{particularly}} reliable. As of 2012, paper {{is used in}} the form of <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> for MP <b>capacitors</b> with self-healing properties used for EMI suppression. [...] Paper is also used as an insulating mechanical carrier of metallized-layer electrodes, and combined with polypropylene dielectric, mostly in power capacitors rated for high current AC and high voltage DC applications.|$|R

The {{results showed that}} the aroma permeation through the three barrier layers was similar to their water vapour permeability. APV has the lowest permeability followed by the <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> with the printed paper having the highest permeability. Permeation through the cigarette package wall simulation material (inner wrapper + carton + PP) gave similar results.

25|$|However, the {{roughness}} of a <b>metallized</b> <b>paper</b> surface can cause many small air-filled bubbles between the dielectric and the metallization, decreasing the breakdown voltage of the capacitor. For this reason, larger film capacitors or power <b>capacitors</b> using <b>paper</b> as carrier of the electrodes usually {{are filled with}} an insulating oil or gas, to displace the air bubbles for a higher breakdown voltage.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a sensor for detecting {{the distribution of}} forces on a surface. The device with nine buttons consisted of an elastomer-based layer as a touch interface resting on a substrate of patterned <b>metallized</b> <b>paper.</b> The elastomer-based layer included a three-by-three array of deformable, hemispherical elements/reliefs, facing down toward an array of interdigitated capacitive sensing units on patterned <b>metallized</b> <b>paper.</b> Each hemispherical element is 20 mm in diameter and 8 mm in height. When a user applied pressure to the elastomer-based layer, the contact area between the hemispherical elements and the interdigitated capacitive sensing units increased with the deformation of the hemispherical elements. To enhance {{the sensitivity of the}} sensors, embedded particles of hydrogel in the elastomer-based layer increased the measured electrical responses. The measured capacitance increased because the effective dielectric permittivity of the hydrogel was greater than that of air. Electromechanical characterization verified that the hydrogel-filled elastomer was more sensitive to force at a low range of loads (23. 4 pF/N) than elastomer alone without embedded hydrogel (3. 4 pF/N), as the hydrogel reduced the effective elastic modulus of the composite material by a factor of seven. A simple demonstration suggests that the force-sensing array has the potential to contribute to wearable and soft robotic devices...|$|R

5000|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1950s, Sprague {{produced}} its classic [...] "Black Beauty" [...] line of <b>capacitors.</b> These <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> were similar to Robert Sprague's original patent. Instead of using wax coating on the outer body to keep moisture out (moisture renders capacitors useless), Sprague applied a plastic resin material to encapsulate the device and provide better and longer-lasting resistance to moisture.|$|R
5000|$|Robert C. Sprague (August 2, 1900 [...] - [...] September 27, 1991) {{was the son}} of Frank J. Sprague and Harriet Sprague.

5000|$|Type - the {{dielectric}} {{used in the}} capacitor. Polyester and polypropylene are most common, with ceramic capacitors also being popular, especially in lower-end instruments. Reissues of vintage instruments often use reproductions of vintage <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors,</b> which are also popular aftermarket replacements. Finally, audiophile-grade polypropylene film and foil capacitors are sometimes used in custom instruments, although their size can prove problematic as they're designed for use in audio amplifiers and consequently have working voltages in excess of 500 V, far higher than anything encountered inside an electric guitar.|$|R
25|$|Capacitors, {{especially}} ceramic capacitors, {{and older}} designs such as <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors,</b> can absorb sound waves {{resulting in a}} microphonic effect. Vibration moves the plates, causing the capacitance to vary, in turn inducing AC current. Some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. This can generate audible sound, but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte, if any.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the study of electricity non conductive materials like glass, porcelain, paper and mica have been used as insulators. These materials some decades later were also well-suited for further use as the dielectric for the first <b>capacitors.</b> <b>Paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> made by sandwiching a strip of impregnated paper between strips of metal, and rolling the result into a cylinder were commonly used in the late 19th century; their manufacture started in 1876, and they were used from the early 20th century as decoupling capacitors in telecommunications (telephony).|$|R
5000|$|The hazard was {{eliminated}} from later sets {{by the use}} of an internal ground bus connected to the chassis by an isolation network. Underwriters Laboratories required the adoption of the floating chassis, as isolation from the mains (the exact circuit and component values were not specified although the leakage current allowed was specified) to limit the shock to a [...] "safe" [...] current level. The chassis was maintained at RF ground (for shielding) by a bypass capacitor (typically 0.05 µF to 0.2 µF) usually with a resistor connected across it (typically 220 kΩ to 470 kΩ, although values as small as 22 kΩ were sometimes used or the resistor was simply omitted). Over the years, these <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> often become leaky, and could allow sufficient current flow to give the user a shock.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{capacitors}} {{were constructed}} via hand-printing on paper using pencil graphite. Graphite traces {{were used to}} draw conductive connections and capacitor plates on opposing sides of a sheet of standard notebook paper. The paper served as the dielectric separating the plates. Capacitance of the devices was generally < 1000 [*]pF and scaled with surface area of the plate electrodes. By combining a pencil-drawn capacitor with an additional resistive pencil trace, an RC low-pass filter was demonstrated. Further utility of the pencil-on-paper devices was demonstrated through description of a capacitive force transducer and reversible chemical sensing. The latter was achieved for water vapor when the hygroscopic cellulose matrix of the <b>paper</b> <b>capacitor’s</b> dielectric adsorbed water. The construction and demonstration of pencil-on-paper capacitive elements broadens the scope of paper-based electronic circuits while allowing new opportunities in the rapidly expanding field of paper-based sensors...|$|R
40|$|Oils {{extracted}} from Cucumeropsis edulis, Hevea brasiliensis (Para rubber), Hura crepitans (Sound box tree), Jatropha curcas (Physic nut), Khaya ivorensis (Lagos Mahogany) and Citrus sinensis (sweet orange) were assessed for such characteristic physical properties as colour, flavour (odour and taste), specific gravity, viscosity, dielectric constant, surface tension and refractive index. Specific gravity measurement varied between 0. 9004 - 0. 9113 at 80 �C and 0. 9125 - 0. 9207 at 30 �C. Viscosity measurement, in centipoises, ranged between 7. 35 - 9. 41 at 80 �C and 38. 44 - 60. 34 at 30 �C. Dielectric constant values varied between 1. 63 - 3. 88 within the temperature range of 26 - 80 �C. Surface tension values at 28. 5 �C were between 0. 03492 - 0. 03616 m - 1 and refractive index values at 28 �C lied between 1. 46469 and 1. 47072.

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) diagnostics are utilised {{to examine}} the aging process of mineral oil-impregnated-high density kraft <b>paper</b> <b>capacitor</b> bushing models, subjected to repetitive voltage switching surges. It is demonstrated that the PD measurements of cumulative apparent charge transfer and discharge inception stress constitute an effective means for assessing aging and its reversibility due to gas evolution and re-absorption or solubility of a mineral oil-impregnated-paper insulation system in the presence and absence of switching surges. While the experimental results indicate that electrically overstressed solid-liquid insulation can recover in part its initial electrical properties following an electrical stress-free period, long term stability is only effectively achieved by {{a reduction in the}} switching surge overstress through an increase in the overall insulation thickness. The electrical stress levels, employed in the experiments, are found to be not sufficiently elevated to lead to any detectable partial discharge formation within the oil phase itself; the observed discharge behavior is rather characteristic of the type that is normally associated with macroscopic cavities occluded within the oil-paper insulation systems...|$|R
