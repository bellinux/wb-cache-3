Geomagnetic variation data {{measured with a}} fluxgate magnetometer are not absolute but are relative to a baseline and show drift. To enhance {{the importance of the}} geomagnetic data at Syowa Station, therefore, it is necessary to correct the continuous variation data by using absolute baseline values acquired by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>theodolite</b> and proton magnetometer. However, the database of baseline values contains outliers. We detected outliers in the database and then converted the geomagnetic variation data to absolute values by using the reliable baseline values...|$|E
