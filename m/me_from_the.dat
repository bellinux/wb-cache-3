5|$|O you, Son, who, {{concealed}} in your mother's womb, you gather together peoples by your Father's act – for I perchance {{am able to}} compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be God, because, glorious one, the glittering stars show (you) to the world; and I ask, after the close of my life, that you grant to <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> throne of heaven to take a tiny gift because of the honour (I have) attained.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the deYoung family's Chronicle Publishing Company unit {{discussed}} a possible trade of KRON-TV (for $100 million) to the Gannett Company, {{in exchange for}} acquiring Gannett's Oklahoma City station KOCO-TV. The proposal ultimately fell apart by September 1983. In the late 1980s, KRON-TV was among the few local television stations in the United States that produced a game show: Claim to Fame was a weekly half-hour show hosted by Patrick Van Horn that usually ran on Saturday evenings. During that timeframe, KRON also produced a Saturday morning children's program called Buster and <b>Me.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> 1970s into the late 1980s, the station used Gabriel Fauré's Pavane, Opus 50 as the music piece played during its nightly sign-off, alongside scenic rustic shots from around the Bay Area. KRON also produced Bay Area Backroads, a half-hour program (which ran from the mid-1980s to 2008) that profiled places {{and people in the}} greater San Francisco Bay Area, and occasionally beyond. The program, which generally aired on Sunday evenings, featured hosts such as Jerry Graham and Doug McConnell.|$|E

500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath.

The track's sound was compared to the works of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails by David Chiu of Consequence of Sound. Furthermore, Chris Gerard, a writer for PopMatters, compared the production's sound to being intoxicated.|$|E
500|$|Handling the film's {{special effects}} were KNB EFX GROUP and the Moving Picture Company (MPC). For Jennifer's demonic form, the creators used {{different}} techniques. [...] "I actually wasn't in [...] that much because they created an entire head. They did a live cast of <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shoulders up. They created {{me and then}} put the teeth in", stated Fox. [...] "To save my face, they had a photo double that {{would come in and}} do most of the crazy monster makeup - they would do that on her. So it would go from me, then in post-production it would somehow go to her and the fake head. They would mix them all together." ...|$|E

Witnesses from the Pandora attested that Heywood had surrendered himself voluntarily, and that he had been fully cooperative in providing information. On the issue of his alleged laughing at Bligh's predicament, Heywood managed to cast doubts on Hallett's testimony, asking how Hallett had managed [...] "to particularise the muscles of a man's countenance" [...] at some distance and during the hurly-burly of a mutiny.

[...] In 2003, Randall was nominated for an Australian Writers' Guild AWGIE Award for Best Unproduced Screenplay. Randall's script was subsequently picked up by producer Miriam Stein and her production company, Tama Films. Stein said that [...] "The script resonated with <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start", particularly because of her similar adolescent experience as a Jewish girl who felt like an outsider. Stein brought the film into production after recruiting Nice Pictures CEO Heather Ogilvie as executive producer, Los Angeles-based Harry Clein as associate producer and Buena Vista International to handle distribution in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

500|$|Henn {{revealed}} that {{he was drawn to}} [...] "Mulan's story [...] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, [...] "We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's not going to look realistic... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across." [...] In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as [...] "the emotional heart of the story". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of her {{decision}} to become Mahomet's queen, Irene becomes ensnared in a complex power struggle between his various advisors: the First Visier Cali Bassa, the Aga Mustapha, and the officer Abdalla, who is suffering from unrequited love for Aspasia.

500|$|The {{audience}} {{reception of}} Jonas Quinn was sparked with controversy over Michael Shanks' {{departure from the}} show. When rumors began late in 2001 that Showtime would also not be renewing StargateSG-1 after its fifth season, panicking fans rallied to save the show and Daniel's character, starting massive write-in campaigns and setting up websites such as the [...] "Save Daniel Jackson" [...] site. The SciFi Channel eventually ordered a sixth season of the show, but the character of Jonas continued to be distrusted by loyal fans, who were concerned that Daniel's death might cause the SG-1 team to lose its moral compass. Robert C. Cooper summarized that [...] "there's been {{quite a bit of}} ire directed by fans towards Daniel's replacement" [...] after the airing of [...] "Meridian", but he hoped that the character would grow on fans eventually.

500|$|Artists {{influenced}} by The Kinks include punk rock {{groups such as}} the Ramones, [...] The Clash, and The Jam, heavy metal acts including Van Halen and Britpop groups such as Oasis, Blur and Pulp. Craig Nicholls, singer and guitarist of The Vines, described the Kinks as [...] "great songwriters, so underrated". Pete Townshend, guitarist with the Kinks' contemporaries the Who, credited Ray Davies with inventing [...] "a new kind of poetry and a new kind of language for pop writing that influenced <b>me</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> very, very, very beginning." [...] Jon Savage wrote that The Kinks were an influence on late-1960s American psychedelic rock groups [...] "like The Doors, Love and Jefferson Airplane".

Musicologist Joe Harrington stated: [...] "You Really Got Me', 'All Day and All of the Night' and 'I Need You' were predecessors of the whole three-chord genre ... the Kinks did a lot to help turn rock 'n' roll (Jerry Lee Lewis) into rock (Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Stooges)."

[...] In 1976, Brian revealed that before the final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by members of the group, whom Brian declined to name.
