5|$|Gaius instructs <b>Merlin</b> {{to deliver}} elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room {{he finds the}} poppet, but bluffs {{his way out of}} discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests to fall asleep. <b>Merlin,</b> {{realising}} what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but <b>Merlin</b> drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but <b>Merlin</b> slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards <b>Merlin</b> by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea. The next day, Gaius gives <b>Merlin</b> a book on magic, under condition that he keep it hidden.|$|E

The type is equipped with extended-range fuel tanks and is capable of air-to-air refuelling. The <b>Merlin</b> is frequently utilised for troop transport duties and for the transport of bulky objects, either internally or underslung, including vehicles and artillery. The <b>Merlin</b> Depth Maintenance Facility at RNAS Culdrose performed most tasks upon the <b>Merlin</b> HC3.|$|E

5|$|As the <b>Merlin</b> was {{considered}} to be so important to the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the <b>Merlin</b> in the U.S. or Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 <b>Merlin</b> order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a <b>Merlin</b> XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war the <b>Merlin</b> I, II and III ran on the then {{standard}} 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cuin) displacement: the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 pounds per square inch (141kPa; 1.44atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the <b>Merlin</b> rated to use 100 octane fuel. The <b>Merlin</b> R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400m), 1,285 horsepower (958kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800m) and 1,320 horsepower (984kW) on take-off; while a <b>Merlin</b> X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700m) and 1,160 horsepower (865kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100m).|$|E

50|$|By early 1973 the {{certificates}} of fitness of the 16 earliest <b>Merlins</b> {{were due to}} expire, requiring them to be overhauled. In the event only one (MBS 4) was completed, the overhaul taking 8 months to complete. Such was {{the cost of the}} refit, that it was decided to withdraw the remainder of the batch. In the meantime the <b>Merlins</b> had started to display serious mechanical problems, with oil spillage onto the roads leading to complaints from local authorities and the Metropolitan Police. In August 1973 the GLC gave the LTE permission to withdraw the <b>Merlins</b> five years early, and to replace them with new double-deckers.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, Westland made an {{unsuccessful}} unsolicited offer to the British Ministry of Defence, proposing an enhanced <b>Merlin</b> variant intended {{to satisfy the}} demand for additional lift capacity. An alternative measure was the acquisition of six AW101s from Denmark in 2007; designated <b>Merlin</b> HC3A, these {{were assigned to the}} RAF, allowing Merlins to be deployed in Afghanistan. The HC3A is used for training and not for frontline operations due to various configuration differences. In December 2007, a second <b>Merlin</b> squadron, No. 78 Squadron was formed at RAF Benson.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} aircraft engines of the World War II era, some fifty marks of <b>Merlin</b> were built by Rolls-Royce in Derby, Crewe and Glasgow, as well as by Ford of Britain at their Trafford Park factory, near Manchester. A de-rated version was also the basis of the very successful Rolls-Royce/Rover Meteor tank engine. Post-war, the <b>Merlin</b> was largely superseded by the Rolls-Royce Griffon for military use, with most <b>Merlin</b> variants being designed and built for airliners and military transport aircraft. Production ceased in 1956 with the fulfilment of an order for 170 Merlins for the Spanish Air Force's CASA 2.111 and Hispano Aviación HA-1112 aircraft, after 160,000 engines had been delivered. In addition, the Packard V-1650 was a version of the <b>Merlin</b> built in the United States, itself produced in numbers upwards of 55,000 examples, and was the principal engine used in the North American P-51 Mustang.|$|E

In March 2004, Navy Merlins were temporarily grounded following an incident at RNAS Culdrose in which a tail rotor failed due to a manufacturing defect. An improved tail rotor was designed and adopted on most AW101s; according to AgustaWestland, the redesigned rotor also significantly reduced associated maintenance.|$|E
