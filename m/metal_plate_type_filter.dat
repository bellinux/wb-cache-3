40|$|A new photoacoustic {{instrument}} for {{the measurement of}} aerosol light absorption was collocated with conventional aerosol instrumentation during the 1996 - 1997 winter intensive of the Northern Front Range Air Quality Study. Measurements of the light absorption efficiency for black carbon were 5 m 2 /g at 685 nm and 10 m 2 /g at 532 nm, and for elemental carbon, 3. 6 m 2 /g at 685 nm. We show that these values together with previous photoacoustic measurements of aerosol light absorption elucidate the wavelength dependence of absorption efficiency for carbonaceous aerosol in the visible and near-visible region. Integrating <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> <b>filter</b> measurements of aerosol light absorption result in far larger values than those measured with the photoacoustic instrument. We demonstrate that a very recently published correction technique [Horvath, 199 X] can yield improved agreement. Moosmller et al. : submitted to JGR [...] Atmospheres...|$|R
40|$|Wave filters may be {{employed}} in laboratory facilities to attenuate oscillatory surface waves reflected from a test model, or {{to improve the quality}} of generated waves. When used for these purposes, they are placed between the generator and the test model, usually quite close to the generator. The studies reported herein consisted of experimental tests of the attenuation and reflection characteristics of plate and wire-mesh filters. The results indicated that high attenuations can be achieved with either <b>type</b> <b>filter</b> without serious reflections. The attenuation and reflection depend, in addition to other factors, upon the plate spacing of <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> and the porosity of wire-mesh filters. Very dense or closely spaced filters produced high attenuations and high reflections. The best over-all performance was obtained by plate spacings or porosities selected to utilizee a filter length equal to or in excess of the wave length. Reflection produced by plate filters depended, to a considerable extent, on the blockage or reduction in cross-section of the channel, as well as on the ratio of wave length to filter length. Reflections from plate filters were reduced when the filter was constructed of plates of various lengths. The experimental results were compared with available theory. Very good agreement was obtained with the plate-type filter when the spacing was not too small. Brief comparisons between the data on wire-mesh filters and two suggested theories were not successful. The majority of the filter tests were conducted in a relatively small wave channel. limited tests were conducted on wire-mesh filters in a large channel; a comparison of data from the two sources indicated that porosity was not the sole factor affecting the attenuation and that the resistance of the wire mesh probably varied as a function of Reynolds number.

50|$|Charge in the {{universe}} is conserved. The electrophorus simply separates positive and negative charges. A positive or negative charge ends up on the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> (or other storage conductor), and the opposite charge is stored in another object after grounding (in the earth or the person touching the <b>metal</b> <b>plate).</b> This separation takes work since the lowest energy state implies uncharged objects. Work is done by raising the charged <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> away from the oppositely charged resinous plate. This additional energy put into the system is converted to potential {{energy in the form}} of charge separation (opposite charges that were originally on the plate), so raising the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> actually increases its voltage relative to the dielectic plate.|$|R

40|$|Uniformity of the {{temperature}} in the mold plate is of paramount important since it will affect the dimensional stability of the part produced. To provide uniform temperature to the <b>metal</b> <b>plate,</b> many factors need to be considered such as choice of heating technology, uniformity of a heat source, a type of control, etc. This paper aims to study {{the temperature}} uniformity of <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> using closed-loop oscillating heat pipe (CLOHP) as a heat transfer device. The <b>metal</b> <b>plates</b> which were P- 20 with the size of 306 x 130 mm 2 were used. <b>Metal</b> <b>plate</b> was gouged to a depth of 3 mm for installing the CLOHP. Distances from the heating device to the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> surface were 5 and 10 mm. The surface temperatures of the <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> were controlled at 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 130 °C. Sixteen pointa of temperature were recorded. The results were then compared to those using the heat source as the cartridge heater arranged in the similar way with the same heating capacity. Once the system entered the steady state, {{it was found that the}} temperature distribution of <b>metal</b> <b>plate</b> using the CLOHP has a deviation in the range of ± 1. 00 °C and ± 0. 94 °C at the CLOHP depth of 5 mm. and 10 mm., respectively. While those of using cartridge heater deviated in the range of ± 1. 35 °C and ± 1. 16 °C. Compare to the recommended value from the ASTM Standard that the mold surface temperature need to be in the range of ± 2. 0 °C, the CLOHP shows the very promising results...|$|R
