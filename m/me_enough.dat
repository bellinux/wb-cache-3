500|$|Evancho {{appeared}} in the feature film The Company You Keep, a 2013 political thriller. She played Isabel, the eleven-year-old daughter of a widowed attorney turned fugitive, played by Robert Redford, who also directed the film. Jon Weisman wrote that Evancho [...] "showed she's more than a singing prodigy with her earnest sweetness". Redford cast Evancho only days before filming began. Evancho said in 2012: [...] "I don't think I want to act full-time. I think I might like {{to do something with}} a Disney special or make a movie once in a while that would give <b>me</b> <b>enough</b> time to sing and record, but that's about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Commercially, {{the song}} had limited success, {{reaching}} number 27 on the US Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart but only managing to peak at 99 Billboard Hot 100. Later {{in an interview}} with Billboard magazine, Garrett revealed that the song would not be included on Pink Friday and that the poor performance of the song was out of his control, [...] "I was only able to do as much as I was allowed to do. Sometimes you have to step back and get off the wheel. I didn't have control of the entire creative process. A lot of [...] artists trust <b>me</b> <b>enough</b> and allow me to do what I know is best to do as a producer".|$|E
500|$|Asif had {{initially}} rejected Dilip Kumar {{for the part}} of Prince Salim. Kumar was reluctant {{to act in a}} period film, but accepted the role upon the insistence of the film's producer. According to Kumar, [...] "Asif trusted <b>me</b> <b>enough</b> to leave the delineation of Salim completely to me." [...] Kumar faced difficulty while filming in Rajasthan owing to the heat and the body armour he wore. The part of Anarkali had first been offered to Suraiya but later went to Madhubala, who had been longing for a significant role. Madhubala suffered from congenital heart disease, {{which was one of the}} reasons why at times she fainted on set; she also endured skin abrasions while filming the prison sequences, but was determined to finish the film.|$|E

500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw {{too much attention to}} it and should try to keep it {{in the back of their}} heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave <b>me</b> <b>enough</b> to get home to my wife and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon was first used in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
500|$|There was a {{backlash}} in India, which forced Gilchrist to clarify his position. Gilchrist later {{insisted that he}} did not accuse Tendulkar of lying in his testimony. He also denied calling the Indian a [...] "bad sport" [...] in regards to the handshake issue. Tendulkar responded by saying that [...] "those remarks came from someone who doesn't know <b>me</b> <b>enough.</b> I think he made loose statements...I reminded him that I {{was the first person to}} shake hands after the Sydney defeat." [...] The autobiography also blamed the ICC for allowing Sri Lankan cricketer Muralitharan to bowl; Gilchrist believes that ICC changed the throwing law to legitimise a bowling action that he regards as illegitimate. The law change was described as [...] "a load of horse crap. That's rubbish." [...] Gilchrist claimed that Muralitharan threw the ball and alleged that the ICC protected him because Sri Lankan cricket authorities portrayed any criticism of the bowler's legitimacy as racism and a witchhunt conducted by whites. In response to these comments, former Sri Lankan captain Marvan Atapattu said that by questioning the credentials of players like Muralitharan and Tendulkar, Gilchrist had done no good to his own reputation.|$|E
500|$|Rixey {{was traded}} to the Reds prior to the 1921season for Jimmy Ring and Greasy Neale. In his first season with the Reds, he won 19 games, and set a Major League record by {{allowing}} just one home run in 301 innings pitched. In three of the next four seasons, he had 20 or more victories each season, with a league-leading total of 25 in 1922. He also led the league in innings pitched and hits allowed in 1922 and shutouts with four in 1924. In 1926 he had 14 wins, followed by seasons of 12, 19 and 10 wins. Rixey's production began to decline in 1930, when he went 9–13 with a 5.10ERA, and pitched fewer than 200 innings {{for the first time since}} 1919. From 1931 through 1933, Rixey pitched very little, and was used almost exclusively against the Pittsburgh Pirates. For the 1933 season, he was the only Reds pitcher with a winning record, at 6-3 as the Reds finished last in the National League with a 58-94record. He retired prior to the 1934season, stating [...] "the manager wasn't giving <b>me</b> <b>enough</b> work". Rixey completed his career with 266wins, 251losses, and a 3.15ERA. He appeared in 692games and completed 290, and had 20wins and 14saves as a relief pitcher.|$|E

500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared {{that he would not be}} able to give <b>me</b> <b>enough</b> attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] as to what they would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it." ...|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{continued}} his road racing successes in 1975, winning {{three out of}} four races in the 1975 Transatlantic Match races. After having won the national championship in 1974, Roberts faced an increasingly difficult battle in dirt track races, as Harley-Davidson continued to improve their XR-750 dirt tracker while Yamaha struggled to maintain the pace. Roberts made up for his bike's lack of power with an almost fearless, determined riding style. He battled Harley-Davidson factory rider Gary Scott throughout the 1975 season but mechanical breakdowns hampered his title defense. He had been leading the Daytona 200 when mechanical problems yielded the victory to his Yamaha teammate Gene Romero. At the Ascot TT, Roberts battled from 17th place to take the lead before a broken sprocket ended his race. Roberts' fearless riding style was highlighted at the Indy Mile Grand National. In a desperate effort to keep Scott within reach in the points chase, Yamaha wedged a Yamaha TZ750 two-stroke road racing engine inside a dirt track frame. On a bike that was considered unrideable due to its excessive horsepower, Roberts came from behind on the two-stroke, and overtook the factory Harley-Davidson duo of Corky Keener and Jay Springsteen on the last lap {{for one of the most}} famous wins in American dirt track racing history. Afterward, Roberts was famously quoted as saying, [...] "They [...] pay <b>me</b> <b>enough</b> to ride that thing". Despite accomplishing another Grand Slam, this time in only one season, Roberts lost his crown, finishing second to Gary Scott in the 1975 national championship.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses {{that he and}} Aaron should take the rod and order the rock to yield its water. Moses took the rod, {{assembled}} the congregation {{in front of the}} rock, and said to them: [...] "Listen, you rebels, shall we get water for you out of this rock?" [...] Then Moses struck the rock twice with his rod, out came water, and the community and their animals drank. But God told Moses and Aaron: [...] "Because you did not trust <b>Me</b> <b>enough</b> to affirm My sanctity in the sight of the Israelite people, therefore you shall not lead this congregation into the land that I have given them." [...] The water was named Meribah, meaning quarrel or contention." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 1, 1889, Wright {{married his}} first wife, Catherine Lee [...] "Kitty" [...] Tobin (1871–1959). The two had met around {{a year earlier}} during {{activities}} at All Souls Church. Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: [...] "Mr. Sullivan, {{if you want me}} to work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend <b>me</b> <b>enough</b> money to build a little house?" [...] With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot at the corner of Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of Oak Park. The existing Gothic Revival house was given to his mother, while a compact Shingle style house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, Hip-Hop Press posted {{information}} about Ron Carroll launching his own independent record label called Electricity, {{which is to}} be part of One Entertainment company that will specialize in marketing and promoting concerts, fashion shows and club events all over the world, and signing Electronic, Hip-Hop/R and gospel artists. According to the producer himself, Carroll's goal with the label (which has a major distribution deal with Universal) is to focus on artist development, music education and ensuring that Electricity creates a solid foundation for the music industry in Chicago. Following this announcement, a house/groove, [...] "In Love with a DJ", with Peniston as its lead vocalist was released in July, including four remixes. In an interview for Great British Life, Carroll said that he [...] "wanted to make a song that gives the perspective of a woman groovin’ to my music, and loving <b>me</b> <b>enough</b> make her night complete.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} first {{released}} on cinema in Ireland on 23 March 2007, {{followed by a}} limited release in the United States on 16 May 2007. After its second weekend in release in the United States and Canada, the film topped the 23 May 2007 indieWIRE box office chart with nearly $31,000 average per location. As of 28 March 2009, Once has grossed nearly $9.5 million in North America and over $20 million worldwide. After 2007's box office success and critical acclaim, it won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film.

2500|$|On March 13, 2006, a {{statement}} was issued in Hayes's name, indicating {{that he was}} asking {{to be released from}} his contract with Comedy Central, citing recent episodes which satirized religious beliefs as being intolerant. [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins," [...] he was quoted in the press statement. However, the statement did not directly mention Scientology. A response from Matt Stone said that Hayes' complaints stemmed from the show's criticism of Scientology and that he [...] "has no problem – and he's cashed plenty of checks – with our show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons or Jews." [...] Stone adds, [...] " [...] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Stone and Parker agreed to release Hayes from his contract by his request. In 2007, Hayes said he had quit because [...] "they [...] didn't pay <b>me</b> <b>enough...</b> They weren't that nice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! But I wonder if we can start with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to respect <b>me</b> <b>enough</b> to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E
