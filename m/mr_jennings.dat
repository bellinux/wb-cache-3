25|$|In 1970, <b>Mr</b> <b>Jennings</b> again {{raised the}} issue of {{pollution}} through Burton, the River Tame continuing {{to be a source of}} the problem, and further improvements were promised. The responsibility for sewage treatment works still belonged primarily to local authorities, which often meant an uncoordinated approach and a proliferation of small works. In 1974, these works were transferred to the regional water authorities, with the Severn Trent Water Authority taking over the role for the Trent catchment. This led to increased investment, the closure of older and smaller works, with sewage treatment being combined at larger modern works such as Strongford and Minworth.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008 the House of Lords re-visited the {{doctrine}} of proprietary estoppel, {{and in the process}} was quite fierce in describing its limits. [...] In that light, it must be very doubtful that <b>Mr</b> <b>Jennings</b> would have got the result he did: properly understood, Jennings v Rice {{is a bit of a}} muddle, probably concerning promissory estoppel, with a bit of quantum meruit thrown in for good measure.|$|E

"If <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings</b> {{will permit}} me," [...] pursued the old lady, [...] "I {{should like to}} ask a favour. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings</b> is about to try a {{scientific}} experiment to-night. I used to attend scientific experiments when I was a girl at school. They invariably ended in an explosion. If <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings</b> will be so very kind, I should like to be warned of the explosion this time. With a view to getting it over, if possible, before I go to bed." ...|$|E
60|$|One of his peculiarities, as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> {{learned on}} the second day, was his habit of coming to breakfast. But he always earned all he got, and more too; and, as it was {{probable}} that his living at home was frugal, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> smiled at his thrift, and quietly gave him his breakfast if he arrived late, which was not often.|$|R
6000|$|An {{intimate}} {{acquaintance of}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> joined them {{soon after they}} entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was herself left to quiet reflection. She saw nothing of the Willoughbys, nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her. But at last she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings,</b> left her own party for a short time, to join their's. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> immediately whispered to Elinor, ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Dear, dear! We are all as {{the grass}} of the field, Miss Dorothy,--here to-day and gone to-morrow, as sparks fly upwards. Just {{fit to be}} cut down and cast into the oven. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings</b> has been with her, I believe?" [...] <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings</b> was the other minor canon.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{do it by}} degrees,' {{said the}} Mayor. 'You would begin with one piece to-morrow, and two the next day, and so on, till you had got it all on. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings,</b> give Twigger a glass of rum. Just try the breast-plate, Twigger. Stay; take another glass of rum first. Help me to lift it, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings.</b> Stand firm, Twigger! There!--it isn't half as heavy as it looks, is it?' ...|$|E

60|$|The chance {{proved a}} lucky one, for {{a message from}} Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived, carried <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> away.|$|R
60|$|Charlie thanked 'er, {{and they}} was all walking along, him and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> behind, when Emma looked over 'er shoulder.|$|R
60|$|This melancholy sat strangely upon <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings,</b> {{who usually}} took {{things as they}} came with smiling resignation. It {{affected}} Bradley deeply to see him so gloomy.|$|E
6000|$|Easy-going <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings</b> {{laughed in}} his silent way. [...] "I guess you'll help {{when the time}} comes," [...] he said, and, clucking to his team, drove off.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear me, Mr. Jennings,' said Nicholas, turning pale at the {{possibility}} of Ned's being smothered in his antique costume--'Dear me, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings,</b> can nothing be done with him?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> {{directly}} {{gave her}} the gratifying assurance that she certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.|$|R
60|$|Charlie laughed, and {{the more}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> showed 'er dislike for 'is {{nonsense}} the more he gave way to it. Even Ted {{thought it was going}} too far, and tried to interfere when he put his arm round Mrs. Jennings's waist and made 'er dance to a piano-organ; but there was no stopping 'im, and at last <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> said she had 'ad enough of it, and told Emma she was going off 'ome.|$|R
5000|$|In Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen's {{character}} <b>Mrs</b> <b>Jennings</b> {{recommends a}} little Constantia for [...] "its healing powers on a disappointed heart".|$|R

60|$|At last he mounted his planking, {{selecting}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings</b> to pull {{upon the}} other {{handle of the}} hog-hook. He considered he conferred a distinct honor in this selection.|$|E

60|$|In the drawing-room, whither {{she then}} repaired, she was soon joined by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings,</b> with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.|$|R

60|$|Milton, his twenty-year-old son, {{was just}} driving {{out of the}} yard, seated in a fine new cutter, drawn by a {{magnificent}} gray four-year-old colt. He drew up as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings</b> spoke.|$|E
60|$|A {{little before}} stage time, that castle of {{indolence}} awoke. The ostler threw his straw away {{and set to}} his preparations. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings</b> rubbed his eyes; happy <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jennings,</b> the something he {{had been waiting for}} all day about to happen at last! The boarders gathered in the veranda, silently giving ear, and gazing down the road with shaded eyes. And as yet there was no sign for the senses, not a sound, not a tremor of the mountain road. The birds, to whom the secret of the hooting cuckoo is unknown, must have set down to instinct this premonitory bustle.|$|E

6000|$|She {{performed}} {{her promise}} of being discreet, to admiration.--She attended {{to all that}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three times to say, [...] "Yes, ma'am."--She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another, and when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jennings</b> talked of Edward's affection, it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself.|$|R
