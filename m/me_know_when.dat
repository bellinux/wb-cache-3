500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April 1801, Nelson began to advance into Copenhagen harbour. The battle began badly for the British, with , [...] and [...] running aground, {{and the rest of}} the fleet encountering heavier fire from the Danish shore {{batteries}} than had been anticipated. Parker sent the signal for Nelson to withdraw, reasoning:I will make the signal for recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in a condition to continue the action he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be attached to him. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: [...] "I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and let <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> he surrendered. Keep your eyes fixed on him." [...] He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes." [...] He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said [...] "I really do not see the signal." [...] The battle lasted three hours, leaving both Danish and British fleets heavily damaged. At length Nelson dispatched a letter to the Danish commander, Crown Prince Frederick, calling for a truce, which the Prince accepted. Parker approved of Nelson's actions in retrospect, and Nelson was given the honour of going into Copenhagen the next day to open formal negotiations. At a banquet that evening, he told Prince Frederick that the battle had been the most severe he had ever been in. The outcome of the battle and several weeks of ensuing negotiations was a 14-week armistice, and on Parker's recall in May, Nelson became commander-in-chief in the Baltic Sea. As a reward for the victory, he was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, on 19 May 1801. In addition, on 4 August 1801, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk, this time with a special remainder to his father and sisters. Nelson had sailed to the Russian naval base at Reval (now Tallinn) in May, and there learned that the pact of armed neutrality was to be disbanded. Satisfied with the outcome of the expedition, he returned to England, arriving on 1 July.|$|E
2500|$|To {{maximize}} the output from their holdings, the Bradleys lease their lands during hunting season. Minnie Lou has issued ten suggestions to her temporary tenants. One is “No litter”; anyone caught littering, {{and that includes}} cigarette butts, will not be invited back to hunt on Bradley 3 land. She insists that guests treat her as a friend, not as a business associate, and that they stay in communication: “We have a busy ranch, so I like to have hunters call {{ahead of time and}} let <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> they’ll be there. All of my hunters are great at communicating when they plan on being out and are always quick to let me know if they see any problems on the ranch.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Dian Wei {{later became}} a {{subordinate}} of Xiahou Dun, a general under the warlord Cao Cao. He was promoted to Major (司馬) for his efforts in battle. Around 194, Cao Cao attacked a rival warlord Lü Bu in Puyang (濮陽) and launched a surprise night attack on one of Lü's camps located 40-50 li west of Puyang. However, Lü Bu led reinforcements from Puyang and joined in the battle. Cao Cao and his forces were caught in an onrush by Lü Bu's forces. Dian Wei ordered dozens of men to gather around him, put on two layers of armour, discard their shields and arm themselves only with spears and jis. Another wave of enemy soldiers closing in from the west unleashed a barrage of arrows onto Dian Wei and his men. Dian Wei remained oblivious to the arrows and told his men, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> the enemy is ten paces away." [...] The men did so. Dian Wei then said again, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> they are five paces away." [...] The men then suddenly cried out in fear, [...] "The enemy is upon us!" [...] Dian Wei was holding on to a dozen jis, and he flung them at the enemy when they were near him. Each ji knocked down an enemy soldier {{and not a single}} ji missed its target. Lü Bu's forces retreated. By then, it was nearing dawn, so Cao Cao and his forces returned to their camp. Cao Cao was impressed with Dian Wei so he promoted the latter to Commandant (都尉). Dian Wei was placed in command of hundreds of Cao Cao's personal guards, who patrolled around Cao's tent. Dian Wei was a robustly built fighter, so the guards under his command were specially selected by him. In battle, Dian Wei and his men were always the first to charge into the enemy formation. Dian Wei was later promoted to Colonel (校尉).|$|E

2500|$|Phillimore and the Edgar {{went with}} Sir Hyde Parker's fleet for his {{expedition}} to the Baltic in 1801. [...] During the Battle of Copenhagen Phillimore {{had been sent to}} Parker's flagship, the 90-gun [...] to take his examination. He served as the Londons acting-signal lieutenant during the battle, sending Parker's famous signal for Nelson to withdraw. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: 'I told you to look out on the Danish commodore and let <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> he surrendered.

[...] Phillimore returned to the Edgar after the battle, where he learnt that the Edgars first lieutenant had been killed in the engagement. A round of general promotions of the junior officers followed, and Phillimore was promoted to lieutenant.|$|E
