25|$|On December 14, 2006, a 17-year-old {{girl from}} Montgomery County, Virginia, filed {{a civil lawsuit}} against Vick accusing him of molestation of a <b>minor,</b> <b>fraud,</b> and {{additional}} charges. In the lawsuit, seeking $6.3 million, the girl claimed {{that when she was}} 15 (below the legal age of consent in Virginia), she was forced into a sexual situation with Vick, who was 20 years old, over a nearly two-year-long period. She also alleged that Vick offered to provide her alcohol and marijuana and forced her to have sex with other men. On September 15, 2008, the parties agreed to a settlement in the lawsuit.|$|E
5000|$|The once-great Max Bialystock (Mostel) {{had once}} been the toast of Broadway, but now he has been reduced to a washed-up, aging, fraudulent, corruptible, and greedy Broadway {{producer}} who barely ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence romancing lascivious, wealthy elderly women ("angels" [...] in theatrical terms) in exchange for money for his next play. Accountant Leopold [...] "Leo" [...] Bloom (Wilder), a young man who is highly nervous and prone to hysterics, arrives at Maxs office to do his books and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Maxs last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively <b>minor</b> <b>fraud,</b> and while shuffling numbers, Leo has a revelation: a producer could make a lot more money with a flop than a hit by overselling shares in the production, because no one will audit the books of a play presumed to have lost money. Max immediately puts this scheme into action. They will oversell shares on a massive scale and produce a play that will close on opening night, thus avoiding payouts and leaving the duo free to flee to Rio de Janeiro with the profits. Leo is afraid such a criminal venture will fail and they will go to prison, but Max eventually convinces him that his drab existence is no better than prison.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, {{joined by}} Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. [...] Breyer stated that class arbitrations are {{appropriate}} ways to resolve claims that are minor individually but {{significant in the}} aggregate. [...] "Where does the majority get its contrary idea — that individual, rather than class, arbitration is a fundamental attribute of arbitration?" [...] He said that without class actions, <b>minor</b> <b>frauds</b> would not be remedied. [...] "What rational lawyer would have signed on to represent the Concepcions in litigation {{for the possibility of}} fees stemming from a $30.22 claim?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Plaetorius, a tribune of the plebs before 192. No {{title is}} preserved, but Cicero names a Lex Plaetoria that {{protected}} {{young men and}} <b>minors</b> from <b>fraud,</b> and references in Plautus to such legislation would date it prior to 191 BC.|$|R
5000|$|Calderón heavily {{supported}} Picado {{during the}} 1944 election, through means legal and illegal. The campaign season was particularly ugly by Costa Rican standards, at times turning violent. According to recent, documented studies, by historians Fabrice Lehoucq and Ivan Molina, {{though there was}} some <b>minor</b> electoral <b>fraud</b> in a few voting tables {{far removed from the}} Capital, it was not enough to have changed the outcome of the landslide election. [...] Picado won by a 2:1 margin.|$|R
50|$|In {{one such}} case wealthy {{businessmen}} had made financial contributions to martial arts organizations, {{as was the}} norm. Unfortunately, in several instances the contributions were not properly accounted for. In one case in particular, Ji and his organization were brought up on charges of tax fraud. Even though Ji was generally viewed as not guilty, {{he was given a}} prison term of one year. The judge in the case later explained that it was really beyond his control and that if Ji did not go to jail on this <b>minor</b> tax <b>fraud</b> charge, he would no doubt continue to be charged with other offenses until he was sent to prison on something else, perhaps something more serious.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of modern services in the United States use toll-free numbers whereby clients can dial up to request a call with a particular performer using credit cards, Automated Clearing House systems, {{and a variety of}} other billing methods. There are still some services that rely upon premium-rate telephone numbers (e.g., 976 and 900 numbers) for billing purposes, although this practice has been largely abandoned due to the high rate of fraud associated with these lines and the inability to dial 900 and 976 lines from cellular phones. As a direct result, most telephone companies allow their customers to block outgoing calls to premium-rate telephone numbers. In 1996, the FCC changed regulations on 900 numbers to address abuse of these services by <b>minors</b> and <b>fraud</b> concerns.|$|R
5000|$|Soon after, Rachel petitioned {{for divorce}} but was herself imprisoned for {{pursuing}} an extra-marital {{affair with a}} man called John Ford. Both were incarcerated on [...] "suspicion of uncleanliness and other evil practises". The two were bound to maintain 'good behaviour' and the relationship with Ford ended. She renewed her efforts to obtain a divorce from Lawrence Clinton, who married again although not divorced from Rachel, sired children, and continued to come before the courts on <b>minor</b> charges of <b>fraud.</b>|$|R
500|$|On 12 December 1975 Private Eye {{included}} another short teasing {{piece by}} Auberon Waugh which ended: [...] "My only {{hope is that}} sorrow over his friend's dog will not cause Mr Thorpe's premature retirement from public life". By this time most newspapers knew of the stories surrounding Thorpe and Scott, but were wary of libel; according to Parris, by keeping silent they were [...] "serving notice on Thorpe that they knew a bigger story must break, and could wait for it". In January 1976 Scott appeared before magistrates on a <b>minor</b> social security <b>fraud</b> charge, and stated {{that he was being}} hounded because of his previous sexual relationship with Thorpe. This claim, made in court and therefore protected from the libel laws, was widely reported.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the years}} Scott made several {{attempts}} to publicise his story, but no newspapers were interested. The satirical magazine Private Eye decided in late 1972 {{that the story}} [...] "was defamatory, unproveable, and above all was ten years old". Even when, in October 1975, Newton's bungled attempt to shoot Scott resulted {{in the death of}} the latter's Great Dane, Rinka, and Newton's arrest on charges of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, the press remained muted, possibly awaiting the bigger story that they hoped would break. Their reticence ended in January 1976 when Scott, in court on a <b>minor</b> social security <b>fraud</b> charge, claimed he was being hounded because of his previous sexual relationship with Thorpe. This statement, made in court and thus protected from the libel laws, was widely reported.|$|R
