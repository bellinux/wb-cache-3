The rebellion was led by Maha Chakkraphat, the deposed king of Siam whom Bayinnaung had just showered with honors and permitted to return to Ayutthaya on pilgrimage as a monk. No sooner had the monk arrived at Ayutthaya than he flung off the robe, and declared independence. But all was not lost. The ruler of central Siam (Phitsanulok), Maha Thammarachathirat, remained loyal to him. On 29 May 1568, a dismayed Bayinnaung sent an army of 6,000 to reinforce Phitsanulok.|$|E
25|$|<b>More</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> arrived: the Syrian governor's {{army had}} been {{defeated}} by the Parthians, and retreated in disarray. Reinforcements were dispatched for the Parthian frontier. P. Julius Geminius Marcianus, an African senator commanding X Gemina at Vindobona (Vienna), left for Cappadocia with detachments from the Danubian legions. Three full legions were also sent east: I Minervia from Bonn in Upper Germany, II Adiutrix from Aquincum, and V Macedonica from Troesmis. The northern frontiers were strategically weakened; frontier governors were told to avoid conflict wherever possible. M. Annius Libo, Marcus' first cousin, was sent to replace the Syrian governor. He was young—his first consulship was in 161, so he was probably in his early thirties—and, as a mere patrician, lacked military experience. Marcus had chosen a reliable man rather than a talented one.|$|E

Measuring flows of <b>bad</b> and good <b>news</b> using flows of negative and positive abnormal stock returns, we find that firms with higher volatility of operations and managerial incentives to withhold <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> exhibit relatively <b>more</b> concentrated <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> flows.

He also acknowledged that remunerative steps (in the form of more stock options) would have to be taken to redress the animosity of many Enron employees towards management after it was revealed that Lay and other officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock during the months prior to the crisis. The situation was not helped by the disclosure that Lay, his [...] "reputation in tatters", stood to receive a payment of $60 million as a change-of-control fee subsequent to the Dynegy acquisition, while many Enron employees had seen their retirement accounts, which were based largely on Enron stock, ravaged as the price decreased 90% in a year.

We first construct a communication game between an investor and a (possibly) biased securities analyst. We find an equilibrium characterised by the following properties: first, the investor reacts <b>more</b> to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> than to good news, and second, the di. erence in this reaction is higher when the investor has a greater prior suspicion that the analyst is a biased type. We then use nonparametric techniques and a large database of earnings forecasts to test these predictions, and find that the evidence supports them. Lastly, we use our empirical strategy to discriminate between the causes for analysts’ bias. ...|$|R

The methodology {{is based on}} a dynamic covariance modelling that accounts for leverage effects and the asymmetric impact of currency fluctuations.

Market volatility tends to be ceteris paribus, <b>more</b> sensitive to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> about equity than good news and more responsive to currency depreciations than appreciations.

By employing a double-threshold GARCH model to investigate six major index-return series, we find strong evidence supporting the asymmetrical hypothesis of stock returns.

As a result, they react <b>more</b> strongly to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> than to good news. They also dislike assets for which information quality is poor, especially when the underlying fundamentals are volatile. These effects induce negative skewness in asset returns, increase price volatility and induce ambiguity premia that depend on idiosyncratic risk in fundamentals. Moreover, shocks to information quality can have persistent negative effects on prices even if fundamentals do not change. This helps to explain the reaction of markets to events like 9 / 11 / 2001. ...|$|R

40|$|Conditional {{conservatism}} (CON) {{is related}} to the cost of equity capital in a complex way, especially in imperfect markets. Prior literature suggests that CON affects the information precision and information asymmetry, resulting in either increased or decreased cost of equity. In addition, CON may influence firms’ investment decisions and exacerbate their fundamental operating risks, and investors are asymmetrically loss-averse to <b>more</b> <b>bad</b> earnings <b>news</b> reporting via conservative disclosure, both of which contribute to a higher equity cost. This paper empirically examines the impact of CON on the cost of equity capital through these informational, fundamental and behavioral risk effects, and detects a significantly positive association between CON and equity cost by adopting accounting-based CON proxies and equity cost measures adjusted for unexpected cash flow shocks. Using the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) as a natural experiment, we find that the positive CON-equity cost relation disappears in the post-SOX period, consistent with diminished informational, operational, and behavioral risk effects engendered by SOX regulations. postprin...|$|R
