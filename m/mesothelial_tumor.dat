40|$|Introduction: We {{describe}} a rare tumor {{arising from the}} prostate gland: Perivascular Epithelioid Cells tumor (PEC-ome). A 54 -years old was treated for acute urinary retention with alpha-blockers at presentation due to benign prostate enlargement (65 cc) with asymmetric middle lobe and regular PSA (0. 92 ng/ml). After 5 months, patient developed a second acute urinary retention episode and nodules in the left lung; he was treated with transurethral resection of the prostate and left lobectomy. Results: Histological examination of prostate and lung tissue gave the same diagnosis: leiomyosarcoma with atypical morphological features and patient was observed for 4 months. Considering the uncommon diagnosis, pathological review by the uro-pathologist at our Hospital was done. Additional immunohistochemistry was done and both tumors showed similar and typical features of metastatic PEC-ome (T 1 b N 0 M 1). Therefore a new staging showed local and distant progression with prostatic mass and small lung metastasis. Three cycles of Gemcitabine and Pazopanib were administered, but 2 months later a new urinary retention occurred, despite chemotherapy. Patient referred to our Hospital for salvage pelvic surgery with lymph node dissection. Final pathological diagnosis was PECome of the prostate stage pT 4 pN 0 R 0 M 1. Conclusions: PEC-ome is a rare but rapidly invasive <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumor</b> with early metastatic potential. When this tumors originates from the fibromuscular stroma of the prostate it mimics benign prostatic enlargement and causes LUTS. Expert pathology aided by immunoisthochemistry {{is the cornerstone of}} diagnosis. There are no pathognomonic imaging on ultrasound or symptoms suggesting the presence of PECome in early stage. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary and radical surgery should be done to treat this aggressive cancer...|$|E
40|$|Malignant {{mesothelioma}} (MM) of the pleura is {{a highly}} aggressive neoplasm whose incidence is increasing due to asbestos exposure. The capacity of asbestos to induce MM {{has been linked to}} its ability to cause the release of TNF-α that promotes mesothelial cells survival via NF-kB pathway leading to transcription of multiple pro-survival genes that promote tumor development. To date, there is no standard curative therapy for MM that is largely unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. As a consequence, more effective therapeutic strategies are needed for this fatal disease with the aim to identify new candidates for targeted therapies. Increasing evidence demonstrates that adenosine affects numerous pathophysiological processes including the regulation of cell death and proliferation. Adenosine interacts with four G-proteins coupled receptors named as A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B and A 3 adenosine receptors (ARs). A 1 and A 3 ARs inhibit adenylate cyclase activity and decrease cAMP production whilst A 2 A and A 2 BARs exert an increase of cAMP accumulation. It has been accepted that A 3 ARs are highly expressed in tumor cells showing a pivotal {{role in the development of}} cancer. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the presence of adenosine receptors (ARs) in human MM pleura (MMP) and healthy mesothelial pleura (HMP). To shed some light on the interaction between adenosine and MM, the presence and the functionality of ARs were explored in human healthy mesothelial cells (HMC) and in malignant mesothelioma cells (MMC). ARs were analyzed by using RT-PCR, Western blotting and saturation binding assays. HMC were treated with crocidolite asbestos which is the principal risk factor of MM. The role of A 3 ARs on these cellular models, evaluating cAMP production, Akt phosphorylation and NF-kB activation was investigated. The dual effect of A 3 AR stimulation on healthy and cancer cell growth was studied by means of proliferation, apoptosis and cytotoxicity assays. In conclusion, this is the first study reporting the up-regulation of A 3 AR in pleura from MM patients when compared with healthy pleura. A 3 AR mRNA and protein expression was significantly increased in MMC and in asbestos-treated HMC respect to untreated HMC. Furthermore, the A 3 AR agonist Cl-IB-MECA decreases proliferation and exerts cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effect on HMC exposed to asbestos and TNF-α and on tumoral MMC, but not in control HMC. These effects appear to be related to the de-regulation of the Akt/NF-kB cell survival pathways contributing to the processes that lead to the malignant transformation of asbestos-exposed mesothelial cells. Taken together, these new findings suggest that A 3 AR could represent a possible target for pharmacological intervention to prevent <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumor</b> development after asbestos exposure and to treat full blown MM...|$|E

40|$|An {{immunoperoxidase}} technique employing antibody to prekeratin {{was used}} to study distribution and pattern of staining of prekeratin filaments in cytological smears obtained from 42 specimens of pleural and peritoneal effusions (27 benign, 15 malignant).

Both benign and malignant mesothelial cells showed distinctive peripheral or perinuclear staining patterns which differed from the characteristic arborizing pattern in adenocarcinoma cells. The ultrastructure of these 2 cell types studied in 27 body fluids (12 benign, 15 malignant) and in 13 malignant tumors (3 mesotheliomas, 10 adenocarcinomas) showed a distinctive localizaton of intermediate filaments which corresponded to and could explain the pattern of staining obtained using the immunoperoxidase technique.

40|$|In {{the course}} of studies to {{elucidate}} the relative contribution of simian virus 40 (SV 40) large T and small t proteins during oncogenesis, we observed the appearance of pericardial and pleural tumors in 100 % of Syrian hamsters injected in the pleural space with wild type SV 40. When SV 40 was injected via the intracardiac or intraperitoneal routes, more than 50 % of hamsters developed <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumors.</b> Macroscopic, microscopic, ultramicroscopic, and histochemical characteristics identify these neoplasms and derived cell lines as mesotheliomas and mesothelioma-derived cell lines.

40|$|Information {{developed}} by Newhouse {{in a survey}} of an asbestos factory in London suggests that the risk of <b>mesothelial</b> <b>tumors</b> is strongly related to both the degree and the length of exposure to asbestos dust. The present paper presents extracts from the paper of Newhouse (1) and offers some commentary. Studies have been made of an East London asbestos factory (2, 3). This factory, a heavy user of crocidolite asbestos, as well as of amosite and chrysotile, kept a unique file of all employees. These records gave both personal details and details of jobs while employed. A cohort of male workers who started work at the factory any time between the implementation of the Asbestos Regulations of 1931 in April 1933 and the closure of the factory in 1968, and a smaller cohort of women who were first employed between 1936 and 1942, were established. The war-time period was chosen for the women because regulations during the war simplified the difficult task of establishing whether women who had changed their name on marriage were alive or dead. The mortality experienced by the workers was assessed by comparing the number of observed deaths with the number of deaths that would be expected in a similar population of England and Wales using the man-years method of Case and Lea (4). Degree of dust exposure was categorized either as low-moderate (nonproduction workers and those working with low proportions of asbesto...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{development}} of peritoneal metastases {{is a significant}} clinical issue {{in the treatment of}} abdominal cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. We have previously shown that ICAM- 1 -CD 43 interaction plays a significant role in tumor adhesion. However, an invasive phenotype is critical to establish tumor progression via cell associated and secreted proteases including matrix metalloproteinases. High metalloproteinases level significantly enhanced metastasis phenotype on tumors, a detrimental effect on surgical outcome. We investigated the role of direct and indirect signaling between the mesothelium and the tumor cells in enhancing tumor invasion and possible therapeutic intervention. Methods: Mesothelial cells were enzymatically derived from human omental tissue and implanted in 24 wells plates. Colorectal cancer cells were then introduced and allowed a direct and an indirect contact with the mesothelial layer. Anti-ICAM antibodies, anti-CD 43 antibodies, and heparin were used to block MMP production. Gelatin zymography was performed on the supernatant to detect MMPs activity. Results: MMP production was observed in <b>mesothelial</b> and <b>tumor</b> cells. Direct contact between cell types enhanced MMP 9 and 2 (p < 0. 05). Indirect contact also stimulate MMPs but at a lower degree. ICAM- 1 blocking antibodies attenuated MMP production in direct contact to that observed in the indirect. Heparin introduction achieved a similar outcome. Conclusions: ICAM- 1 -CD 43 interaction plays a vital role in tumor cells-peritoneum adhesion and invasion, which is manifested by the increased production of MMPs leading to tumor invasion and peritoneal loco-regional. Blocking this interaction with heparin can provide a new therapeutic option...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Malignant {{mesothelioma}} {{is a rare}} neoplasm of mesothelial cells arising {{most frequently}} in the pleura or peritoneum and less frequently in the liver. Case presentation: We present a case of primary hepatic mesothelioma of 41  year old woman. She had no history of asbestos exposure or cancer. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed 21  cm intrahepatic mass in the right lobe with many cystic lesions and few small calcifications. Pathology showed a biphasic cellular pattern. In addition, the tumor cells were positive for Calretinin, Creatine Kinase (CK) 5 / 6, CK 7, CKAEI 1 / 3, Wilms Tumor protein (WT- 1), and Vimentin, but were negative for Alpha Feto protein (AFP), Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP- 1), Anti-Hepatocyte Specific Antigen (HSA), Synaptophysin, CK 20, and Homeobox protein (CDx- 2).

40|$|Malignant {{mesothelioma}} (MM) is a fatal {{disease in}} dire need of therapy. The role of inflammasomes in cancer is not very well studied, however, literature supports both pro-and anti-tumorigenic effects of inflammasomes on cancer depending upon the type of cancer. Asbestos is a causative agent for MM and we have shown before that it causes inflammasome priming and activation in <b>mesothelial</b> cells. MM <b>tumor</b> cells/tissues showed decreased levels of inflammasome components like NLRP 3 and caspase- 1 as compared to human mesothelial cells or normal tissue counterpart of tumor. Based on our preliminary findings we hypothesized that treatment of MMs with chemotherapeutic drugs may elevate the levels of NLRP 3 and caspase- 1 resulting in increased cell death by pyroptosis while increasing the levels of IL- 1 β and other pro-inflammatory molecules. Therefore, a combined strategy of chemotherapeutic drug and IL- 1 R antagonist may play a beneficial role in MM therapy. To test our hypothesis we used two human MM tumor cell lines (Hmeso, H 2373) and two chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin, cisplatin). Through a series of experiments we showed that both chemotherapeutic drugs caused increases in NLRP 3 levels, caspase- 1 activation, pyroptosis and pro-inflammatory molecules released from MM cells. In vivo studies using SCID mice and Hmeso cells showed that tumors were smaller in combined treatment group of cisplatin and IL- 1 R antagonist (Anakinra) as compared to cisplatin alone or untreated control groups. Taken together our study suggests that chemotherapeutic drugs in combination with IL- 1 R antagonist may have a beneficial role in MM treatment...|$|R
40|$|Malignant {{mesothelioma}} (MM) {{is a rare}} tumor {{associated with}} occupational exposure to asbestos with no effective treatment regime. Evaluation of mitochondrial function in human MM cell lines revealed a common tumor phenotype: in comparison to immortalized or primary human <b>mesothelial</b> cells, MM <b>tumor</b> cells displayed a more oxidized mitochondrial environment, increased expression of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes, and altered mitochondrial metabolism. Earlier work by our laboratory indicated that increases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) in MM cell lines supports expression of FOXM 1, an oncogenic transcription factor that contributes to increased cell proliferation and chemoresistance. These studies sought to investigate targeting of mitochondrial structure and function as a therapeutic avenue in MM. MM cells have reduced mitochondrial reserve capacity, a redox vulnerability exploitable by pro-oxidant therapeutics. Targeting of the mitochondrial peroxidase peroxiredoxin 3 (PRX 3) with the anti-cancer compound thiostrepton (TS) induces irreversible modifications to PRX 3 protein, increased mROS, and selective MM cell death. Mass spectrometry showed TS targets conserved cysteine residues in PRX 3. In vitro and in MM cells, TS failed to modify human PRX 3 harboring mutations to Cys 108, Cys 127 or Cys 229. Pre-incubation of MM cells with dimedone blocked cysteine adduction of PRX 3 by TS, suggesting adduction requires an active PRX 3 catalytic cycle. Studies with immortalized and primary human mesothelial cells showed adduction of PRX 3 by TS occurred {{at a much lower}} rate in normal cells than MM cells, and this difference correlated with markedly decreased cytotoxicity. Moreover, MM cells transduced with shRNA to PRX 3 grew more slowly and were less sensitive to TS than their wild type counterparts, indicating PRX 3 is a major target of TS in MM cells. Studies with a xenoplant mouse model of MM showed TS alone or in combination with the TRX 2 inhibitor gentian violet significantly reduced tumor volume. Tumor cell mitochondria have an increased mitochondrial membrane potential, therefore numerous drugs have been developed that selectively accumulatte into energized mitochondria to enhance drug efficacy and specificity. Here two mitochondrial-targeted nitroxides, Mito-carboxy-proxyl (MCP) and Mito-TEMPOL (MT), were investigated for their anti-cancer effects. Treatment of MM cells with MCP or MT led to rapid disruption of the mitochondrial reticulum, increased oxidant levels, and reduced FOXM 1 and PRX 3 protein expression. Immunostaining revealed a pool of cytoplasmic FOXM 1 associated with PRX 3 in mitochondria, suggesting PRX 3 participates in regulating FOXM 1 expression. Combination of MCP or MT with TS led to synergistic effects on MM cell viability. Upregulation of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes is an adaptive response that ameliorates mitochondrial oxidative stress and supports tumor cell survival. Studies here indicate that enhanced dependency on the PRX 3 catalytic cycle in tumor cells promotes inactivation of PRX 3 by TS, providing a therapeutic window dependent on a mitochondrial phenotype common to many human tumor types. Therefore TS, alone or in combination with other agents, may prove useful in the management of intractable tumors such as MM...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Malignant {{mesothelioma}} (MM) {{is a rare}} tumor of the serosal membranes with a poor prognosis. Studies predict {{an increasing}} incidence of this tumor in the next decade. An early and precise diagnosis of MMs in effusions is crucial for patient management and may avoid unnecessary invasive procedures. However, this diagnosis {{represents one of the}} classic diagnostic challenges of cytopathology in serous effusions. It may be overcome by the application of adjuvant methods. The current study investigated the usefulness of cytology, DNA-image cytometry (DNA-ICM), immunocytochemistry, AgNOR-analysis, and chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the diagnosis of MM and of metastatic carcinoma in serous effusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 33 effusions received between March 2005 and May 2007 were cytologically diagnosed as suspicious or positive for MM cells using DNA-ICM, immunocytochemistry and AgNOR-analysis as adjuvant methods. We further investigated the detection of 9 p 21 deletions by chromosomal FISH. To test the utility of adjuvant methods to identify and type tumor cells in serous effusions, we investigated additionally 31 cases of metastatic carcinomas and 39 of tumor cell-negative effusions containing reactive mesothelial cells only, applying DNA-ICM, immunocytochemistry, AgNOR-analysis and chromosomal FISH. All diagnoses were confirmed by histologic and/or clinical follow up. RESULTS: Using DNA-ICM, aneuploidy was found in 71 % of MMs, 100 % of metastatic carcinomas and in none of tumor cell-negative effusions. 61. 3 % of MMs showed their greatest DNA stemline within the range of 1. 8 c and 2. 2 c and/or 3. 6 c and 4. 4 c, while only 19. 4 % of metastatic carcinomas showed their greatest stemline in this region. The immunocytochemical marker Calretinin was positive in 100 % of MMs, none of metastatic carcinomas and 94. 9 % of reactive <b>mesothelial</b> cells in <b>tumor</b> cell-negative effusions. BerEP 4 showed positivity in 15. 6 % of MMs, 87. 1 % of metastatic carcinomas and none of tumor cell-negative effusions. Using AgNOR-analysis, 89. 3 % of MMs, and 96. 7 % of metastatic carcinoma showed >= 2. 5 AgNOR dots as satellites and >= 4. 5 as total AgNOR counts. Only one case of tumor cell-negative effusion revealed an increased number of AgNOR dots. 9 p 21 homo- and heterozygous deletions were demonstrated in 54. 5 % and 42. 4 % of MM cases, respectively. This represents 90. 9 % of 9 p 21 deletion, when both criteria are applied. In metastatic carcinomas, the 9 p 21 homozygous deletion was found in 19. 4 % and in 32. 3 % a 9 p 21 heterozygous deletion. None of the tumor cell-negative effusions demonstrated 9 p 21 deletions. When cytology alone was used for the diagnosis, 81. 8 % of MM cases were identified with certainty as tumor cell positive, confirmed by histologic and/or clinical follow-up. The addition of DNA-ICM improved the prevalence of tumor cell detection to 87. 9 % and the addition of AgNOR-analysis to 97 %. The further introduction of FISH as an adjuvant method could improve the prevalence of tumor cell-detection to 100 % if 9 p 21 homo- and heterozygous deletion were used as diagnostic parameters. To differentiate metastatic carcinoma from MM or reactive mesothelial cells, calretinin positivity was found in all cases of MM and in none of metastatic carcinoma; BerEP 4 positivity was found in 15. 6 % of MM, 87. 1 % of metastatic carcinoma and none of tumor cell- negative effusions. The combination of calretinin positivity and BerEP 4 negativity was found in 84. 4 % of MM cases. CONCLUSION: We have shown that many cases in which cytology on serous effusions is suspicious or doubtful can definitely be solved by one of these adjuvant methods or by their combination and that these may be performed on existing routine cytological smears. The diagnostic methods used in the current study bear individual intrinsic advantages and disadvantages in terms of specificity and sensitivity, laborious effort, and cost effectiveness. Based on our results, we suggest first the parallel application of DNA-ICM, immunocytochemistry, and AgNOR-analysis as adjuvant methods to solve difficult cases of diagnostic cytology in serous effusion. Persistent doubtful diagnoses could be overcome by the application of FISH to analyze the 9 p 21 deletion. Further studies on larger series of patients are needed to evaluate the validity and efficiency of this approach to improve the diagnostic accuracy of effusion cytology...|$|R
