50|$|The {{second factor}} {{explaining}} the non-intuitive {{break in the}} expected results of greater explosive yield producing greater city fire damage is that city fire damage is largely dependent not on the yield of the weapons used, but on the conditions {{in and around the}} city itself, with the fuel loading per square meter value of the city being one of the major factors. A few hundred strategically placed incendiary devices would be sufficient to start a firestorm in a city if the conditions for a firestorm, namely high fuel loading, are already inherent to the city (see Bat bomb). The Great Fire of London in 1666, although not forming a firestorm due to the single point of ignition, serves as an example that, given a densely packed and predominately wooden and thatch building construction in the urban area, a <b>mass</b> <b>fire</b> is conceivable from the mere incendiary power of no more than a domestic fireplace. On the other hand, the largest nuclear weapon conceivable will be incapable of igniting a city into a firestorm if the city's properties, namely its fuel density, are not conducive to one developing.|$|E

5000|$|Just {{west of the}} ABLA's was a small {{neighborhood}} affectionately {{known as}} [...] "'cross Ashland," [...] named for the southern twang where many residents of the downtown and the projects pronounced its location. Bordered by Ashland Ave. to the east, Western Ave. on the west, the 15th Pl. train tracks {{to the south and}} Roosevelt Rd. on the north. This area originally went as far north as Polk, pre-dating the Medical district. Many blacks and Jews lived in the area through much of the 20th century until the late sixties when most Jews, Poles, and Italians moved away. Cross Ashland also extended east all the way to Halsted. Before the ABLA homes were constructed many Blacks worked at the various rail yard companies at 15th St. before the companies all moved to foreign lands and the suburbs. They were proud to leave the oppressive south and work arduous hours to feed families and attend barbecues. In 2005 this community of roughly 10,000 in the fifties and 5,000 in the nineties was eventually brought to an end in a <b>mass</b> <b>fire</b> sale to land developers. Today the Cross Ashland area remains underdeveloped save for the new FBI building and University Police Station.|$|E
50|$|A {{firestorm}} {{is characterized}} by strong to gale-force winds blowing toward the fire, everywhere around the fire perimeter, an effect which {{is caused by the}} buoyancy of the rising column of hot gases over the intense <b>mass</b> <b>fire,</b> drawing in cool air from the periphery. These winds from the perimeter blow the fire brands into the burning area and tend to cool the unignited fuel outside the fire area so that ignition of material outside the periphery by radiated heat and fire embers is more difficult, thus limiting fire spread. At Hiroshima, this inrushing to feed the fire is said to have prevented the firestorm perimeter from expanding, and thus the firestorm was confined to the area of the city damaged by the blast.Large wildfire conflagrations are distinct from firestorms if they have moving fire fronts which are driven by the ambient wind and do not develop their own wind system like true firestorms. (This does not mean that a firestorm must be stationary; as with any other convective storm, the circulation may follow surrounding pressure gradients and winds, if those lead it onto fresh fuel sources.) Furthermore, non-firestorm conflagrations can develop from a single ignition, whereas firestorms have only been observed where large numbers of fires are burning simultaneously over a relatively large area, with the important caveat that the density of simultaneously burning fires needs to be above a critical threshold for a firestorm to form (a notable example of large numbers of fires burning simultaneously over a large area without a firestorm developing was the Kuwaiti oil fires of 1991, where the distance between individual fires was too large).|$|E
5000|$|The Posleen {{are broken}} up into two {{distinct}} elements, the 'Normals' and the 'God Kings'. While these share similar physical characteristics (resistance to {{biological and chemical}} weapons, highly efficient metabolisms, armored body structures etc.), the 'God Kings' are also blessed with enhanced intelligence that makes them the leaders of their less intelligent brethren, {{as well as a}} crest on their necks that expands like certain lizards. In battle, God Kings ride on personal fighting vehicles called Tenar, which are not only heavily armed (usually with plasma cannons and hypervelocity missiles) but also contain communications equipment, a sensor array and tactical displays. The quality of Tenar and their systems varies due to personal preference on the part of their owners and on their owner's wealth. Tenar resemble flying saucers and use anti-grav technology to fly; they can not only hover close to the ground but fly at significant altitudes. A tenar can sense and track isolated weapons fire and respond automatically making it very dangerous to snipe a God King; however, once a certain amount of weapons fire is present in the environment, the [...] "noise" [...] keeps the tenar from being able to keep track and can no longer identify specific threats. However, even in this case, tenar have anti-air capabilities that make conventional aircraft useless. Flying anything from a helicopter to an F-22 in the line of sight of a Tenar is suicide and hugging the ground just leaves an aircraft open to <b>mass</b> <b>fire</b> from the normals. Tenar are durable but contain very volatile energy cores, which explode quite powerfully when pierced, usually killing many nearby normals and potentially other tenar as well. In addition to his Tenar, many God Kings carry swords with mono-molecular blades. A God King will lead a [...] "fief" [...] of several hundred normals whom he essentially owns, he is also responsible for outfitting them at his own expense. God Kings get their starts by working for a higher ranking God King who will set them up with a simple tenar and a small and barely equipped fief in return for subservience. In the novel Yellow Eyes, it is shown that they lack skill in dealing with certain unreasonable Terran problems (i.e. soldier ant swarms and other deep jungle hazards).|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that an outbreak of mass fires would introduce serious additional life hazard factors which may require extensive modifications or overhaul of our existing concepts of shelter design, construction and management.

40|$|Abstract—Assassination of politicians, school mass murders, purported suicides, {{aircraft}} crash, mass shootings by police, {{sinking of}} sea ferries, mysterious car accidents, <b>mass</b> <b>fire</b> deaths and horrific-terror attacks {{are some of}} the cases that bring forth scientific and legal conflicts. Questions about truth, justice and human rights are raised by both victims and perpetrators/offenders as they seek to understand why and how it happened to them. This kind of questioning manifests itself in medical-criminological-legal-psychological and scientific realms. An agreement towards truth-investigations for possible legal-political-psychological transitory issues such as prosecution, victim-offender mediation, healing, reconciliation, amnesty, reparation, restitution, and policy formulations is seen as one way of transforming these conflicts. Forensic scientists and pathologists in particular have formed professional groups where the complexities between legal truth and scientific truth are dramatized and elucidated within the anatomy of courtrooms. This paper focuses on how pathological truth and legal truth interact with each other in Kenya’s criminal justice system.

40|$|ABSTRACT Fire is an abiotic {{disturbance}} {{that regulates}} vegetation structure and biodiversity. Some plant species {{have adapted to}} fire prone environments by evolving protective structures. Acrocomia aculeata (macaw palm) is widely distributed throughout tropical America, and is found in environments continuously influenced by anthropogenic fire. We aimed {{to determine whether the}} fruit characteristics of A. aculeata enable seeds to resist the effects of fire and also the consequent effects of fire on fruit biometric traits and embryo viability. After a fire event in a region of pasture-forest transition, we marked 30 individuals of A. aculeata. The trees were separated by UPGMA analysis into 5 groups according to fire exposure, ranging from trees with no exposure to trees with fruit completely exposed to fire. Fruit exposure to high temperatures led to lower values in fruit fresh weight, length, density, and processable <b>mass.</b> <b>Fire</b> had no significant effect on seed biometric variables, because of the structures of the fruit, including its lignified endocarp and its insulating and mucilaginous mesocarp. These structures helped to maintain the embryos viability by preventing oxidative damage. In conclusion, the fruit structure of the macaw palm may facilitate seed persistence, even when subject to increasingly frequent fire events...|$|E
30|$|Managers {{faced with}} {{grassland}} and woodland restoration in long-unburned ecosystems are challenged in using prescribed fire alone as a management tool (Peterson and Reich 2001). In the Bald Hills, fire weather prescriptions often ensure lower-intensity burns {{that result in}} little mortality of Douglas-fir taller than 3 m (Sugihara and Reed 1987), requiring mechanical removal of larger trees. Research by Tveten and Fonda (1999) and Regan and Agee (2004) suggest that prescribed fires result in little mortality of overstory Oregon white oaks as well. Therefore, if managers desire to restore Douglas-fir invaded stands similar to those studied here (e.g., dominant Douglas-fir in the oak canopy) or to reduce oak densities, thinning or similar silvicultural treatments {{may be required to}} remove fire-resistant individuals. Thinning would expose the forest floor to sunlight, promoting lower afternoon fuel moistures and the eventual establishment of an herbaceous fuelbed (Devine et al. 2007), although it is unclear how long the residual effects of the Douglas-fir overstory (i.e., organic forest floor fuels) will persist. Where prescribed fires are used to maintain oak woodlands and grasslands from invading Douglas-fir saplings, fireline intensities need to be elevated, particularly in areas with greater overstory basal area and lower herbaceous <b>mass.</b> <b>Fire</b> effects could be manipulated by altering firing patterns, changing season of burn, and conducting burns under more favorable fire weather scenarios (e.g., lower relative humidity, higher wind). Overstory structure must be considered in burn prescriptions, however, as results reveal that single prescriptions generate differential behavior across the diverse community structures.|$|E
