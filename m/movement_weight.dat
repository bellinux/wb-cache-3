50|$|Apart {{from his}} work in architecture, Tssui has pursued {{assorted}} other areas of interest. His efforts in design extend out to clothing and furniture, and often reflect similar concerns about <b>movement,</b> <b>weight,</b> and sustainability as appear in his architectural designs. He also pursued a number of athletic endeavors. The most notable titles to his name include the super middleweight boxing title in the 2005 Ringside World Championships, the world's largest amateur boxing tournament, and the Presidential Sports Award, both of which he won eight times. He is also a four-time Senior Olympics Gymnastics All-Around Champion.|$|E
50|$|As {{the body}} {{gradually}} descends, the hips and knees undergo flexion, the ankle extends ("dorsiflexes") and muscles around the joint contract eccentrically, reaching maximal contraction {{at the bottom}} of the movement while slowing and reversing descent. The muscles around the hips provide the power out of the bottom. If the knees slide forward or cave in then tension is taken from the hamstrings, hindering power on the ascent. Returning to vertical contracts the muscles concentrically, and the hips and knees undergo extension while the ankle plantarflexes. In a weight bearing squat, the heels should always maintain contact with the floor throughout the <b>movement.</b> <b>Weight</b> shifting forward on to the toes, and off the heels creates unnecessary stress on the knee joint. This added stress may lead to inflammation or other overuse injuries.|$|E

50|$|Thigh weights are {{not ideal}} for {{movements}} involving quadriceps use, as they require tightness which may limit {{the use of}} the muscle and blood flow to the legs. For such <b>movements,</b> <b>weights</b> worn higher on the body or free weights are more ideal.|$|R
25|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC), {{also known}} as bowel cancer and colon cancer, is the {{development}} of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). A cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread {{to other parts of the}} body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel <b>movements,</b> <b>weight</b> loss, and feeling tired all the time.|$|R

40|$|While {{physiotherapists}} {{are increasingly}} organizing video consultations, assessment of lower body movements over video remains a challenge. We present a wearable technology, SoPhy that captures and presents {{information related to}} three key aspects of lower limb movements - range of foot <b>movement,</b> <b>weight</b> distribution and foot orientation. SoPhy consists {{of a pair of}} socks embedded with sensors for the patients to wear, and a web-interface that displays the captured information to physiotherapists in real-time. The objective of this demonstration is to offer first-hand experience of SoPhy and to create conversations around designing technologies for supporting bodily communication in video consultations...|$|E
40|$|The {{deployment}} of vehicle airbags for maximum protection requires {{information about the}} occupant’s position, <b>movement,</b> <b>weight,</b> size etc. Specifically it is desirable to discriminate between adults, children, front- or rear faced child seats, objects put on the seat or simply empty seats. 2 D images lack depth information about the object and {{are very sensitive to}} illumination conditions. Herein, occupant position classification techniques are developed based on low resolution 3 D image sequences. The proposed methods are of low complexity and high reliability allowing real time implementation and meeting the rigorous requirements for passenger safety systems. Features are extracted from the 3 D image sequences and a Sequential Forward Search (SFS) feature subset selection algorithm is employed {{to reduce the size of}} the feature set. Two classification techniques are evaluated, the Bayes quadratic classifier and the polynomial classifier. We present the classification results based on a large set of measurements from the low resolution 3 D image sequences. The full scale tests have been conducted on a wide range of realistic situations (adults/children/child seats etc.) which may occur in a vehicle. 1...|$|E
40|$|People can {{be shown}} to use memorized {{location}} information to move their hand to a target location if no visual information is available. However, for several reasons, memorized information may be imprecise and inaccurate. Here, we study whether {{and to what extent}} humans use the remembered location of an object to plan reaching movements when the target is visible. Subjects sequentially picked up and moved two different virtual, magnetic target objects from a target region into a virtual trash bin with their index fingers. In one third of the trials, we perturbed the position of the second target by 1 cm while the finger was transporting the first target to the trash. Subjects never noticed this. Although the second target was visible in the periphery, subjects' movements were biased to its initial (remembered) position. The first part of subjects' movements was predictable from a weighted sum of the visible and remembered target positions. For high contrast targets, subjects initially weigh visual and remembered information about target position in an average ratio of 0. 67 to 0. 33. Over the course of the <b>movement,</b> <b>weight</b> given to memory decreased. Diminishing the contrast of the targets substantially increased the weight that subjects gave to the remembered location. Thus, even when peripheral visual information is available, humans use the remembered location of an object to plan goal-directed movements. In contrast to previous suggestions in the literature, our results indicate that absolute location is remembered quite well...|$|E

50|$|A typical {{pullover}} involves resting {{the upper}} {{back on a}} flat bench. The hips are kept slightly flexed. Keeping the hips off the bench is said to help in balancing the weight and stability during the <b>movement.</b> The <b>weight</b> is held above the chest with elbows slightly bent.|$|R
50|$|The push {{press is}} similar to the {{military}} press; however, the movement is started by a 'push' from the legs. This begins the momentum of the <b>movement,</b> the <b>weight</b> is then slowly lowered back to the chest. It can also be used from behind the neck, after a squat.|$|R
40|$|Sibling and parenteoffspring {{conflicts}} arise mainly {{over the}} amount and distribution of parental care, especially food. In altricial bird species where the young depend on parents for obtaining food, parents may control sibling competition by the choice of their respective provisioning locations. In great tits, the parents use fixed provisioning positions on the nest rim that are determined early in the breeding cycle and maintained until fledging. The two parents may choose positions that are close to each other, or far apart, and thereby increase or relax the pressure for optimal feeding positioning among nestlings. As an inspiration to this study we previously found that the two parents provide food from closer positions if the nest is infested by ectoparasites. Here, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} parental choice of relative provisioning locations could be strategically used to control nestling competition. We forced parents to feed from either one or two provisioning locations and assessed the induced change in nestling <b>movement,</b> <b>weight</b> gain, and food distribution among siblings. We show that the angular distance between male and female locations influences the level of behavioural competition and affects nestling weight gain and food distribution. It is the first evidence for hole-nesting birds, where it was assumed that the nestling closest to the entrance hole was fed first, that the apparent choice of feeding positions by parents could be a way of controlling sibling competition and thereby also taking partial control over the outcome of parenteoffspring conflict...|$|E

40|$|Ramazzini {{realised}} {{that it was}} {{not possible}} to ascribe the whole spectrum of workers’ diseases to chemicals or physical agents and he observed that a variety of common diseases (above all musculoskeletal disorders) could originate following the prolonged, violent and irregular movements and the prolonged unnatural postures of the worker’s body. He observed that the causes of these abnormalities were essentially due to the maintenance either of prolonged stationary postures or of unnatural postures and to activities that require heavy muscular performance. Although Ramazzini did not develop a detailed approach for the assessment of the factors associated with work related musculoskeletal disorders, he understood the relationship between posture, repetition of <b>movements,</b> <b>weight</b> lifting, muscular load and certain disorders, allowing him not only to describe the anatomical localization of the disorder, but also to identify intensity and duration of the risk factor...|$|R

5000|$|A typical flat {{consists}} of a nearly flat sole, and a minimal upper to hold it onto the foot. Frequently the thin insole is glued in place to reduce <b>movement</b> and <b>weight.</b> The sole is constructed of two materials: a engineered lightweight foam upper sole attached to a hard rubber base. The uppers are often mesh so that moisture can escape, even on crosscountry variants.|$|R

50|$|As {{bodyweight}} exercises use the individual's {{own weight}} {{to provide the}} resistance for the <b>movement,</b> the <b>weight</b> being lifted is never greater than the weight of one's own body. This can {{make it difficult to}} achieve a level of intensity that is near the individual's one rep maximum, which is desirable for strength training. Another disadvantage is that bodyweight training may be daunting to novices and seen to be too easy for experienced athletes. Women, in general, also find it more difficult to do bodyweight exercises involving upper body strength and may be discouraged from undertaking these exercises in their fitness regimes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} an {{extension}} {{to the learning}} rule of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) namely the Free Projection SOM (FP-SOM) is presented {{in order to enhance}} the SOM projection. The general idea of the FP-SOM is to mirror the <b>movement</b> of <b>weight</b> vectors during the training process allowing their images on the map grid to move more freely between the junctions. The result of the extended training algorithm allows intuitive analysis of the similarities inherent in the input data and most important, intuitive recognition of cluster boundaries. Experiments on artificial and real data sets show the advantages of the proposed extension as a cluster visualization method...|$|R
