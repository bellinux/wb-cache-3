50|$|The eastern {{marsh harrier}} (Circus spilonotus) is a {{bird of prey}} {{belonging}} to the marsh harrier group of harriers. It was previously considered to be conspecific with the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) but is now usually classified as a separate species. It has two subspecies: C. s. spilonotus in eastern Asia and C. <b>s.</b> spilothorax (Papuan <b>harrier,</b> perhaps a separate species) in New Guinea.|$|R

40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) Complex {{products}} and systems (CoPS), such as large defense equipment programs, are major capital goods in which customers {{play a central}} role from design through disposal (Davies & Hobday, 2005). A central idea of the research that this paper reports on is that the degree of complexity in CoPS may {{have a significant effect on}} the range of possible variance of their operations and support (O&S) costs. However, operational use and other factors also have an important part to play in the complexity of CoPS, which simple ''parts count'' approaches may miss. The research design presented is one of a pair of detailed case studies, based on the U. <b>S.</b> /UK <b>Harrier</b> combat aircraft. In this work paper, the intention is to explore how different approaches in the U. S. and UK to O&S on the Harrier aircraft have impacted some of the key drivers of costs. In addition, initial comparisons are made with more complex (in parts count terms) aircraft. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|R

5|$|In the 1970s the British Aerospace Sea Harrier was {{developed}} from the Harrier {{for use by the}} Royal Navy (RN) on <b>s.</b> The Sea <b>Harrier</b> and the Harrier fought in the 1982 Falklands War, in which the aircraft proved to be crucial and versatile. The RN Sea Harriers provided fixed-wing air defence while the RAF Harriers focused on ground-attack missions in support of the advancing British land force. The Harrier was also extensively redesigned as the AV-8B Harrier II and British Aerospace Harrier II by the team of McDonnell Douglas and British Aerospace. The innovative Harrier family and its Rolls-Royce Pegasus engines with thrust vectoring nozzles have generated long-term interest in V/STOL aircraft. Similar V/STOL operational aircraft include the contemporary Soviet Yakovlev Yak-38. The F-35B V/STOL variant of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is under development.|$|R
40|$|Silicon-based {{ceramics}} {{have been}} proposed as component materials for gas turbine engine hot-sections. When the Navy <b>s</b> <b>Harrier</b> fighter experienced engine (Pegasus F 402) failure because of leading-edge durability problems on the second-stage high-pressure turbine vane, the Office of Naval Research came to the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field for test support in evaluating a concept for eliminating the vane-edge degradation. The High Pressure Burner Rig (HPBR) was selected for testing since it could provide temperature, pressure, velocity, and combustion gas compositions that closely simulate the engine environment. The study focused on equipping the stationary metal airfoil (Pegasus F 402) with a ceramic matrix composite (CMC) leading-edge insert and evaluating the feasibility and benefits of such a configuration. The test exposed the component, with and without the CMC insert, to the harsh engine environment in an unloaded condition, with cooling to provide temperature relief to the metal blade underneath. The insert was made using an AlliedSignal Composites, Inc., enhanced HiNicalon (Nippon Carbon Co. LTD., Yokohama, Japan) fiber-reinforced silicon carbide composite (SiC/SiC CMC) material fabricated via chemical vapor infiltration. This insert was 45 -mils thick and occupied a recessed area in the leading edge and shroud of the vane. It {{was designed to be}} free floating with an end cap design. The HPBR tests provided a comparative evaluation of the temperature response and leading-edge durability and included cycling the airfoils between simulated idle, lift, and cruise flight conditions. In addition, the airfoils were aircooled, uniquely instrumented, and exposed to the exact set of internal and external conditions, which included gas temperatures in excess of 1370 C (2500 F). In addition to documenting the temperature response of the metal vane for comparison with the CMC, a demonstration of improved leading-edge durability was a primary goal. First, the metal vane was tested for a total of 150 cycles. Both the leading edge and trailing edge of the blade exhibited fatigue cracking and burn-through similar to the failures experienced in service by the F 402 engine. Next, an airfoil, fitted with the ceramic leading edge insert, was exposed for 200 cycles. The temperature response of those HPBR cycles indicated a reduced internal metal temperature, by as much as 600 F at the midspan location for the same surface temperature (2100 F). After testing, the composite insert appeared intact, with no signs of failure on either the vane s leading or trailing edge. Only a slight oxide scale, as would be expected, was noted on the insert. Overall, the CMC insert performed similarly to a thick thermal barrier coating. With a small air gap between the metal and the SiC/SiC leading edge, heat transfer from the CMC to the metal alloy was low, effectively lowering the temperatures. The insert's performance has proven that an uncooled CMC can be engineered and designed to withstand the thermal up-shock experienced during the severe lift conditions in the Pegasus engine. The design of the leading-edge insert, which minimized thermal stresses in the SiC/SiC CMC, showed that the CMC/metal assembly can be engineered to be a functioning component...|$|R
40|$|Xeric, mixed-grass landscapes are {{changing}} rapidly as native grasslands are converted to cropland. We surveyed birds to compare {{their use of}} grassland and cropland habitats and to evaluate whether their abundances were related to grassland fragment size. Surveys were conducted in western South Dakota at 146 sites that were stratified by habitat type, landscape composition and fragment size. The abundances of 13 of 14 species were 1. 2 - 140 times higher in grass- lands than in cropland. Greater prairie-chicken, sharp-tailed grouse, burrowing owl, Baird 2 Ì† 7 <b>s</b> sparrow, northern <b>harrier,</b> and short-eared owl never occurred in cropland. Abundances of grasshopper sparrow, western meadowlark and chestnut-collared longspur were higher in grassland {{than in any other}} habitat type. A positive relationship between grassland fragment size and grasshopper sparrow abundance indicates that it {{may not be enough to}} conserve small parcels of habitat even for the most common grassland species. The future of grassland bird populations will depend on grassland habitat conservation practices because most species are grass land specialists...|$|R
2500|$|In London, it {{provided}} for a cabinet-level Secretary of State for India and a fifteen-member Council of India, whose members were required, as one prerequisite of membership, {{to have spent}} at least ten years in India and to have done so {{no more than ten}} years before. Although the Secretary of State formulated the policy instructions to be communicated to India, he was required in most instances to consult the Council, but especially so in matters relating to spending of Indian revenues. The Act envisaged a system of [...] "double government" [...] in which the Council ideally served both as a check on excesses in imperial policy making and as a body of up-to-date expertise on India. However, the Secretary of State also had special emergency powers that allowed him to make unilateral decisions, and, in reality, the Council's expertise was sometimes outdated. From 1858 until 1947, twenty seven individuals served as Secretary of State for India and directed the India Office; these included: Sir Charles Wood (1859â€“1866), Marquess of Salisbury (1874â€“1878; later Prime Minister of Britain), John Morley (1905â€“1910; initiator of the Minto-Morley Reforms), E. <b>S.</b> <b>Montagu</b> (1917â€“1922; an architect of the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms), and Frederick Pethick-Lawrence (1945â€“1947; head of the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India). The size of the advisory Council was reduced over the next half-century, but its powers remained unchanged. In 1907, for the first time, two Indians were appointed to the Council. They were K.G. Gupta and Syed Hussain Bilgrami.|$|R
