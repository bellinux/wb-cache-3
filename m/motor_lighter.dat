40|$|During {{the past}} decades, superconducting {{electrical}} machines {{have become more}} suitable to replace conventional iron based designs, because of their lower weight and higher torque density. These properties make them good candidates for use in More Electric Aircraft (MEA). Especially helicopter propulsion systems could benefit from the increased performance. This paper describes the feasibility study of a superconducting motor {{to be used for}} helicopter propulsion as part of a More Electric Aircraft (MEA). For this, the armature, field windings and cryostat are designed, aiming at meeting the difficult specifications. Since superconductors have virtually no electrical resistance when cooled down below a certain critical temperature, they can be used to build high field and low weight coils for electrical machines. Especially the possibility to not use iron can make the superconducting <b>motor</b> <b>lighter</b> with a higher power density compared with conventional Permanent Magnet (PM) motors.

50|$|Joseph F. Barter's <b>Light</b> <b>Motors</b> Ltd. {{was one of}} Douglas's customers. Barter built a single-cylinder bicycle engine between 1902 and 1904; he then {{developed}} the Fée bicycle engine system. The Fée's 200 cc flat-twin engine was mounted in-line with the frame, using chain drive to a countershaft beneath (with clutch); this then used a drive belt to power the bicycle's rear wheel. Barter founded <b>Light</b> <b>Motors</b> Ltd. to build the Fée system. Production began in 1905; the Fée's name was anglicized to Fairy shortly afterward. In 1916 The Motor Cycle magazine claimed that the 1904 Fée was the earliest flat-twin motorcycle engine, of which there had since been many copies.

This paper describes a potential solar system using two stepper <b>motors,</b> <b>light</b> sensor and a concave mirror.
