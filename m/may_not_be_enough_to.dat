In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, there was only one remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E

25|$|When an {{inductive}} circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage {{across the open}} circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy may generate a spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid-state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> damage the switch but may still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package.|$|E
25|$|Any person born in India on {{or after}} 26 January 1950, but {{prior to the}} {{commencement}} of the 1986 Act on 1 July 1987, is a citizen of India by birth. A person born in India on or after 1 July 1987 is a citizen of India if either parent was a citizen of India {{at the time of}} the birth. Those born in India on or after 3 December 2004 are considered citizens of India only if both of their parents are citizens of India or if one parent is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant {{at the time of the}}ir birth. In September 2013, Bombay High Court gave a judgement that a birth certificate, passport or even an Aadhaar card alone <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> prove Indian citizenship, unless the parents are Indian citizens.|$|E
25|$|HTML5 is {{the latest}} version of Hypertext Markup Language specification. HTML defines how user agents, such as web browsers, are to present {{websites}} based upon their underlying code. This new web standard changes the way that users are affected by the internet and their privacy on the internet. HTML5 expands the number of methods given to a website to store information locally on a client as well as the amount of data that can be stored. As such, privacy risks are increased. For instance, merely erasing cookies <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> remove potential tracking methods since data could be mirrored in web storage, another means of keeping information in a user's web browser. There are so many sources of data storage that it is challenging for web browsers to present sensible privacy settings. As the power of web standards increases, so do potential misuses.|$|E

500|$|Mark Sutherland from Billboard {{gave the}} album a {{favourable}} review. He {{said that it}} offers [...] "string-drenched ballads, slick George Michael-style electronic dance-pop, Elvis Costello-esque clever wordplay and the slightly cheesy, supremely catchy MOR pop he made his name with." [...] Sutherland said that [...] "The end result <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> convince America it's missing out, but expect this album to bring the already-converted back onboard in droves." [...] Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ rating. Karger felt that, although the album [...] "contains fewer knockout potential hits than past efforts", it does feature [...] "the two strongest soul-flecked tracks of Williams' career", in [...] "You Know Me" [...] and [...] "Won't Do That", and that the singer [...] "simply sounds fantastic with a horn section".|$|E
500|$|It was renewed for a {{third season}} on March 6, 2010. As part of a {{reorganization}} of its 2010 midseason line up to capture more market for American Idol, the Fox network shifted Fringe to 9:00p.m. on Fridays. [...] This timeslot, commonly considered the [...] "Friday night death slot" [...] for several previous Fox shows due to cancellation shortly following the move to that slot, left critics considering the show's fate. [...] While The X-Files originally premiered during this slot and {{would continue to be}} a highly successful series, critics were unsure if Fringe could duplicate this performance. [...] In this slot, the show competed with Supernatural, a series that attracts similar types of viewers. Fox's Entertainment President Kevin Reilly, in response to these concerns, stated that 45% of Fringes viewership is from time shifting recording through digital video receivers, and does not expect the viewership numbers to change significantly with the change to Friday. Reilly further postulated that [...] "If it does anywhere near what it did on Thursdays, we can glue that show to the schedule because it can be a big win for us". Further promoted by the critical reaction to the rescheduling, the Fox network created a self-deprecating promotional advertisement acknowledging the reputation of the time slot, including quotes from other media outlets concerned about the move, but asserted that the move would [...] "re-animate" [...] the show. The network also created a music video, set to [...] "Echoes" [...] by the band Klaxons as a means of summarizing the third season to date prior to the first Friday broadcast. Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop on the show, cautioned that time-shifted viewership <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> save the show: [...] "It's not that not enough people are watching Fringe, it's that not enough people are watching Fringe during the hour that it's on the air, which is key for the network." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{there are}} more {{dangerous}} influences than ragtimes waiting for people brought up in ignorance of fine art. Nothing is more pitiably ridiculous than the wild worship of artists {{by those who have}} never been seasoned in youth to the enchantments of art. Tenors and prima donnas, pianists and violinists, actors and actresses enjoy powers of seduction which in the middle ages would have exposed them to the risk of being burnt for sorcery. But as they exercise this power by singing, playing, and acting, no great harm is done except perhaps to themselves. Far graver are the powers enjoyed by brilliant persons who are also connoisseurs in art. The influence they can exercise on young people who have been brought up in the darkness and wretchedness of a home without art, and in whom a natural bent towards art has always been baffled and snubbed, is incredible to those who have not witnessed and understood it. He (or she) who reveals the world of art to them opens heaven to them. They become satellites, disciples, worshippers of the apostle. Now the apostle may be a voluptuary without much conscience. Nature may have given him enough virtue to suffice in a reasonable environment. But this allowance <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> defend him against the temptation and demoralization of finding himself a little god on the strength of what ought to be a quite ordinary culture. He may find adorers in all directions in our uncultivated society among people of stronger character than himself, not one of whom, if they had been artistically educated, would have had anything to learn from him or regarded him as in any way extraordinary apart from his actual achievements as an artist. Tartuffe is not always a priest. Indeed he is not always a rascal: he is often a weak man absurdly credited with omniscience and perfection, and taking unfair advantages only because they are offered to him and he is too weak to refuse. Give everyone his culture, and no one will offer him more than his due.|$|E

50|$|Within this model, media {{messages}} {{may receive}} insufficient or limited processing for two basic reasons (i.e., cognitive overload). First, there <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> {{resources available to}} process the message fully (i.e., the required resources exceed the total resources). For example, a message on a topic that a person does <b>not</b> understand <b>may</b> require so many resources - perhaps trying to retrieve information from long-term memory - that, even though all resources may have been allocated to the task, the required resources for retrieval leave neither remaining nor available resources for attending to and encoding the message. Second, there may <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> resources available to process the message but those resources <b>are</b> <b>not</b> allocated to the task for reasons such as insufficient motivation or because the person is multitasking (e.g., resources required exceeds resources allocated).
