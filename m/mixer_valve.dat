With the help of an on–off controller and a PID controller (two step), the set point for the mass flow is achieved which considers the room temperature and the desired room temperature. The heating system works such that the room is 20  °C and during night a desired room temperature of 16  °C during 22 : 00 – 6 : 00 in the nights. There assumed to be four persons living {{in the house and the}} gains are such that there is at least one person in the house and the electrical gains are also taken into the account. In addition, {{with the help of}} a diverter and <b>mixer</b> <b>valve,</b> the temperature inlet to the space heating is varied and this is done in accordance to the ambient temperature. The gas boiler is controlled such that the auxiliary volume of the storage tank is kept at 50  °C in all cases except WSchVO 95 where it is to be maintained at 65  °C. Moreover, the radiators at WSchVO 95 building require a lot of power, and radiator is an older high temperature model, and hence the gas boiler is also sized such that this is satisfied. As mentioned in Table  1, the infiltration and ventilation systems were designed for each building. Along with that, the simulation of window opening during the summer months is achieved via increasing the infiltration when the ambient temperature goes above 26  °C. The self-shading and shading via overhangs are also taken into account in the simulation.|$|E
40|$|Relative {{humidity}} of air {{produced by}} simple compressors {{used to drive}} ventilators was measured at different working pressures. At normal working pressures, a relative humidity of 100 % was found and condensation occurred, mainly at the high pressure air/oxygen <b>mixer</b> <b>valve.</b> This resulted in blockages and loss of accuracy which could have serious consequences for patients. It was concluded that simple compressors are unsuitable and that medical air must be used. The Siemens Servo- 900 B ventilator is driven by gas derived from a high pressure air/oxygen mixer unit and requires a minimum operating pressure of 200 kPa. When medical air is not available, the ventilators are supplied with compressors which are of the reciprocating piston, oil-free type, without air drying facilities but fitted with cooling coils. Difficulties were encountered because of condensation and water collection in the mixer unit which affected the performance and reliability of the ventilator system. This particular problem has not been reported and prompted our investigation {{of the characteristics of}} air produced by simple compressors. METHODS A test circuit consisting of a compressor, a cooling coil, a water trap, 2 m of flexible tubing and a mixer unit was set up and the temperature of the air measured at various points (fig. 1). The relative humidity before the mixer was measured by dew point estimation and values derived for the other points indicated. Measurements of relative humidity were made for working pressures between 0 and 207 kPa. RESULTS The measured values of temperature and relative humidity for a working pressure of 150 kPa are shown in figure 1. The measured data of relativ...|$|E

Methods: The evaluation was undertaken {{from the perspective of}} the UK public sector, and conducted in conjunction with a randomised control trial of TMVs installed in social housing in Glasgow. Installation costs were borne by the social housing organisation, while support materials were provided by the UK NHS. Effectiveness was represented by the number of families with at-risk bath water temperatures pre- and post-installation, and the number of bath scalds avoided as a result of installation. Differences in the number of families with at-risk temperatures between groups were derived from the RCT. Cost-effectiveness was assessed and a series of one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Unit costs associated with installation were calculated to be 13. 68 pound, while costs associated with treating bath water scalds ranged from 25 pound 226 to 71 pound 902. The cost of an avoided bath water scald ranged from net savings to public purse of 1887 pound to 75 pound 520 and at baseline produced a net saving of 3 pound 229 008; that is, 1. 41 pound saved for every 1 pound spent.

This thesis presents {{the development of}} reversible microballoon pump, <b>mixer</b> and <b>valve</b> that enhance the control over the manipulation of liquids in bioanalytical assay on centrifugal microfluidic platforms. The high elasticity of the microballoon allows for an efficient conversion of centrifugally and externally induced forces to pumping, mixing and valving forces. The first liquid handling element presented in this thesis is a microballoon pump that relies on elastic energy stored in a latex membrane. It operates at low rotational speeds (< 1500 rpm) and pumps various liquid volumes towards {{the centre of the}} CD. The second presented liquid handling element is a microballoon mixer that operates by the expansion and relaxation of the membrane to provide for a consistent periodical 3 D reciprocating flow. The third presented microballoon liquid handling element is a reversible thermo-pneumatic valve (RTPV) that seals or reopens an inlet when a trapped air volume is heated or cooled, respectively. It employs the deflection of a latex membrane to control liquid flow and prevent evaporation of reagents over a wide range of spinning speeds (up to 6000 rpm) and temperatures (up to the operational temperature of the disk materials), respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Each {{year in the}} UK 2000 {{children}} attend emergency departments and 500 are admitted to hospital following a bath water scald. The long term effects can include disability, disfigurement or psychological harm and repeated skin grafts may be required as the child grows. The costs of treating a severe scald are estimated at 250, 000 GBP. Children living in the most deprived wards are at greatest risk of thermal injuries; hospital admission rates are three times that for children living in the least deprived wards. Domestic hot water, which is usually stored at around 60 degrees Celsius, {{can result in a}} second-degree burn after 3 seconds and a third-degree burn after 5 seconds. Educational strategies to encourage testing of tap water temperature and reduction of hot water thermostat settings have largely proved unsuccessful. Legislation in the USA mandating pre-setting hot water heater thermostats at 49 degrees Celsius was effective in reducing scald injuries, suggesting passive measures may have a greater impact. Thermostatic <b>mixer</b> <b>valves</b> (TMVs), recently developed for the domestic market, fitted across the hot and cold water supply pipes of the bath, allow delivery of water set at a fixed temperature from the hot bath tap. These valves therefore offer the potential to reduce scald injuries. Design/Methods A pragmatic, randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of TMVs in reducing bath hot tap water temperatures in the homes of families with young children in rented social housing. Two parallel arms include an intervention group and a control group where the intervention will be deferred. The intervention will consist of fitting a TMV (set at 44 degrees Celsius) by a qualified plumber and provision of educational materials. The control arm will not receive a TMV or the educational materials for the study duration but will be offered the intervention after collection of follow-up data 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome measure will be the bath hot tap water temperature. Fifteen families per arm are required to detect a reduction in the mean bath hot tap water temperature from 60. 4 degrees Celsius (SD 9. 1) in the control group to 46 degrees Celsius in the intervention group, with 90 % power and a 5 % significance level (2 sided). Secondary outcome measures including acceptability will require a sample size of 120 participants.

The 10, 000 BPD is split evenly between two types of crude: heavy and light. The heavy crude has the following inlet conditions: it will produce 1, 000 BPD of water, has an American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity of 16 degrees, a gas/oil ratio (GOR) of 150, a delivery temperature range of 20 - 30 degrees Celsius, a delivery pressure range of 250 to 450 psia, 13 % H 2 S in the gas phase, and a high salt content. The light crude has the following inlet conditions: it will produce 1, 000 BPD of water, has an API gravity of 37 degrees, a GOR of 600, a delivery temperature range of 18 to 40 degrees Celsius, a delivery pressure range of 250 to 700 psia, 23 % H 2 S in the gas phase, and a high salt content. Despite the differing inlet conditions, the product sales specifications are the same: a basic sediment and water (BS&W) content of less than 0. 5 weight percent, a relative vapor pressure (RVP) of less than 10 psia, an H 2 S concentration of less than 20 ppm, a salt concentration of less than 10 pounds per barrel (PTB), and an overall sulfur concentration of less than 2 weight percent. In order to achieve these specifications, the Team designed two processes that run in parallel, meaning that the light and heavy crudes remain separate. Within the process, the crude encounters a phase separator to extract the free flowing water and natural gas that enters from the well, two electrostatic coalescers (ECs) in series to remove emulsified water and salts, and a stripping tower to absorb hydrogen sulfide into nitrogen gas. Between these major pieces of equipment, additional features like heaters, <b>mixers,</b> <b>valves,</b> and flares are used to reduce the viscosity of the oil, mix in freshwater, control pressure drops, and burn excess gases, respectively. Wastewater is piped off site to a wastewater treatment facility and then returns to the facility as process water.

'Smart' or controllable composite materials have been obtained by doping polymers, foams, fabrics etc. with these field-responsive fluids. The resulting composite materials have potential applications in numerous fields ranging from adaptive energy absorption, automotive crash protection to microfluidic <b>valves,</b> <b>mixers</b> and separation devices. A series of stable magnetorheological (MR) fluids have been systematically characterized under steady shearing, creep and large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) flow conditions. A rheometer fixture for applying nearly uniform magnetic fields up to 0. 4 T has been fabricated to measure both steady-state and transient changes in the fluid properties under applied fields. Stable MR fluids with a markedly improved dynamic response (yield stress {{as a function of}} magnetic field) compared to commercial fluids have been formulated by increasing the constituent particle size and by stabilizing the system against sedimentation. A new "soft-glassy rheology" model has been used to model the fluid response time and visco-elasto-plastic response under creep conditions and oscillatory loadings. (cont.) The experiments and model show that the evolution of chain structure and plastic collapse in these suspensions exhibits a universal scaling with the dimensionless stress s = [sigma]/[sigma]y. Structure evolution, pattern formation and dynamics of MR fluid flow in microchannel geometries has been analyzed using high-speed digital video microscopy. In order to elucidate the mechanisms that control MR structure formation, experiments have been performed while varying the magnetic field, particle size, channel geometry, concentration and fluid composition. Excellent qualitative agreement has been obtained with Brownian Dynamics simulations and useful scalings based on interplay of magnetostatic & viscous forces have been extracted to understand the field-dependent fluid response on the macro & micro scale. Novel MR elastomeric materials and microparticles have been synthesized by doping photo-curable or thermo-curable polymers with field-responsive fluids.

Facing this demand by traditional technologies and fossil energy sources implies evident difficulties and risks, because of the scarcity and high cost of fuels and their relevant environmental impact in terms of local pollution and global warming emissions. Then, the efforts of researchers have been focusing on alternative solutions, either based on the use of renewable energy sources and on innovative plant schemes for the combined and efficient production of several energy and material flows. In this paper an innovative renewable polygeneration system is considered, which includes: a solar field based on concentrating parabolic trough photovoltaic/thermal collectors; a biomass heater; a single-stage absorption chiller; a Multiple Effect Distillation desalination plant; two sensible heat storage tanks; Balance of Plant and auxiliary components, like pumps, <b>mixers,</b> diverters, <b>valves,</b> controllers, plate-fin heat exchangers, etc. The system is sized to cover the very base load of an isolated small community. The plant operation has been analysed in detail in previous papers; in this paper an exergetic and exergoeconomic analysis is made. As concerns the exergetic analysis, it is intended to: i) quantify the exergy destructions occurring along the whole complex energy conversion process; ii) identify the steps that mostly affect the overall exergy efficiency of the system and thus propose possible improvements. Also, as the system actually operates under dynamic conditions, the analyses are performed by adopting daily integral values of energy flows, comparing the results obtained in the summer, winter and intermediate (spring/autumn) seasons. Finally, being the installation and maintenance costs of plant components known, an exergoeconomic analysis is also performed, based on the exergy costing method. The study is applied to integral energy flows; then, the cost accounting procedure will allow one to assign a monetary value to each energy or material flow, thus representing a good premise for the future definition of selling prices...|$|R

Recent papers have proposed programmable labs-on-achip {{as an alternative to}} traditional application-specific chips to reduce design effort, time, and cost. While these previous papers provide the basic support for programmability, this paper identifies and addresses a practical issue, namely, fluid volume management. Volume management addresses the problem that the use of a fluid depletes it and unless the given volume of a fluid is distributed carefully among all its uses, execution may run out of the fluid before all its uses are complete. Additionally, fluid volumes should not overflow (i. e., exceed hardware capacity) or underflow (i. e., fall below hardware resolution). We show that the problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem (LP). Because LP’s complexity and slow execution times in practice may be a concern, we propose another approach, called DAGSolve, which over-constrains the problem to achieve linear complexity while maintaining good solution quality. We also propose two optimizations, called cascading and static replication, to handle cases involving extreme mix ratios and numerous fluid uses which may defeat both LP and DAGSolve. Using some real-world assays, we show that our techniques produce good solutions while being faster than LP...|$|R
50|$|Water for baths, {{sinks and}} basins can be {{provided}} by separate hot and cold taps; this arrangement is common in older installations, particularly in public washrooms/lavatories and utility rooms/laundries. In kitchens and bathrooms, mixer taps are commonly used. In this case, hot and cold water from the two valves is mixed before reaching the outlet, allowing the water to emerge at any temperature between that of the hot and cold water supplies. Mixer taps were invented by Thomas Campbell of Saint John, New Brunswick, and patented in 1880.For baths and showers, mixer taps frequently incorporate some sort of pressure balancing feature so that the hot/cold mixture ratio will not be affected by transient changes in the pressure of one or other of the supplies. This helps avoid scalding or uncomfortable chilling as other water loads occur (such as the flushing of a toilet).Rather than two separate <b>valves,</b> <b>mixer</b> taps frequently use a single, more complex, valve controlled by a single handle (single handle mixer). The handle moves up and down to control {{the amount of water}} flow and from side to side to control the temperature of the water. Especially for baths and showers, the latest designs are thermostatic mixing valves that do this using a built-in thermostat, and can be mechanical or electronic. There are also faucets with color LEDs to show the temperature of the water.|$|R
40|$|Work {{presented}} in this thesis demonstrates methods of combining a newly developed magnetic composite polymer (M-CP) with other commonly used polymer microfluidics materials {{for the creation of}} complex all-polymer microfluidic systems. To achieve fully integrated microfluidic systems, new fabrication techniques for integration of M-CP structures are developed. Employing the new M-CP material and the novel fabrication techniques, three types of actuators are developed: cilia, flap, and hybrid M-CP/PDMS actuator. All three actuators employ compatible materials, fabrication techniques, and actuation mechanisms. The performance of each of these actuators is characterized for different applications: cilia-based <b>mixers,</b> flap-based <b>valves,</b> and hybrid M-CP/PDMS actuators for applying extracellular stimulation on cell monolayers. The actuators in each of these applications are driven via relatively small external magnetic fields. The M-CP used in these novel actuators is composed of rare-earth magnetic micro-particles (5 – 10 micrometer) that are embedded in polydimethylsiloxane. The M-CP is patterned into large force, large stroke actuators. The polymer matrix without magnetic particles is employed as the substrate material for passive parts, facilitating integration of the magnetic and non-magnetic materials. The compatible fabrication techniques include a modified soft-lithography technique for hybrid M-CP/PDMS actuators, screen printing via shadow masks for micro-patterning of thin layers of M-CP, and a novel fabrication technique using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a sacrificial material for the fabrication of ultra-high aspect-ratio and highly flexible M-CP cilia. Microfluidic devices using these actuators show improved performances in their respective fields when compared with existing designs. Microfluidic mixers with 8 cilia show a reduction in mixing time of up to 63 times over diffusion. Flap-based valve arrays effectively switch flows between two microfluidic channels using an array of two valves, and effectively perform as on-off switches for flow control. A valve with a 2. 3 mm flap thickness, actuated under an 80 mT magnetic field, is capable of blocking liquid flow at a flow rate of 1 mL/min for pressures up to 9. 65 kPa. Microfluidic platforms for stretching/compressing biological cells based on the hybrid M-CP/PDMS actuators achieve large and bi-directional surface deflections. Actuation can be applied cyclically, under both flow and no-flow conditions...|$|R

The novelty of this study lies in the utilization of flat-plate stationary solar collectors, manufactured by TVP Solar, rather than concentrating ones (typically adopted for driving double-stage absorption chillers).

However multiple barriers exist towards low-cost field deployment of programmable microfluidics. Incorporating multiple pumps, <b>mixers</b> and discrete <b>valve</b> based control of nanoliter fluids and droplets in an integrated, programmable manner without additional required external components has remained elusive. Combining the idea of punch card programming with arbitrary fluid control, here we describe a self-contained, hand-crank powered, multiplex and robust programmable microfluidic platform. A paper tape encodes information {{as a series of}} punched holes. A mechanical reader/actuator reads these paper tapes and correspondingly executes a series of operations onto a microfluidic chip coupled to the platform in a plug-and-play fashion. Enabled by the complexity of codes that can be represented by a series of holes in punched paper tapes, we demonstrate independent control of fifteen on-chip pumps with enhanced mixing, on-off valves and a novel on-demand impact-based droplet generator. We demonstrate robustness of operation by encoding a string of characters representing the word "PUNCHCARD MICROFLUIDICS" using the droplet generator. Multiplexing is demonstrated by implementing an example water quality test utilizing colorimetric assays for pH, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate content in different water samples. With its portable and robust design, low cost and ease-of-use, we envision punch card programmable microfluidics will bring complex control of microfluidic chips into field-based applications in low-resource settings and in the hands of children around the world bringing microfluidics and low-Reynolds number hydrodynamics to everyday classrooms.

Contamination arises because fluid flow is not perfect and leaves residue in the PLoC 2 ̆ 7 s components (e. g., channels and reservoirs) despite efforts to reduce such residue. This residue may contaminate the next fluid that uses the same components. Fourth, I establish a benchmark suite of real-world assays that cover a wide range of domains, and use them to evaluate the PLoC concept and proposed solutions to the fluid volume management and contamination issues. Finally, I develop a working PLoC prototype, compiler suite, runtime system and control platform and use it to run two real-world diverse assays as a proof-of-concept to the PLoC approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Microfluidics is {{the science}} of {{designing}} and manufacturing devices and processes for manipulation of extremely small volumes of fluid, typically micro to nanoliters. The most mature application of microfluidics technology is ink-jet printing, which uses orifices less than 100 μm in diameter to generate drops of ink. The complex devices now being developed for biological applications involving the analysis of DNA (in genetics and genomics) and proteins (in proteomics) and bio-defense typically involve aqueous solutions and channels 30 to 300 μm in diameter. Unlike microelectronics, in which the current emphasis is on reducing the size of transistors, microfluidics is focusing on making more complex systems of channels with more sophisticated fluid-handling capabilities, rather than reducing {{the size of the}} channels. Although micro- and macro-fluidic systems require similar components including pumps, <b>valves,</b> <b>mixers,</b> filters, and separators, the small size of microchannels causes their flow to behave differently. At micron scales, fluid motions are primarily dominated by surface tension and viscous forces. In the problem under consideration, the issue is one of wicking or leaking of the sample from the reaction reservoir to the waste region at elevated temperatures. A mechanism responsible for this phenomenon was thought to be the "wedge effect," which refers to the tendency of liquids to move along a sharp corner by capillary effects if the conditions are right. The analysis performed during the workshop also mainly focused on this effect. While a definitive solution to this challenging problem posed in the workshop was not identified, it was felt that using a manufacturing process that can affect the corner angles in the channels may hold the most promise, allowing the wicking mechanism to be controlled without surface treatments that insert hydrophobic stops in the channel. For instance by "rounding" the side walls to increase the corner angles from 90 toward 180 degrees, the leaking of the sample away from the reaction chamber might be delayed...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} micro total {{analysis}} systems (μTAS) aims at developments toward miniaturized and fully integrated lab-on-a-chip systems for applications, such as drug screening, drug delivery, cellular assays, protein analysis, genomic analysis and handheld point-of-care diagnostics. Such systems offer to dramatically reduce liquid sample and reagent quantities, increase sensitivity {{as well as}} speed of analysis and facilitate portable systems via the integration of components such as pumps, <b>valves,</b> <b>mixers,</b> separation units, reactors and detectors. Precise microfluidic control for such systems has long been {{considered one of the}} most difficult technical barriers due to integration of on-chip fluidic handling components and complicated off-chip liquid control as well as fluidic interconnections. Actuation principles and materials with the advantages of low cost, easy fabrication, easy integration, high reliability, and compact size are required to promote the development of such systems. Within this thesis, liquid displacement in microfluidic applications, by means of expandable microspheres, is presented as an innovative approach addressing some of the previously mentioned issues. Furthermore, these expandable microspheres are embedded into a PDMS matrix, which composes a novel thermally responsive silicone elastomer composite actuator for liquid handling. Due to the merits of PDMS and expandable microspheres, the composite actuator's main characteristic to expand irreversibly upon generated heat makes it possible to locally alter its surface topography. The composite actuator concept, along with a novel adhesive PDMS bonding technique, is used to design and fabricate liquid handling components such as pumps and valves, which operate at work-ranges from nanoliters to microliters. The integration of several such microfluidic components promotes the development of disposable lab-on-a-chip platforms for precise sample volume control addressing, e. g. active dosing, transportation, merging and mixing of nanoliter liquid volumes. Moreover, microfluidic pumps based on the composite actuator have been incorporated with sharp and hollow microneedles to realize a microneedle-based transdermal patch which exhibits on-board liquid storage and active dispensing functionality. Such a system represents a first step toward painless, minimally invasive and transdermal administration of macromolecular drugs such as insulin or vaccines. The presented on-chip liquid handling concept does not require external actuators for pumping and valving, uses low-cost materials and wafer-level processes only, is highly integrable and potentially enables controlled and cost-effective transdermal microfluidic applications, as well as large-scale integrated fluidic networks for point-of care diagnostics, disposable biochips or lab-on-a-chip applications. This thesis discusses several design concepts for a large variety of microfluidic components, which are promoted by the use of the novel composite actuator. Results on the successful fabrication and evaluation of prototype devices are reported herein along with comprehensive process parameters on a novel full-wafer adhesive bonding technique for the fabrication of PDMS based microfluidic devices.
