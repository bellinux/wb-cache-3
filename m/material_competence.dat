40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between goals, <b>materials</b> and <b>competences</b> {{in the practice of}} everyday design. Appropriations and creative uses of design artifacts are often reported in terms of outcomes and goals; however, we observe a gap in understanding how <b>materials,</b> tools, and <b>competences</b> are also involved in these processes. We conduct a multiple case study of three groups of everyday designers: families, hobbyist jewelers, and steampunk enthusiasts. We provide a description of the aspects of meaning, <b>materials,</b> and <b>competences,</b> as well as how they are interrelated, for each case. Our findings show that amongst these three aspects of the practice of everyday designers, it is the meaning of the practice that acts as the strongest motivator for practitioners. <b>Materials,</b> tools, and <b>competences</b> are hence largely determined accordingly. The implications of this study propose ways to design for practices with different types of meaning: foundational, aesthetic, and aspirational goals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} Social Practices Theory (SPT) {{as a way}} of facilitating necessary {{evolution in}} social marketing. SPT conceptualises individuals as carriers of practices comprising <b>materials,</b> <b>competences</b> and meanings (Shove et al., 2012). The theory enables problem ‘practice’ to be analysed in the abstract through the detailed consideration of the links between elements. Thus social marketers can use SPT to frame their contribution to the strategic planning of interdisciplinary solutions, which has been identified as the future of effective behaviour change (House of Lords, 2011). Secondly, SPT removes the individual from the focus of enquiry, distancing social marketing from its criticisms of myopic individualism. Both disciplinary evolutions are required for social marketing to survive...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we argue}} that an {{approach}} informed by practice theory coupled with design fiction provides useful insights {{into the role of}} interaction design with respect to environmental sustainability. We argue that a practice-oriented approach can help interaction designers step away from models of individual behavior and studies of artifacts towards seeing sustainable behaviors as part of multidimensional and interrelated practices and practice elements. We analyze two previously conducted studies. The first study of everyday repair focuses on how people repair their broken objects. The second study of green-DIY examines how green enthusiasts facilitate their practices of making sustainable DIY (do-it-yourself) projects. We describe the practices of everyday repairers and green enthusiasts in terms of <b>materials,</b> <b>competences,</b> and meanings, and the interrelations among those elements, using the framework of Shove et al. [2012]. We argue that understanding the dynamics of practice and their unique configurations is a starting point to redefine the roles of sustainable interaction design (SID). We propose that designers design towards resources and tools in ways that reflect on the challenges of intelligibility of their design interventions in practices. In addition to considering SID in the light of practice theories, we reveal how design fictions are readily incorporated into green practices in ways that transform those practices and hold implications for transformations of design as well. We bring forward opportunities for designers to co-design with DIY enthusiasts, targeted as practitioners in their own right, designing toward or within a design fiction. As a result, we conclude with the possibility for sustainable interaction designers to become practice-oriented designers who design with transparent open strategies and accessible <b>materials</b> and <b>competences...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{transformations of}} {{economic}} structures {{as well as}} of transportation and communication means have altered neighborhood-based interaction in the last decades. Therefore most urban studies argue that local neighborhoods have lost their function as places of sociability and solidarity. But if one looks at the more semipublic local contact sites and therein on a more superficial and fluid interactional level, interactions and ties among local residents do not seem to decrease {{in the same way as}} close and intimate ties have exceeded the neighborhood boundaries. This article thus examines the neighborhood-based interactions in one example of an important neighborhood space – a café – that demands different kinds of commitments. Practice theories thereby provide a particularly advantageous set of approaches to examine these rather spontaneous and loose micro-interactions. This is why this article ethnographically analyzes a café, as one of the important social neighborhood spaces. The article elaborates on Theodore Schatzki's (2010) and Elizabeth Shove's (2012) idea of practices as linked entities of <b>material,</b> <b>competence,</b> and meanings, coupled with Erving Goffman's conceptualization of public behavior (1959, 1963) regarding why local businesses represent locational material neighborhood settings for local micro-interactions (as social practices).

Eco-design is consequently the process of incorporating environmental considerations during all (as early as possible) phases of the design of buildings or objects. Eco-design is for that reason closely related to life cycle thinking. All the case studies deal with the principles of Reusability, Recyclability and Recoverability of urban and industrial waste such as packaging and thus explore structural capacities to become inhabited devices such as playgrounds, dwellings or furniture. Low-tech fabrication is the optimal medium to test and materialise our Eco-design outcomes, throughout the method of ‘bricolage’ or Do-It-Yourself (DIY), an elementary fabrication process that is 100 % personal involvement and enhancement of manual skills, which are dormant due to an education based on abstraction and merely cognitive aspects rather than <b>material</b> <b>competences.</b> Through comparative teaching and design methods, this study critically explores the principles of low-tech and high-design carried out in several international workshops led by the author in Spain, Slovenia, Chile and the UK, since 2004.

40|$|The globalized food system poses many {{systemic}} {{challenges that}} have significant {{impacts on the}} environment and human health. In order to tackle these challenges, especially those relating to climate change, it is assumed that consumers need to be accountable for the role they play in these issues, requiring them to alter their harmful consumption habits. In terms of the food system, this means that people need to evolve into ethical consumers and become more invested in what and how much they eat, where it comes from, etc. However, throughout the literature and in policies, there remains a focus on altering what people buy, rather than reducing waste from their overconsumption. Reducing waste and consumption would have a more beneficial impact for the environment, human health, and urban sustainability, yet it remains secondary to the narrative of buying sustainable alternatives. A waste reduction narrative would encourage sustainable behaviours that would also be more accessible to households of various socioeconomic backgrounds, and would provide more tangible results in terms of money saved, reduced greenhouse gases and waste output, and increased sustainability. However, food consumption is the result of many ingrained daily food practices influenced by a multitude of factors that prevent people from consciously considering the consequences of their actions. Food consumption and waste management as a phenomenon can therefore be interpreted using Social Practice Theory (SPT), which states that all humans act autonomously and according to social norms. This means that practices are recursive and routinized, subject to change, yet somewhat unconscious. All practices lead to consumption in some way, and changing such deeply embedded routines to become more sustainable requires a full understanding of these deeply entrenched practices. Practices can be broken down into three main components that drive how practices are formed and maintained:materials, competences, and meanings. This project uses mini-ethnographic studies to highlight SPT in order to understand the factors (contextual, <b>materials,</b> <b>competences,</b> and meanings) influencing households in Edmonton, Canada as they navigate the current sustainability narrative, and how they approach sustainable food consumption and food waste management. The results from this study lend some insight into what <b>materials,</b> <b>competences,</b> meanings, and other factors drive people already somewhat aware of sustainable food consumption issues to practice such types of behaviour. These influential elements have been found in many other recently published works, and give further insight into how broad external factors and specific internal factors can drive consumption practices. Prevention and reduction behaviours were already somewhat prevalent in this group. It is important that education programs targeting sustainable food consumption behaviours understand what drives certain food related practices, and how they can target the barriers that prevent certain groups of people from adopting more sustainable habits...|$|R

She grew vegetables, such as red peppers, green onions and lettuces. Today, I buy a variety of vegetables from supermarkets, including imported food from all over the world. The initial research question asks the reason why my grandmother and I consume food differently. My research investigates what caused this change and how different farming practices have influenced our purchasing behavior in daily life. The progress of agricultural development tells a story how we can acquire food from supermarkets as consumers. This thesis begins with sustainability and systems thinking to explain the fourth design generation. The thesis examines the definition, categories and new farmers of urban farming. In terms of the framework, social practice theory allows us to conceive farming as a social practice with three central concepts: <b>materials,</b> <b>competences</b> and meanings.

40|$|Territorial {{competence}} is, {{together with}} <b>material</b> <b>competence</b> and functional competence, {{one of the}} fundamental forms of competence, without which the precise competence of a judicial body in the resolution of a criminal matter cannot be established. Among the fundamental forms of competence, territorial competence is imperative by its extreme importance, being immutable, namely the judicial bodies can only build a case or try a criminal case if they are competent from the territorial point of view. Starting from this qualification, it is extremely important to know the criteria based on which territorial competence is established {{and the way in which}} they are enforced, aspects analyzed in this article. In the light of the Romanian criminal procedural regulations, the establishment of the territorial competence of the judicial bodies is done depending on two main coordinates – art. 30 (competence for offenses perpetrated in the country) and art. 31 (competence for offenses perpetrated abroad). The establishment of the territorial competence as a criterion for the establishment of the territorial competence in criminal matters implies the approach of both criminal law aspects and criminal procedure law aspects. Thus, from the point of view of substantial law, the appreciation of the place of perpetration of an offense is done by applying the territoriality principle. The proper enforcement of the territoriality principle in the establishment of the place of perpetration of the offense was characterized by different approaches that adopted in the criminal law doctrine several forms around which several theories have been built – the theory of action, result, unlawfulness, preponderance and ubiquity. Last but not least, from the point of view of criminal procedure law, the analysis and definition of the place of perpetration of the offense is done in accordance with the theory of ubiquity or equivalence, a dominant theory in criminal doctrine nowadays...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we are trying}} to offer those {{practicing}} law a theoretical and practical approach of some dispositions in Law 202 / October 25, 2010 regarding some measures to accelerate the adjudication of matters, known as the Law on the Small Justice Reform, that amended and completed the Code of Civil Procedure. The law on accelerating justice was adopted only three months and 11 days after the New Code of Civil procedure was published. This law is important due to the content of some dispositions regarding certain institutions of civil procedural law, that have the role intended by the Romanian legislator, to accelerate the determination of matters, institutions that are not found in the New Code. The reform (change) in the Romanian civil trials took into consideration the respect of some principles such as the access to justice, equality of the parties in civil lawsuits, the right to due and fair trial as well as the fact that any reform has to guarantee that the judicial system is efficient, answers the necessity of transparency and democracy. Still, the application of the new dispositions of civil procedure, beginning with Law no. 59 / 1993 and until the coming into force of law on accelerating the determination of matters, namely the past 17 years, the amendments brought to the Code of Civil procedure have not always been beneficial for the Romanian litigant {{by the fact that they}} determined different interpretations leading thus to a non unitary judicial practice even within the same institution. The present law is not safe either from critics that some theoreticians and practitioners of law have expressed, being interested in accomplishing the purpose the Romanian legislator has set in that law. In this paper, the authors aim at analyzing the impact of the abovementioned law, regarding the <b>material</b> <b>competence</b> of the tribunal in trials and the requests regarding claims with the object of payment up to 2000 lei; adjudicating the objection to jurisdiction of the instance and the effect of non invocating it on legal basis; the solutions that the appeal court can issue. At the same time, without getting into theoretical disputes regarding these issues raised in this study (to avoid issuing decisions that could be given in applying the same norm of procedure, obviously with negative effect on the litigant parties), we will try to propose solutions in case they will be transposed into judicial norms of civil procedure (until the coming into force of the New Code of civil procedure) will have a positive effect in the accelerated development of the Romanian civil trial. We assert that “acceleration in adjudicating civil trials” should not remain a collocation empty of content and this is the reason for which the judicial norms of civil procedure have to be characterized by accuracy and flexibility in application, without the necessity of elaborating an application “guide”...|$|E

The governance of domestic energy systems has attracted European research attention, and the findings illustrate how <b>materials,</b> <b>competence,</b> and meaning influence energy productivity in domestic settings and how accountability is enacted by connecting people and technologies. The present research cites Swedish examples of how energy efficiency has been improved by involving multiple local actors, such as consumers, energy utilities, property companies, and local governments. Examples are analysed {{through the lens of}} social change and mundane governance theory, illustrating how spaces and places often overlooked as too mundane to be considered in policy prove, when analysed in more detail, to be important for energy efficiency. The results indicate that “governance pairs” (e. g., “households/lighting” and “caretakers/heating systems”) are more or less successfully held together and influence accountability and governance possibilities. The present analyses demonstrate that, while governance is often portrayed in terms of causality, everyday practices involving governance pairs are messier and less predictable than anticipated. These results call for the upgrading of research into everyday life and for bottom–up approaches to energy studies. Accountability – crucial to closing the energy-efficiency gap and understood in the context of mundane governance – can advance our energy-efficiency thinking and action. Formas - Everday lif...|$|R

As part of a wider study of how alternative consumption practices become embedded in everyday life, this paper follows a different line of enquiry, taking its orientation from how theories of practice conceptualise what people do and how this changes.

The focus then shifts to how these elements are variably integrated in the performance of reuse. First, what are the implications for how people go about giving and receiving when small details are changed relative to other similar practices? Findings suggest that technologically mediated reuse 'communities' connect some people but exclude others. Eliminating money from the exchange process gives participants access to goods they would otherwise struggle to afford, {{but at the same time}} raises questions as to how goods are allocated, potentially privileging other unequally distributed material and cultural resources.

40|$|O objetivo {{principal}} de nossa tese é comprovar que a competência da Justiça do Trabalho às causas trabalhista-previdenciária, decorrentes das relações de trabalho, em face dos Regimes Geral e Privado Fechado de Previdência, é critério de efetividade do direito social fundamental à Previdência. Nossas justificativas decorrem de questões jurídicas com repercussões na jurisdição trabalhista e na vida do trabalhador. Por exemplo, a declaração formal, mas não efetiva do direito fundamental à previdência, corresponde à inexistência de direito, reconhecimento de que algo precisa ser mudado e feito para assegurar o gozo pleno desse direito. Ao mesmo tempo, a mera declaração formal do direito, denuncia criticamente que os meios escolhidos até então para esse fim não têm correspondido. No contexto da tutela jurisdicional, isso tem ocorrido com o direito social à previdência oriundo da relação de trabalho. Consideramos, como hipótese principal que o formalismo, a onerosidade e a excessiva morosidade típicos da jurisdição comum defendidos pelo constitucionalismo neoliberal para causas contra o Regime Fechado de previdência são obstáculos que impedem o trabalhador de ter acesso à Justiça, restando ineficaz o seu direito. Outra hipótese é que, do ponto de vista da unidade interna do sistema constitucional, não é correto atribuir à jurisdição comum o exame de derivado previdenciário cuja causa de pedir é a relação de trabalho, quando essa (pelo mesmo sistema constitucional) é o núcleo básico da competência material da JT. Nossa tese, coloca também sob questionamento se a competência comum configura ou não antinomias própria e teleológica entre o parágrafo 2 º, art. 202 da EC nº 20 / 98 e o art. 114, incisos I, VIII e IX da EC nº 45 / 04. Diante disso, nossa tese sustenta que a regra no parágrafo 2 º, art. 202 da EC nº 20 / 98, não pode negar-nos o direito de pensar criticamente essa questão, nem pode impedir-nos de apresentar novos elementos jurídicos que comprovem a insubsistência daquela regra em face do art. 114, incisos I, VIII e IX da EC nº 45 / 04. Isso porque o direito fundamental à previdência decorrente das relações empregatícias pede efetividade principal resultado prático que se pretende alcançar. Para isso, a tese defende que são necessários meios adequados para sair da retórica para realidade concreta. É a função vinculante e imediata desse direito fundamental que exige adequação do regime de competência à natureza da matéria. A tese sustenta que este regime é o da Justiça do Trabalho. Afinal, nenhum aspecto de nosso modelo de jurisdição deve ser blindado às mudanças, salvo quando representa retrocesso. O caráter normativo compõe os aspectos teóricos da nossa tese, complementado pelos princípios, que iluminam metodologicamente a sistemática interpretação e aplicação da tese. Isso porque os princípios da simplicidade, não onerosidade, cumulação objetiva de pedidos, economia processual, impulso ex-officio do processo e celeridade são típicos da Justiça do Trabalho, constitucionalmente formatada às ações decorrentes das relações de trabalho humano, às suas controvérsias e litígios derivados de suas próprias decisões, independentemente do status jurídico da parte demandada. Por fim, nossa tese apresenta-se como um meio jurisdicional eficaz para preservar o princípio da unidade da jurisdição disso tudo advindo o seu interesse e efeitos jurídico, processual e social para a sociedade brasileira, que são os resultados obtidosThe {{main purpose}} of our thesis is {{to prove that the}} jurisdiction of the Justice Federal Labour of the causes, arising from labor relations, in the face of General and Private Schemes Closed Pension Fund, is a criterion of effectiveness of fundamental social right to Social Security. Our reasons are the result of legal issues impacting on labor jurisdiction and the lives of workers. For example, the formal declaration, but not the fundamental right to effective security, corresponds to the absence of law, recognition that something needs to be changed and made to ensure the full enjoyment of this right. At the same time, the mere formal declaration of the law, critically denounces that the means chosen previously for this purpose have not correspondid. In the context of judicial review, this has occurred with the social right to welfare derived from the employment relationship. We consider as the main hypothesis that formalism, the burden and excessive delays typical of ordinary court - defended by neoliberal constitutionalism causes against the Closed Pension Scheme - are obstacles that prevent the employee from having access to justice, his right remaining ineffective. Another hypothesis is that, {{from the standpoint of the}} internal unity of the constitutional system, is not correct to attribute to ordinary jurisdiction to take derivative pension whose cause of action is the working relationship, when this (the same constitutional system) is the nucleus of <b>material</b> <b>competence</b> of JT. Our thesis also raises under question on set up a joint competence or not and teleological own antinomies between paragraph 2, art. Amendment Nº. 202 of 20 / 98 and art. 114, Sections I, VIII and IX of Amendment Nº. 45 / 04. Given this, our thesis argues that the rule in paragraph 2, art. Amendment No. 202 of 20 / 98, can not deny us the right to think critically about this issue, nor can it prevent us from presenting new legal elements that prove unsustainable in the face of the rule of art. 114, Sections I, VIII and IX of Amendment Nº. 45 / 04. That´s why is because the fundamental right to security arising from employment relationships asks effectiveness - the main practical result to be achieved. For this, the thesis argues that appropriate measures are required to leave the rhetoric to reality. It is the function of binding and immediate fundamental right that requires adaptation of the accrual to the nature of matter. ito crucial that requires the accrual basis of suitability to the nature of matter. For this, the thesis argues that this regime is the Labour Court. After all, the aspect of our model Should be shielded from law changes, except when it represents retrogression. That crucial to requires the accrual basis of suitability to the nature of matter. This scheme is the Labour Court. After all, the aspect of our model Should be shielded from law changes, except when it represents retrogression.

This is because the principles of simplicity, not burden, overlapping objective order, judicial economy, boost ex-officio of the process and speed are typical of JT, constitutionally shaped the actions arising from the relations of human labor, its controversies and disputes derived from their own decisions, regardless of legal status of the respondent.

Although it does not represent a radically new technology, car sharing challenges {{the foundations of the}} current mobility system, which is based on private ownership. Much of the literature on sustainability transitions uses socio-technical tools like the multi-level perspective and transition pathways typology, which have been useful for analyzing innovation from a macro, top-down perspective, but are less useful for analyzing micro-phenomena and capturing user perspectives. Practice theory is an alternative approach to studying human behavior and societal change that decenters the human agent and focuses on everyday activities and the formation of habits. Using practice theory, this thesis investigates mobility behavior and user adoption of car sharing platforms in Oslo to gain insights into critical aspects of a socio-technical transition in its nascent stages. Based on in-depth interviews with seven households living in Oslo, this thesis provides new understandings related to the <b>materials,</b> <b>competences</b> and meanings associated with car sharing. Car sharing is also contextualized among other important practices, chief among them, residency. I argue that the strength of car sharing is that it maintains many of the practices prevalent in the incumbent regime, and that, in Oslo, it is a distinctively urban phenomenon that attracts distinctively urban users who engage in the practice because it helps them achieve a preferred lifestyle. Although this thesis does not provide a blueprint for car sharing promotion or the enactment of a transition, its comprehensive analysis of innovation adoption and real-world use offers useful insights to inform future research and policy...|$|R
40|$|Gated {{communities}} are a global phenomenon - a common housing choice for middle-income groups in contexts of large socio-economic disparities. They have recently gained academic attention, and scholarly work {{since the late}} 1990 s has focused primarily on drivers such as security, status, prestige, and social homogeneity. However, the proliferation of these enclaves {{is not only the}} result of individual motivations and choices, but rather a complex issue that goes beyond the gates. In this thesis, I propose that the discussion should focus not on the physical artefact (gated communities) but the policies, practices, and meanings that enable their existence. I centre the discussion on the concept of “gatedness”, which embodies the three elements of practice proposed by Shove et al. (2012) : <b>materials,</b> <b>competences,</b> and meanings. The research took place in Mexico, a country with a history of debt-fuelled economy that affects individual households, particularly middle class families. The thesis provides elements for better understanding the complexity of the gated communities’ social phenomenon, where global economic forces affect national housing, land, finance, and planning policies, while shaping individual practices fed by aspirations and anxieties. The focus on the middle class population is mainly due to their role in the proliferation of these enclaves, and also because of the challenges to sustaining their lifestyle in a context of social, economic, and political uncertainty. Research was conducted with a qualitative approach using the case study of Lomas de Angelópolis, a large-scale suburban gated community in Puebla, Mexico. This research adds to previous knowledge about gated communities by recognising how elements of practice shape the physical world. Understanding these spaces better could help planners and policymakers in countries with similar dynamics to Mexico, propose alternatives to make cities more equitable, addressing the aspirations and anxieties of the middle classes without critically affecting access to opportunities to others...|$|R

Template analysis identified seven key patterns affecting energy behaviour: access to knowledge and skills; nature of technical intervention; habit; external circumstances; quality of technical intervention; convenience of technology; and thermal comfort. These findings were discussed in relation to Social Practice Theory and <b>competence,</b> <b>material</b> and image as components of practice. The research provides an insight into the interaction between occupants and retrofit technologies {{in the context of a}} social housing retrofit. It is recommended that policy makers and implementers of retrofit programmes ensure that <b>competence,</b> <b>material</b> and image considerations are integral to retrofit programmes for energy use practice to change and more optimal CO 2 emissions reduction achieved...|$|R

Defence date: 21 October 2013 The {{recognition}} of the legally binding value of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights has profoundly transformed the Union system of fundamental rights protection. The novelties not only concern the sources of this protection, but also the conditions for the application and interpretation of EU fundamental rights. In particular, before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty the Court of Justice was the exclusive architect of its approach to fundamental rights, whereas {{in the era of}} the legally binding Charter is confronted with written rules on the subject. Moreover, if {{there is no doubt that}} the Lisbon Treaty has put an unprecedented emphasis on the protection and promotion of EU fundamental rights, the Member States have contextually expressed, and with equal emphasis, concerns towards an ever-increasing expansion of the scope of EU fundamental rights, at the expense of domestic standards and <b>material</b> <b>competences.</b> Against this background, the aim of this thesis is to reconstruct the scope of the protection offered (better, that should be offered) by the EU Charter. The analysis covers problems relating both to the scope of application of the Charter and to its effects. Some of the questions addressed are new, as they stem from novelties introduced by the Charter others are veritable topoi of the EU discourse on fundamental rights, which nevertheless need to be revisited in light of the new scenario just described. The leading idea is that, in order to overcome the ambiguity of the Charter on many crucial issues concerning its scope of application and effects, reliance must be made on the role assigned to EU fundamental rights by the revised Treaties. These, and the progressive evolution of the EU system of fundamental rights protection, suggest that fundamental rights are constitutive values of the EU legal order...|$|R

Data from a qualitative sociological study is used here to explore the difference that cultural meanings make to cycling practices in four different English urban areas. Specifically, we discuss differences between places with established cycling cultures and those with newer cycling cultures. Drawing on concepts from practice theory we discuss the role that cultures of cycling play within the four places, and suggest how the meanings of cycling, including its association with other social identities, are connected to the <b>materials</b> and <b>competences</b> seen as necessary for cycling. Our research highlights the embedding of transport in local as well as national cultures, and the associated need for policy-makers to take culture seriously in considering how to shift transport practices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a {{descriptive}} multiple-case study that portrays the practices of three groups of everyday designers {{as a way to}} inform the design of interactive technologies. Previous research describes cases of appropriation and everyday design where people creatively transform and adapt design artifacts; however, there is still a gap in our understanding of how individuals precisely design and make things. The aim {{of this study is to}} discern the similarities and differences between the practices of the selected cases of everyday designers: family members, hobbyist jewellers, and steampunk enthusiasts. Based on the theory of practice, the analytical framework combines goals, outcomes, <b>materials,</b> tools, <b>competences,</b> and strategies to holistically describe those cases of everyday design. The findings point to a reconfiguration of how objects and technologies should be designed, but also a reflection on how designers can create materials, tools, and structures to support heterogeneous and creative design practices...|$|R

30|$|In {{contrast}} to existing diagnostic assessments for well-defined domains, {{in this study}} I emphasise intrapreneurship (IP) as a professional competence that is much more complex and transferable for work and life (so-called twenty first century-skills: Pellegrino 2014; Pellegrino and Hilton 2012; Weber et al. 2014). With {{the exception of the}} work of Weber and colleagues (2014, 2015, 2016 a, b) within the ASCOT 1 research initiative, intrapreneurship has been subject to little research to date. Therefore, I refer to their work where IP competence has been conceptualized, operationalized, and scaled up by IRT procedures with the purpose of comparing groups within a large-scale assessment (LSA). Their assessment design also follows the steps of the ECD. At this point, all three ECD parts (1 domain analyses and modelling, 2 conceptual assessment framework, and 3 assessment implementation and delivery) have been completed. In particular, I refer to their domain analysis and modelling <b>material,</b> their <b>competence</b> model, their task model, 2 and the data base of their main study.|$|R
40|$|Objectives The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to explore the role of consumption community for sustainable consumption. The background of the study lies in the unsustainable consumption of the toxic antifouling paints in recreational boats in the Baltic Sea, hence the context of the study is in recreational boating and boat maintenance in the Baltic Sea. The study adapts practice theory, focusing on the practice elements, to explain the lack of sustainable consumption. The aim is to extend the present understanding on why leisure boaters find it hard to switch to ecological antifouling techniques by offering explanations for the role of boating community in explaining unsustainable consumption. In addition, the study aims at identifying potential opportunities and barriers boating community creates for sustainable consumption. The study lies under consumer culture theory (CCT) as market place cultures and communities form one of the main research programs of CCT. Methodology The study is qualitative in nature. The theoretical framework bases on practice theory, which also constructs the research approach of the study to understand the practice of antifouling painting, which is {{in the center of the}} analysis. The empirical data of the study consists of ethnography at the boatyards and harbors and eight in-depth interviews with leisure time boaters. Key Findings The findings indicate how the role of boating community in explaining the lack of sustainable consumption is prominent. The study finds that numerous factors within the practice elements of <b>materials,</b> <b>competences</b> and meanings explain boating community in terms of unsustainable consumption. Interestingly, the findings foreground how boating community can at times hinder sustainable consumption practices by uncovering the opportunities and barriers boating community is identified to create for sustainable consumption. Understanding the influence of consumption community and connected practice elements in terms of unsustainable consumption is helpful in trying to change the consumption to more sustainable. The study suggests that the change needs to start within the boating community. Marketers should be aware of the potential barriers boating community indicates to be creating as well. Furthermore, the findings contribute to the international research project CHANGE, which aims at changing leisure boat owners’ behaviors and making the Baltic Sea cleaner...|$|R

40|$|A {{transition}} to a sustainable path of development will require that fossil fuels are replaced with renewable energy sources and involve, therefore, a large-scale transformation of the energy system. In the EU, offshore wind power and biorefineries {{have the potential to}} play an important role in this transformation. This thesis focuses on development and, particularly, diffusion of these technologies and the associated crucial mobilisation of resources. First, the formation of competences is analysed, with focus on the need for engineering competences in the offshore wind sector. Second, an analysis is made of an incumbent industry that is in control of strategic raw <b>material,</b> <b>competences</b> and technical systems and which, therefore, can hinder or drive the development of technology. The incumbent industry in question is the Swedish pulp and paper industry and the focus is on the adoption of biorefinery options. The analytical framework used is constructed by combining literature on innovations systems, transition management and strategic management. This combination contributes to a better understanding of the interactions between different system levels. The analysis of the human capital required to realize an expansion of offshore wind power shows that there is a need for both deep competences and new types of integrated competences. By 2020, the number of additional engineers needed in the wind power value chain may easily go beyond 10 000. The demand for competence has implications for the universities, which need to expand the number and types of educational programmes. This up-scaling of university programmes will require that the associated teaching staffs are enlarged. It may also require support for a European portfolio of specialized courses that are made available to students from different universities. The analysis of the pulp and paper industry describes how the industry has started to change its attitude towards development of biorefinery technologies due to pressure from several changes at a societal level. This far, the industry’s reaction to these changes has been modest and is characterized by incremental change and extended vertical integration. However, development along two new technological trajectories (including development of gasification and separation/refining technologies, respectively) can be identified. The firms’ different reactions to pressure can be explained by their different prerequisites regarding resources, skills, position and experience. These reactions can be seen as an initial phase of a regime fragmentation and could constitute a starting point for a transition...|$|R

In these fields, EU law has progressively become preponderant. How do the devolved bodies implement the European Law? What are the legal consequences and their responsibilities? Firstly, I take a special interest in the foundations of the norms of devolution in Great Britain, federalism in Germany and décentralisation in France. All entities qualified as 'devolved entities' have a power to make subordinate legislation in these matters. It is necessary to note that EC law is uninterested {{in the form of the}} national measures applying EC law. It is more a question of degree of decentralization of the state. Secondly, the problem raised results from the legally binding legislation taken on the basis of the EC Treaty. Regulations, directives which are 'sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional' and decisions are directly applicable in national orders. The possibility of confrontation with a national norm, general as individual, is problematic. The Simmenthal jurisprudence implies the national norm should be put aside, even when valid. European law has no competence to regulate the territorial organization of Member States. The principle of institutional autonomy drawn by the ECJ prohibits any interference of the European norm. European institutions are thus limited to the <b>material</b> <b>competences.</b> Consequently, the European norm directly applicable lacks an important element of a normal norm, which is the determination of the organ. That means that this norm cannot be effective without the national norm which is exclusively competent for this determination. Finally, I raise two important problems. On the one hand, the complexity of European law shows the failure to adapt to the coordination between the devolved administration, the national representation and the EU. On the other hand, I underline the lack of direct constraint towards devolved entities which apply European law insofar as the state assumes this responsibility for them. That explains, in part, why the British and French states tend to keep the control of the implementation of European law. The German Länder stand out from this tendency according to general powers enshrined in the Grundgesetz...|$|R

40|$|Pressure {{from society}} and a growing need for {{education}} and specialised knowledge require new ways of facilitating access to learning and documentation of qualifications. Traditional universities do not have capacity {{to meet these challenges}} at their own premises. The use of ICT and Internet seems to be a possible way to increase access and capacity. In order to keep costs and efforts at a reasonable level without lowering study quality or staff qualifications, collaboration and sharing of <b>material</b> and <b>competence</b> may be the best option. This has been tested over the past 20 years in different plans and projects. Experiences from three projects are presented in this paper: NITOL (Norway-net with IT for Open Learning) as a national project in Norway, MENU (Model for a European Networked University) at a European level, and UNU-GVU (Global Virtual University) with students and partners around the World. The analysis of positive and negative findings leads up to certain recommendations that may be of value for future attempts to exploit the full potential of collaboration between universities.

40|$|The {{practice}} of {{working from home}} has become widespread in developed countries, and the numbers of regular home workers are steadily increasing. There are potentially positive implications for energy consumption associated with home working, but these depend on myriad variables. This qualitative study, {{based on interviews with}} regular home workers, provides a more in-depth perspective on how and why energy is used compared with quantitative models of household consumption. Ethnographic research data is analysed using insights from practice theory. Placing the practice at the heart of analysis, it explores meanings, <b>materials</b> and <b>competences</b> involved in home working, and attends to the affective experiences of practitioners. Considering working from home as an integrative practice, it explores how dispersed practices are incorporated into individual performances, bringing about affective satisfaction. Findings show that the {{practice of}} working from home is characterised by themes of comfort, control and flexibility, with implications for energy demand. It is argued that the synthesis of practice theory and affect can provide valuable insights for energy research. The paper discusses the implications for demand reduction, demand shifting and ‘smart’ controls, with reference to the role of employers, researchers, policy makers and home workers themselves...|$|R
