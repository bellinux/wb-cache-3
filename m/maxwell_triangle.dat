It is psychophysically well justified since it is consistent with several human visual perception laws and characteristics. It is mathematically and computationally relevant since it allows to consider color images as vectors in an abstract linear space, contrary to the classical color spaces (e. g., RGB and L∗a∗b∗). The first purpose of this book chapter is to present the mathematical fundamentals of the CoLIP together with its main psychophysical connections (Grasmann’s law, color matching functions, chromaticity diagram and the <b>Maxwell</b> <b>triangle).</b> The second purpose is to present some basic image processing and analysis techniques for contrast enhancement (histogram equalization, dynamic range maximization, toggle contrast calculation), white balance correction, color transfer, K-means clustering and filtering. Most of them are applied on various original color images in a comparative way between CoLIP, RGB and L∗a∗b∗ color spaces...|$|E
25|$|The RGB color {{model is}} based on the Young–Helmholtz theory of {{trichromatic}} color vision, developed by Thomas Young and Hermann Helmholtz in the early to mid nineteenth century, and on James Clerk <b>Maxwell's</b> color <b>triangle</b> that elaborated that theory (circa 1860).|$|R
2500|$|The second {{proposed}} a new chromaticity space, {{guided by a}} principle {{that has become the}} holy grail of color spaces: perceptual uniformity (chromaticity distance should be commensurate with perceptual difference). By means of a projective transformation, Judd found a more [...] "uniform chromaticity space" [...] (UCS) in which to find the CCT. Judd determined the [...] "nearest color temperature" [...] by simply finding the point on the Planckian locus nearest to the chromaticity of the stimulus on <b>Maxwell's</b> color <b>triangle,</b> depicted aside. The transformation matrix he used to convert X,Y,Z tristimulus values to R,G,B coordinates was: ...|$|R
