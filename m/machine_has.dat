5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Walternate's <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> been detected by the Fringe division and Fauxlivia {{and her team}} go to investigate. When Walternate tells them to stand down, Fauxilivia asks him about her recent mission to the prime universe and the part that she recovered. Walternate admits {{to her that the}} <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> been activated, having sacrificed his own son Peter to allow Fauxlivia's son to live. Fauxlivia becomes distressed at Walternate's actions, and later returns to Liberty Island to obtain the devices to allow her to cross to the prime universe, but is caught before she can use them. Walternate locks her away, seeing her as a traitor to his cause.|$|E
5|$|Both Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden have {{reformed}} since Audioslave's breakup. Rage Against the <b>Machine</b> <b>has</b> {{performed at}} several live venues and other festivals since its initial {{performance at the}} Coachella Music Festival in April 2007, although the band currently {{has no plans to}} make a new album. Soundgarden announced a reunion in 2010 and recorded a new album, King Animal, which was released in November 2012.|$|E
5|$|The 808 was {{the first}} drum machine {{with the ability to}} program an entire {{percussion}} track from beginning to end, complete with breaks and rolls. It includes volume knobs for each voice, numerous audio outputs, and a DIN sync port (a precursor to MIDI) to synchronize with other devices through the Digital Control Bus interface, which was considered groundbreaking. The <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> three trigger outputs, which can be used to synchronize with synthesizers and other equipment.|$|E
50|$|These <b>machines</b> <b>have</b> {{mechanical}} power steering {{similar to a}} large truck. This system gives a mechanical link between {{the steering wheel and}} the front wheels.Generally these <b>machines</b> <b>have</b> had a maximum speed of 65 km/h except some 100 and 3000 series <b>machines</b> <b>having</b> a maximum speed of 75 km/h.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in November 1993 in both North America and Europe. An 8-bit version was released for the Game Gear {{in the same year}} and the Master System in the following year. Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean <b>Machine</b> <b>has</b> also appeared in retrospective compilations, such as the Sonic Mega Collection for the Nintendo GameCube in 2002, Sonic Mega Collection Plus for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2004; which also contains the Game Gear version, and Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection (known as Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection in North America) for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2009. In 2006, Sega released the game on the Wii's Virtual Console. In 2010, it was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam.|$|E
5|$|Vertical {{broaching}} machines {{can be designed}} for push broaching, pull-down broaching, pull-up broaching, or surface broaching. Push {{broaching machines}} are similar to an arbor press with a guided ram; typical capacities are 5 to 50 tons. The two ram pull-down machine {{is the most common}} type of broaching machine. This style <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> the rams under the table. Pull-up machines have the ram above the table; they usually have more than one ram. Most surface broaching is done on a vertical machine.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lewis and Falsone {{investigate}} the execution-style shootings of Wilkie Collins and his wife, presumably {{in retaliation for}} Collins cooperating with police in the investigation and incarceration of Georgia Rae Mahoney, Luther's sister. They find Collins' young son Jack (Marc John Jefferies) hiding in a closet at the house, but he is too terrified to answer any of their questions. Falsone takes the Jack to a park, where they bond over their mutual love of cars, and Falsone teaches him how to hotwire a vehicle. More comfortable with the police, Jack tells Falsone that a man identifying himself as Robert on Collins' answering <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> the same voice as the killer. A disturbed Stivers recognizes the voice as belonging to Detective Robert Castleman (Lance Lewman). After Jack identifies Castleman in a lineup, Lewis and Falsone confront him with the evidence during questioning, pressuring Castleman to confess to the murder. Castleman said Georgia Rae Mahoney blackmailed him into killing Collins by threatening to reveal Castleman had been on Luther Mahoney's payroll.|$|E

5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of the}} machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback {{in the way that they}} handle visual output. Neither <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.|$|E

50|$|Multi-line slot <b>machines</b> <b>have</b> {{become more}} popular since the 1990s. These <b>machines</b> <b>have</b> {{more than one}} payline, meaning that visible symbols that are not aligned on the main {{horizontal}} may be considered for winning combinations. Reel slot <b>machines</b> commonly <b>have</b> three or five paylines, while video slot <b>machines</b> may <b>have</b> 9, 15, 25, or as many as 243 different paylines. Most video slot <b>machines</b> <b>have</b> a themed game, some of which feature graphics and music based on popular entertainers, motion pictures or TV programs (The Addams Family, I Dream of Jeannie, Happy Days, etc.) with a bonus round. Most accept variable numbers of credits to play, with 1 to 15 credits per line being typical. The higher the amount bet, the higher the payout will be if the player wins.|$|R

25|$|Free-motion machine {{embroidery}} can be time-consuming. Since {{a standard}} sewing <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> only one needle, {{the operator must}} pause to re-thread the machine manually for each subsequent color in a multi-color design. He or she must also manually trim and clean up loose or connecting threads after the design is completed.|$|E
25|$|Various {{breathing}} machines {{have been}} developed and used for assessment of breathing apparatus performance. ANSTI Test Systems Ltd (UK) has developed a testing machine that measures the inhalation and exhalation effort in using a regulator. Publishing results {{of the performance of}} regulators in the ANSTI test <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> resulted in big performance improvements.|$|E
25|$|By default MSX <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> {{hardcoded}} {{character set}} and keyboard return scan code handling algorithm. While MSX in overall has full application software compatibility, at the firmware (BIOS) level coupled with its hardware level, due to minor hardware differences, {{replacement of the}} BIOS with another from different PC may render incorrect scan code translations and thus incorrect behavior of the keyboard subsystem for the application software.|$|E

25|$|However, {{with only}} 4 registers, this <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> not nearly {{big enough to}} build a RASP that can execute the {{multiply}} algorithm as a program. No matter how big we build our finite state machine {{there will always be}} a program (including its parameters) which is larger. So by definition the bounded program machine that does not use unbounded encoding tricks such as Gödel numbers cannot be universal.|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} NPT set up, a small {{table-top}} device is used. A drop of capillary blood is obtained with an automated finger-prick, {{which is almost}} painless. This drop is placed on a disposable test strip with which the <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> been prepared. The resulting INR comes up on the display a few seconds later. A similar form of testing is used by people with diabetes for monitoring blood sugar levels, which is easily taught and routinely practiced.|$|E
25|$|The Z-machine at Sandia National Laboratory, a z-pinch device, {{can produce}} ion {{energies}} {{of interest to}} hydrogen–boron reactions, up to 300 keV. Non-equilibrium plasmas usually have an electron temperature higher than their ion temperature, but the plasma in the Z <b>machine</b> <b>has</b> a special, reverted non-equilibrium state, in which the ion temperature is 100 times higher than electron temperature. These data represent a new research field, and indicate that Bremsstrahlung losses could be in fact lower than previously expected in such a design.|$|E
