40|$|Purpose: Metabolic {{syndrome}} {{is a set}} of metabolic risk factors associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of a lifestyle modification program (Heart WATCH) geared toward reducing development of chronic disease in women deemed at risk for metabolic syndrome, prediabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. Methods: Our institution’s Heart WATCH program consists of screening sessions with a multidisciplinary team (physician/nurse, nutritionist and psychologist), a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>visits</b> with a nurse practitioner and weekly follow-up phone calls for a 14 -week period. Sociodemographic variables were obtained at initial visit. Biometric testing indices and self-reported clinical and behavioral health measures were recorded pre- and postintervention, and compared using paired t-tests or McNemar’s test as appropriate. Results: Heart WATCH enrolled 242 women from November 2006 to April 2014, and 193 (80...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of part-time versus full-time occlusion for treatment of amblyopia in children aged 7 - 12 years. Materials and Methods: Prospective interventional case series. One hundred children between 7 - 12 years of age with anisometropic (57), strabismic (25) and mixed (18) unilateral amblyopia were randomized (simple randomization) into four groups (25 each) to receive two hours, four hours, six hours or full-time occlusion therapy. Children were regularly followed up at six-weekly intervals for a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>visits.</b> Statistical Analysis: Intragroup visual improvement was analyzed using paired t-test while intergroup comparisons were done using ANOVA and unpaired t-test. Results: All four groups showed significant visual improvement after 18 weeks of occlusion therapy (P &# 60; 0. 001). Seventy-three (73 &#x 0025;) of the total 100 eyes responded to amblyopia therapy with 11 eyes (44 &#x 0025;), 17 eyes (68 &#x 0025;), 22 eyes (88 &#x 0025;) and 23 eyes (92 &#x 0025;) being amblyopia responders in the four groups respectively, with the least number of responders in the two hours group. In mild to moderate amblyopia (vision 20 / 30 to 20 / 80), {{there was no significant}} difference in visual outcome among the four groups (P = 0. 083). However, in severe amblyopia (vision 20 / 100 or worse), six hours (P = 0. 048) and full-time occlusion (P = 0. 027) treatment were significantly more effective than two hours occlusion. Conclusion: All grades of part-time occlusion are comparable to full-time occlusion in effectiveness of treatment for mild to moderate amblyopia in children between 7 - 12 years of age unlike in severe amblyopia, where six hours and full-time occlusion were more effective than two hours occlusion therapy...|$|E
40|$|Magister Public Health - MPHNamibia has {{recorded}} an ascending trend of maternal and neonatal mortality rate from 225 – 449 per 100 000 women from 1992 to 2006, and 38 – 46 per 1000 live births from 2000 to 2006 respectively. Kavango Region in Namibia is one {{among the top}} seven regions with high maternal and infant mortality rate. Most pregnant women in peri-urban areas of Rundu District in the Kavango region, where this study was conducted, attend ante-natal care services but do not use public health facilities for delivery. The health records from the public health facilities in Rundu, especially from Nkarapamwe clinic and Rundu Hospital maternity section, reveal that although the pregnant women comply with the required standard policy of a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> <b>visits</b> per pregnancy or more, over 40 % of women who attend public ante-natal care clinics do not deliver in the public health facility. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the perceptions of women regarding obstetric care in public health facilities in Kehemu settlement, a peri-urban area of Rundu town. The objectives of the study were to explore the perceptions of women on accessibility and acceptability of maternity services in public health facilities. An explorative qualitative study design using focus group discussion as a data collection method was conducted with three groups of women. A purposeful sampling procedure was used to select participants. Ethical approval was obtained from the High Degree Committee of University of the Western Cape and permission to use data from local facilities was obtained from the Ministry of Health and Social Services. Participants were recruited on their own free will and they signed an agreement on confidentiality. A data reduction process was used for analysis. The study findings indicate that women wish to use public health facilities for deliveries due to perceived benefits, in particular, safety for the mother and the baby and that those services are affordable. However a number of reasons hinder women to access services including the attitudes of health care providers, inability to afford transport at night and cultural influences. The study recommends that delivery services at the local clinic be expanded from eight to twenty-four hours; an information campaign on pregnancy and birth complications as well as the benefits of delivering in a public facility be implemented; refresher training for nurses to improve their caring practices during delivery should be considered and that a similar research be conducted with care providers to ascertain ways to improve maternity services in the public health facility in the area...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Antenatal {{counseling}} on breastfeeding and postnatal lactation {{support are}} likely to improve rates of exclusive breastfeeding. This descriptive study was undertaken to assess whether antenatal visits were utilized for promotion of exclusive breastfeeding {{in addition to the}} routine obstetric services. Methods This descriptive study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Pondicherry, India. Every third primigravida mother admitted in the maternity ward from June to December 2005 was recruited. Among these 144 primigravida mothers, 108 who had a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> antenatal <b>visits</b> ("booked") were included in the study. These 108 mothers were administered a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire on breastfeeding in the local language, Tamil, within 24 hours of giving birth. Appropriate flash cards with pictures were also used while administering the questionnaire. The awareness among mothers (both "counseled" and "not counseled") regarding health information pertaining to breastfeeding was assessed. Results Of the booked mothers, 21 % (n = 23) had received some antenatal counseling about breastfeeding while 79 % (n = 85) had not received any such counseling. Four percent had undergone breast examination during antenatal visits. Awareness related to breastfeeding among mothers in the "counseled" group was better than those in the "not counseled" group. Even in the "counseled" group, awareness among mothers with regard to correct breastfeeding technique and concept of continuing breastfeeding during illness in the baby was no different from those in the "not counseled" group. Conclusion Existing antenatal counseling on breastfeeding is inadequate in the population studied and needs to be strengthened. Informing all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding should be a priority during antenatal visits. </p...|$|R
