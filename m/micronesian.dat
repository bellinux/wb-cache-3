5|$|The Federated States of Micronesia is a {{collection}} of some 6,000 islands in the South Pacific ocean that includes approximately 100,000 people. The nation is composed of several states that each embody a prominent ethnic group amongst the island group, and lies approximately three-quarters of the way between Hawaii and Indonesia. After World War II, the <b>Micronesian</b> island chain became a United Nations trust territory administered by the United States. The Federated States of Micronesia became an independent country on 1986, but freely associates with the United States, which handles matters of defense. The Federated States of Micronesia sent its first delegation to participate in the Olympics approximately 14 years after it became a sovereign entity, sending three men and two women to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Between then and Beijing in 2008, three male and two female <b>Micronesian</b> athletes participating across three sports have appeared at the Olympics at every instance. Prior to Beijing, there had been no medalists from the Federated States of Micronesia; no medals were won by <b>Micronesian</b> athletes at the Beijing games either. Up to and including the Beijing Olympics, weightlifter Manuel Minginfel had been the flagbearer for Micronesia at every opening ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The Federated States of Micronesia sent {{a team of}} five {{athletes to}} compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The {{appearance}} of the delegation marked the third appearance by a <b>Micronesian</b> team at the Olympics since its debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Three male athletes (Jack Howard in athletics, Kerson Hadley in swimming and Manuel Minginfel in weightlifting) and two female athletes (Maria Ikelap in athletics and Debra Daniel in swimming) comprised the Olympic team. None of the track or swimming athletes advanced past the qualification round, and Minginfel placed second to last in his event. There {{has yet to be}} a medalist from the Federated States of Micronesia. At the ceremonies, Minginfel held the <b>Micronesian</b> flag in the opening ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year on Saipan, where the species' nesting behaviour has been studied. The peak breeding period seems to be from March to July. The species is monogamous. The nests are simple undecorated cups of casuarina needles, grasses, and vines. These are placed around 2.9m (between 1.5 and 6.5m) off {{the ground in a}} variety of trees including Casuarina, Guamia, Cynometra, Leucaena, and Citrus. The nests are predated by other bird species, specifically <b>Micronesian</b> starlings and collared kingfishers, as well as the introduced green tree skink.|$|E
50|$|After 1945, {{most of the}} Japanese {{settlers}} were repatriated to Japan, but {{the offspring}} of Japanese settlers and <b>Micronesians</b> were allowed to remain. These offspring usually identify themselves as <b>Micronesians</b> rather than Japanese, and constitute a sizeable minority {{in each of the}} territories' populace.|$|R
50|$|The Nauruans {{have two}} {{elements}} of their population: the native <b>Micronesians</b> and the Polynesians who had immigrated long before. The <b>Micronesians</b> are represented through coarse, dark hair; the Polynesians are lighter brown and have smoother, black hair. Through these two extremes the diverse transitions came to exist.|$|R

5|$|The Marshall Islands are a <b>Micronesian</b> island nation, {{located in}} the western Pacific Ocean midway between Hawaii and Australia. As of 2016 the nation had a {{population}} of approximately 53,000. The islands were under Spain's influence until their annexation by Germany in 1885. Japan occupied the Islands during World War I and formally annexed {{them as part of}} its postwar South Pacific Mandate. The Marshall Islands were placed under United States control in 1944. The islands granted independence in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association with the United States.|$|E
5|$|Though human {{activities}} {{have allowed the}} expansion of a few species, such as the barn swallow and European starling, they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species. Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of Melanesian, Polynesian, and <b>Micronesian</b> islands. Many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as threatened by BirdLife International and the IUCN in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The golden white-eye is a generalist, {{feeding on}} fruit, berries, and insects. Nectar forms {{part of the}} diet, and, along with the <b>Micronesian</b> myzomela and the bridled white-eye, the golden white-eye is a {{pollinator}} of some trees, albeit not one as important as these other species. Insects may be either gleaned from the bark of trees and from leaves, or caught in the air. Certain tree species are preferred as foraging habitat. The common forest tree Cynometra ramifolia is the most favoured tree and used more frequently than the equally common Guamia mariannae. There is considerable overlap between this species' foraging range {{and that of the}} bridled white-eye, but the golden white-eye is more generalised in its diet. Within the forest there is some partitioning of niche, with bridled white-eyes (and <b>Micronesian</b> myzomelas) feeding primarily in the forest canopy, and the golden white-eye feeding in both the canopy and understory of the forest, as well as a variety of smaller trees and bushes. It shares the understory with the rufous fantail, which has a different feeding technique. At a smaller scale additional partitioning occurs. The golden white-eye shows differences in the preferred microhabitat for obtaining insects, for example, feeding in dead leaves and branches, whereas the bridled white-eye prefers gleaning insects on live leaves. It is the most generalised of all the extant forest passerines on Saipan. It has been suggested that the versatility in diet and foraging technique is an adaptation to the challenges presented by typhoons, which can dramatically alter the structure of the forest.|$|E
5|$|Like other white-eyes, {{the golden}} white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the <b>Micronesian</b> myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E
5|$|The FSM {{government}} {{estimated that}} residents on Fais and Ulithi would need food rations for 3–6 {{months following the}} typhoon. Debris removal at Chuuk International Airport allowed for flights to the state to resume on April1. Emergency assistance across the nation was hampered by the remote and small nature of the islands it comprises. In many instances, communities can only be reached by boat. Further complicating issues was {{the large number of}} trees uprooted or downed by the storm which blocked numerous roads. Generators had been supplied to Ulithi and Fais by April6, allowing for water pumps to be activated and supply clean water. Power and water supply was gradually restored, although many remained without power by two weeks after the storm. On April6, a United States Coast Guard helicopter provided an aerial assessment of the islands affected. Damage assessment was difficult due to the many sparse islands affected across open ocean. Relief supplies stockpiled by the <b>Micronesian</b> Red Cross were distributed {{in the immediate aftermath of}} Maysak; however, these supplies were exhausted by April8. On April14, the FSM government sent a patrol boat to Chuuk, delivering rice, ramen noodles, and water.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} once called the golden honeyeater {{as it was}} {{considered}} to be a honeyeater (Meliphagidae). It was placed within the genus Ptilotis by French naturalist Émile Oustalet when he described the species in 1889; that genus is now considered defunct and is no longer used. It was subsequently moved into the genus Cleptornis, which had been provisionally established by Oustalet in case the species proved to be distinct. Behavioural and morphological characteristics led American ornithologist Harold Douglas Pratt, Jr., to suggest in 1987 that it was related to the white-eyes. Subsequent studies have supported the idea that this species was a white-eye. It is possibly most closely related to the <b>Micronesian</b> white-eyes of the genus Rukia, or the monotypic Bonin white-eye (Apalopteron), another species once placed with the honeyeaters and subsequently moved to the white-eyes. The golden white-eye has a long 10th primary feather (one of the flight feathers), unlike other white-eyes where that primary is reduced or absent, which has led to the alternative suggestion that it is basal (an early offshoot) among the white-eyes.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Minginfel was {{the only}} {{weightlifter}} at the Beijing Olympics who competed {{under the banner of}} the Federated States of Micronesia. He participated in the men's featherweight class, which includes athletes of 62kilograms and below. Born in Yap, Minginfel was 21 years old when he first competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Although he was unable to successfully lift any snatches at those games, Minginfel finished in his event when at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, at 25 years old. The <b>Micronesian</b> athlete was 29 years old {{when he returned to the}} Olympics for the third time in 2008. During the course of his event, which took place on August 11, Minginfel {{was the only}} Oceanian competing against 16 other athletes. While on the snatch phase, Minginfel successfully lifted 115kilograms on his first attempt and 120kilograms on his second attempt, but failed to lift 123kilograms on his third try. However, he succeeded in all of his clean and jerks, and successfully lifted 145kilograms; 150kilograms; then 155kilograms. His final score, which combines his highest lifted weight from the snatch and clean and jerk categories, was 275kilograms. Of the 12 athletes who finished the event, Minginfel ranked 11th ahead of Canadian weightlifter Jasvir Singh (266kilograms) and behind Henadzy Makhveyenia of Belarus (278kilograms). In comparison, gold medalist Zhang Xiangxiang of China lifted a combined total of 319kilograms.|$|E
