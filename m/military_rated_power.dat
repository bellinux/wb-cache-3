50|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, a {{wind turbine}} would ideally operate at its maximum efficiency for below <b>rated</b> <b>power.</b> Once <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> has been hit, {{the power is}} limited. This is for two reasons: ratings on the drivetrain equipment, such as the generator; and second to reduce the loads on the blades. An operating strategy for a wind turbine can thus be divided into a sub-rated-power component, and a rated-power component.|$|R

30|$|At t =  1  s, {{the load}} with 3 / 4 <b>rated</b> <b>power</b> is {{connected}} to the microgrid. At t =  3  s, the load decreases to 1 / 4 <b>rated</b> <b>power.</b> At t =  4.5  s, the load increases to the <b>rated</b> <b>power.</b> From Fig.  6 a, b, {{it can be seen that}} the ratio of active or reactive power output of DG 1 to that of DG 2 is about 1 / 2 whatever the active power or reactive power load changes. It can be seen from Fig.  6 c, the AC common bus voltage is always maintained at the rated value. Thus, it can be concluded that the variation of active or reactive load has little influence on the load sharing performance with the proposed droop control.|$|R
