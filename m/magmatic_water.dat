25|$|Back-arc basins are {{typically}} very long (several hundreds {{to thousands of}} kilometers) and relatively narrow (a few hundred kilometers). The restricted width of back-arc basins is probably because magmatic activity depends on water and induced mantle convection and these are both concentrated near the subduction zone.

50|$|According to Richard J. Schroeder and John B.

50|$|Magmatic fluids {{coming from}} the {{intrusive}} rock may also {{take part in the}} metamorphic reactions.

Water in equilibrium with igneous melts should bear the same isotopic signature for oxygen-18 and deuterium. Isotope data on hydrothermal solutions spatially associated with igneous intrusions should reflect this isotopic signature. However, isotopic studies of hydrothermal waters indicate that most bear the isotopic signature of meteoric <b>water.</b> Any <b>magmatic</b> <b>waters</b> in these hydrothermal solutions must have been swamped by the circulating meteoric groundwaters of the environment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Magmatic</b> <b>water</b> or {{juvenile}} water is water that exists within, and in equilibrium with, a magma or water-rich volatile fluids that {{are derived from}} a magma. This <b>magmatic</b> <b>water</b> is released to the atmosphere during a volcanic eruption. <b>Magmatic</b> <b>water</b> may also be released as hydrothermal fluids during the late stages of magmatic crystallization or solidification within the Earth's crust. The crystallization of hydroxyl bearing amphibole and mica minerals acts to contain part of the <b>magmatic</b> <b>water</b> within a solidified igneous rock. Ultimate sources of this <b>magmatic</b> <b>water</b> includes water and hydrous minerals in rocks melted during subduction as well as primordial water brought up from the deep mantle.|$|E
50|$|The {{water that}} issues from {{seafloor}} hydrothermal vents consists mostly of sea water {{drawn into the}} hydrothermal system close to the volcanic edifice through faults and porous sediments or volcanic strata, plus some <b>magmatic</b> <b>water</b> released by the upwelling magma. In terrestrial hydrothermal systems, the majority of water circulated within the fumarole and geyser systems is meteoric water plus ground water that has percolated down into the thermal system from the surface, but it also commonly contains some portion of metamorphic water, <b>magmatic</b> <b>water,</b> and sedimentary formational brine that is released by the magma. The proportion of each varies from location to location.|$|E
50|$|Most {{groundwater}} is meteoric water. Other forms {{normally do}} {{not play a}} significant role in the hydrologic cycle. Non-meteoric forms of groundwater are connate water and <b>magmatic</b> <b>water,</b> also termed juvenile water. Connate water is trapped in rock strata at the time of formation. Because rock containing connate water is typically formed from ocean sediments, connate water is normally saline. <b>Magmatic</b> <b>water</b> rises from great depth accompanying magma intrusion and affects mineralogy.

The deposits consist predominantly of sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena), sulfosalts of As and Sb, and a {{diverse range of}} Au-Ag tellurides. The igneous host rocks have undergone mild, pervasive propylitic alteration, whereas immediately adjacent to the veins the wall- rock alteration assemblages consist of quartz, sericite, K feldspar, calcite, and pyrite. Fluid inclusion, stable isotope, and thermodynamic {{data suggest that the}} majority of the mineralization and hydrothermal alteration in these deposits was caused by loci-salinity (0 - 5 wt % NaCl equiv), medium- temperature (200 degrees- 300 degrees C), near-neutral (pH = 5 - 6) fluids, which underwent occasional boiling. The fluid inclusion and stable isotope data support a model in which a metal-bearing, magmatic fluid was exsolved from a crystallizing calc-alkaline melt and ascended to higher levels in the crust, undergoing some isotopic exchange with surrounding sedimentary rocks but limited mixing with ground waters, Although the deposits in this part of the Romanian Carpathians exhibit many of the geologic characteristics of classic low-sulfidation, volcanic-hosted, Au-Ag, epithermal deposits, they seem to have formed from essentially <b>magmatic</b> <b>waters,</b> and there is little evidence for the incorporation of meteoric fluids into the hydrothermal system...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to marshal the {{evidence}} and try to build a case that (1) shallow (1 to 7 km) circulation of surface waters in the Earth's crust is an extremely widespread and common phenomenon in areas of igneous activity and (2) deep (10 to 15 km) circulation of surface waters can occur in certain favorable geological situations, particularly in rift zones and areas of extensional tectonics. It is shown that very large amounts of water may interact with the rocks in such zones and that this can take place at temperatures high enough for melting and metamorphism to occur. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope studies have proven to be very useful in establishing the characteristics of such deeply circulating hydrothermal systems and in determining the origins of the aqueous fluids involved in producing granitic and rhyolitic magmas in such environments. This is mainly because oxygen- 18 and deuterium are constituents of the H_ 2 O molecule itself, and thus stable isotope signatures are by far the best way to characterize hydrothermal fluids of different origins. These conclusions are most clear-cut when low- ^(18) O, low-D meteoric waters are involved in the isotopic exchange processes, but ocean waters, sedimentary formation waters, metamorphic dehydration <b>waters,</b> and <b>magmatic</b> <b>waters</b> can also be distinguished from each other in favorable circumstances. ...|$|R

Halogen concentrations {{suggest that the}} fumarolic condensates represent mostly magmatic fluids, but that the hot springs are a mixture between magmatic fluids and meteoric water with some presence of seawater. The magmatic component is best preserved in the high-temperature fumaroles collected in 1998 and has a 129 I/I ratio of 756 ± 47 × 10 − 15. This 129 I/I ratio yields an iodine age of 15.5 ± 1.5 Ma, which is compatible with derivation of iodine from subducted marine sediments in this region. Ratios of I/Cl, and Br/Cl in the fumaroles also indicate that halides in the magmatic component were mainly derived from marine sediments subducted in the Nankai Trough. These observations suggest that recycling of subducted sediments is an active source of halides in the Satsuma-Iwojima volcanic system. The comparison of 129 I/I ratios obtained from fumaroles over the sampling period shows that a recent meteoric component was present in 1993, but not in 1998. This observation might reflect reorganization of the fumarolic system during this period, which expelled the more recent meteoric water from the fumarolic system after 1993. The acid hot springs on the flanks of the volcano maintain a 129 I isotopic signature indicative of substantial dilution of <b>magmatic</b> <b>waters</b> by mixing with old meteoric water and seawater. Fumarolic gases and hot spring waters were also analyzed for 36 Cl/Cl, but the measured ratios were at, or below, the detection limit of AMS, also indicating that recent contributions of Cl from meteoric water are small in the fumaroles and coastal hot springs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Dickite and {{kaolinite}} are polymorphs of AI 4 (Si 401 o) (OH) 8. Dickite traditionally isregarded as hydrothermal, {{based on}} field and laboratory evidence. Dickite and kaolinite occur in cavities in phylloid algal imestones, in interstices of biocalcarenites and sandstones, and along joints, fractures, and stylolites, in Pennsylvanian rocks exposed throughout 9600 {{square miles of}} southeastern Kansas. The stratigraphic interval of approximately 1100 ft extends from the Fort Scott Limestone (Desmoine-sian) through the Lecompton Limestone (Virgilian). The best crystallized ickites are found in porous algal imestones as pockets of glistening white powder composed of well developed pseudohexagonal plates up to 40 /x across. Very well crystallized kaolinites occur similarly, except he crystals are much smaller. Less well crystallized ickites and b-axis disordered kaolinites occur in less porous rocks. Variations in crystal size and morphological development are genetically significant. Dickite-kaolinite distribution is related to: (1) stratigraphic alternation of limestones and im-pervious hales; (2) gentle, westward regional dip; (3) thick, mound-like buildups of highly porous algal limestones, miles in length and width; (4) igneous intrusions (early Tertiary?) in Woodson and Wilson counties. Dickite is confined to an elliptical area 125 miles long northeast-southwest, x ending 60 miles eastward from the intrusions. Dickite is associated preferentially with porous algal mounds. Kaolinite occurs in less porous rocks within the dickite area, and also is abundant well beyond. Heated groundwaters, possibly mixed with <b>magmatic</b> <b>waters,</b> moved readily up-dip and along strike outward from the intrusions through the conduit-like algal mounds; dickite was deposited from such solutions. Where water movement was restricted or where water had travelled tens of miles from the intrusions, water temperature f ll below the limit for dickite crystallization, and kaolinite precipitated instead.

The Kanmantoo Group in the Strathalbyn-Kanmantoo-Callington areas has been regionally metamorphosed {{and at least}} three deformations have affected the original greywacke - shale sediments to reach mid-amphibolite facies during the Delamerian orogeny. The metamorphic assemblages indicate a temperature of between 500 and 600 degC and pressures between 1. 8 and 3. 8 kb. The presence of andalusite and fibrolite suggests pressures close to the upper value. Two deformations at quartz-muscovite-biotite grade followed, producing non-penetrative crenulation cleavages. Evidence suggests that base metals {{were present in the}} schists at a very early stage during sedimentation or introduced at least in the earliest stages of metamorphism, and to have been localized during the first deformation. Sulphur isotope ratios of the sulphides are compatible with a hydrothermal origin and derivation from metamorphic fluids which had differing mixtures of meteoric, sea and possibly <b>magmatic</b> <b>waters.</b> Wide variations in isotope values between mineralization and pyritic schists and the Nairne Pyrite Formation suggest that the Cu-Pb-Zn was not derived from these pyritic horizons. P-T conditions of sulphide recrystallization as derived from sphalerite barometry and sulphur isotopes indicate a temperature near 420 degC and a pressure of 4. 4 (+/- 0. 5) kb. The pressure is slightly higher than that educed by silicate stabilities. The andalusite schist is closely related to mineralization, not as a major source, but is structurally related being the lithology where folding and shearing were favourable for mineralization. It is concluded that the mineralization is epigenetic, resulting from mobilisation of disseminated sulphides in the country rocks by hydrothermal fluids into shear zones and tight folds. Thesis (B.

This study examined in detail the relationship between magmatism and borate mineralisation in two of these basins (Ernet and Kirka).;The magmatism comprised an Early Miocene K-rich acid phase, represented by granite, ignimbrite, rhyolite and dacite, and a more mafic K-rich, Middle - Late Miocene phase, represented by shoshonite and latite. Information from field observations, mineralogy, isotopic dates, immobile element concentrations and biotite compositions indicate that acid magmatism in Ernet and Kirka Basins was closely related in both space and time to the deposition of the borate-host sediments, whilst mafic volcanism occurred later.;The mineralogical and geochemical composition of the borate-host sediments was strongly influenced by the post-depositional modification of rhyolitic, ignimbritic and granitic-derived material in a saline, alkaline environment. The result {{of the interaction between}} saline, alkaline waters and dominantly acid igneous products, was the generation of an authigenic mineral assemblage comprising mainly calcite, dolomite, borate, trioctahedral smectite and K-feldspar. Trioctahedral smectite, dolomite and K-feldspar, together with elevated concentrations of As, Sr and Li, correlate particularly well with borate mineralisation.;The geochemistry of the Early Miocene acid igneous rocks suggests that acid magmatism represented a likely source for B and Li, and probably also for As and Sr. Possible mechanisms for the transfer of B and other elements from an igneous source to the basin sediments include; transfer by igneous-driven geothermal fluids, rich in B as a result of hydrothermal leaching and contributions from <b>magmatic</b> <b>waters</b> and gases, and the breakdown of igneous material in saline, alkaline lakes.

The isotopic composition of the water in equilibrium with hydrothermal alteration minerals is consistent with highly evaporated lacustrine <b>waters</b> mixed with <b>magmatic</b> <b>waters</b> or vapor separated from magmatic fluids, however, sulfur isotopes and fluid inclusions data support the lacustrine-magmatic water hypothesis. Milpillas porphyry copper deposit in the Cananea Mining District, yielded a crystallization age of 63. 9 ± 1. 3 Ma. Two Re-Os molybdenite ages yielded an identical age of 63. 1 ± 0. 4 Ma, Suggesting a restricted period of mineralization. Re-Os data indicate that mineralization in Cananea District, spanned ~ 4 m. y. in three discrete pulses at ~ 59 Ma, ~ 61 Ma and ~ 63 Ma. El Arco porphyry copper deposit, Baja California, Mexico, yielded a Middle Jurassic crystallization age (U-Pb) of 164. 7 ± 6. 7 Ma and a Re-Os mineralization age of 164. 1 ± 0. 4 Ma and not ~ 100 Ma as previously determinated. Porphyry copper deposits in Mexico range in age from 164 Ma to 54 Ma and the mineralization in Sonora state occurred in two different periods, but magmatism overlaps in space and time...|$|R
40|$|Gedongsongo {{surface manifestations}} of the Ungaran {{geothermal}} prospect in Central Java, Indonesia, have high temperature properties, 72 - 870 C, 2 – 6 pH and 770 ppm of chloride. The stable isotopic ratios of δ 18 O and δD of two adjacent manifestations show a slightly different enrichment. The western part reveals a more <b>magmatic</b> <b>water</b> influence {{than those of the}} eastern one. This is supported by the presence of relic manifestations as most occurs in the eastern part; whereas active fumaroles and steaming ground exist at western part...|$|E
40|$|The Cu/(Cu+Ni) ratios {{associated}} with the Basal Gabbro also display the vertical reverse fractionation trend, supporting the supercooled margin model. The disseminated sulphides in the lowermost units, are regarded as being the result of sulphur saturation induced by contamination from the dolomitic and quartzitic xenoliths. This is supported by isotope data which indicate {{the high degree of}} contamination in the lowermost units of the Complex. The results of this study are used to propose a model for the petrogenesis and metallogenesis of the Uitkomst Complex, whereby the Complex is closely related to the Bushveld Complex. The Basal Gabbro, as supported by its chemistry and style of mineralisation (Cu-rich), represents a supercooled margin to the lowermost units of the Uitkomst Complex, which stoped upwards into the surrounding sediments, assimilating the country rock xenoliths, and precipitating sulphides. Following this was a period in which large quantities of magma moved laterally through the system before the magma flow waned, and closed system crystallisation ensued. As the body cooled, the primarily <b>magmatic</b> <b>water</b> was superceded by the hydrothermal <b>magmatic</b> <b>water</b> released from the xenoliths, and later by geothermally driven circulating meteoric water, producing the extensive alteration. This alteration was accompanied by considerable stress and the development of fractures and shears. Finally the Complex was itself intruded by diabase sills and later dolerite dykes. ...|$|E
40|$|The Liyuan {{gold deposit}} is hosted within Archean {{basement}} metamorphic rocks {{and controlled by}} the NNE-trending faults in the central North China Craton. The ore-forming processes {{can be divided into}} three stages (early, middle, and late). Three types of primary fluid inclusions (FIs) are identified in the Liyuan, including pure carbonic, carbonic-aqueous, and aqueous inclusions. The primary FIs of three stages are mainly homogenized at temperatures of 318 – 408 °C, 201 – 329 °C, and 136 – 229 °C, with salinities of 2. 1 – 8. 9, 0. 5 – 12. 4, and 0. 4 – 6. 3 [*]wt. % NaCl equivalent, respectively. The main Au mineralization is related to the middle stage, and water-rock interaction caused rapid precipitation of gold in this stage. The initial ore-forming fluids were likely <b>magmatic</b> <b>water</b> or metamorphic fluid and mixed with meteoric water at later stages. Due to the lack of granite body at the present mining levels, we speculate that it was <b>magmatic</b> <b>water</b> that might have been exsolved from a concealed granite body at greater depth or it was metamorphic fluid that was directly transported from depth via deep faults. Based on all the available geological and geochemical evidence, we suggest that the Liyuan deposit belongs to orogenic gold deposit that located in the interior North China Craton...|$|E
40|$|The Ngatamariki Geothermal Field {{is located}} 20 km north of Taupo in the Taupo Volcanic Zone {{and has a}} {{boundary}} of 12 km² as delineated by magneto-telluric surveys (Urzua 2008). Rhyolitic deposits, derived from the Maroa Volcanic Centre, dominate the geology of the area with the 186 AD (Wilson et al. 2009) Taupo pumice mantling stream valleys in the area. The majority of thermal features at Ngatamariki are located along the Orakonui Stream on the western boundary of the field; the stream area is dominated by a 50 x 30 m geothermal pool filling a hydrothermal eruption crater. This crater was formed during a hydrothermal eruption in 1948, with a subsequent eruption in April 2005. Orakei Korako is located 7 km north of Ngatamariki and {{has one of the}} largest collections of thermal features in New Zealand. The geology at Orakei Korako is similar to Ngatamariki, but the area is dominated by a series of south-west trending normal faults which create sinter terraces on the eastern bank of Lake Ohakuri. Water samples from springs and wells at Ngatamariki and Orakei Korako were taken to assess the nature of both fields. Spring waters at Ngatamariki have chloride contents of 56 to 647 mg/l with deep waters from wells ranging from 1183 to 1574 mg/l. This variation is caused by mixing of deep waters with a steam heated groundwater, above clay caps within the reservoir. Stable isotopic results (δ¹⁸O and δD) suggest that reservoir waters are meteoric <b>waters</b> mixed with <b>magmatic</b> (andesitic) <b>water</b> at Ngatamariki. Reservoir water chemistry at Orakei Korako exhibits low chloride contents, which is anomalous in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Chloride content in well and spring waters is similar ranging from 546 to 147 mg/l, due to mixing of reservoir fluids with a ‘hot water’ diluent at depth. Isotopic compositions of spring waters suggest that they are meteoric waters which mix with <b>magmatic</b> (rhyolitic) <b>water,</b> more enriched in δ¹⁸O and δD than ‘andesitic’ water. Relationships between major ion concentrations and known subsurface geology suggest there is no hydraulic connection between the two fields...|$|R
30|$|KML (1999 a) built a hydrogeological {{geothermal}} {{model for}} the Mt. Sabalan volcanic complex based on multi-disciplinary combination of geological, geochemical and geophysical data. The heat source, exploration wells, meteoric waters, deeply circulated meteoric <b>waters,</b> <b>magmatic</b> volatiles and condensates are illustrated. Based on this model, one may explain that a large residual magma mass is shown to underlie the Sabalan caldera complex with intrusive apophyses developing upwards from the magma mass to shallow depths controlled by caldera ring-faults. KML (1999 a) further explained that the thermal features might all have a common origin within the Sabalan caldera.|$|R
40|$|Developing {{electrical}} power from geothermal energy Utah State Universityally requires using wells to convey hot water or steam from deep underground {{to the ground}} surface. Energy production potential is greatest in areas of tectonic and volcanic activity. Even in those areas however, wells must tap subsurface locations that can sustainably provide an adequate rate of sufficiently high temperature fluid. Intersecting such locations is challenging. The process involves hydrothermal, geophysical, <b>magmatic,</b> hydrogeologic, and <b>water</b> supply evaluations. For a South American site, this involved a large multi-disciplinary team. The team recommended five general locations and then refined those based upon access, constructability, avalanche, and flood vulnerability...|$|R
