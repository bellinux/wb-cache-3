5|$|Flora Duffy {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in the Beijing Olympics based on her performance in the qualification competitions. Participating on the August 18 event, Duffy competed in the women's triathlon. Duffy swam the 1.5kilometers portion of the distance in 20:26minutes, ranking 41st out of 55 in that portion of the event, behind Luxembourg's Liz May (40th) by under a second and ahead of Hungary's Zita Szabó by two seconds. In this portion of the event, Duffy was 37 seconds behind the United States' Laura Bennett, who finished the swimming portion of the event first at 19:49. Duffy took 33 seconds to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> swim to cycling, the second part of the event, tying with Mak So Ning of Hong Kong at 52nd place out of 55. Duffy, however, was lapped on the bike leg and was disqualified before reaching the running portion or completing the event.|$|E

25|$|After {{retiring}} as {{a player}} in 1947, Harmon returned to {{his career as a}} sports broadcaster, becoming one of the first and most successful athletes to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> player to broadcaster. Harmon attributed his successful career in radio and television to the early education he received from his drama teacher, Mary Gorrell, at Horace Mann high school. During the 1948 season, he broadcast Rams' games for KFI radio in Los Angeles. In the late 1940s, he was the play-by-play announcer for NBC on the first television broadcast of a Rose Bowl Game. From approximately 1950 to 1962, Harmon worked as a sportscaster for the CBS network. He also handled the nightly sport report on KTLA television in Los Angeles from 1958 to 1964.|$|E
25|$|After the Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj ("Armed Forces Delegation for Homeland") was disbanded, another post-AK {{resistance}} organisation was formed, called Wolność i Niezawisłość ("Freedom and Sovereignty"). Its {{primary goal}} was not combat - Wolność i Niezawisłość (WiN) {{was more concerned}} with helping former AK soldiers <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> a life as partisans to that of civilians. Continued secrecy and conspiracy were necessary {{in light of the}} increasing persecution of AK veterans by the communist government. WiN was, however, much in need of funds to pay for false documents and to provide resources for the partisans, many of whom had lost their homes and entire life-savings in the war. Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, WiN was far from efficient. A significant victory for the NKVD and the newly created Polish secret police, Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (UB), came {{in the second half of}} 1945, when they managed to convince several leaders of WiN that they truly wanted to offer amnesty to AK members. Within a few months, intelligence gathered by the authorities led to thousands more arrests. The primary period of WiN activity lasted until 1947. The organisation finally disbanded in 1952.|$|E

500|$|Another {{important}} {{policy change}} {{came in the}} field of education. In 1970, the government made Malay the medium of instruction for primary, secondary, and tertiary education, replacing English. Although government funding for the Chinese and Tamil education streams continued, many non-Malays considered this new policy to be [...] "the most discriminatory" [...] thus far. The government's rationale was that this would provide better educational opportunities for the Malays, especially those who formerly had to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> Malay-medium primary and secondary schools to English-medium universities. It was also argued that uniting students under one language would provide for greater racial harmony, while indirectly underscoring the [...] "Malay nature of the state".|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer in 1927—the first feature-length film with some audible dialog—sound films, or talkies as they became nicknamed, were all the rage. The {{transition}} from silent to sound panicked many—if not all—involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents or simply because of their refusal {{to make the transition}} to talkies. Many studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last studio to switch over to sound. The Hollywood Revue of 1929 (1929) was one of the studio's first all-talking films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars' ability to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> silent to sound. Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song [...] "Got a Feeling for You" [...] during the film's first act.|$|E

2500|$|Cloud {{condensation}} nuclei or CCNs (also {{known as}} cloud seeds) are small particles typically 0.2 µm, or 1/100th {{the size of}} a cloud droplet [...] on which water vapor condenses. Water requires a non-gaseous surface to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> a vapour to a liquid; this process is called condensation. In the atmosphere, this surface presents itself as tiny solid or liquid particles called CCNs. When no CCNs are present, water vapour can be supercooled at about −13°C (8°F) for 5–6 hours before droplets spontaneously form (this is the basis of the cloud chamber for detecting subatomic particles). In above freezing temperatures the air would have to be supersaturated to around 400% before the droplets could form.|$|E

2500|$|Considering {{walking with}} the {{inverted}} pendulum model, {{one can predict}} maximum attainable walking speed with the Froude number, F = v^2 / lg, where v^2 = velocity squared, l = leg length, and g= gravity. [...] The Froude number is a dimensionless value representing the ratio of Centripetal force to Gravitational force during walking. [...] If the body {{is viewed as a}} mass moving through a circular arc centered over the foot, the theoretical maximum Froude number is 1.0, where centripetal and gravitational forces are equal. [...] At a number greater than 1.0, the gravitational force would not be strong enough to hold the body in a horizontal plane and the foot would miss the ground.
