5000|$|Here we see Jordaens {{with his}} wife Catherine van Noort, his eldest child Elizabeth and a servant. The {{painting}} has been dated around 1621-22 because Elizabeth appears to be about 4 years old and {{she was born in}} 1617. [...] Everyone in the painting is looking out at the viewer as if to invite them in to join the group. Jardin d'amour was an ancient tradition that Jordaens has represented in his family portrait. We see that he has also thrown a fair amount of symbolism into the painting to help give it meaning. [...] "The intertwined vines behind the couple symbolize the inseparability of husband and wife." [...] Elizabeth is holding fruit in her hand which is symbolic of love and the flowers she has in her basket reflect innocence and purity." [...] In the upper left there is a perched parrot which depicts marital fidelity. Another animal located in the lower right is a dog representing faithfulness and trust."This {{is one of the first}} examples of RA-like findings in Dutch art. Little evidence of rheumatoid arthritis like disease was noted in art or skeletal remains before the 17th century in Europe and Northern Africa.

40|$|Our novel {{prosthetic}} hand {{is controlled}} by extrinsic flexor muscles and tendons of the <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> joints. The hand uses tendon-activated pneumatic (TAP) control and has provided most subjects, including amputees and those with congenital limb absence, control of multiple fingers of the hand. The TAP hand restores a degree of natural control over force, duration, and coordination of multiple finger movements. An operable hand will be demonstrated. BACKGROUN...|$|E

30|$|Brachymetacarpia is a {{congenital}} condition {{characterized by}} undergrowth of the metacarpal bone {{in the hand}} [1]. This {{may be caused by}} idiopathic early closure of the epiphyseal plate [2]. Typically, when one digit is affected, the patient may complain that the “knuckle is missing” due to severe recession of the affected metacarpal [3]. However, there are typically no significant functional issues although this recessed position may restrict <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> joint (MPJ) flexion [3]. Patients who pursue treatment for brachymetacarpia are likely seeking improvement in the cosmesis of their hand [2, 3].|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: An {{estimated}} 30 - 50 % {{of essential}} tremor diagnoses are incorrect, {{and the true}} diagnosis in those patients is often Parkinson’s disease or other tremor disorders. There are general statements about the tremor in these essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, but published data on the more subtle characteristics of tremor are surprisingly limited. Postural tremor may occur in both disorders, adding to the difficulty. There are several anecdotal impressions regarding specific features of postural tremor in essential tremor vs. Parkinson’s disease, including joint distribution (e. g., phalanges, <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> joints, wrist), tremor directionality (e. g., flexion-extension vs. pronation-supination), and presence of intention tremor. However, there is little data to support these impressions. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients (essential tremor, 50 Parkinson’s disease) underwent detailed videotaped neurological examinations. Arm tremor was rated by a movement disorder neurologist who assessed severity and directionality across multiple joints. Results: During sustained arm extension, essential tremor patients exhibited more wrist than <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> and phalangeal joint tremor than did Parkinson’s disease patients (p< 0. 001), and more wrist flexion-extension tremor than wrist pronation-supination tremor (p< 0. 001). During the finger-nose-finger maneuver, intention tremor was present in approximately one in four (28 %) essential tremor patients vs. virtually none (4 %) of the Parkinson’s patients (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: We evaluated the location, severity, and directionality of postural tremor in essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, {{and the presence of}} intention tremor, observing several clinical differences. We hope that detailed phenomenological data on tremor in essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease will help practicing physicians delineate the two diseases...|$|E
40|$|A hand injury {{occurred}} at a U. S. facility in 1985 involving a pointed shaft (similar to a meat thermometer) that a worker was using to remove scrap solid plutonium from a plastic bottle. The worker punctured his right index finger on the palm side at the <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> joint. The wound was not through-and- through, although it was deep. The puncture wound resulted in deposition of ~ 48 kBq of alpha activity from the weapons-grade plutonium mixture with a nominal 12 to 1 Pu-alpha to {sup 241 }Am-alpha ratio. This case clearly showed that DTPA was very effective for decorporation of plutonium and americium. The case is a model for management of wounds contaminated with transuranics: (1) a team approach for dealing {{with all of the}} issues surrounding the incident, including the psychological, (2) early surgical intervention for foreign-body removal, (3) wound irrigation with DTPA solution, and (4) early and prolonged DTPA administration based upon bioassay and in vivo dosimetry...|$|E
30|$|Transverse {{and short}} oblique {{metacarpal}} fractures may be splinted with intramedullary wires [28 – 37]. Flexible bent intramedullary fascicular wires {{may be used}} to support oblique fractures. In a study of 21 metacarpal fractures, a J-shaped nail formed from a curved 2.0 -mm-diameter Kirschner wire bent sharply at the proximal end was found to be useful in neck or transverse shaft fractures of the metacarpals without concomitant injuries such as severe soft tissue damage [31]. A recent uncontrolled retrospective consecutive study of 22 metacarpal fractures suggested that transcutaneous intramedullary wire fixation of oblique extra-articular metacarpal shaft fracture wires achieves good results and has few complications [36]. In a study of 52 consecutive closed, displaced, extra-articular metacarpal fractures, results of intramedullary nail (IMN) fixation were compared with those of plate–screw (PS) fixation. No significant differences in clinical outcomes were found, but the incidences of loss of reduction, penetration to the <b>metacarpal–phalangeal</b> joint, and secondary surgery for hardware removal in the operating room were much higher in the IMN group [37].|$|E
40|$|Metastasis {{may occur}} in any bone but more {{commonly}} {{occurs in the}} spine, pelvis, or other axial bones. Metastasis in peripheral bones located distal to the elbow or knee, so-called acrometastasis, is rare. Although the mechanism of acrometastasis development is not completely understood, it {{is thought to be}} the result of a massive dissemination of cancer cells; thus the prognosis of patients with acrometastasis is relatively poor. Here, we report the case of renal pelvic cancer with multiple acrometastases in both the upper and lower extremities without axial bone metastasis in a 68 -year-old man. After two regimens of chemotherapy, he suffered from pain on his wrist and ankle and swelling and hemorrhage of his toe. He had no axial bone metastasis by CT but was diagnosed with multiple acrometastases by plain radiographs. Radiation therapy and disarticulation of the left big toe at the <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> joint were performed and his pain and hemorrhage were successfully controlled. Although acrometastasis from renal pelvic cancer is very rare, we should recognize that acrometastasis might occur which exists outside of the CT scanning field...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{exercise}} {{may induce}} osteoarthritis (OA), or degeneration, of articular cartilage, {{which is a}} leading cause of lameness and decreased use in horses. The purposes of this study were to utilize a sheep model {{to determine the effects of}} circular and linear exercise on the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of articular cartilage in the <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> (MCP) joint and to evaluate biochemical changes in serum and synovial fluid compared to non-exercised control lambs. Twenty lambs were randomly assigned to three groups: circular exercise (C, 8. 5 m diameter; n = 8), straight-line exercise (S, treadmill; n = 8) and non-exercised control (CON, n = 4). Lambs (C and S) were exercised at 1. 3 m/s over a 6 - to 8 -wk period. Serum and synovial fluid (SF) from the MCP joint was collected throughout the study. Upon euthanasia, MCP joints were collected and fixed for gross morphology and histological analysis. Serum was analyzed for total protein (STP), collagen Type II cleavage fragments (C 2 C) and lysyl oxidase (LOX) activity. Synovial fluid was analyzed for total protein (SFTP) and LOX activity for each MCP separately...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether and how hand shaping was affected by the presence of a distractor object adjacent to the tobe- grasped object. Twenty subjects were requested to reach towards and grasp a ‘convex’ or a ‘concave’ object in the presence or absence of a distractor object either of the same or different shape than the target object. Flexion/extension at the <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal joints of all digits, and abduction angle between digits were measured by resistive sensors embedded in a glove. The results indicate robust interference effects at the level of reach duration and the extent of fingers’ abduction angles together with changes at the level of a single joint for the thumb. No distractor effects on individual fingers’ joints except for the MCP of the middle and little fingers were found. These findings suggest that the presence of distractor object affects hand shaping in terms of fingers’ abduction angles, but not at the level of ‘shape dependent’ fingers’ angular excursions. Furthermore, they support the importance of the thumb for the guidance of selective reach-to-grasp movements. We discuss these results in the context of current theories proposed to explain the object selection processes underlying the control of hand action...|$|E
40|$|Objects can be grasped {{in several}} ways due to their {{physical}} properties, the context surrounding the object, and {{the goal of the}} grasping agent. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether the prior-to-contact grasping kinematics of the same object vary as a result of different goals of the person grasping it. Subjects were requested to reach toward and grasp a bottle filled with water, and then complete one of the following tasks: (1) Grasp it without performing any subsequent action; (2) Lift and throw it; (3) Pour the water into a container; (4) Place it accurately on a target area; (5) Pass it to another person. We measured the angular excursions at both <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> (mcp) and proximal interphalangeal (pip) joints of all digits, and abduction angles of adjacent digit pairs by means of resistive sensors embedded in a glove. The results showed that the presence and the nature of the task to be performed following grasping affect the positioning of the fingers during the reaching phase. We contend that a one-to-one association between a sensory stimulus and a motor response does not capture all the aspects involved in grasping. The theoretical approach within which we frame our discussion considers internal models of anticipatory control which may provide a suitable explanation of our results...|$|E
40|$|Six {{variations}} of opponensplasty were biomechanically studied {{to determine if}} there is {{a significant difference in the}} amount of opposition produced by altering the insertion site of the tendon transfer while keeping the tendon source and pulley location constant. Five cadaveric arms were used to simulate six described insertion sites for opponensplasty tendon transfers. The arms were mounted through the ulna onto a specially designed stand. The stand was equipped with a calibrated stylus which could be turned 90 ° in order to accurately measure points in X, Y, and Z planes. <b>Metacarpal–phalangeal</b> flexion and thumb abduction were measured before and after application of a 550 -g load. Axial rotation (pronation) was mathematically calculated using reference points on the thumb which were measured with the stylus before and after application of the load. The Bunnell transfer insertion site provided the greatest amount of palmar abduction, the Brand transfer insertion site the greatest metacarpophalangeal flexion, and the Royle transfer insertion site the greatest rotation. Although each of these transfers produced the greatest motion in one plane, they performed relatively poorly in the other two. The Riordan transfer insertion site into the extensor pollicis longus in line with the abductor pollicis brevis was, in our study, the overall best transfer, providing the second greatest change in motion in each of the three planes measured...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although {{previous}} studies have been performed on cartilage explant cultures, the generalized dynamics of cartilage metabolism after extraction from the host are still poorly understood {{due to differences in}} the experimental setups across studies, which in turn prevent building a complete picture. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the response of cartilage to the trauma sustained during extraction and determined the time needed for the cartilage to stabilize. Explants were extracted aseptically from bovine <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> joints and cultured for up to 17 days. RESULTS: The cell viability, cell number, proteoglycan content, and collagen content of the harvested explants were analyzed at 0, 2, 10, and 17 days after explantation. A high percentage of the cartilage explants were found to be viable. The cell density initially increased significantly but stabilized after two days. The proteoglycan content decreased gradually over time, but it did not decrease to a significant level due to leakage through the distorted peripheral collagen network and into the bathing medium. The collagen content remained stable for most of the culture period until it dropped abruptly on day 17. CONCLUSION: Overall, the tested cartilage explants were sustainable over long-term culture. They were most stable from day 2 to day 10. The degradation of the collagen on day 17 did not reach diseased levels, but it indicated the potential of the cultures to develop into degenerated cartilage. These findings have implications for the application of cartilage explants in pathophysiological fields...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{technique}} and protocols of cryopreservation of articular cartilage, a study was carried out to assess the effects of rapid cooling on the intact articular cartilage. Cartilage slices with a thickness ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 5 mm taken from bovine <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> joints were subjected to rapid cooling by immersing them in liquid nitrogen with and without treatment of the VS 55 cryoprotective agent (CPA). The ultrastructure, chondrocyte viability, swelling property, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content were then examined before and after cryopreservation to give qualitative and quantitative evaluation on the functional state of both chondrocytes and extracellular matrix. The transmission electron microscopy study demonstrated that damage to chondrocytes without CPA was far more pronounced than those with VS 55 protection while {{the structure of the}} extracellular matrix altered little in either group. The cell viability assay showed that although the exposure to VS 55 led to about 36 % chondrocytes losing membrane integrity, the VS 55 could provide protection to chondrocytes during rapid cooling and thawing, with approximately 51 % of the cells having survived rapid cooling compared to fewer than 5 % in the absence of CPA. There {{were no significant differences in}} degrees of swelling or the GAG contents of cartilage slices after cryopreservation indicating rapid freezing caused little damage to the matrix. Future research activities include searching improved CPA formulation, optimising the treatment protocol and investigating the long-term effects of rapid cooling on articular cartilage...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} how hand shaping {{responds to}} a perturbation of object shape. In blocked trials (80 % of total), subjects {{were instructed to}} reach, to grasp and lift a concave or a convex object. In perturbed trials (20 % of total), a rotating device allowed for the rapid change from the concave to the convex object or vice versa. In this situation subjects grasped the last presented object. Flexion/extension at the <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> and proximal interphalangeal joints of all digits was measured by resistive sensors embedded in a glove. In the blocked condition we found that most joints of the fingers were modulated {{by the type of}} the to-be-grasped object during the reach. When object shape was perturbed, reach duration was longer and angular excursion of all fingers differed with respect to blocked trials. For the 'convex [...] > concave' perturbation, a greater degree of finger extension was found than during the blocked 'concave' trials. In contrast, for the 'concave [...] > convex' perturbation, fingers were more flexed than for the blocked 'convex' trials. The thumb reacted to the perturbation showing a similar pattern (i. e., over-flexion with respect to the blocked trials) regardless the 'direction' of the perturbation. The present results suggest that applying an object shape perturbation during a reach-to-grasp action determines a reorganization of all digits. This pattern is suggestive of a control strategy, which assigns to opposing digits different roles...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} {{the role of the}} wrist, elbow and shoulder joints to single-finger tapping. Six human subjects tapped with their index finger at a rate of 3 taps/s on a keyswitch across five conditions, one freestyle (FS) and four instructed tapping strategies. The four instructed conditions were to tap on a keyswitch using the finger joint only (FO), the wrist joint only (WO), the elbow joint only (EO), and the shoulder joint only (SO). A single-axis force plate measured the fingertip force. An infra-red active-marker three-dimensional motion analysis system measured the movement of the fingertip, hand, forearm, upper arm and trunk. Inverse dynamics estimated joint torques for the <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> (MCP), wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints. For FS tapping 27 %, 56 %, and 18 % of the vertical fingertip movement were a result of flexion of the MCP joint and wrist joint and extension of the elbow joint, respectively. During the FS movements the net joint powers between the MCP, wrist and elbow were positively correlated (correlation coefficients between 0. 46 and 0. 76) suggesting synergistic efforts. For the instructed tapping strategies (FO, WO, EO, and SO), correlations decreased to values below 0. 35 suggesting relatively independent control of the different joints. For FS tapping, the kinematic and kinetic data indicate that the wrist and elbow contribute significantly, working in synergy with the finger joints to create the fingertip tapping task. © 2007...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether hand shaping was affected by planning of an action subsequent to object contact. Ten subjects (5 females and 5 males, ages 19 - 33) were requested to reach toward and grasp a convex object between the thumb and the four fingers of the right hand and to perform one of the following actions: 1) lift up the object; 2) insert the object into a niche of a similar shape and size as the object, or 3) insert the object into a rectangular niche much larger than the object. Flexion/extension at the <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> and proximal interphalangeal joints of all digits were measured using resistive sensors embedded in a glove. Although all experimental conditions required grasping the same object, we found different covariation patterns among finger joint angles across conditions. Gradual preshaping of the hand occurred only when planning object lift or when the end-goal required object placement into the tight niche. In contrast, for the larger niche, gradual preshaping was not evident for the ring and the little finger. Further, reaching movements were faster for movements ending with the larger niche than for the other movement conditions. The present results suggest that hand shaping takes into account end-goal in addition to object geometry. We discuss these findings in the context of forward internal models that allow the prediction of the sensorimotor consequences of motor commands in advance to their execution...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{successful}} replantation of a human thumb reported by Komatsu and Tamai in 1968, thousands of severed digits and body parts have been successfully salvaged. Restoration of anatomic form and function are the goals of replantation after traumatic tissue amputation. Regardless of anatomic location, methods include microsurgical replantation and nonmicrosurgical replantation, such as composite graft techniques. Numerous techniques to maximize tissue survival after revascularization have been described, including “pocket procedures” to salvage composite grafts, interposition vein grafts, and medicinal leeches to name a few. Artery-to-venous anastomoses have been performed with successful “arterialization” of the distal venous system in fingertip replantation. Although there is documented survival of free venous cutaneous flaps, to our knowledge {{this is the first}} report of a replanted composite body part (bone, tendon, soft tissues, and skin) utilizing exclusively multiple, microvascular, nonarterialized venous–venous anastomoses. We present a patient with an isolated band saw fillet amputation {{to the back of the}} thumb at the <b>metacarpal–phalangeal</b> joint region, resulting in a composite graft composed of bone, tendon, soft tissue, and skin. The hand wound provided no viable regional arterial inflow source, but there were multiple good caliber superficial veins present. The amputated tissues were replanted and revascularized by using only venous blood flow. The replanted part survival was 100 % with excellent function of the digit. We conclude that a hand composite body part involving bone, tendon, soft tissues, and skin can survive replantation with a strict venous blood supply if sufficient good caliber, microvascular, venous–venous anastomoses are performed, granted that arterial inflow options are not available. This is an isolated case, yet introduces a new way of thinking regarding tissue replantation...|$|E
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} is a chronic, progressive, {{inflammatory disease}} characterised by pain, stiffness, swelling {{and loss of}} function. Severity of these symptoms is extremely variable both between patients and over time in individual patients. Assessment of disease activity and response to treatment relies heavily on subjective assessments of pain and stiffness and non-specific biochemical measures. In this study an arthrograph {{has been used to}} measure stiffness objectively at the right index <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> joint. Stiffness was defined as resistance to motion in the flexion / extension plane of movement. The finger was moved through 40 degrees, centred on the equilibrium position. Stiffness was quantified in terms of resistive torque, dissipated energy and angles of the hysteresis loop slope in flexion, extension and mid range positions. Principal components analysis was later used to create an ‘objective stiffness factor' from these readings. Grip strength, proximal inter-phalangeal joint size and total hand size were measured in all study subjects. Patients with rheumatoid disease were asked to assess the severity of their pain and stiffness using numerical rating scales and to record the duration of their morning stiffness. Joint tenderness was assessed using an articular index; plasma viscosity and haemoglobin estimation were recorded. One hundred healthy women and eighty five women with rheumatoid disease were each assessed on one occasion. Thirteen healthy women and twenty six women with rheumatoid disease agreed to be assessed monthly for one year. Objective stiffness was found to be influenced by size of the pip joints. It bore little relationship to patient’s subjective assessment of stiffness and did not differentiate between patients and healthy control subjects. Patient's assessment of their symptoms was mainly influenced by joint tenderness and grip strength. These findings support the suggestion that difficulty of movement, due to pain and weakness, is being misinterpreted as stiffness by patients with active rheumatoid disease...|$|E
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: A {{comparative}} {{in vitro}} metalloproteinases and their inhibitors gene expression profile. OBJECTIVE: To obtain a complete expression profile of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), family of proteases with a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in bovine adult nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and to compare this profile with the expression profile obtained from bovine adult articular chondrocytes cultured under identical conditions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The {{cells of the}} NP resemble articular chondrocytes morphologically but produce a matrix which, though consisting of similar components, has very different biomechanical properties. No specific markers for NP cells have yet been identified; they can be distinguished from chondrocytes only by differences in gene expression. Here we compare profiles of gene expression of metalloproteinases and their inhibitors between NP cells and chondrocytes to improve understanding {{of the differences between}} these cell types. METHODS: NP cells and articular chondrocytes were harvested respectively from bovine caudal discs and the articular cartilage of <b>metacarpal-phalangeal</b> joints of 18 - to 24 -month-old steers. These cells were cultured under identical conditions for 96 hours in alginate beads. Expression levels of MMPs, ADAMTSs, and TIMPs were detected by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Gene profiling demonstrated distinct differences between levels of MMPs, ADAMTSs, and TIMPs produced by chondrocytes and NP cells. In particular, NP cells expressed considerably more MMP- 2 and MMP- 14 than chondrocytes, and expression of ADAMTS- 1,- 2,- 17 and TIMP- 1 was also higher. However, expression of MMP- 1,- 3,- 7,- 8,- 10,- 11,- 13,- 16,- 19,- 20,- 21,- 23,- 24,- 28, ADAMTS- 4,- 5,- 6,- 14,- 18,- 19, and TIMP- 3 was lower in NP cells than in chondrocytes. Chondrocytes but not NP cells expressed MMP 12 and MMP 27; this difference is a potential marker for distinguishing between NP cells and chondrocytes. CONCLUSION: Because culture conditions and animal age were identical, differences in metalloproteinase and inhibitor expression between NP cells and chondrocytes were intrinsic to cell phenotype and not induced by differences in the in situ extracellular environment...|$|E
40|$|Proteoglycans were {{extracted}} from the articular cartilage of foetal, calf and adult bovine <b>metacarpal–phalangeal</b> joints with 4 m-guanidinium chloride. After extraction, the high-density proteoglycans (PG-I fractions) were prepared by sedimentation in two sequential CsCl-density-gradient procedures [Swann, Powell & Sotman (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 945 – 954]. The PG-I fractions from foetal, calf and adult tissues accounted for 75 %, 52 % and 46 % respectively of the extracted components. The glucosamine, galactose, N-acetylneuraminic acid and protein contents increased with age. The overall amino acid compositions of PG-I fractions were similar. Fractionation of PG-I-fraction samples on a Bio-Gel A- 50 m column indicated that the molecular weight decreased with age. The PG-I fractions were specifically 3 H-labelled by treatment with galactose oxidase followed by reduction with NaB 3 H 4. The 3 H radioactivity was incorporated into both galactose and galactosamine residues of different carbohydrate side chains. The elution profiles of alkaline borohydride-treated foetal, calf and adult PG-I-fraction samples on a Sepharose 6 B column showed that the molecular weights of chondroitin sulphate chains were 13500, 12000 and 10500 in foetal, calf and adult tissues respectively. Fractionation of the alkaline borohydride-treated foetal, calf and adult PG-I-fraction samples and 3 H-labelled calf and adult PG-I-fraction samples on a Bio-Gel P- 10 column showed {{that there was an}} inverse relationship between the low-molecular-weight O-linked oligosaccharides and the higher-molecular-weight sialic acid-containing constituents at different ages. The oligosaccharide components of foetal, calf and adult PG-I-fraction samples represented 79 %, 69 % and 36 % respectively of the total sialic acid content of the proteoglycans. Similarly in the 3 H-labelled calf and adult samples 75 % and 30 % of the total radioactivity were present in the oligosaccharide components respectively. Digestion with chondroitinase AC-II and infrared analyses showed that the PG-I-fraction F and C samples contained primarily chondroitin 4 -sulphate chains whereas PG-I-fraction sample A was 6 -sulphated. These studies show that the major proteoglycans (PG-I fractions) in the articular cartilage of foetal, calf and adult animals differ in the content, types and structure of the chondroitin sulphate, keratan sulphate and oligosaccharide constituents. These changes in proteoglycan structure reflect the gross age-related changes in the chemical composition of the tissue...|$|E
