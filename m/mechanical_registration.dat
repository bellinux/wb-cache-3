40|$|SummaryHigh-throughput operant {{conditioning}} systems for rodents provide efficient training on sophisticated behavioral tasks. Combining these systems with technologies for cellular resolution functional imaging {{would provide a}} powerful approach to study neural dynamics during behavior. Here we describe an integrated two-photon microscope and behavioral apparatus that allows cellular resolution functional imaging of cortical regions during epochs of voluntary head restraint. Rats were trained to initiate periods of restraint up to 8  s in duration, which provided the mechanical stability necessary for in vivo imaging while allowing free movement between behavioral trials. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>registration</b> system repositioned the head to within a few microns, allowing the same neuronal populations to be imaged on each trial. In proof-of-principle experiments, calcium-dependent fluorescence transients were recorded from GCaMP-labeled cortical neurons. In contrast to previous methods for head restraint, this system {{can be incorporated into}} high-throughput {{operant conditioning}} systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the concept of}} an algorithm to register specified markers on the neuroArm surgical manipulators, an image-guided MR-compatible tele-operated robot for microsurgery and stereotaxy. Two range-finding algorithms, namely time-of-flight and phase-shift, are evaluated for registration and supervisory control. The time-of-flight approach is implemented in a semi-field experiment to determine the precise position of a tiny retro-reflective moving object. The moving object simulates a surgical tool tip. The tool is a target that would be connected to the neuroArm end-effector during surgery inside the magnet bore of the MR imaging system. In order to apply flight approach, a 905 -nm pulsed laser diode and an avalanche photodiode are utilized as the transmitter and receiver, respectively. For the experiment, a high frequency time to digital converter was designed using a field-programmable gate arrays. In the phase-shift approach, a continuous green laser beam with a wavelength of 530 nm was used as the transmitter. Results showed that a positioning error of 0. 1 mm occurred when the scanner-target point distance was set in the range of 2. 5 to 3 meters. The effectiveness of this non-contact approach exhibited that the method could be employed as an alternative for conventional <b>mechanical</b> <b>registration</b> arm. Furthermore, the approach is not limited by physical contact and extension of joint angles...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to {{improving}} of modulation-polarization method for <b>mechanical</b> stress <b>registration</b> by increasing the measurement sensitivity of birefringence created by non-stationary processes in electronic materials. The modeling and technical implementation of photoelastic microscope is made {{on the base of}} nonstationary photoelasticity research in electronic materials to measure the birefringence values in them. The calculation method of the surface and internal mechanical stresses is described. Practical application of photoelastic microscope is demonstrated as mechanical displacement measurement of photoelastic bar with internal changes in refractive index. On the base of he modulator noise spectrum, thermal, structural, and other noises calculations it is shown that thermal noise, amplifier noise and low frequency vibration are the dominant. For linear and circular modulation of laser radiation components photoelastic modulator is used. To increase the sensitivity of the signal registration an optimal correlation filter is synthesized, which simultaneously perform lock-in detection of reference and useful signals under background noise. Equations that describe the S/N ratio in the output of photoelastic microscope are obtained as well as methodological and instrumental error. For mechanical stresses measurements and search of irregularities in optical materials it is made the comparative analysis of modulation polarization devices and designed photoelastic microscope. ??????????? ????????? ????????????????? ????????????-???????????????? ?????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????? ????????? ???????????????? ????????? ??????????????????, ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ???????????. ????????? ????????????? ? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ????????????????? ?? ?????? ???????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ? ??? ???????? ??????????????????. ????????? ???????? ??????? ???????????????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????. ?????????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??? ????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????. ?? ?????? ???????? ???????? ????? ??????????, ?????????, ???????????? ? ?????? ????? ????????, ??? ????? ??????? ???????? ? ???????? ????????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ???, ??? ????????? ? ?????????????? ????????. ??? ????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????????. ??? ????????? ???????????????? ??????????? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????, ??????? ????????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????-???????? ?????????????? ????????? ? ???????? ???????? ?? ???? ?????. ???????? ?????????, ??????????? ????????? ?/? ?? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ??? ???????????? ? ???????????????? ???????????. ???????? ????????????? ?????? ????????????-??????????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ???????????? ??????????, ?????? ?????????? ??????????????? ? ??????????...|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} way of regularizing correlation procedures is {{to consider}} mechanical admissibility. This is, for instance, possible by requiring that the measured displacement field minimize a weighted sum of the DVC objective functional and the equilibrium gap by assuming, say, an elastic behavior [72]. These so-called mechanics-aided (i.e., regularized) DVC procedures enable the high frequency kinematic components that are not mechanically admissible to be filtered out [47]. This penalization acts as <b>mechanical</b> filter in <b>registration</b> procedures. Because <b>mechanical</b> admissibility controls the high spatial frequencies, fine meshes (that cannot be considered in standard DVC calculations) become accessible [41, 72]. They also allow registrations to be performed at the voxel level [73]. In this extreme situation, implementations on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) enable very large computations to be run [47]. One alternative route consists in considering PGD-based DVC [74].|$|R
40|$|The {{study focused}} on the {{comparison}} between <b>mechanical</b> and computerized <b>registration</b> methods used by the two selected kinematic facebows. The material consisted of 35 women aged 18 to 35, studied using the Gerber Dynamic Facebow and the computerized ARCUSdigma II axiograph. To compare the devices the condylar path inclination (CPI) was recorded according to the Camper’s line, enabling the acquisition of easily comparable values based on which the devices were objectively and subjectively analyzed. Statistics was performed for the obtained data. The study showed that the values for the CPI registrated by the ARCUSdigma II are significantly higher than those obtained by using the Gerber Dynamic Facebow. The {{significant difference in the}} records of the CPI is most likely a result of the differences in the registration techniques assumptions. ARCUSdigma II provides the user with more diagnostic options than Gerber Dynamic Facebow. Mechanical facebow handling has a higher risk of hand-measuring errors in tracing procedure. Due to high discrepancy of achieved results from different systems the authors recommend to use articulator compatible with facebow whose measurement has been done...|$|R
40|$|Since 1888, {{a series}} of {{mutually}} perpendicular lines {{have been used as}} a test object for evaluation of optics, systems, products, etc. The availability of such test objects has traditionally been in the frequency range of about one cycle per millimeter to a couple hundred cycles per millimeter. These have been available from a few manufacturers, none of which offers the extended range of. 25 cycles per millimeter to greater than one thousand cycles per millimeter proposed in this project. The usefulness of such an extended range serves to make it an all-purpose test target for measurement of enlarging, contact and reduction systems. Since the test object is on film, it can be used with ease in each of these systems. The actual test object range obtained was from. 25 cycles per millimeter to greater than one thousand cycles per millimeter. The camera attained this by a simple but effective three station, multi-exposure method. The advantage of such an exposure method is that optimum independent line width control can be used at each exposure step. Breaking the total frequency range into three groups eases exposure and optical restrictions but does produce <b>mechanical</b> <b>registration</b> problems. It is obvious that with a reasonable budget a sturdier, higher precision and more reproducible instrument could be built such that this extended range resolving power test target could be produced on a production basis...|$|E
40|$|It was found, {{from the}} curves of <b>mechanical</b> <b>registration</b> that the precise {{determination}} of atrio-ventricular interval and the time interval {{from the beginning to}} the summit of ventricular contractions cannot be accurately measured. But it was clearly shown that the height of auricular contractions is obviously reduced by vagus stimulation {{as well as by the}} application of acethylcholin, which is generally known as &# 34;Vagusstoff&# 34; while on the other hand the ventricular contractions are not affected. It is considered, therefore, from the results obtained, that the acethylcholin like substance is produced from the endings of vagus nerve as a conseqence of its activity through stimulation, and that this substance causes a decrease in the height of auricular contractions. Examining the electrocardiogramm, it clearly showed a marked prolongation of the atrio-ventricular interval, and in the last three curves it failed to record the ventricular contraction after each P-spike. Hence it is considered that vagus stimulation affects the conductivity of atrio-ventricular bundle and causes diminution of its conductivity. The results above cited, agree with those of the former investigators. But with regard to the duration of the electrical response of the ventricle, it was found contrary for the vagus stimulation has no effect upon the function of ventricular muscle. From the results obtained, the following conclusions may be made. 1. The vagus stimulation affects the negative inotropic only on auricular contraction. 2. The vagus stimulation affects the negative dromotropic on the conductivity of atrio-ventricular bundle. 3. The vagus stimulation has no effect upon the function of ventricular muscle. </p...|$|E
40|$|From Reconstruction to Great Depression in the United States, {{major changes}} in food {{production}} techniques altered traditional dietary habits. Transformation of common staples into mass-market goods raised concerns about food quality in an urban, industrial society. Government-supported inquiry at land-grant universities, experiment stations, and official bureaus offered nutrition scientists institutional and instrumental means to pursue laboratory or field studies of food. University departments, foundation institutes, endowed schools, research wards in teaching hospitals, and commercial product-testing facilities afforded other sites for physiological-chemical inquiries. ^ Despite this wide range of institutional-disciplinary communities oriented to specific colleagues, clients, or constituencies, nutritionists had {{by the turn of}} the century achieved more stable identities. They submerged some differences by participating in public-service communities committed to practical advice or policy recommendation regarding food regulation, environmental hygiene, consumer education, and scientific accountability. Much of this public-service effort eventually modified customary habits, consumer preferences, and common beliefs about food 2 ̆ 7 s place in daily life. Attempts to refashion dietary expertise into accessible genres and media encouraged nutritionists to participate in diffuse intellectual-cultural communities associating specialty terminology with comparable, but figurative, lay idiom in order to popularize their authority. Terms such as elements of nutrition pedagogy; energy conservation or efficiency in evaluating environmental conditions; economy of metabolic, dietary, or fiscal balance in ‘dynamic’ diet factors; and equilibrium mechanisms in the regulation of the ‘internal environment’ figured prominently in popular nutrition literature. ^ Four main technical-instrumental communities emerged from this diverse array of research locations, public missions, and popular forums, each making use of comparable apparatus, materials, practices, and metrics. They included: chemical analysis of food composition; respiration calorimetry of material and thermal conversion in metabolism; standardized animal-feeding trials with large-scale colonies fed purified rations to isolate trace nutrients; and sectional aperture or <b>mechanical</b> <b>registration</b> of alimentary processes in physiology. Each attempted to balance autonomous inquiry with applicable service by establishing the optimal place and time, scale and scope of their research programs and practices, using suitable experimental subordinates and subjects. ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of {{computer-aided}} surgery is to match intraoperative data to preoperative images of the anatomy and add complementary information that can facilitate the task of surgical navigation. In this context, mechanical palpation can reveal critical anatomical features such as arteries and cancerous lumps which are stiffer that the surrounding tissue. This work uses position and force measurements obtained during <b>mechanical</b> palpation for <b>registration</b> and stiffness mapping. Prior approaches, including our own, exhaustively palpated the entire organ to achieve this goal. To overcome the costly palpation of the entire organ, a Bayesian optimization framework is introduced to guide the end effector to palpate stiff regions while simultaneously updating the registration of the end effector to an a priori geometric model of the organ, hence enabling the fusion of intraoperative data into the a priori model obtained through imaging. This new framework uses Gaussian processes to model the stiffness distribution and Bayesian optimization to direct where to sample next for maximum information gain. The proposed method was evaluated with experimental data obtained using a Cartesian robot interacting with a silicone organ model and an ex vivo porcine liver...|$|R

The converter of the rectifier is not commanded type, and the inverter is with IGBT transistors, commanded by the microcontroller PWM signals. The equipment was experimented in three regimes: the converter in no-load regime; asynchronous motor in no-load regime; asynchronous motor in load regime. Experimented issues to refer to: registration of the indicial response of the motor speed, and the detection of the <b>mechanical</b> time constant; <b>registration</b> of the indicial response of the motor speed, and the detection of the electromagnetically time constant; registration of the wave form of the voltage at the motor terminal, and her harmonic analysis; registration of the wave form of the phase current, and her harmonic analysis; analysis of the starting moment for the motor; calculus of the thermal constant. The experiments are done with different type of static converters: Siemens, Danfoss, and UEM Resita types. The commands algorithms for the converters assign a constant stator flux, in the under nominal speed domain. The registration for the parameters was done on-line, using virtual instruments and LabVIEW data acquisition systems. Were experimented 36 converters, different types...|$|R
5000|$|Manuel Garcia II {{was one of}} {{the first}} to develop a {{scientific}} definition of registers, a definition that is still used by pedagogues and teachers today. [...] "A register is a series of homogeneous sounds produced by one mechanism, differing essentially from another series of equally homogeneous sounds produced by another mechanism." [...] Another definition worth considering is from Clifton Ware. [...] "A series of distinct, consecutive, homogeneous vocal tones that can be maintained in pitch and loudness throughout a certain range." [...] A register consists of the homogeneous tone qualities produced by the same <b>mechanical</b> system whereas <b>Registration</b> is the process of using and combining the registers to achieve artistic singing. For example: a skilled singer moves through their range and dynamics smoothly, so that you are unaware of register changes. This process could be described as good or clean registration.The term “register” came about in the sixteenth century. Before then it was recognized that there were different “voices”. As teachers started to notice how different the areas on either side of the passaggios or breaks in the voice were, it was compared to the different sets of pipes in an organ. These clusters of pipes were called registers, we now use the same term when speaking of voices.|$|R
