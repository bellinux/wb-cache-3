Wise was distinct from the others, arriving early in 1846 and lacking much formal education. He was of little ideological consistency, often willing to compromise.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Shaye J. D. Cohen, in the Bible, {{the status}} of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally. He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (kilayim). Thus, a <b>mixed</b> <b>marriage</b> is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally. Second, the Tannaim may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the mother.|$|E
25|$|The legal {{definitions}} decreed: The {{marriage of}} a Gentile husband and his wife, being a Jewess or being {{classified as a}} Jewess due to her descent, was {{generally considered to be}} a privileged <b>mixed</b> <b>marriage,</b> unless they had children, who were enrolled in a Jewish congregation. Then the husband was obviously not the dominant part in the family and the wife had to wear the yellow badge and the children as well, who were thus discriminated against as Geltungsjuden. Without children, or with children not enrolled with a Jewish congregation, the Jewish-classified wife was spared from wearing the yellow badge (else compulsory for Germans classified as Jews as of 1 September 1941).|$|E
40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>marriages</b> {{have always}} had an {{ambiguous}} and often problematic relationship with the law. On one hand, <b>mixed</b> <b>marriages</b> {{have been seen as}} a key indicator of sociocultural integration into mainstream society. In terms of the law, this perception has been expressed, for example, as privileged access to citizenship status for immigrant family members of citizens. On the other hand, <b>mixed</b> <b>marriages</b> have been seen as a threat to society and social cohesion. In this article, I argue that these contradictory perceptions of mixed relationships have informed the development of citizenship law over time. Building on literature on the regulation of <b>mixed</b> <b>marriages</b> in law, as well as gender and citizenship law, I use the Netherlands as a case study to demonstrate how citizenship law {{has been used as a}} tool to prevent certain types of "undesirable" mixed couples and how this approach has informed Dutch citizenship law until today...|$|R

25|$|Hamburg had the {{greatest}} concentration of Jews in Germany. Systematic deportations of Jewish Germans and Gentile Germans of Jewish descent started on 18 October 1941. These were all directed to Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe or to concentration camps. Most deported persons perished in the Holocaust. By the end of 1942 the Jüdischer Religionsverband in Hamburg was dissolved as an independent legal entity and its remaining assets and staff were assumed by the Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland (District Northwest). On 10 June 1943 the Reichssicherheitshauptamt dissolved the Reichsvereinigung by a decree. The few remaining employees not somewhat protected by a <b>mixed</b> <b>marriage</b> were deported from Hamburg on 23 June to Theresienstadt, where most of them perished.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there was}} no {{elaborate}} regulation, the practice of exempting privileged mixed marriages from anti-Semitic invidiousnesses varied amongst Greater Germany's different Reichsgaue. However, all discriminations enacted until December 28, 1938 remained valid without exemptions for privileged mixed marriages. In the Reichsgau Hamburg, for example, Jewish-classified spouses living in privileged mixed marriages received equal food rations like Aryan-classified Germans. In many other Reichsgaue they received shortened rations. In some Reichsgaue in 1942 and 1943, privileged mixed couples, and their minor children whose father was classified as a Jew, were forced to move into houses reserved for Jews only; this effectively made a privileged <b>mixed</b> <b>marriage</b> one where the husband was the one classified as Aryan.|$|E
25|$|According to the Nazi family value attitude, {{the husband}} was {{regarded}} {{the head of}} a family. Thus people living in a <b>mixed</b> <b>marriage</b> were treated differently according to the sex of the Aryan spouse and according to the religious affiliation of the children, their being or not being enrolled with a Jewish congregation. Nazi-termed mixed marriages were often not interfaith marriages, because in many cases the classification of one spouse as non-Aryan was only due to her or his grandparents being enrolled with a Jewish congregation or else classified as non-Aryan. In many cases both spouses had a common faith, either because the parents had already converted or because at marrying one spouse converted to the religion of the second (marital conversion). Traditionally the wife used to be the convert. However, in urban areas and after 1900, actual interfaith marriages occurred more often, with interfaith marriages legally allowed in some states of the German Confederation since 1847, and generally since 1875, when civil marriage became an obligatory prerequisite for any religious marriage ceremony throughout the united Germany.|$|E

50|$|The {{measures}} {{for the final}} solution of the Jewish question should extend only to full Jews and descendants of <b>mixed</b> <b>marriages</b> of the first degree, but should not apply to descendants of <b>mixed</b> <b>marriages</b> of the second degree.With regard {{to the treatment of}} Jewish descendants of <b>mixed</b> <b>marriages</b> of the first degree, I agree with the conception of the Reich Minister of the Interior which he expressed in his letter of 16 February 1942, to the effect that the prevention of propagation of these descendants of <b>mixed</b> <b>marriages</b> is to be preferred to their being thrown in with the Jews and evacuated. It follows therefrom that the evacuation of those half-Jews who are no more capable of propagation is obviated from the beginning. There is no national interest in dissolving the marriage between such half-Jews and a full-blooded German.Those half-Jews who are capable of propagation should be given the choice to submit to sterilization or to be evacuated {{in the same manner as}} Jews.|$|R

In the mid-1970s, Tyndall used Spearhead to claim that [...] "the negro has a smaller brain and a much less complex cerebral structure" [...] than white Europeans. In 1988, Tyndall described his crime as having [...] "dared to publish an honest and frank opinion on the relative merits of Whites and Negroes." [...] Tyndall argued that non-whites were unassimilable to Britain and that those living in Britain should be repatriated. Tyndall strongly objected to interracial relationships and miscegenation and remarked in his book The Eleventh Hour: [...] "I feel deeply sorry for the child of a <b>mixed</b> <b>marriage,</b> but I can have no sympathy whatever for the parents... They produced an offspring that will never wholly fit, and will undoubtedly face a life much harder than the normal person born of pure race." [...] In contrast to his views on non-white migration, he spoke positively of white immigrants from Poland, Hungary, and the Baltic states, regarding them as being racially similar and sharing the [...] "same basic culture" [...] as the British and were thus easily able to assimilate [...] "within a generation or two".|$|E
500|$|Vitalian {{was born}} in Zaldapa in Lower Moesia (usually {{identified}} with modern Abrit in north-eastern Bulgaria). He is called a [...] "Goth" [...] or a [...] "Scythian" [...] in the Byzantine sources. Since Vitalian's mother was a sister of Macedonius II, Patriarch of Constantinople in 496–511, this points to a <b>mixed</b> <b>marriage</b> and a probable barbarian origin for his father, Patriciolus. On the other hand, the assertion {{that he was a}} [...] "Goth" [...] is based on a single Syriac source, and is today considered dubious. Likewise, the [...] "Scythian" [...] label commonly applied to him by some contemporary authors is non-conclusive, since the term [...] "Scythian" [...] could mean an inhabitant of Scythia Minor, or simply, in the classicizing language usual in Byzantine texts, someone from the north-eastern fringes of the Graeco-Roman world, centred on the Mediterranean; the term had a wide-encompassing meaning, devoid of clear ethnic attributes. Furthermore, since none of the [...] "Scythian Monks", to whom Vitalian and members of his family seem to have been related, expressed any kinship, by blood or spiritually, with the Arian Goths who at that time ruled Italy, a Gothic origin for Vitalian is questionable. Whatever Patriciolus's origin, his name was Latin, while of Vitalian's own sons, the generals Bouzes and Coutzes had Thracian names and Venilus a Gothic name. His nephew, John, later also became a distinguished general in the wars against the Ostrogoths of Italy.|$|E
2500|$|Mechur's {{father was}} a Jew, but {{somewhat}} protected because he was married with a so-called Aryan Protestant, and his daughter was by religion not Jewish, this made the Nazi authorities classify his marriage as a then so-called 'privileged' <b>mixed</b> <b>marriage.</b> German Jews and German Gentiles of Jewish descent living in privileged <b>mixed</b> <b>marriage</b> were in fact spared from deportation. On November 1944 Mr. Mechur died in the [...] , {{after he had been}} badly injured by a falling burning beam during an allied air raid.

2500|$|The {{inconsistent}} {{application of}} [...] privileged mixed marriages led to different compulsions to forced labour in 1940: Sometimes it was ordered for all Jewish-classified spouses, sometimes for Jewish-classified husbands, sometimes exempting Jewish-classified wives {{taking care of}} minor children.

2500|$|Second only to Geiger, Rabbi Samuel Holdheim {{distinguished}} {{himself as}} a radical proponent of change. While the former stressed continuity with the past and described Judaism as an entity that gradually adopted and discarded elements along time, Holdheim accorded present conditions the highest status, sharply dividing the universalist core from all other aspects that could be unremittingly disposed of. Declaring that old laws lost their hold on Jews as it were and the rabbi could only act {{as a guide for}} voluntary observance, his principal was that the concept of [...] "the Law of the Land is the Law" [...] was total. He declared <b>mixed</b> <b>marriage</b> permissible – almost the only Reform rabbi to do so in history; his contemporaries and later generations opposed this – for the Talmudic ban on conducting them on Sabbath, unlike offering sacrifice and other acts, was to him sufficient demonstration that they belonged not to the category of sanctified obligations (issurim) but to the civil ones (memonot), where the Law of the Land applied. Another measure he offered, rejected almost unanimously by his colleagues in 1846, was the institution of a [...] "Second Sabbath" [...] on Sunday, modeled on Second Passover, as most people desecrated the day of rest.|$|E
