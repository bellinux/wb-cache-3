5|$|In human civilization, {{wind has}} {{inspired}} mythology, influenced {{the events of}} history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for <b>mechanical</b> <b>work,</b> electricity and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and man-made structures are damaged or destroyed.|$|E

5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated <b>mechanical</b> <b>work</b> that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E

25|$|Thermodynamics is an {{applied science}} used in several {{branches}} of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics {{is the study}} of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into <b>mechanical</b> <b>work</b> that eventually turns the wheels.|$|E
