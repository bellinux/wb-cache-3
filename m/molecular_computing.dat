Research and development in this area concerns theory, experiments and applications of DNA computing. DNA computing is fundamentally similar to parallel computing in that it {{takes advantage of the}} many different molecules of DNA to try many different possibilities at once. Leonard Adleman of the University of Southern California initially pioneered this field in 1994.

Kurzweil describes four paradigms of computing that came before integrated circuits: electromechanical, relay, vacuum tube, and transistors. What technology will follow integrated circuits, to serve as the sixth paradigm, is unknown, but Kurzweil believes nanotubes are the most likely alternative among a number of possibilities:nanotubes and nanotube circuitry, <b>molecular</b> <b>computing,</b> self-assembly in nanotube circuits, biological systems emulating circuit assembly, computing with DNA, spintronics (computing with the spin of electrons), computing with light, and quantum computing.|$|E

Biological systems are inherently nano in scale; nanoscience must merge with biology in order to deliver biomacromolecules and molecular machines that are similar to nature.

In the 21st century, humans have developed the technology to artificially tap into nanobiology. This process is best described as [...] "organic merging with synthetic." [...] Colonies of live neurons can live together on a biochip device; according to research from Dr. Gunther Gross at the University of North Texas. Self-assembling nanotubes have the ability to be used as a structural system. They would be composed together with rhodopsins; which would facilitate the optical computing process and help with the storage of biological materials.

50|$|Coffman is {{best known}} for his seminal {{research}} together with his international collaborations, measured in part by some 150 co-authors in his collection of publications. His work can be found in over 180 articles in technical journals devoted to original research contributions. He published 4 graduate-level text books, and papers in the proceedings of some 250 conferences and workshops, most of these being preliminary versions of journal articles. In his research, Coffman has been a generalist following many parallel paths in engineering and applied mathematics. The directions he has taken have drawn on the tools of combinatorial optimization and the theory of algorithms, along with those of applied probability and stochastic processes. The processes studied include those in the theories of scheduling, bin packing, sequential selection, graphs, and dynamic allocation, along with those in queueing, polling, reservation, moving-server, networking, and distributed local-rule systems (e.g. cellular automata). His contributions have been divided between mathematical foundations and the design and analysis of approximation algorithms providing the basis for engineering solutions to NP-hard problems. Computer and network engineering applications have been broad in scope; a partial list includes research addressing problems in the scheduling and storage allocation functions of computer operating systems, storage architectures, data structures, computer timing problems such as deadlocks and synchronization, Internet congestion, peer-to-peer file sharing networks, stream merging, self-assembly processes of <b>molecular</b> <b>computing,</b> minimalist algorithms in sensor networks, optical burst switching, and dynamic spectrum management in cognitive networks. The list expands greatly when including the myriad applications in industrial engineering and operations research of Coffman's research in scheduling and bin-packing theory in one and two dimensions.
