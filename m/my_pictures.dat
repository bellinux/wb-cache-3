500|$|The {{scientific}} {{subjects of}} Wright's paintings {{from this time}} were meant {{to appeal to the}} wealthy scientific circles in which he moved. While never a member himself, he had strong connections with the Lunar Society: he was friends with members John Whitehurst and Erasmus Darwin, as well as Josiah Wedgwood, who later commissioned paintings from him. The inclusion of the moon in the painting was a nod to their monthly meetings, which were held when the moon was full. Like The Orrery, Wright apparently painted Air Pump without a commission, and the picture was purchased by Dr Benjamin Bates, who already owned Wright's Gladiator. An Aylesbury physician, patron of the arts and hedonist, Bates was a diehard member of the Hellfire Club who, despite his excesses, lived to be over 90. Wright's account book shows a number of prices for the painting: Pd£200 is shown in one place and £210 in another, but Wright had written to Bates asking for £130, stating that the low price [...] "might much injure me in the future sale of <b>my</b> <b>pictures,</b> and when I send you a receipt for the money I shall acknowledge a greater sum." [...] Whether Bates ever paid the full amount is not recorded; Wright only notes in his account book that he received £30 in part payment.|$|E
2500|$|I {{am not an}} abstractionist ... I am not {{interested}} in the relationship of color or form or anything else. ...

2500|$|Traditionally, the Start menu {{provided}} a customizable nested list {{of programs for}} the user to launch, {{as well as a}} list of most recently opened documents, a way to find files and get help, and access to the system settings. Later enhancements via Windows Desktop Update included access to special folders like [...] "My Documents" [...] and [...] "Favorites" [...] (browser bookmarks). Windows XP's Start menu was expanded to encompass various My Documents folders (including My Music and <b>My</b> <b>Pictures),</b> and transplanted other items like My Computer and My Network Places from the Windows desktop. Until Windows Vista, the Start menu was constantly expanded across the screen as the user navigated through its cascading sub-menus.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to directing some television work, Bogdanovich returned to acting with a recurring guest {{role on the}} cable television series The Sopranos, playing Dr. Melfi's psychotherapist, also later directing a fifth-season episode.

2500|$|The {{next major}} change in the Start menu since its {{inception}} came in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. The Start menu was expanded to two columns: the left-hand column focuses on installed programs, while the right-hand column provides access to My Documents, <b>My</b> <b>Pictures,</b> My Music and other special folders. This column also includes shortcuts for Computer and Network (Network Neighborhood in Windows 95 and 98), which have been traditionally placed on Windows Desktop, {{making it easier to}} access them even when the Desktop is obscured. The contents of this column can be customized. Commonly used programs are automatically displayed in the left-hand menu. Users may opt to [...] "pin" [...] programs to this side of the Start menu so that they are always accessible. A sub-menu item at the bottom of this column grants access to all items of Start menu. When this menu item is selected, a scrolling list of start menu programs replaces the user/recent list.|$|E
2500|$|Build 3683 (build date of September 23, 2002) {{was leaked}} on October 20, 2002, {{and was the}} first Longhorn build leaked to the Internet. This build was the first of several that had a working title of [...] "Longhorn XP Professional". Visually it was not {{significantly}} different from Windows XP. One of the notable changes was that the Windows logo was only white, not colored like all the versions of Windows before it. Also the templates in the My Documents and <b>My</b> <b>Pictures</b> were notably different as well as the Open and Save as dialog boxes also included the template, incorporating aesthetic changes and a few new user interface options. A new [...] "Sidebar" [...] was also present, which contained many of the gadgets that would much later be seen in Windows Sidebar, such as an analog clock, slide show, and search capability. An option in this version of the sidebar also made it possible to move the Start button into it, and disable the traditional taskbar entirely. An early revision of WinFS was also included, but very {{little in the way of}} a user interface was included, and as such it appeared to early testers to be nothing more than a service that consumed large amounts of memory and processor time. The [...] "Display Properties" [...] control panel was the first significant departure, being built on the new [...] "Avalon" [...] API.|$|E
