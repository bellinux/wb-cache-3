5|$|Carlos P. Romulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines {{and member}} of the UN had suite 3600, below Hoover's, for some 45 years from 1935 onwards, and fellow Filipino Imelda Marcos also spent <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money at the hotel. Another {{connection}} with the Philippines is that many meetings were held here between President Manuel L. Quezon and high ranking American politicians and senators. Through the meetings, Quezon encouraged investment into the country and convinced General MacArthur to accompany him back to the Philippines as his military adviser.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money {{restoring}} Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{displacement}} of a dreadnought was {{taken up by the}} steel plating of the armour. Designers spent <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort to provide the best possible protection for their ships against the various weapons they would be faced with. Only so much weight could be devoted to protection, without compromising speed, firepower or seakeeping.|$|E

5|$|The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for tracking down and reporting all communicable diseases in the U.S., faced governmental apathy {{in the face of}} mounting crisis. Shilts reported how CDC epidemiologists forged ahead blindly after being denied funding for researching the disease repeatedly. Shilts expressed particular frustration describing instances of the CDC fighting with itself over how <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> attention was being paid to AIDS issues.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in San Francisco {{after having}} been {{released}} from questioning by immigration officials on Angel Island on 11 August 1918, Prokofiev was soon compared to other famous Russian exiles (such as Sergei Rachmaninoff). His debut solo concert in New York led to several further engagements. He also received a contract from the {{music director of the}} Chicago Opera Association, Cleofonte Campanini, for the production of his new opera The Love for Three Oranges; however, due to Campanini's illness and death, the premiere was postponed. The delay was another example of Prokofiev's bad luck in operatic matters. The failure also cost him his American solo career since the opera took too <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort. He soon found himself in financial difficulties, and in April 1920, he left for Paris, not wanting to return to Russia as a failure.|$|E
5|$|Mercer's {{greatest}} passion however {{was reserved}} for the Canadian militia, which he joined as a student in 1881. Posted to The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada as a private soldier, Mercer devoted <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> energy to the unit and became an excellent soldier and first-rate shot. Mercer rose steadily {{through the ranks of}} the militia, being made an officer in 1885 and a captain in 1891. In 1903 as a brevet major, Mercer led a company to Sault Ste. Marie to calm a riot by striking dock workers, his only deployment before 1914. In 1911, Mercer was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the regiment and in 1913, Mercer was aide-de-camp to Defence Minister Sam Hughes during a military tour of Europe, during which he inspected the German army first-hand and became convinced that war was imminent.|$|E

5|$|The actors {{selected}} {{to portray the}} protagonists invested <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> research into character development. Motion capture was used to record the characters' facial and body movements. Like its predecessors, the game features an in-game radio that plays a selection of licensed music tracks. The game {{is the first in}} its series to feature an original score, composed over several years by a team of five music producers. They worked in close collaboration, sampling and incorporating different influences into each other's ideas. The game's re-release added a first-person view option along with the traditional third-person view. To accommodate first-person, the game received a fundamental visual and technical upgrade, as well as new gameplay features like a replay editor that lets players create gameplay videos.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too <b>much</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E
5|$|Life {{under the}} Japanese changed rapidly {{as many of}} the {{traditional}} structures were replaced by a military power. Aborigines who wished to improve their status looked to education rather than headhunting as the new form of power. Those who learned to work with the Japanese and follow their customs would be better suited to lead villages. The Japanese encouraged aborigines to maintain traditional costumes and selected customs that were not considered detrimental to society, but invested <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money in efforts to eliminate traditions deemed unsavory by Japanese culture, including tattooing. By the mid-1930s as Japan's empire was reaching its zenith, the colonial government began a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs, rituals and a loyal Japanese identity upon the aborigines. By the end of World War II, aborigines whose fathers had been killed in pacification campaigns were volunteering to serve in Special Units and if need be die for the Emperor of Japan. The Japanese colonial experience left an indelible mark on many older aborigines who maintained an admiration for the Japanese long after their departure in 1945.|$|E

5|$|The most {{complete}} {{books on the}} Pony Express are The Story of the Pony Express and Saddles and Spurs by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as {{he was the first}} writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account {{on the history of the}} Pony Express amongst many historians.|$|E

25|$|One {{possible}} {{means of}} averting such a catastrophe {{would be to}} strengthen the lake wall, though this would take <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> money.

25|$|While Baldwin was {{attending}} the university, {{one of his}} friends and fellow students, William Darlington developed a serious illness. Baldwin devoted <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort to assisting his recovery. Thus began a close and lifelong friendship. After one course at the University of Pennsylvania, Baldwin again fell short financially, and in 1803 returned to Dr. Todd to work as his assistant.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the {{organization}} was criticized by some of Canada's gay press for failing to submit a brief, after indicating an intention to do so, to the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights regarding the potential impact on LGBT communities of Bill C-2, a controversial {{piece of legislation that}} revised the age of sexual consent.

25|$|A more {{rigorous}} standard of accountability {{is known as}} an audit. Because reviewers are not paid, they cannot be expected to put as <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> effort into a review as an audit requires. Therefore, academic journals such as Science, {{organizations such as the}} American Geophysical Union, and agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation maintain and archive scientific data and methods in the event another researcher wishes to replicate or audit the research after publication.|$|E
25|$|Unlike dingoes other feral {{domestic}} {{dogs and}} dingo-hybrids are theoretically capable two come in heat twice annually {{and tend to}} have a breeding cycle less influenced by the seasons. However, it is considered to be unlikely that they are capable of rearing two litters per year in the wild since this would require <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> energy. Successful rearing of two successive litters would probably only be possible in the wild under very favourable conditions and there is currently no proof that it ever happened in the wild.|$|E
25|$|Ward's time in New York was not {{completely}} without success, however. Following a brief courtship, on June 15, 1940, Ward married Mary Sangigian, an Armenian-American artist and social activist from Bridgeport, Connecticut who {{would go on to}} work for the National War Labor Board during World War II. Like her husband, Mary Sangigian Ward dedicated <b>much</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> energy to social justice reforms and was a major contributor to the Scottsboro Defense, the labor movement, and the fight for Social Security legislation. The couple had two children together, Elise Virginia and Laura Louise.|$|E
