5000|$|<b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites</b> breed {{across the}} central and {{southern}} United States. Breeding territory has expanded {{in recent years and}} <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites</b> have been regularly recorded in the southern New England states and a pair has successfully raised young as far north as Newmarket, New Hampshire. [...] They migrate to southern subtropical South America in the winter. <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites</b> usually lay two white eggs (rarely one or three) in twig nests that rest in a variety of deciduous trees. In the past 75 years, they have undergone changes in nesting habitat from use of forest and savanna to include shelterbelts and are now very common nesters in urban area that are highly populated in the western south-central states.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites</b> nest in {{colonies and}} both parents (paired up before {{arriving}} at the nesting site) incubate the eggs {{and care for the}} young. [...] They have one clutch a year which takes 30 to 32 days to hatch. The young birds leave the nest another 30 to 35 days after hatching. Only about half of kites successfully raise their young. Clutches fall victim to storms and predators such as raccoons and great horned owls. Because of the reduced amount of predators in urban areas, <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites</b> produce more offspring in urban areas than rural areas. They have an average lifespan of 8 years.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife found nearby include white-tailed deer, turkeys and bobcats. River otters are {{occasionally}} {{seen and}} alligators are seen frequently. A variety of birds, including red-headed and pileated woodpeckers, hawks, crows, warblers and <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites</b> frequent the river area. Shorebirds such as plovers and sandpipers, {{as well as}} many types of heron and egret, can be found along the banks and sandbars.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kite</b> (Ictinia mississippiensis) {{is a small}} bird of prey in {{the family}} Accipitridae. Mississippi kites have narrow, pointed wings and are graceful in flight, often {{appearing}} to float in the air. It {{is not uncommon to}} see several circling in the same area.|$|E
5000|$|Vigors placed Ictinia [...] - [...] "the Milan Cresserelle of M. Vieillot" [...] and [...] "the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kite</b> of Mr. Wilson" [...] - [...] into Buteonina. Though {{noting that}} [...] "the wings are of {{considerable}} length, extending {{far beyond the}} tail, a character which has induced M. Vieillot and others to place this bird near the Kites", he wrote that the strong affinity in characteristics and manners warranted it to be placed closer to the falcons.|$|E
50|$|The basin's wooded {{wetlands}} {{also provide}} vital nesting habitat for wood duck, {{and support the}} nation's largest concentration of American woodcock. Bald eagles, ospreys, swallow-tailed <b>kites,</b> and <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites</b> can occasionally be seen soaring overhead. Wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, eastern gray and fox squirrels, eastern cottontail, swamp rabbit, gray and red fox, coyote, striped skunk, and Virginia opossum inhabit the refuge, as do a small remnant population of Louisiana black bears. Furbearers found in this great swamp are raccoon, mink, bobcat, coypu, muskrat, North American river otter, and American beaver.|$|R
50|$|One {{individual}} bat {{was recorded}} {{to have lived}} eight years, based on dentition. Predators of the bat include large birds such as red-tailed hawk, American kestrels, great horned owls, barn owls, and <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites.</b> Mammal predators include Virginia opossums, striped skunks, and raccoons. Snakes such as eastern coachwhips and eastern coral snakes may also prey on them, but at a lesser extent. Certain types of beetles prey on neonate and juvenile bats that have fallen to the ground. This species {{seems to have a}} low incidence of rabies, at least in the United States. They do, however, contain certain pesticides.|$|R
50|$|Adults do {{not require}} cover, so that they {{commonly}} roost and nest on the open ground. After young chicks are three days old, they are brooded less frequently by parents and require wind blocks and shade, and protection from predators. In some colonies in southern California, Spanish roof tiles are placed in colonies so chicks can hide there. Notable disruption of colonies can occur from predation by burrowing owls, gull-billed terns and American kestrels. Depredation by domestic cats has been observed {{in at least one}} colony. Predation on inland breeding terns by coyotes, bobcats, feral dogs and cats, great blue herons, <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites,</b> and owls has also been documented.|$|R
50|$|The Lower Coast section {{which lies}} around the Rio Grande offers its own species diversity. South Padre Island and the Laguna Madre areas feature {{magnificent}} frigatebirds, bridled terns, and Coryâ€™s shearwater. Further up the Rio Grande around Santa Ana and McAllen {{one can find}} elf owls, white-tipped doves, green jays, green kingfishers, and <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kite.</b> The brown pelican is found especially on South Padre Island {{in addition to other}} locations on the coast. The inland areas around Zapata are home to white-collared seedeaters, lesser goldfinch, ash-throated flycatchers, and black-tailed gnatcatchers.|$|E
5000|$|Small {{animals are}} {{sometimes}} compared with squeaky toys. A particularly apt {{example is the}} desert rain frog, {{the subject of a}} widely viewed video titled [...] "World's Cutest Frog," [...] regularly described as making a noise like a squeaky toy. The resemblance is enhanced {{by the fact that the}} frog vocalizes by inflating its body, and then exhaling (relatively) large quantities of air, as if being squeezed. [...] The calls of certain birds have also been compared to squeaky toys; in particular those of the western kingbird, <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kite,</b> and sulphur-bellied flycatcher of North America, and the blue nuthatch of southeast Asia.|$|E
5000|$|While the <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kite</b> {{is not an}} {{endangered}} species, it is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which protects the birds, their eggs, and their nests (occupied or empty) from being moved or tampered with without the proper permits. This can make the bird somewhat of a nuisance when it chooses to roost in populated urban spots such as golf courses or schools. The birds protect their nests by diving at perceived threats, including humans. Staying at least 50 yards from nests {{is the best way}} to avoid conflict with the birds. If unavoidable, wearing a hat or waving hands in the air should prevent contact from being made but will not prevent the diving behavior.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kites</b> are regular {{visitors}} to Nebraska. Prior to 1974, {{there were four}} reports for the state (NBR 33 : 49. 1965), but it has occurred almost annually since then. Almost all reports are from the North Platte and Missouri River valleys, with concentrations of sightings at Fontenelle Forest in Sarpy County, near Aurora in Polk County, and, most recently, in Ogallala, Keith County. Of 39 dated reports, 12 were in May and 13 in September, suggesting spring overshoot migrants and fall dispersal. The first summer report was an adult at Shoemaker Island, Hall County on 10 July, 1983 (NBR 51 : 90). Several other reports are suggestive of breeding. A single bird was seen in Ogallala in 1992, and a territorial male was observed there in 1993 (Richard C. Rosche, pers. comm.). On 6 August, 1994, we found at least 11 <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kites</b> soaring over the north edge of Ogallala, especially {{in the vicinity of}} the hospital. The birds appeared to be foraging and captured several large insects, including a butterfly and a large locust. Our highest count was eight adults and three subadults. The large number of birds suggested that they were breeding nearby, and we watched individual birds in the hope that they might lead us to a nest. After less than 15 minutes of observations, a lone adult suddenly dropped from an elevation of several hundred feet and disappeared into a group of large trees in a nearby residential section of the town. We drove to the area and, at 3 : 50 p. m. MDT (Mountain Daylight Time), found a nest containing two nearly full-grown young. The nest was located 3540 feet above ground in the crotch of a large American elm. It consisted of a loose platform of small twigs, similar in size and shape to that of an American Crow (pers. obs.) ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites,</b> {{peregrine}} falcons and merlins are raptors {{that are}} known to take adult chimney swifts in flight, being among the select few avian hunters fast enough to overtake the appropriately named swift on the wing. Eastern screech-owls have been seen attacking colonies, as have non-avian predators including eastern rat snakes, northern raccoons and tree squirrels. These {{are most likely to}} take nestlings but may take some nesting adults as well. When disturbed by potential predators (including humans) at the colony, adult chimney swifts slap their wings together after arching back and taking flight, making a very loud noise known either as [...] "booming" [...] or [...] "thunder noises". When disturbed, nestlings make a loud, raspy raah, raah, raah sound. Both sounds seem designed to startle potential predators.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} animals prey on {{hummingbirds}} given the opportunity. Due to their small size, hummingbirds are vulnerable even to passerine birds {{and other animals}} which generally feed on insects. On the other hand, only very swift predators can capture them and a free-flying adult hummingbird is too nimble for most predators. Chief among their predators are the smaller, swifter raptors like sharp-shinned hawks, merlins, American kestrels and <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kites</b> as well as domestic cats, loggerhead shrikes and even greater roadrunners, {{all of which are}} likely to ambush the hummingbird while it sits or sleeps on a perch or are distracted by breeding or foraging activities. Predatory lizards and bird-eating snakes may also prey on the species, especially on its tropical wintering grounds. Even large, predatory invertebrates have preyed on ruby-throated hummingbirds, including praying mantises (which have been seen to ambush adult hummingbirds at hummingbird feeders on more than one occasion), orb-weaver spiders, and green Darners. Blue jays are common predators of nests, as are several other corvids in addition to some icterids, bats, squirrels and chipmunks.|$|R
50|$|Birds are common, {{and there}} are 59 species present during at least some years. Seven {{different}} raptors are found, the turkey vulture, American kestrel, golden eagle, ferruginous hawk, red-tailed hawk, <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kite,</b> and the prairie falcon, {{all of which are}} classed as being of least concern according to the IUCN. There is one other bird of prey, the western screech-owl. There are no waterfowl found on Black Mesa. The mourning dove, greater roadrunner, common nighthawk, common poorwill, ladder-backed woodpecker, red-shafted flicker, olive-sided flycatcher, Say's phoebe, ash-throated flycatcher, Cassin's kingbird, and western kingbird are also found. There are five corvids; the black-billed magpie, pinyon jay, American crow, and common raven, as well as the more local Chihuahuan raven.61 species of butterfly are found in the preserve, including seventeen skippers, three swallowtails, four hairstreaks, a copper, four whites, nine true brushfoots, two satyrs, and a leafwing.|$|E
50|$|HNWR {{is located}} within the Central Flyway, a route {{traveled}} annually by numerous species of waterfowl and other migratory birds. The refuge enjoys {{a reputation as a}} premier bird watching destination in North Texas. Although a total of 316 bird species have been recorded on the refuge since it was established in 1946, recent surveys show 273 different bird species are regularly found at HNWR, of which 80 species nest and 193 are migratory. Painted buntings, cardinals, scissor-tailed flycatchers, blue grosbeaks, eastern meadowlarks, northern mockingbirds, blue jays, and red-bellied woodpeckers are common nesting birds. Neotropical migrants such as warblers, tyrant flycatchers, tanagers, orioles, sparrows, and others pass through them each spring and fall with many of these species remaining to nest. Game birds on the refuge include the mourning dove, northern bobwhite and wild turkey. Many declining species either occasionally or commonly occur on the refuge including the American golden plover, prothonotary warbler, painted bunting and Hudsonian godwit. The refuge attracts 15 species of raptors during the fall and spring migration period including the osprey, rough-legged buzzard and Swainson's hawk, hen harrier, sharp-shinned hawk and Cooper's hawk. The refuge provides excellent wintering habitat for bald eagles, particularly along Lake Texoma. Nesting raptors include the red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, hen harrier, <b>Mississippi</b> <b>kite,</b> American kestrel, and the broad-winged hawk.|$|E

40|$|I (Ross Silcock) {{would like}} to point out that {{observers}} who have information which adds to, modifies, or corrects this report are urged to send it to me; it is better published late than not at all! I like to think of these reports as a team effort to advance Nebraska ornithology. Two nesting phenomena were significant this year: the continuing presence of nesting Clark 2 Ì† 7 s Grebes at the west end of L. McConaughy, and the stunning increase in numbers of nesting <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kites</b> in Ogallala. Perhaps missed by some (it was in the Spring report) was the suggestive presence through June of a pair of Sharp-shinned Hawks near Morse Bluff in northern Saunders Co. Of similar significance was the presence of a Merlin on the Pine Ridge. Rosche noted that some species of water-birds began nesting activities much earlier than normal in w NE. Little information was received on the following dabbling ducks, all of which are regular nesters in some numbers in sandhill marshes and, in some cases, the Rainwater Basin and elsewhere: Mallard, Northern pintail, Blue-winged Teal, Northern Shoveler, Gadwall, and American Wigeon; I assume that this means that numbers were as expected by observers and that none were noted out of their normal summer ranges, i. e. a 2 Ì† 2 normal 2 Ì† 2 year. Ditto the diving ducks Canvasback and Redhead...|$|R
40|$|Overall, {{this fall}} {{migration}} was routine (waterfowl, warblers, sparrows), {{but there were}} a few unexpected highlights. The flooded Missouri River Valley provided habitat that led to some amazing fall counts: 3000 pelicans, 5700 coots, 338 American Golden-Plovers, and 1200 Pectoral Sandpipers. The 10, 000 cormorants at Harlan County Reservoir may not have been affected by the Missouri River flooding, and were a record count also. While we 2 Ì† 7 re talking numbers, the martin roost in Omaha topped out at 50, 000 â€“ 55, 000, and seasonal totals of 4 Red-necked Grebes and 15 Philadelphia Vireos for the state, 34 <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kites</b> over Ogallala (it 2 Ì† 7 s often hard to find one), and 45 Lesser Goldfinches banded at Wildcat Hills Nature Center were interesting tallies. Surprising many was the rare occurrence of 4000 â€“ 5000 Sandhill Cranes lingering late into fall; the reports of 5 Snowy Owls {{before the end of the}} period also was a hint of what might follow. Also surprising was the low number of Black-capped Chickadees reported in south-central Nebraska; the NOU meeting held at Audubon Rowe Sanctuary reported chickadees in only one of the 12 counties covered by participants. And, of course, there is always the weird. Two species of vagrant psittacids were reported, neither a threat to our native birds: a Rosy-faced Lovebird and a Budgerigar. One reporter found a Burrowing Owl on the grounds of an Omaha Lowes store (strange enough), but a subsequent reporter, looking for the owl, turned up a Smith 2 Ì† 7 s Longspur in the same place. Maybe Iâ€™ve been trying too hard for the Smith 2 Ì† 7 s! And finally, a Rufous Hummingbird appeared in a Lincoln yard in midÂ·Sep and stayed there all fall until it was captured on 10 Nov and sent to hummingbird heaven at the Henry Doorly Zoo...|$|R
40|$|As {{is often}} the case, the spring season had {{something}} for everyone: potential range expansions, an incredible shorebird migration through the eastern Rainwater Basin, a scarcity of migrant warblers, and some genuinely rare birds. Timely spring rainfall transformed the Rainwater Basin, leaving large areas of sheetwater for migrant shorebirds and improving the attractiveness of wetlands, particularly renovated wetlands, to certain breeding species. Perhaps the most important bits of information we can record here are changes in breeding ranges or behavior. Of significance here is the second nesting record for Hooded Merganser, the increasing occurrence of Greater Prairie-Chickens at Rainwater Basin grasslands, the return of <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kites</b> to Red Cloud, nesting Black-necked Stilts and American Avocets in the Rainwater Basin, discovery of Barn Owls in northeast Nebraska, expansion into the state of Scissor-tailed Flycatchers, possible breeding of Clark 2 Ì† 7 s Nutcrackers on the Pine Ridge, the continued feeding of grackle and robin chicks by the Sioux Co Curve-billed Thrasher (now {{considered to be a}} Husker), increasing evidence of Spotted Towhee introgression at Schramm State Park, and extra-limital nestings of Pine Siskin. The shorebird migration through the Rainwater Basin was one for the ages, with record numbers of Hudsonian Godwits, Ruddy Turnstones, Dunlin, and Buff-breasted Sandpipers found. Numbers of other species were also high, and L Mcconaughy contributed with a record count of Whimbrels. On the other hand, migrant warblers were drastically lower in numbers, notably Nashville Warbler (8), Chestnut-sided Warbler (3), Magnolia Warbler (1), Black-throated Green Warbler (1), and Blackburnian Warbler (0). What this means will have to wait for a regional or national perspective. Rarities were in evidence also, with some real 2 Ì† 2 zooties 2 Ì† 2 : Black-bellied Whistling-Duck, Anhinga, Glossy Ibis, White-tailed Kite, Red Knot, Ruff, Little Gull, White-eyed Vireo (in Sioux Co, no less), and Connecticut Warbler...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kite</b> (lctinia mississippiensis) is {{considered}} extremely rare in Nebraska, with only 8 spring records and 2 fall records (Johnsgard, P. A., 1980, A revised {{list of the}} birds of Nebraska and adjacent Plains States, Occasional papers of the N. O. U., No. 6, Lincoln, Nebraska, 114 pp.). On 10 July 1983, at 12 : 30 CDT, we sighted an adult <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kite</b> circling above a flooded native hay meadow on Shoemaker Island, Hall Co. (Sec. 1, T 9 N R 11 W). The bird was identified by its frosted head and secondaries, pearly gray back and underside, and black retrices. It is believed this Kite was attracted to the area because of the recent flooding of the Platte River. This represents the first record in Hall Co., and the first summer record in Nebraska...|$|E

40|$|There {{was much}} of {{interest}} this spring. Early and late dates, early breeding, {{even a few}} rarities, are scattered through the species accounts. A few highlights are mentioned here. Mark Brogie found 6 species of Gallinaceous birds in one hour in Knox Coâ€”quite a feat. Glossy Ibis reports continue to increase, and <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kites</b> were found in new areas. Cranes made news: a leucistic Sandhill, another Common, and good numbers of Whoopings. Piping Plovers may be spreading out a bit, given {{the disappearance of the}} expanses of sand at L McConaughy, and amazing finds are being made by the team studying Mountain Plovers in Kimball County. Several shorebird species made a huge push 30 Apr: check out the accounts, beginning with American Avocet. The shorebird star had to be Bailey, the transmitter-wearing Long-billed Curlew, who made a rapid transit from wintering to summering grounds. Not far behind was XN, a banded Hudsonian Godwit seen on Chiloe Island, Chile, and next in Dakota Co, Nebraska. Black-billed Magpies have been hit hard in recent years and their progress is mixed, but Carolina Wrens took a beating last winter. A few survived, however, and we will watch their progress. A Bewick 2 Ì† 7 s Wren was a rarity in the southwest, but there was no doubt that the top rarity for the season was the Hermit Warbler photographed at Crescent L NWR; it was Nebraska 2 Ì† 7 s second. Additional rare Parulids found were Pine and Hooded Warblers. An amazing find, {{for the second year in}} a row, was singing Baird 2 Ì† 7 s Sparrows, seemingly acting territorially, in extreme northeast Sioux County. It will be interesting to see if they remain into summer...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} major drought in the {{southwest}} United States on bird life in Nebraska {{has yet to be}} determined, as has the effect of the historic inundation of the Missouri River bottom lands from Gavins Point Dam to Rulo in eastern Nebraska. The water level at McConaughy is coincidentally at a maximum, ensuring that breeding habitat for Piping Plover and Least Tern was much reduced in the state overall. On the other hand, bottom lands wetlands above the flood level were expanded; Black-necked Stilts initiated a late nesting in Dakota Co in flooded fields that also attracted thousands of shorebirds, notably Killdeer and Pectoral Sandpiper. In the Rainwater Basin, good localized water conditions attracted southern herons, notably Little Blue Heron and Snowy Egret, although Great Egret appeared in about normal numbers. Ospreys continued their so far ill-fated nesting attempts in the west, while <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kites</b> added new towns to their list of breeding locations. A large influx of Cassin 2 Ì† 7 s Sparrows occurred in the west, mostly increasing numbers in previously known breeding locations, but with some expansion eastward, notably to Lincoln Co. This {{may be related to the}} extensive drought {{in the southwest}} United States. Grassland conditions in the Panhandle were suitable for Dickcissels (as well as Cassin 2 Ì† 7 s Sparrows); large numbers of Dickcissels were reported from there, a recent phenomenon that has been continuing. Surprisingly, following a strong move into the Panhandle in the last few years, no Lesser Goldfinches were reported. Finally, expansion and range consolidation of several 2 Ì† 2 southeastern 2 Ì† 2 species continued; included were Least Bittern, Glossy Ibis, Chuck-will 2 Ì† 7 s-widow, Acadian Flycatcher, Summer Tanager, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, and Kentucky Warbler...|$|R
40|$|The {{fall season}} {{is a mix}} of summer, fall migration, and winter. Thus there are {{breeding}} records of interest, such as <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kites</b> nesting at Red Cloud, only the 2 nd known location in Nebraska, and only the 3 rd documented breeding record for Northern Parula, despite its common summer residency. Fall migration generates early arrival dates, high counts, and late departure dates, the last seemingly more numerous as our average temperatures increase. Included in the late departure category were several late shorebirds, Great Egret and White-faced Ibis, and even the latest ever Black-throated Blue Warbler. Counts of interest were 3000 Double-crested Cormorants at Harlan Co Res and 588 Cattle Egrets at a single Rainwater Basin wetland. At {{the other end of the}} scale were low numbers of waterfowl, for reasons much speculated upon by hunters as well as birders, the consensus being that wet fall conditions in the Dakotas were holding geese and ducks there. The best count of Mallards by period 2 Ì† 7 s end was only 10, 000, and no other puddle ducks had counts over 500. Geese did not arrive in numbers until the last days of the period. One bright spot was the number of Hooded Mergansers reported; there are almost no breeding records for Nebraska, and so one wonders whether these birds are indeed breeding undetected in the state. Also disappointing were low numbers of Long-billed Dowitchers and especially Buffbreasted Sandpipers in the Rainwater Basin. Arrival of winter birds, especially invasion species, is anticipated each fall; the first of these is usually Red-breasted Nuthatch, which arrives in Aug most years, and this year appeared in numbers, seemingly every feeder hosting at least one. Best single-location count was 15. Exciting was the appearance of several Clark 2 Ì† 7 s Nutcrackers, and a Mountain Chickadee was found near Scottsbluff...|$|R

40|$|Some {{of you may}} {{be curious}} about the sources of {{sightings}} I use to compile these reports. The primary sources are reports posted to NEBirds, the Nebraska Listserv, along with the full reports (early and late dates, peak counts for all species) sent by a few faithful reporters around the state. The latter reports are very useful overviews of movements in the reporters 2 Ì† 7 regions. Lately, thanks to a suggestion by Clem Klaphake, I have been receiving the eBird daily rarity report for Nebraska which I find to be an excellent check against reports posted to NEBirds, while providing a few additional reports of interest. As eBird becomes a major depository and source of data, how {{and to what extent}} these data can be utilized by seasonal reporters and state records committees is a topic under serious discussion. More on that as it unfolds. In these reports, I often cite 2 Ì† 2 early dates 2 Ì† 2 and 2 Ì† 2 late dates. 2 Ì† 2 These follow the style in Birds of Nebraska (Sharpe et al., 2001) and refer to the first or last set of accumulated dates that are within a few days of each other, preferably 3 or fewer, and so presumably define a sort of 2 Ì† 2 consensus 2 Ì† 2 arrival or departure date. Now to the birds. This was an interesting fall in several ways. Raptor enthusiasts were excited about Harris 2 Ì† 7 s Hawk and Crested Caracara reports, while nesting <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kites,</b> Broad-winged Hawks, and Ospreys added interest. An amazing number of wood-warblers were found in the west, notably such rarities as Tennessee, Nashville, Magnolia, Bay-breasted, Chestnut-sided, and Blackburnian. I often think {{that the best way to}} find these 2 Ì† 2 eastern 2 Ì† 2 birds is to go west! A few wood-warblers arrived early: Black-and-white, Tennessee, Nashville, and Mourning. Perhaps most exciting was the appearance of almost the full suite of Rocky Mountain birds and 2 Ì† 2 winter finches 2 Ì† 2 that are somewhat expected from time to time, with Pine Grosbeak the only exception. Steller 2 Ì† 7 s Jay, Mountain Chickadee, Cassin 2 Ì† 7 s Finch, and Evening Grosbeak were out west, Red and White-winged Crossbills were in the east, and Common Redpoll was essentially statewide...|$|R
40|$|New in this Seasonal Report, {{direct from}} the American Ornithologists 2 Ì† 7 Union (along with Wilson 2 Ì† 7 s Snipe, Rock Pigeon, etc.), is the {{modified}} checklist order, featuring geese, swans, and ducks at the beginning, followed by gallinaceous birds, then resuming the familiar order with loons. Perhaps {{the most important}} use for these reports, {{in addition to their}} incorporation into the Southern Great Plains Region summary in North American Birds, is the noting of significant avian events in Nebraska. Some are of obvious importance, but the meaning of others is obscure, perhaps only to be revealed as subsequent reports show a trend, or events noted in Nebraska are corroborated by the same events noted in the other Southern Great Plains states, in Kansas and Oklahoma, or even on a national level. Such events discussed in this report include a good showing of scoters, hints of a recovery of the Gray Partridge population, a sighting of 7 + migrating <b>Mississippi</b> <b>Kites,</b> a Clark 2 Ì† 7 s Nutcracker in Sowbelly Canyon, indications of declines in numbers of Black-billed Magpie, American Crow, and Black-capped Chickadee, westerly Carolina Wrens, rather low numbers of thrushes and warblers, westerly Rose-breasted Grosbeaks possibly breeding, good numbers of Purple Finches, no reports of Red Crossbills after 27 Sep, and few Pine Siskins. A similar category of events, but perhaps better labeled 2 Ì† 2 quirky, 2 Ì† 2 were some strange bobwhite items from the Panhandle, the occurrence of Eurasian Collared-Doves in 74 counties so far, the possibility that the Curve-billed Thrasher at the Frimann Ranch in Sioux County was able to sneak its genes into the Brown Thrasher pool, a Blue Grosbeak carrying a minnow, and an Orange Bishop (a bird, not a Dutch prelate) in Kearney. Among significant early or late dates of occurrence were record late Caspian Terns, Panhandle Gray Catbird, and Bobolink (although the Boblink was unsubstantiated), second-latest Forster 2 Ì† 7 s Tern and Western Kingbird, and record early Northern (Red-Shafted) Flickers eastward. In-your-face numbers were the 321 Hooded Mergansers at L Yankton, 5 Yellow-crowned Night-Herons in the eastern Rainwater Basin, a fall record 247 Upland Sandpipers there also, an almost-record 283 Buff-breasted Sandpipers also in the eastern Rainwater Basin, 26, 000 Franklin 2 Ì† 7 s Gulls at L McConaughy, a record 14 Caspian Terns at Branched Oak L, 30 + Burrowing Owls at a Scotts Bluff County location, and a record 12 Brown Creepers at Arbor Day Farm. And for rarity buffs and state listers, there was limited joy this fall. Best were the 3 rd state record Yellow-billed Loon at L McConaughy and 5 th state record Tricolored Heron in the eastern Rainwater Basin. Significant also was a 3 rd state fall record Hudsonian Godwit, at L McConaughy. Important Panhandle records were a first record Summer Tanager (of the western subspecies cooperi), 2 nd record Ruby-throated Hummingbird (as well as a 2 nd record Archilochus hummingbird), 2 nd record Winter Wren, first fall record Baltimore Oriole, 2 nd fall record Mourning Warbler, and 3 rd fall record Rose-breasted Grosbeak, a male. Other important records were a Tufted Titmouse at Ponca SP, apparently the same bird that was there in May, and the 8 th fall record Rock Wren in the southeast...|$|R
