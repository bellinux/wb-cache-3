5|$|Carbon <b>monoxide</b> is {{produced}} naturally {{by the body}} as a byproduct of converting protoporphyrin into bilirubin. This carbon <b>monoxide</b> also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.|$|E
5|$|Carbon <b>monoxide</b> {{poisoning}} in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon <b>monoxide</b> also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon <b>monoxide</b> than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon <b>monoxide</b> is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon <b>monoxide</b> poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|In {{this process}} lead bullion and slag is {{obtained}} directly from lead concentrates. The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized, forming lead <b>monoxide.</b> Carbon (coke or coal gas) {{is added to}} the molten charge along with fluxing agents.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} ground state of <b>monoxides</b> MO and carbides MC 2 with M an alkaline-earthmetal atom (Be to Ba) has been investigated.

To understand the bonding characteristics, the ELF (electron localization function) and the NBO (natural bond orbitals) have been used. It {{has been found that}} despite many similarities between the <b>monoxides</b> and the carbides there is a difference in the bond formation. The results suggest that in the <b>monoxides,</b> and not in the carbides, a change in the type of bonding occurrs in going from the beryllium compound to the barium compound.

5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} by which the effects of carbon <b>monoxide</b> are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood. Known mechanisms include carbon <b>monoxide</b> binding to hemoglobin, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon <b>monoxide</b> causing brain lipid peroxidation.|$|E
5|$|As many {{symptoms}} of carbon <b>monoxide</b> poisoning also occur {{with many other}} types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon <b>monoxide</b> exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon <b>monoxide</b> in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Carbon <b>monoxide</b> also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity}} for myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. Carbon <b>monoxide</b> bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon <b>monoxide</b> from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E
50|$|Like many <b>monoxides,</b> MnO adopts {{the rock}} salt structure, where cations and anions are both octahedrally coordinated. Also like many oxides, manganese(II) oxide is often nonstoichiometric: its {{composition}} {{can vary from}} MnO to MnO1.045.|$|R

These properties are discussed as signatures of the proximity to a magnetic quantum phase transition. The results are summarized in a new electronic phase diagram for the 3 d <b>monoxides,</b> which resembles that of other strongly correlated systems.

5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon <b>monoxide</b> (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon <b>monoxide,</b> resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon <b>monoxide</b> {{at one of}} these sites {{increases}} the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon <b>monoxide</b> shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon <b>monoxide</b> poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon <b>monoxide</b> acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E

5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon <b>monoxide</b> {{poisoning}} {{develop in the}} organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute carbon <b>monoxide</b> poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of acute carbon <b>monoxide</b> poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon <b>monoxide</b> poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon <b>monoxide</b> {{poisoning}} is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, carbon <b>monoxide</b> poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon <b>monoxide.</b> Carbon <b>monoxide</b> detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E
5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon <b>monoxide</b> poisoning as people with carbon <b>monoxide</b> poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E

40|$|The {{absence of}} a {{crystalline}} SiO phase under ordinary conditions is an anomaly in the sequence of group 14 <b>monoxides.</b> We explore theoretically ordered ground-state and amorphous structures for SiO at P = 1 atm, and crystalline phases also at pressures up to 200 GPa. Several competitive ground-state P = 1 atm structures are found, perforce with Si-Si bonds, and possessing Si-O-Si bridges {{similar to those in}} silica (SiO 2) polymorphs. The most stable of these static structures is enthalpically just a little more stable than a calculated random bond model of amorphous SiO. In that model we find no segregation into regions of amorphous Si and amorphous SiO 2. The P = 1 atm structures are all semiconducting. As the pressure is increased, intriguing new crystalline structures evolve, incorporating Si triangular nets or strips and stishovite-like regions. A heat of formation of crystalline SiO is computed; it is found to be the most negative of all the group 14 <b>monoxides.</b> Yet, given the stability of SiO 2, the disproportionation 2 SiO (s) → Si(s) +SiO 2 (s) is exothermic, falling right into the series of group 14 <b>monoxides,</b> and ranging from a highly negative ΔH of disproportionation for CO to highly positive for PbO. There is no major change in the heat of disproportionation with pressure, i. e., no range of stability of SiO with respect to SiO 2. The high-pressure SiO phases are metallic. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon <b>monoxide</b> binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon <b>monoxide</b> and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E

5000|$|Hope {{was formed}} by Dana Goofball Robertson (formerly of The <b>Monoxides)</b> on vocals/guitars, and Jamie [...] "Jimmy" [...] Oldfield on bass/vocals in 1992 Riverview, New Brunswick. Robertson and Oldfield began writing lyrics {{together}} after finding common philosophical ground in punk music. Hope's first drummer was Chris Lewis (later of Skinkeeper, Mood Cadillac, Iron Giant, etc.). The band released their first demo, New Love, recorded by Derek [...] "Big D" [...] Robichaud (of The <b>Monoxides).</b> Jamie actually sang lead vocals on {{a good portion of}} the first demo, which is quite rare for the band; Dana has for the most part always been known as the vocalist. Chris Lewis parted ways with Hope to move on to other bands and they recruited Ken Kelley (of The <b>Monoxides)</b> to take on drumming duties on Emus Can Fly, their second official demo (1993). After Ken moved on from Hope, a drummer by the name of Luc Daigle joined the band in 1994, along with the addition of Pascal [...] "Pak" [...] Toussaint of Sour Grapes on second guitar (from 1995-1996). This would solidify the Hope lineup for quite a few years. Everythin' About Nuttin' was recorded and mixed by Duane [...] "Doolang" [...] Kelly and released in 1995. It is little known that Luv Your Mummy (1996) was partially recorded by Rick White (Eric's Trip, Elevator) at his home studio, including early versions of some of the songs that would later be re-recorded on Lupus Man, the rest being tracked once again by the mighty Doolang.|$|R

5|$|Carbon <b>monoxide</b> is {{a product}} of {{combustion}} of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of carbon <b>monoxide</b> include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|Carbon <b>monoxide</b> is not {{toxic to}} {{all forms of}} life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with {{hemoglobin}} so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus {{has no effect on}} photosynthesising plants. It is easily absorbed through the lungs. Inhaling the gas can lead to hypoxic injury, nervous system damage, and even death. Different people and populations may have different carbon <b>monoxide</b> tolerance levels. On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period; in addition, employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ("ceiling") of 100 ppm is reached. Carbon <b>monoxide</b> exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage. The carbon <b>monoxide</b> tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including activity level, rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, sickle cell disease and other hematological disorders, barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.|$|E

40|$|Atomic scale {{simulations}} {{are used}} to predict how excess oxygen is accommodated across the group II <b>monoxides.</b> In all cases, the preference is to form a peroxide ion centered at an oxygen site, rather than a single oxygen species, although the peroxide ionic orientation changes from to to with increasing host cation radius. The enthalpy for accommodation of excess oxygen in BaO is strongly negative, whereas in SrO it is only slightly negative and in CaO and MgO the energy is positive. Interestingly, the increase in material volume due to the accommodation of oxygen (the defect volume) does not vary greatly {{as a function of}} cation radius. The vibrational frequency of peroxide ions in the group II <b>monoxides</b> is predicted with the aim to provide test data for future experimental observations of oxygen uptake. Finally, calculations of the dioxide structures have also been carried out.
