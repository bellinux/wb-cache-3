6000|$|Again I {{stood at}} the {{neighbouring}} door, and soon was re-admitted into the cheerful passage with its clear dove-colour imitation marble walls. I followed the portress, and descending a step, and making a turn, I found myself {{in a sort of}} corridor; a side-door opened, Mdlle. Reuter's little figure, as graceful as it was plump, appeared. I could now see her dress in full daylight; a neat, simple mousseline-laine gown fitted her compact round shape to perfection--delicate little collar and <b>manchettes</b> of lace, trim Parisian brodequins showed her neck, wrists, and feet, to complete advantage; but how grave was her face as she came suddenly upon me! Solicitude and business were in her eye--on her forehead; she looked almost stern. Her [...] "Bon jour, monsieur," [...] was quite polite, but so orderly, so commonplace, it spread directly a cool, damp towel over my [...] "vives impressions." [...] The servant turned back when her mistress appeared, and I walked slowly along the corridor, side by side with Mdlle. Reuter.|$|E
60|$|We walked in, and Frances {{rose from}} her seat near the table to receive us; her {{mourning}} attire gave her a recluse, rather conventual, but withal very distinguished look; its grave simplicity added nothing to beauty, but much to dignity; the finish of the white collar and <b>manchettes</b> sufficed for a relief to the merino gown of solemn black; ornament was forsworn. Frances curtsied with sedate grace, looking, as she always did, when one first accosted her, more a woman to respect than to love; I introduced Mr. Hunsden, and she expressed her happiness at making his acquaintance in French. The pure and polished accent, the low yet sweet and rather full voice, produced their effect immediately; Hunsden spoke French in reply; I had not heard him speak that language before; he managed it very well. I retired to the window-seat; Mr. Hunsden, at his hostess's invitation, occupied a chair near the hearth; from my position I could see them both, and the room too, at a glance. The room was so clean and bright, {{it looked like a}} little polished cabinet; a glass filled with flowers in the centre of the table, a fresh rose in each china cup on the mantelpiece gave it an air of FETE, Frances was serious, and Mr. Hunsden subdued, but both mutually polite; they got on at the French swimmingly: ordinary topics were discussed with great state and decorum; I thought I had never seen two such models of propriety, for Hunsden (thanks to the constraint of the foreign tongue) was obliged to shape his phrases, and measure his sentences, with a care that forbade any eccentricity. At last England was mentioned, and Frances proceeded to ask questions. Animated by degrees, she began to change, just as a grave night-sky changes at the approach of sunrise: first it seemed as if her forehead cleared, then her eyes glittered, her features relaxed, and became quite mobile; her subdued complexion grew warm and transparent; to me, she now looked pretty; before, she had only looked ladylike.|$|E

A transient microtubular structure, the <b>manchette,</b> appears around the differentiating spermatid head {{and serves as}} a platform for protein transport to the growing tail. Sperm flagellar 2 (SPEF 2) is known to be essential for sperm tail development. In this study we investigated the function of SPEF 2 during spermatogenesis using a male germ cell-specific Spef 2 knockout mouse model. In addition to defects in sperm tail development, we observed a duplication of the basal body and failure in <b>manchette</b> migration resulting in an abnormal head shape. We identified cytoplasmic dynein 1 and GOLGA 3 as novel interaction partners for SPEF 2. SPEF 2 and dynein 1 colocalize in the <b>manchette</b> and the inhibition of dynein 1 disrupts the localization of SPEF 2 to the <b>manchette.</b> Furthermore, the transport of a known SPEF 2 -binding protein, IFT 20, from the Golgi complex to the <b>manchette</b> was delayed in the absence of SPEF 2.

40|$|Spermatid perinuclear RNA-binding protein (SPNR) is a mi-crotubule-associated RNA-binding {{protein that}} localizes to the manchette in {{developing}} spermatids. The RNA target of SPNR in vivo is unknown, {{although we have}} previously suggested the possibility that SPNR {{is involved in the}} translational activation of the protamine 1 mRNA in elongated spermatids. To increase our understanding of SPNR’s association with the manchette, we sought to determine SPNR’s subcellular localization in several mouse mutants that show reduced fertility or sterility and that have structurally abnormal <b>manchettes.</b> We show here that de-spite the highly abnormal <b>manchettes</b> and microtubule aggre-gates formed in azh, hop-sterile, tw 2, and tw 8 mutants, SPNR re-mains associated with the <b>manchettes.</b> Localization of SPNR to the abnormal <b>manchettes</b> suggests that SPNR is tightly bound to the manchette. SPNR could bind manchette microtubules di-rectly, or it could bind indirectly via an interaction with a mi-crotubule-associated protein (MAP). We sought to determine whether SPNR binds microtubules in vitro, and if so, whether it requires a MAP. We show by Western analysis that the endog-enous SPNR protein can be pelleted with murine testis micro-tubules in a taxol-dependent manner in vitro. A recombinant version of SPNR produced in bacteria can also be pelleted with testis microtubules, as well as microtubules polymerized from purified bovine brain tubulin, an association that is salt-sensi-tive. These results suggest that SPNR, in addition to its function as an RNA-binding protein, is also a bona fide MAP...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe manchette is a {{transient}} structure that develops during spermiogenesis. It {{consists of three}} components: a perinuclear ring, a microtubule mantle inserted in the ring, and dense plaques attached at the distal end of the mantle. A procedure has been developed for the fractionation of intact <b>manchettes</b> from rat spermatids. Each fractionation step was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence using an antibody to unmodified α-tubulin. Indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopy demonstrate that fractionated <b>manchettes</b> are relatively intact. A thermocleavage step was used to sever the microtubule mantle from the perinuclear ring. Microtubules of the mantle collected in a stabilizing buffer containing Taxol formed long bundles of side-by-side aligned microtubules. The perinuclear ring sample consisted of circular-shaped units of different diameter with truncated microtubules still attached to the ring, a property that enabled the initial recognition of the rings by α-tubulin antibody staining. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblotting experiments using isoform-specific antibodies to α-tubulins show that the manchette contains acetylated, tyrosinated, glutamylated α-tubulin and an α- 3 / 7 tubulin isoform. The same α-tubulin isoforms were observed in the axoneme of the sperm tail. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fractionation maps of silver-stained proteins of the intact manchette show four predominant proteins: α- and β-tubulins, β-actin, vimentin, and a 62 -kDa protein. The latter persisted in thermocleaved perinuclear ring samples. Results {{of this study indicate}} that the newly developed procedure for the fractionation of <b>manchettes</b> will facilitate a direct characterization of posttranslationally modified tubulin variants, microtubule-associatedproteins, and the components of the perinuclear ring of this largely neglected structure of the spermiogenic process...|$|E

40|$|Sequence {{analysis}} of a mouse testicular alpha-tubulin partial cDNA, pRD alpha TT 1, reveals an isotype that differs from both the somatic and the predominant testicular alpha tubulins at approximately 30 % of the 212 amino acid residues determined. Although this mouse testicular cDNA retains the highly conserved sequence, Glu-Gly-Glu-Glu, found in the carboxyl termini of many alpha tubulins, the protein extends substantially beyond this sequence and does not terminate with a C-terminal tyrosine. Using rabbit antiserum prepared to a novel synthetic peptide predicted from this mouse testis alpha-tubulin cDNA, we have have detected by immunoblot and indirect immunofluorescence an antigenic epitope present in testicular alpha tubulin that is not detectable in brain alpha tubulins. We find that the antiserum specifically binds to the <b>manchettes</b> and meiotic spindles of the mouse testis but not with neural fibers or tubulin extracts of the adult mouse brain.

40|$|CLIP- 170 is a {{microtubule}} "plus-end-tracking protein" {{implicated in}} the control of microtubule dynamics, dynactin localization, and the linking of endosomes to microtubules. To investigate the function of mouse CLIP- 170, we generated CLIP- 170 knockout and GFP-CLIP- 170 knock-in alleles. Residual CLIP- 170 is detected in lungs and embryos of homozygous CLIP- 170 knockout mice, but not in other tissues and cell types, indicating that we have generated a hypomorphic mutant. Homozygous CLIP- 170 knockout mice are viable and appear normal. However, male knockout mice are subfertile and produce sperm with abnormal heads. Using the knock-in mice, we followed GFP-CLIP- 170 expression and behavior in dissected, live testis tubules. We detect plus-end-tracking GFP-CLIP- 170 in spermatogonia. As spermatogenesis proceeds, GFP-CLIP- 170 expression increases and the fusion protein strongly marks syncytia of differentiated spermatogonia and early prophase spermatocytes. Subsequently GFP-CLIP- 170 levels drop, but during spermiogenesis (post-meiotic development), GFP-CLIP- 170 accumulates again and is present on spermatid <b>manchettes</b> and centrosomes. Bleaching studies show that, as spermatogenesis progresses, GFP-CLIP- 170 converts from a mobile plus-end-tracking protein to a relatively immobile protein. We propose that CLIP- 170 has a structural function in the male germline, in particular in spermatid differentiation and sperm head shaping...|$|E

Adjacent 0. 5 - 0. 9 - micron sections of polyethylene glycol-embedded tissues were incubated with affinity-purified MAP 4 or tubulin antibodies, and the immunofluorescent images were compared.

MAP 4 antibody labeled microtubules in vascular elements of all tissues and in other cells considered to have supportive functions, including Sertoli cells in the testis and glial elements in the nervous system.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{work in our}} {{laboratory}} {{has shown}} that a 62 - to 64 -kDa protein was {{a major component of}} the perinuclear ring of <b>manchettes</b> fractionated from rat spermatids. Mass spectrometry analysis of this protein indicated the presence of a glycine-rich domain homologous to human keratin 9 (K 9). Several antibodies to K 9, raised against synthetic peptides of human K 9, recognized the 64 - to 62 -kDa protein in the perinuclear ring of the manchette as well as in keratinocytes of the suprabasal layer of the rat and human footpad/sole epidermis in both immunoblotting and immunocytochemical experiments. Based on these data, human-derived K 9 primers were used to clone rat K 9 cDNA from epidermis by RT-PCR. Rat-specific K 9 primers were then used to perform a two-step (nested) PCR to amplify the K 9 -specific rat testicular RNA and to obtain cDNA to demonstrate K 9 gene expression in rat testis. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat K 9 cDNA contains 618 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 63, 020 Da, in agreement with that obtained by electrophoretic fractionation of rat manchette and epidermis footpad proteins. The deduced protein structure correlates with the recognizable pattern of keratins: a rod domain of 304 amino acids with well-conserved initiation and termination sequences (MQNLNSRLASY and EIETYRKLLEG, respectively), flanked by glycine/serine-rich head and tail domains of 141 and 173 amino acids, respectively. A high content of phenylalanine was detected in the head domain and a repetitive motif (SGGSYGGGS) in the tail domain. A comparison with human keratin 9 showed an overall nucleotide and amino acid similarity of 75 %. An increased level of K 9 transcripts was detected in a cDNA library prepared from fractionated round spermatids. Results of this study show that rat testis expresses K 9 and that this protein is a component the perinuclear ring of the manchette of rat spermatids...|$|E

40|$|Les rivalités syndicales depuis quelques années au Québec font l’objet des <b>manchettes</b> des journaux. Comme les grèves, à cause de leur caractère sensationnel, elles attirent l’attention et posent à {{plusieurs}} des points d'interrogation. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to evaluate the extent of union rivalry in the Province of Québec starting from union certification votes ordered by the Québec Labour Relations Board. Unions were classified in four categories according to their affiliation (or non-affiliation) : a) CNTU ; b) CLC; c) District 50 UMW; d) Independent. During the period April 1, 1964 to March 31, 1965, the QLRB ordered 79 votes. In 56 of them, two or more unions were involved seeking for the right to represent the workers in the bargaining unit. As it is normal, on account of their respective strength and militancy, CNTU and CLC unions are those which are more often in competition, either organizing simultaneously unorganized workers or fighting one another. In 20 % of cases, locals of those two Central bodies were seeking for representation of unorganized workers. Locals holding a certification belonging to the CLC were more often attacked by other unions. In the 37 cases where an already certified union was contested, we find 20 belonging to the CLC and only 6 belonging to the CNTU. Locals affiliated to the CLC were mostly attacked by CNTU : 13 cases out of 20  ; when the former attacked CNTU locals only in 2 cases. The action of CLC was directed against Independent unions (5), District 50 of UMW (4) and even against locals belonging to CLC (3). The agressivity to remove a union already holding a certificate is almost the same among the CLC (14) and among the CNTU (17). Locals belonging to CLC are more often than any others the target in raids. Among the 37 cases where a local already certified sees its certification contested, 20 belong to the CLC whereas only 6 belong to the CNTU. And the locals affiliated to CLC were attacked by CNTU 13 times out of 20 while those attacked CNTU locals only 2 times. The action of CLC locals aimed at Independent unions (5), District 50 UMW (4) and even against locals belonging to CLC (3). Agressivity to remove an already certified union is about the same in the CLC (14) as in the CNTU (17). During the period April 1, 1965 to March 31, 1966, union certification votes ordered by the QLRB where two unions or more were involved have been less numerous. There were only 29. Simultaneous action by CNTU and CLC for organizing the same non-organized workers decreased to a great extent. While during the previous year there were 11 cases ; in 65 - 66, there were only 3. But the action of those two Central bodies against independent unions remained the same. In general, when a local (CNTU or CLC) attempts to remove an already certified union, it is successful while the same action taken by an independent union usually fails. In both years, union rivalry does not exist only between locals belonging to different central bodies, but also between locals affiliated to the same central body...|$|E

We have identified tau in rat and bovine testis, a unique non-neuronal location, using biochemical, molecular, and immunologic approaches. SDS-PAGE of ammonium sulfate-fractionated, testis heat-stable MAPs resulted in an enrichment of bands that comigrated with rat brain tau, Only the 35 - 45 % precipitated ammonium sulfate fraction induced microtubule assembly. Immunoblotting with mono-clonal anti-tau antibodies demonstrated tau immunoreactivity in these testis MAP preparations. Northern analysis of total rat testis RNA demonstrated a 1. 7. kb band that hybridized with a 51 -nucleotide oligomer complementary to a conserved portion of the tau transcript. This 51 -mer identified a similar 1, 7 -kb minor band and an additional 6 -kb major band in Northern analysis of total rat brain RNA, Finally, in the bull testis, immunohistochemistry localized tau to the spermatid <b>manchette,</b> a transient, cross-linked microtubule network of unknown function. As spermatid elongation begins, the <b>manchette</b> forms a sheath around the posterior aspect of the nucleus, but, by the completion of nuclear condensation, the <b>manchette</b> is largely disassembled.

40|$|Nuclear {{condensation}} during spermiogenesis in the ostrich {{follows the}} basic pattern established in other vertebrates. The fine granular nuclear substance of early spermatids is gradually replaced by numbers of coarse dense granules which appear to arise by aggregation of smaller dispersed {{elements of the}} chromatin. The granules increase in size and eventually coalesce to form the compact homogenous mass of chromatin typical of the mature sperm. In ostrich spermatids, however, the aggregation of the nuclear material produces large numbers of longitudinally oriented rod-shaped structures in addition to some granular material. Although fibrillar chromatin has been observed during spermiogenesis {{in a number of}} vertebrate species, the hollow nature of the rod-shaped chromatin granules in ostrich spermatids is a unique phenomenon. The spiralisation of the chromatin material observed in ostrich spermatids and in some other nonpasserine birds is possibly related to the reduction in nuclear length demonstrated during spermiogenesis in these species. In common with other nonpasserine birds, spermiogenesis in the ostrich is characterised by the appearance both of a circular and a longitudinal <b>manchette.</b> The circular <b>manchette</b> consists of a single row of microtubules reinforced by additional peripherally arranged microtubules. Links between adjacent microtubules, and between the nucleolemma and some of the microtubules, are evident. The longitudinal <b>manchette</b> consists of arrays of interconnected microtubules arranged in approximately 4 – 6 staggered, ill defined rows. This structure seems to originate {{as a result of the}} rearrangement of the microtubules of the circular <b>manchette</b> and is only formed once the process of chromatin condensation is well advanced. Based on the sequence of morphological events observed during spermiogenesis in the ostrich, it is concluded that the circular <b>manchette</b> is responsible for the initial transformation in shape of the spermatid nucleus. Thereafter, the chromatin condenses independently within the confines of the nucleolemma with the circular <b>manchette</b> merely acting to maintain the shape of the nucleus while this process is underway, to compress the nuclear membrane, and possibly to orientate the subunits of the condensing chromatin. The longitudinal <b>manchette</b> appears to assist in the translocation of material during spermatid elongation. There are indications that the developing acrosome is instrumental in effecting nuclear shaping of the apical (subacrosomal) head region of the ostrich spermatid...|$|R
