5|$|In 1867 the Cambridge and Colchester {{branch line}} of the Great Eastern Railway was built through the castle, cutting across and largely {{destroying}} the inner bailey in order to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new station. The railway line was later closed in 1967 {{as part of the}} Beeching Axe.|$|E
5|$|Initial works {{commenced}} in August 2007, when Pastasentralen was demolished to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> temporary {{bus terminal}} {{that would allow}} Kaigaten to be closed for construction. Contracts for building the line were awarded to Svein Boasson, NCC Construction, Fyllingen Maskinstasjon and Veidekke Entreprenør. The contract for laying the tracks was awarded to Baneservice.|$|E

5|$|The Alan B. Shepard Civic Center ("The Dome"), a {{significant}} {{building in the}} city's history, was constructed in 1958, and was dedicated to the career of former Virginia Beach resident and astronaut Alan Shepard. As the area changed, the Dome was frequently used as a bingo hall. The building was razed in 1994 to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> municipal parking lot and potential future development.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} was converted into {{housing in the}} 1950s, and in May 1970 the station building was demolished to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new bus station. The cargo building was refurbished {{to serve as a}} station building for passengers and as offices. The wharf was sold by the municipality in 1987, and the last train to serve the station departed on 31 December 1990. Most of the line and infrastructure is however intact.|$|E
5|$|A full upgrade of {{the station}} {{was carried out in}} 1987. A main {{incentive}} was that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration wanted the station building removed to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new interchange towards Jar. Therefore, Kielland's station building was demolished in 1987. The new station building, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and Arne Henriksen, was built in glass and concrete with a dominant portal presenting the staircases. On the island platform a new ticket booth was built in steel and glass. The platform was covered by a roof of laminated wood and plywood held up by galvanized steel columns. The roof followed the shape of the curved platform and featured a gable.|$|E

5|$|After Groundskeeper Willie {{takes away}} Bart's {{skateboard}} for destroying his leaf pile, Bart fills up Willie's shack with creamed corn {{as he is}} sleeping, destroying it. As Willie is taken away for medical attention, he swears revenge on Bart. Meanwhile, Krusty the Clown's show comes under criticism by the Federal Communications Commission for not being educational enough for children. The Channel 6 executive proposes that Krusty cut ten minutes from his three-hour show to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> kids' news program, Kidz News, where children deliver and report news items. Lisa is recruited as a news anchor along with other Springfield Elementary School children. Bart is not chosen at first, but is made sportscaster after he complains to Marge.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium's {{original}} scoreboard was a black, non-descript, rectangular {{unit with}} a two line reader panel. In 1985, it {{was moved to}} beside the left field foul pole to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new rectangular 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3m) high with a fully animated reader panel. The original unit was then used as an out-of-town scoreboard, displaying the scores of other baseball games. When the guitar display was installed in 1993, the original scoreboard was removed and replaced by the second scoreboard, which became the new out-of-town board. From 2008 to 2014, the out-of-town scoreboard {{was not used to}} display scores; instead it was used only as a support for additional advertising signage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area {{inhabited}} predominantly {{by people of}} African descent, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961. Other than one apartment building, {{none of the other}} buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.|$|E

5|$|Many {{artefacts}} {{are displayed}} at the Mutsu Memorial Museum in Tōwa-chō. This is a successor to a local museum funded by the town of Suō-Ōshima which opened in July 1970. To <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new road, this museum was moved in April 1994 to a new building. Since 1963, a memorial service has been held here every year on 8 June in honour of the crew. A very {{large portion of the}} bow was located at Suo-Oshima until at least 2012, but it may have been moved or lost.|$|E
5|$|Papoose Peak Jumps was a {{ski jumping}} hill located at Squaw Valley Ski Resort in the US state of California. The hill {{consisted}} of three jumps, with K-points of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. Constructed upon the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, it was built for the 1960 Winter Olympics; the 80-meter hill hosted the ski jumping event and the 60-meter hill the Nordic combined event. The jump was designed by Heini Klopfer and opened in 1958. After the Olympics the venue saw little use; it was renovated for the 1976 US National Ski Jumping Championships, but has since fallen into disrepair and demolished to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ski lift.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 2 {{opened in}} December 1991 as the Charter/International Terminal, serving all {{international}} flights and some domestic flights to the airport. It was {{located at the}} site of two previous terminals, one for PSA Airlines and the other for American Airlines. The PSA terminal was converted to an international terminal before both terminals were demolished to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single Terminal 2. It had two stories and eight gates (T2-1 through T2-8), four of which could receive international flights. Terminal 2 closed upon the opening of Terminal 3, and it was demolished in early 2016.|$|E

5|$|Plans for the {{single-track}} Queens Super Express Bypass for the IND Queens Boulevard Line {{had been}} doubled to two tracks in 1972. The BMT Jamaica Line from 121st Street to 168th Street would be demolished to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{connection to the}} lower level of the Archer Avenue Line, which extended east to Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer. A year later, a final design for the Northeast Queens LIE line was published, while other final engineering for the Southeast Queens line was imminent. In the summer of 1972, ground was broken on the Southeast Queens Line along Archer Avenue to 147th Place. Two southeast Brooklyn IRT routes—the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line extension to Avenue W, {{as well as an}} IRT Eastern Parkway Line branch under Utica Avenue to Avenue U—were being designed. The MCTA, which was by now renamed the MTA, were rerouting the proposed IRT Pelham Line branch to Co-op City via New Haven Railroad right of way.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2000 season, Six Flags New England {{was known}} as Riverside Park. Six Flags {{purchased}} the park and added their own DC Comics theming. The site that Superman the Ride operates on is the former site of the Riverside Park Speedway. The Speedway was demolished after the 1999 season to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new themed area, DC Superhero Adventure. As part of the $40 million expansion, the park built Superman: Ride of Steel. Six Flags worked with Swiss manufacturer, Intamin, to build and design the ride a year earlier. The final track piece of Superman was installed on March 27, 2000, about 40 days before opening day. The ride officially opened on May 5, 2000 as the tallest and longest roller coaster on the East Coast of the United States. The entrance and station were themed to Superman with Superman logos {{and a picture of}} him located above the entrance. The second tunnel also had a mist effect.|$|E
5|$|The Boston and Maine Railroad built a new, {{more modern}} station in 1952 but reused the 1914-built platforms. This single-story {{building}}, {{located on the}} south side of the tracks at Mt. Vernon and Exchange streets, was in the same flat-roofed brick style as Winchester Center and Wedgemere built five years later. The building was the first on the Boston & Maine system to have radiant heat, and also included a restaurant and newsstand. The 1895-built station was demolished to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> parking lot. Saugus Branch service ended in May 1958, leaving through service on the Eastern Route as the only trains serving Lynn. Around this time, the third and fourth tracks through the station were removed due to reduced traffic, leaving the station with effectively two side platforms serving two tracks.|$|E

5|$|The {{suitability}} {{of the prison}} was finally brought to a head at the 1821 assizes in York, when an official complaint was made and an investigation begun. The decision was taken to purchase Clifford's Tower and the Waud house, {{with the aim of}} demolishing them both to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new, more modern prison. Sydney Smith, the famous wit, writer and vicar of Foston-le-Clay, successfully led a campaign to save Clifford's Tower, emphasising the historic importance of the location for the surrounding city. An alternative proposal, put forward by architect Robert Wallace, would have seen the conversion of Clifford's Tower back into a habitable building to form the hub of a radial prison design, but this was turned down.|$|E
25|$|Due to deteriorating {{conditions}} and undercapacity, the bascule bridge was torn down in 2006 to <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> hybrid suspension/cable-stayed bridge. The suspension/cable-stayed bridge fully opened on May 23, 2008.|$|E
