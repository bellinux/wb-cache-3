Inside the cart, expansion cards were connected using the [...] "Minibus" [...] system, using a 36-pin card connector with an 8-bit data bus.

50|$|A {{graduated}} {{neutral density filter}} can be {{also used}} to improve the reproduction of the exposure range of the scene, by darkening bright parts of the image. A graduated filter will reduce the extreme highlights of an image, such as a clear, open sky as well as sunlight. The filter is usually an even gradation of neutral gray to clear, covering the top third to half of the filter in gray. Therefore, it mostly affects the top third to half of the frame's exposure, leaving the highlights in the bottom half to two-thirds unaffected. Often these filters are the square gelatin, polycarbonate, or glass type. A <b>mounting</b> <b>kit</b> such as a square frame receptacle mounted to interchangeable screw-in rings will hold the filter at an appropriate orientation. These can be mounted {{to the end of}} an SLR lens camera in the same fashion as a polarizing lens, UV filter, and various other screw-in type filters for SLR and DSLR cameras.|$|E
5000|$|Low riders are {{specifically}} designed to be mounted on a specific kind of fork.Touring bicycles usually have a front fork {{with one or two}} threaded eyelets for M5 bolts on the front dropout on each side. These are for mounting fenders and/or luggage carrier. Another mid-fork eyelet [...] "braze-on" [...] is positioned 160 to 175 mm above it for mounting a low rider front luggage carrier. [...] There is no established standard for the position of the mid-fork eyelet. Most low riders are adjustable to compensate for this.Some forks have mid-fork eyelets on the inside as well as outside to provide mounting of some specialized carriers such as the Tubus Duo.For bicycles that do not have these eyelets or [...] "braze-ons", various alternatives exist. Some of these {{come in the form of}} [...] "U-Bolts", clamps, or some sort of clamp-on eyelet (see Tubus Aluminum Alloy Fork <b>Mounting</b> <b>Kit)</b> When installing carriers, a drop of thread locking compound is advised to ensure that the screws do not loosened from vibrations under load.|$|E

40|$|This project aims {{to develop}} MEMS {{actuators}} {{to aid in}} the study of insect flight mechanics. Specifically, we are developing actuators that can stimulate the antennae of the crepuscular hawk moth Manduca Sexta. The possible mechanosensory function of antennae as airflow sensors has been suggested, and recent discoveries of our collaborators reveal that mechanosensory input from the antennae of flying moths serves a similar role to that of the hind wings of two-winged insects, detecting Coriolis forces and thereby mediating flight stability during maneuvers. Early evidence suggests that mechanical stimulus of the antennae may enable flight control. In addition, the crepuscular hawk moth Manduca Sexta has a wide wingspan (~ 110 mm) and is capable of carrying at least one quarter of its own weight. Thus, studying the flight of Manduca Sexta by attachment of microsystems seems plausible. The goal of our project is to design and fabricate micromechanical actuators, which will be mounted onto the moth antennae. Our collaborators will study the flight control mechanism by mechanical stimulation. Our first step was to fabricate "dummy" silicon rings for our biologist collaborators for implant experiment. A series of mounting kits were developed, and {{due to the nature of}} the moth antennae, ring-beam-ring construction was finally designed and fabricated, like a "shackle", to meet the mounting requirements. Next, we integrated actuators onto the <b>mounting</b> <b>kit.</b> Piezoelectric film/sheet, piezoelectricbender and piezoelectric-stack were considered as the actuators. Live testing was also taken while the moth was resting or flapping its wings. The moth apparently responds to the mechanical stimulus under both circumstances, by swinging its wings and abdomen. Actuation amplifier was also modeled and tested, which might be used for future mechanical stimulators. by Hui Zhou. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|Another {{important}} contribution of Geloso were <b>mounting</b> <b>kits.</b> The kits allowed for TVs and radios to be home-assembled almost from scratch, beginning with raw metal frames onto which components were installed. There {{was also a}} user-friendlier line of pre-assembled, pre-calibrated kits and, also available, were cabinets, knobs, keys, etc. - all branded Geloso. Bulletins instructed how to calibrate finished units. By 1969 - the year John Geloso died - S.p.A. Geloso had become an empire of eight manufacturing facilities. Production persisted till 1972, when the business closed. Several were {{the reasons for the}} end of activities: fierce foreign competition, managerial problems, union demands and massive indebtedness to banks.|$|R
