40|$|In earlier reports (1, 2) it {{has been}} shown that various {{oxidized}} marine oils, when administered orally to hypertensive rats, reduces their blood pressure in a way similar to that of renal extracts (3). In view of the expense and technical difficulty involved in preparing active extracts from kidney tissue, compared to the less laborious procedure of obtaining equally effective agents from readily available marine oils, the latter appeared to be a better source of the desired product. We have, therefore, investigated a number of <b>marine,</b> vegetable and <b>animal</b> <b>oils,</b> as sources of this material as well as methods for the preparation and concentration of extracts suitable for administration to animals or to human patients. Our results have consistently shown the effectiveness of these products in ‘the experimental animal (rats and dogs) and show promise in preliminary studies on man.

40|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>animals</b> contain various {{carotenoids}} {{that show}} structural diversity. These <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> accumulate carotenoids from {{foods such as}} algae and other animals and modify them through metabolic reactions. Many of the carotenoids present in <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> are metabolites of β-carotene, fucoxanthin, peridinin, diatoxanthin, alloxanthin, and astaxanthin, etc. Carotenoids found in these animals provide the food chain as well as metabolic pathways.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of {{identification of the}} authenticity for various <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> drugs was investigated by a fingerprinting method based {{on the distribution of}} nucleoside compounds, and a new method for the discrimination of precious animal drugs was provided. Sixteen nucleoside compounds in various <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> drugs were determined by hydrophilic interaction liguid chromatography-electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry(HILIC-ESI-TOF/MS). Characteristic fingerprint based on the distribution of 16 nucleosides was constructed, and it was used for identification of the authenticity of various <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> drugs combined with similarity analysis and clustering analysis. The results indicated that the proposed characteristic fingerprint could reflect the inherent characteristics of their own for various <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> drugs. Furthermore, it could be used to distinguish different <b>marine</b> <b>animal</b> drugs combined with similarity analysis and clustering analysis. In conclusion, the developed fingerprinting method {{is expected to be a}} powerful tool for the identification of animal drugs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract As {{some species}} of marine yeasts can colo-nize {{intestine}} of <b>marine</b> <b>animals,</b> {{they can be}} used as probiotics. It has been reported that β-glucans from marine yeast cells can be utilized as immuno-stimulants in <b>marine</b> <b>animals.</b> Some siderophores or killer toxins produced by marine yeasts have ability to inhibit growth of pathogenic bacteria or kill pathogenic yeasts in <b>marine</b> <b>animals.</b> The virulent factors from marine pathogens can be genetically displayed on marine yeast cells, and the yeast cells displaying the virulent factors can stimulate <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> to produce specific antibody against the pathogens. Some marine yeast cells are rich in proteins and essential amino acids and can be used in nutrition for <b>marine</b> <b>animals.</b> The <b>marine</b> yeast cells rich in lipid can be used for biodiesel production. Recently, {{it has been reported that}} some strains of Yarrowia lipolytica isolated from marine environments can produce nanoparticles. Because many marine yeasts can remove organic pollutants and heavy metals, they can be applied to remediation of marine environments. It has been shown that the enzymes produced by some marine yeasts have many unique properties and many potential applications...|$|R

This chapter compares the total energetic cost of straight line swimming for both <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> and AUVs, using cost of transport (COT) as a comparative metric. COT is a normalised measure of the energetic cost of transporting the animal’s or vehicle’s mass over a unit distance. It includes non propulsion power requirements as well as considering the energy lost by actuators and mechanical couplings and energy lost in the wake. Comparisons presented in this chapter show that <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> typically have higher optimum COT than engineered systems of equivalent size. However parallels may be drawn, for example, to increase range both <b>marine</b> <b>animals</b> and AUVs appear to favour reducing non-propulsion power costs and travelling slowly to ensure operating at the minimum COT...|$|R
