5|$|In 1990 Hata {{argued that}} the {{recently}} released <b>monologue</b> of Emperor Hirohito, the former Emperor's recollection of wartime Japan which he recorded shortly after World War II, had likely been created {{to prove to the}} United States that he was not involved in war crimes and consequently Hata theorized that an English language translation must have also been drawn up at the same time, a theory which was mocked by right-wing scholars who felt the <b>monologue</b> was created as a simple historical record without ulterior motives. In 1997 the English language draft was discovered.|$|E

5|$|The novel {{frequently}} changes narrative perspectives, using {{a significant}} amount of interior <b>monologue,</b> direct speech and dramatic irony. Though employing an omniscient narrator who occasionally describes the events from a broad perspective, the novel tends to shadow a handful of characters closely, principally Stephen Wraysford, Isaebelle Azair, Micheal Weir, Jack Firebrace and Elizabeth Benson.|$|E

50|$|The group {{struggled}} with the “Harold” format, and Hillman, as Artistic Director, guided them towards their own signature performance format, “The Morris”, which was discovered during a rehearsal sequence. “The Morris” is long-form improvisation based on personal <b>monologues</b> followed by scene development. It was named after Saved By the Bell character Zack Morris, who would often engage the audience with <b>monologues</b> both before and during scenes, {{in a way that}} was similar to the use of <b>monologues</b> in “The Morris”. Eventually, the form became three individuals delivering short, personal, extemporaneous opening <b>monologues</b> based on an audience suggestion. These <b>monologues</b> give inspiration to a series of improvised scenes in a montage-style format.|$|R
5|$|Max Payne 2 is a third-person shooter, {{in which}} the player assumes the role of Max Payne, but also plays as Mona Sax in a few levels. Initially, the player's weapon is a 9mm pistol.

To move the game along, the player is told what the next objective is through Max's internal <b>monologue,</b> in which Max iterates what his next steps should be.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 7, 1988 {{with a budget}} of $15 million. Filming began in Jackson, Mississippi, where the production team filmed a church being burned down. The sequence required a multiple-camera setup; {{a total of three}} cameras were used during the shoot. On March 8, the production team filmed a scene set in a motel where Anderson (Hackman) delivers a <b>monologue</b> to Ward (Dafoe). On March 10, production moved to a remote corner of Mississippi, where the crew filmed the burning of a parish church.|$|E
5|$|The poets Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine worshipped Wagner.

5|$|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} rewrite {{of the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior <b>monologue,</b> and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E
5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross Scott, is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner <b>monologue</b> of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E
5|$|Burger's Daughter details a {{group of}} white anti-apartheid activists in South Africa seeking to {{overthrow}} the South African government. It {{is set in the}} mid-1970s, and follows the life of Rosa, the title character, as she comes to terms with her father Lionel Burger's legacy as an activist in the South African Communist Party (SACP). The perspective shifts between Rosa's internal <b>monologue</b> (often directed towards her father or her lover Conrad), and the omniscient narrator. The novel is rooted {{in the history of the}} anti-apartheid struggle and references to actual events and people from that period, including Nelson Mandela and the 1976 Soweto uprising.|$|E
