40|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} (OAM) technique provides a new degree of freedom for information transmissions in <b>millimeter</b> wave communications. Considering the spatial distribution characteristics of OAM beams, a new OAM spatial modulation (OAM-SM) <b>millimeter</b> wave communication system is first proposed for future mobile networks. Furthermore, the capacity, average bit error probability and energy efficiency of OAM-SM <b>millimeter</b> wave communication systems are analytically derived for performance analysis. Compared with the conventional multi-input multi-output (MIMO) <b>millimeter</b> wave communication systems, the maximum capacity and energy efficiency of OAM-SM <b>millimeter</b> wave communication systems are improved by 36 % and 472. 3 %, respectively. Moreover, numerical {{results indicate that the}} proposed OAM-SM <b>millimeter</b> wave communication systems are more robust to path-loss attenuations than the conventional MIMO <b>millimeter</b> wave communication systems, which makes it suitable for long-range transmissions. Therefore, OAM-SM <b>millimeter</b> wave communication systems provide a great growth space for future mobile networks...|$|R
5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. This method is mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several <b>millimeters</b> in size (see picture).|$|E
5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of <b>millimeters</b> per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium.

40|$|From <b>millimeter</b> {{observations}} of classical T Tauri stars, {{it is suggested}} that dust grains in circumstellar disks have grown to <b>millimeter</b> size or larger. However, gas drag on such large grains induces rapid accretion of the dust. We examine the evolution of dust disks composed of <b>millimeter</b> sized grains, and show that rapid accretion of the dust disk causes attenuation of <b>millimeter</b> continuum emission. If a dust disk is composed mainly of grains of 1 cm − 1 m, its <b>millimeter</b> emission goes off within 10 6 yr. Hence, grains in this size range cannot be a main population of the dust. Considering our results together with grain growth suggested by the <b>millimeter</b> continuum observations, we expect that the <b>millimeter</b> continuum emission of disks comes mainly from grains in a narrow size range of [1 mm− 1 cm]. This suggests either that growth of <b>millimeter</b> sized grains to centimeter size takes more than 10 6 yr, or that <b>millimeter</b> sized grains are continuously replenished. In the former case, planet formation is probably difficult, especially in the outer disks. In the latter case, reservoirs of <b>millimeter</b> grains are possibly large (� 10 m) bodies, which can reside in the disk more than 10 6 yr. Constraints on the grain growth time-scale are discussed for the above two cases. Subject headings: accretion, accretion disks — planetary systems: formation — solar system: formation 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{aspiration}} {{to control}} the weather is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military Operation Popeye, an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the North Vietnamese monsoon. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding; they include the fog- and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains, and techniques to suppress hail. A recent example of weather control was China's preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. China shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites {{in the city of}} Beijing {{in an effort to keep}} rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 <b>millimeters</b> falling in Baoding City of Hebei Province, to the southwest and Beijing's Fangshan District recording a rainfall of 25 <b>millimeters.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight <b>millimeters</b> square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four <b>millimeters</b> square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into the cement are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{not only}} affects {{in-flight}} operations but can affect ground-based airport operations as well. Small accumulations of ash can reduce visibility, create slippery runways and taxiways, infiltrate communication and electrical systems, interrupt ground services, damage buildings and parked aircraft. Ash accumulation {{of more than}} a few <b>millimeters</b> requires removal before airports can resume full operations. Ash does not disappear (unlike snowfalls) and must be disposed of in a manner that prevents it from being remobilised by wind and aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The Eastern small footed bat {{is between}} 65 and 95millimeters in length, has a {{wingspan}} of 210 to 250millimeters, and weighs between 4 and 8grams. The bat {{got its name}} from its abnormally small hind feet, which are only 7 to 8 <b>millimeters</b> long. The fur on the dorsal side of their body is dark at the roots, and fades to a light brown at the tips, which gives the bats a signature shiny, yellow-brown appearance. The fur on the dorsal {{side of the body}} is a dull gray color, which is believed to help camouflage themselves in their hibernacula. The defining characteristic of this bat is its face-mask, which is completely black. They also have black ears, wings and interfemoral membrane, (the membrane between the legs and tail). Like all bats, the Eastern small-footed bat has a patagium that connects the body to the forelimbs and tail, allowing the animal to fly. Their head is very flat and short, with a forehead that slopes gradually away from the rostrum, a feature that is unique to other individuals in the Myotis species. They have erect ears, which are very broad at the base and a short flat nose. They have a keeled calcar (protruding cartridge on the hind legs to support the interfemoral membrane) as well as a pointed tragus Their tail is between 25-45 <b>millimeters</b> in length and protrudes past their interfemoral membrane, and they have a dental formula of 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown–roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few <b>millimeters</b> long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E
5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few <b>millimeters.</b> Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E

Certain species are protected through fady that forbid hunting them, including sharks, rays and crocodiles. Many fady also exist to regulate relations between the sexes. For instance, it is taboo for a girl to wash her own brother's clothing. Conservative communities adhere to a fady against medical injections, surgery or modern medicines due to their association with their historic enemies the Merina, who were the first to use them widely; instead, tromba ceremonies and traditional herbal remedies are commonly used for healing.

5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment—one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or <b>millimeters</b> in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets by the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.|$|E
5|$|Iran {{lies within}} the complex zone of {{collision}} between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate; near Qeshm {{the rate of}} convergence is about 25 <b>millimeters</b> annually. Part of this convergence is accommodated by shortening within the Zagros fold and thrust belt, with the remainder occurring {{to the north of}} the Iranian Plateau. The most active part of the Zagros is the 'Simply Folded Belt', which is characterised by large folds formed above a layer of late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Hormuz salt, which locally reaches the surface in the crests of some anticlines as salt diapirs. The sedimentary rocks above the salt layer comprise a basal Cambrian conglomerate and a thick sequence of limestones of Palaeozoic to Upper Cretaceous age, known together as the 'Competent Group' due to their relatively high competence, followed by a sequence of mechanically weaker marls and interbedded limestones of latest Cretaceous to Lower Miocene age topped by Neogene sandstones and conglomerates. There is evidence of intermediate level detachment at some of the weaker layers, leading to folds at different stratigraphic levels have different locations, orientations or wavelengths. Earthquake focal mechanisms and hypocentral depths show that shortening is accommodated by a mixture of high-angle and low-angle reverse faulting, within either the lowest part of the sedimentary cover or in the basement beneath the Hormuz salt.|$|E
