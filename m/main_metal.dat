2500|$|Soon Sardinia, a land rich in mines, notably {{copper and}} lead, saw the {{construction}} of numerous furnaces {{for the production of}} alloys which were traded across the Mediterranean basin and nuragic people became skilled metal workers; they were among the <b>main</b> <b>metal</b> producers in Europe [...] and with bronze they produced a wide variety of objects and new weapons as swords, daggers, axes, and after drills, pins, rings, bracelets, typical bronze statuettes, and the votive bronze boats that show a close relationship with the sea. Tin may have drawn Bronze Age traders from the Aegean where copper is available but tin for bronze-making is scarce; [...] The first verifiable smelting slag has come to light, its appearance in a hoard of ancient tin confirms local smelting as well as casting. [...] The usually cited tin sources and trade in ancient times are those in the Iberian Peninsula or from Cornwall. Markets included civilizations living in regions with poor metal resources, such as the Mycenaean civilization, Cyprus and Crete, as well as the Iberian peninsula, a fact that can explain the cultural similarities between them and the Nuraghe civilization and the presence in Nuragic sites of late Bronze Age Mycenaean, west and central Cretan and Cypriote ceramics, as well as locally made replicas, concentrated in half a dozen findspots that seem to have functioned as [...] "gateway-communities.|$|E

50|$|Metals {{were also}} a very {{important}} part of the Mycenaean economy, during the Mycenaean period there were five metals in use: gold, silver, copper, tin and lead. Iron was not unknown but was very rare. Therefore, bronze was the <b>main</b> <b>metal</b> for the making of tools and weapons. Although bronze was the most important metal for the Mycenaeans, it was relatively scarce and expensive. Our knowledge of the Mycenaean bronze industry comes entirely from Pylos where we have some information about smiths. Most of the tablets concerning bronze demonstrate a very tight control of the metal industry by the palace.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mountains}} are primarily composed of granite {{surrounded by an}} envelope of mica-schist and much older rocks such as quartzite.

The mountains owe much of their present topography to the effects of the last ice age, which deepened the valleys and created corrie and ribbon lakes. Copper and lead have been the <b>main</b> <b>metals</b> mined in the mountains and a brief gold rush occurred in the 18th century.|$|R
