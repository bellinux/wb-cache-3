40|$|A Masters Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The NEWTON project intends to replace the existing ceramic hermetic packaging by a novel non-hermetic polymer packaging for high power semiconductors (thyristors). Polymer electrical packaging material candidates have been identified by reverse engineering, by literature review and by using Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES) software. The potential materials identified are polyimide (PI), polyetherimide (PEl), liquid crystal polymers (LCP), poly (phenylene sulphide) (PPS), and epoxy (EP). In addition, two design options (ceramic replacement and over moulded) were selected, out of four, based on all the known issues and the requirements. PEl, PI, LCP, PPS and EP were the selected materials for the ceramic replacement design option and PEl, PI and EP for the over-mould design option. Ceramic replacement option was ranked as the best choice {{on the basis of}} the device stability during injection moulding. After a data survey of different producers, a few specific grades for candidate materials were selected. Polymer packaging has to overcome certain identified issues such as non-hermeticity (moisture absorption and transmission), high thermal expansion, voids and micro-voids, weldlines, stress, aging etc., which could be the potential reasons for the device failure. Coatings could also be a good solution to avoid failure due to nonhermeticity. Electrical degradation and breakdown in polymers was facilitated by moisture absorption and transmission, ionic impurities, ionizing radiations, oxidation, poorly dispersed antioxidants, micro-structure defects, aging and low tensile strength etc. A computer generated component model, designed on the ceramic replacement option, was analysed through <b>Moldflow</b> software. The wall shear stress values were compared with the recommended values. The thickness of the model was increased until the wall shear stress values reached just near the recommended values for all the analysed materials. Hence, two models A and 8 were selected for further in depth analysis using pin point tunnel gates. <b>Moldflow</b> results were compared for both models (A and B) and for all the materials. This showed that the PI material and the model A were the best choices. Finally, the candidate materials were quantitatively compared based by reverse engineering, CES materials selection, literature review, electrical degradation, nonhermeticity and <b>Moldflow</b> results. The PI material was the final choice, followed by PEl, PPS, and LCP. Injection moulding was identified as the best processing method. The package quality had to be improved by combined approach of part design, MoldFiow simulation, mould design and controlled processing (plasticising, filling, cooling etc.). Therefore, after 1 the selection of the model 'A', it was further optimised by reducing the fin sizes. This new model was named as 'C' and was further analysed using a disc gate. The parameters and the dimensions of the sprue and the disc gate were selected and optimised based on the <b>Moldflow</b> results.

40|$|Injection molding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and most {{important}} methods of processing thermoplastic polymers. Analysis of injection molding is difficult because of the non-Newtonian flow of the polymer melt. This non-Newtonian flow also influences the physical properties of the solidified part. An optical access mold was designed and built to allow viewing of the melt during the molding of a rectangular plaque. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the midplane velocity field of STYRON 615 APR during mold filling. The gate pressure, flow front shapes and front propagation velocities were also measured. These measurements were compared to <b>Moldflow</b> simulations. <b>Moldflow</b> was found to be accurate for the bulk of the flow, with an average vector orientation error of 1. 7 degrees. The ratio of cavity-averaged PIV velocity magnitudes to <b>Moldflow</b> average magnitudes had a mean of 0. 998 and a standard deviation of 0. 25. This deviation was due to problem areas near the cavity walls and the flow front. <b>Moldflow</b> also had difficulty predicting realistic flow front shapes. A power-law model of the flow was developed and was used to predict the gate pressure. The model and the measured gate pressure were used to estimate the power-law parameters of the melt. The power-law exponent was found to be 0. 4063, within 0. 4 % of the value measured by capillary rheometer. The power-law coefficient was found to be 2659 Pa-s^n, within 9. 5 % of the measured value. Velocity fields during packing were also measured. The random component of the flow was initially 10 - 20 % and grew to 60 - 80 % after 2. 5 seconds of packing. The random component increased as the packing pressure was decreased. The mass flow during packing was modeled analytically as a combination of compressibility and solidification effects. Two limiting cases of the model bracketed the experimental data within 20 %.

40|$|Powder {{injection}} moulding (PIM) is a versatile technology {{capable of producing}} complex and near net shape parts. Significant help in optimisation of the PIM process {{can be obtained from}} the numerical simulation. To obtain realistic numerical results it is necessary to fulfil certain conditions. The material properties should be correctly determined in the conditions close to those during the real powder {{injection moulding}}. The process must be described with the appropriate mathematical model. Also proper initial and boundary conditions must be chosen. In this study a standard feedstock of stainless steel 316 L produced by BASF AG has been characterised for determining the input parameters for the numerical simulation. Viscosity of the feedstock was measured in the wide range of shear rates at four temperatures using the capillary rheometer. Specific heat of the studied feedstock was measured with an advanced DSC apparatus at different cooling rates.

Simulation of the PIM process using a material model for a Generalised Newtonian Fluid has been performed with three best known commercial packages, C-Mold, <b>Moldflow</b> and ProCAST. The obtained simulation results have been compared {{with each other and with}} the experimentally determined ones (melt front advancement, weld line locations, in-cavity temperatures and pressures).
