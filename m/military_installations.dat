5|$|After {{the early}} 20th century, few fortifications {{were built in}} Malta. However, new <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> such as airfields began {{to be built in}} World War I, when the {{seaplane}} base of RAF Kalafrana and the airfield at Marsa were built. More airfields were built in the interwar period and the Second World War, including RAF Hal Far, RAF Ta Kali, RAF Luqa, RAF Safi, RAF Krendi and Ta' Lambert Airfield.|$|E

5|$|Below the {{national}} headquarters level {{there are eight}} geographic regions {{and a handful of}} overseas squadrons at various <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> worldwide. Each region, commanded by a CAP colonel, encompasses several statewide organizations referred to as wings. The eight regions are the Northeast, Middle East, Southeast, Great Lakes, Southwest, North Central, Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Regions.|$|E
5|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} of the Philippines, American soldiers were ordered to withdraw from Manila, and all <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> were removed on December 24, 1941. General Douglas MacArthur declared Manila an open city to prevent further death and destruction, but Japanese warplanes continued to bomb it. Manila was occupied by Japanese forces on January 2, 1942.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, when Kwajalein of the Marshall Islands {{was secured}} by the U.S. forces, Sergeant Fernando Bernacett from Puerto Rico {{was among the}} Marines who were sent to guard various {{essential}} <b>military</b> <b>installations.</b> Bernacett, a combat veteran of the Battle of Midway, guarded the airport and POWs, {{as well as the}} atomic bomb as it was transported to Japan.|$|E

5|$|Sales are {{primarily}} derived from branded ice cream parlors, quick-serve restaurants, {{and the distribution}} of its pre-packaged items to convenience stores, food service operators such as schools, hospitals, prisons, <b>military</b> <b>installations,</b> sports stadiums, amusement parks, and assisted living centers. Pre-packaged items are also sold in regional supermarkets, but this accounts for a minority of the company's sales.|$|E
5|$|The Svalbard Treaty {{specifies}} that no <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> {{are permitted}} on the archipelago. The Soviet authorities {{were concerned that}} a permanent civilian airport {{could also be used}} by Norwegian and NATO forces. But the Soviets also needed an airport to serve their settlements at Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and by the early 1970s, an understanding was reached between the two countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of San Juan were furious with Capt. Rivero-Méndez and blamed {{him for the}} destruction wreaked on their city by American bombardments. Nothing came of those recriminations and Capt. Rivero-Méndez was ordered {{to turn over the}} keys of all the <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> in San Juan to Captain Henry A. Reed of the U.S. Army after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 was signed.|$|E

5|$|Værnes Air Station {{is one of}} two air {{stations}} in Central Norway, the other being Ørland Main Air Station. There are no aircraft permanently stationed at Værnes, but the station serves the Home Guard, including its training center and the headquarters of the Trøndelag District (HV-12). Most of the <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> are located {{on the north side of}} the runway, although some are also located on the south side, to the east of the civilian terminal. Værnes also serves as a storage base for the United States Armed Forces as part of the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway. The military owns the runways and taxiways, but these are operated by Avinor. Three to four hundred military aircraft are handled at the air station each year. The <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> contain places for up to six aircraft of the size of a C-5 Galaxy and barracks to house 1,200 soldiers. The Ring Road connects the northern to the southern installations and passes the main runway on the east side.|$|E
5|$|As elsewhere, {{sabotage}} {{was employed}} against enemy {{military and economic}} assets, with railway lines and bridges being common targets. The activities of Groupe G, a small student resistance cell based in Brussels, alone are estimated to have cost the Nazis 10 million man-hours of labour to repair damages done. Direct attacks on German troops and <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> were rarer, yet one estimate puts the number of German soldiers killed by the Belgian resistance in 1941 as higher than in all of France.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{impending}} threat of Dot, storm signals were raised {{along the north}} and central Philippines. The metropolis of Manila was placed on typhoon alert, forcing the mobilization of emergency crews. Seven domestic and two military flights were called off. Additionally, railway and shipping services were cancelled. All United States <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> in the Philippines were placed in a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness and two airbases, Clark Air Base and Cubi Point NAS, were evacuated. Schools and many offices were shut down in preparation of Dot.|$|E

5|$|In particular, {{intelligence}} gathering {{played a major}} role. Around 6,000 Belgian civilians were involved in gathering intelligence on German <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> and troop movements and communicating {{it back to the}} Allied armies. The organization was run through a large number of independent groups and included, notably, the large Dame Blanche (White Lady) network. Alongside {{intelligence gathering}} were similar organisations which helped men wishing to join the Belgian Army on the Yser Front escape occupied Belgium, usually to the neutral Netherlands. Around 32,000 were successfully smuggled out which boosted the size of the Belgian force considerably.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the private}} sector, {{military}} weather forecasters present weather conditions to the war fighter community. Military weather forecasters provide pre-flight and in-flight weather briefs to pilots and provide real time resource protection services for <b>military</b> <b>installations.</b> Naval forecasters cover the waters and ship weather forecasts. The United States Navy provides a special service to both themselves {{and the rest of}} the federal government by issuing forecasts for tropical cyclones across the Pacific and Indian Oceans through their Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, the Knights of Columbus {{has been}} {{involved}} in evangelization. In 1948, the Knights started the Catholic Information Service (CIS) to provide low-cost Catholic publications for the general public as well as for parishes, schools, retreat houses, <b>military</b> <b>installations,</b> correctional facilities, legislatures, the medical community, and for individuals who request them. Since then, CIS has printed millions of booklets, and thousands of people have enrolled in CIS correspondence and on-line courses.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{consisted}} of American air raids against Japanese <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> on Formosa (Taiwan) {{during the day}} and Japanese air attacks at night against American ships. Japanese losses exceeded 300 planes destroyed in the air, while American losses amounted to fewer than 100 aircraft destroyed and two cruisers damaged. This outcome effectively deprived the Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet of air cover for future operations, which proved decisive during the Battle of Leyte Gulf later in October.|$|E
5|$|The {{collectivization}} {{efforts in}} the 1930s led to the concentration of the reindeer herds in kolkhozes (collective farms), which, in turn, were further consolidated into a few large-scale state farms in the late 1950s–early 1970s. By the mid-1970s, the state farms were further consolidated into just two, based in Lovozero and Krasnoshchelye. The consolidations were rationalized by the necessity to isolate the herders from the <b>military</b> <b>installations,</b> {{as well as by}} the need to flood some territories to construct hydroelectric plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{country was}} bombed by the Allies on 27 June 1944, {{killing at least}} 35. The Sammarinese {{government}} declared {{the same day that}} no <b>military</b> <b>installations</b> or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter. In early July, it announced that prominent signs had been put up at the border crossings by the German command, to instruct German units not to enter the territory, and again reiterated its complete neutrality.|$|E
