5|$|A Twitterbot is a {{computer}} program that automatically posts on Twitter, they are programmed to tweet, retweet, and follow other accounts. According to a recent report, there were 20 million, fewer than 5%, of accounts on Twitter that were fraudulent in 2013. These fake accounts are often {{used to build large}} follower populations quickly for advertisers, while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase. Twitter's wide-open application programming interface and cloud servers <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> twitterbots' existence within the social networking site.|$|E

5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E
5|$|The Emerging and Voluntary Measures Policy {{allows a}} state to add {{unconventional}} forms of heat island mitigation. This can include removing pollution after {{it has already been}} emitted into air, water, or soil. These measures are not implemented into law, but they do <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> certain parties to voluntarily become more efficient. The purpose of this policy is for all polluting sources to follow by example and use the most successful forms of mitigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which {{is attached to the}} lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E
