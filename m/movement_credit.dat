Some within the <b>movement</b> <b>credit</b> David Bercot with introducing {{them to the}} possibility of living out a truly primitive faith. Bercot was, at one time, an Anglican who began a small congregation in Texas that existed along Primitive Catholic lines, but he has since become an Anabaptist. Nevertheless, Bercot's popular tape series [...] "What the Early Christians Believed" [...] remains in distribution among Primitive Catholics both for theological education and, in some places, for Christian formation.|$|E
5000|$|Bishop William A. Rice had {{encouraged}} Ganey in his efforts. His successor, Bishop David Francis Hickey, showed strong support also. Eight Jesuits {{were sent to}} the World Institute of Cooperatives in St. Louis to learn this aspect of missiology and Fr. William Moore, S.J., was assigned to full-time work in the cooperative movement. Moore became the first president of the Belize Credit Union League, while the Belizean government opened a special department of cooperatives and sent civil servants abroad for further study of the <b>movement.</b> <b>Credit</b> unions and cooperatives remain important elements in the national economy of Belize. In {{the latter part of the}} 1950s, two foreign-owned companies were purchasing lobster tails from Belizean fishermen at 40 cents a pound and whole lobsters at 16 cents a pound, then exporting them to the United States where they sold them for $2.40 per pound. In the early 1960s, some local fishermen established their own fish processing plant and marketing operation. The new operation, although inefficient, immediately realized significant savings, enabling the fishermen to double their income. Ganey wrote of his experience with empowerment: “During my ten years in British Honduras, experience has taught me, if nothing else, the great fact that I should not try to dominate the movement. This applies as well to my years of action in the Fiji Islands. It is a difficult lesson to learn and I learned by many mistakes. We hurt the people and the movement if we figure too positively in the program.” ...|$|E
40|$|The Gay Games {{is firmly}} {{established}} on the contemporary global sports calendar, but is seldom canvassed in mainstream sports media, or considered {{a model for}} sports administrators. This is regrettable, as the Games’ ethos offers many clues into the relationships between individual and communal empowerment for homosexual and heterosexual participants alike, while providing a site of resistance against entrenched norms of elitism, nationalism, victory and record-breaking indicative of the modern Olympic <b>movement.</b> <b>Credit</b> for this inclusive ethos rests with the vision of inaugural Gay Games organiser Dr. Tom Waddell. Drawing on Games archives, this paper outlines Waddell’s vision, then discusses {{the impact of a}} protracted legal dispute instigated by the United States Olympic Committee in 1982 over {{the use of the term}} ‘Olympics’ in association with Gay Games I and II. Four United States Federal court rulings are examined, with particular reference to the contrasting hierarchy of private intellectual property and public civil rights considered under United States law of the time. Domestic and international legacies of the dispute are also briefly examined, focusing on the inherent tensions between the state-sanctioned protection of Olympic terminology, the ideals of free speech, the ownership of common sporting terms, and the potential discriminatory effects of selective trademark enforcement. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of how Waddell’s vision superseded each of these legal technicalities to ensure the Games continues to provide a viable model for inclusive and engaged participation for all people. <br /...|$|E

In this paper we propose a tractable general equilibrium asset pricing model with heterogeneous firms that links movements in stock and bond markets to macroeconomic activity.

We show that <b>movements</b> in <b>credit</b> spreads forecast recessions by predicting future movements in corporate investment.
