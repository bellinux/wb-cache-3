5|$|After {{hearing the}} story, an {{unidentified}} woman from Cincinnati, Ohio, told a WLWT TV reporter in June 2014 that her 13-year-old daughter had attacked {{her with a}} knife, and had written macabre fiction, some involving the Slender Man, who the mother said <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> attack.|$|E
5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E
5|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who had {{recently}} returned from a diplomatic visit to the United Nations, visited {{the site of the}} explosion on August 7. She was berated by local residents; some were angry because her surprise visit halted work at the site, and others thought her presence was politically <b>motivated.</b> <b>The</b> president stayed briefly, visited the CEMAR and met Bonfatti. Kirchner's entourage was surrounded by members of La Cámpora, who tried to prevent demonstrations against her and keep journalists and residents at bay.|$|E

5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the Act {{is that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing to the collapse of almost all industry codes.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{victories}} in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> American Medical Association in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component of medical school curricula, but the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After World War II, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.|$|E
5|$|Multiple escape {{attempts}} were made {{throughout the history of}} the prison camp, but the majority ended in failure. In one attempt, foursoldiers were recaptured by the Japanese. The guards forced all prisoners to watch as the foursoldiers were beaten, forced to dig their own graves and then executed. Shortly thereafter, the guards put up signs declaring that if other escape {{attempts were}} made, tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee. Prisoners' living quarters were then divided into groups of ten, which <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> POWs to {{keep a close eye on}} others to prevent them from making escape attempts.|$|E

5|$|The Bedouin iqtaʿat {{were small}} {{compared}} {{to those of the}} mamluk (manumitted slave soldier) emirs, though a number of sultans granted particularly generous iqtaʿat to the amir al-ʿarab. The distribution of iqtaʿat to the tribes was done, at least in part, to persuade them not plunder the unfortified towns and villages of the countryside as they were normally wont to do, and to induce them to cooperate with the state. The frequent rebellion of the tribes also <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> Mamluks to incorporate them into the iqtaʿ system. The iqtaʿ of the amir al-ʿarab would often be confiscated in cases of rebellion against the sultan. In general, Salamiyah and Palmyra consistently served as iqtaʿat of the amir al-ʿarab, continuing into the early Ottoman era, when the iqtaʿ was supplanted by the timar. Besides Salamiyah and Palmyra, the Ottomans granted the amir al-ʿarab timar grants in the Hawran plain south of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The {{shift in}} support by the Soviet Union <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> Barre regime to seek allies elsewhere. It {{eventually}} settled on Russia's Cold War arch-rival, the United States, {{which had been}} courting the Somali government for some time. The U.S. eventually gave extensive military support. Following the disastrous Ogaden War, Barre's government began arresting government and military officials under suspicion {{of participation in the}} abortive 1978 coup d'état. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad where they formed the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF), the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force. Among these opposition movements were the Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA), a Gadabuursi group which had been formed in the northwest to counter the Somali National Movement (SNM) Isaaq militia.|$|E
5|$|The view of {{communism}} was also affected by evidence of espionage in the US conducted by {{agents of the}} USSR. In 1945, a Soviet spy, Elizabeth Bentley, repudiated the USSR and provided a list of Soviet spies in the US to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI also had access to secret Soviet communications, available from the Venona decryption effort, which revealed significant efforts by Soviet agents to conduct espionage within the US. The growing influence {{of communism}} {{around the world and}} the evidence of Soviet spies within the US <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> Department of Justicespearheaded by the FBIto initiate an investigation of communists within the US.|$|E

5|$|BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and CGRO (with BATSE) was deorbited in 2000. However, the {{revolution}} {{in the study of}} gamma-ray bursts <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion. The first such mission, HETE-2, launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period. One of the most successful space missions to date, Swift, was launched in 2004 and as of 2016 is still operational. Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically slewed to observe afterglow emission following a burst. More recently, the Fermi mission was launched carrying the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's Large Area Telescope. Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{attempted}} {{to place the}} work within a particular genre. MTV compared the song's style to the group Devo and new wave music. El País described the piece as an electropop song {{that contributed to the}} viral spread of the Christian Bale rant after its release on the Internet. Dose described it as an electro jam session which made adept use of sampling from the audio of Bale's rhetoric. The Los Angeles Times called the piece a lively pop music tribute to the actor. USA Today called the song fun dance music and creatively <b>motivated.</b> <b>The</b> Toronto Sun praised its original lyrics and use of audio from the incident, and described the piece as a fusion of electro-pop styles and a good song for dancing. New Musical Express recommended the piece, and described it as electro-rock which astutely sampled Bale throughout the song. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the piece as a form of new wave music which used the most spasmodic segments of the incident, and commented that the end product was comedic. The Arizona Daily Star described the piece as a pop music dance song.|$|E
5|$|The first Siege of Krujë {{occurred}} in 1450 when an Ottoman army of approximately 100,000 men laid siege to the Albanian town of Krujë. The League of Lezhë, led by Skanderbeg, experienced low morale after losing Svetigrad and Berat between 1448 and 1450. Nevertheless, Skanderbeg's exhortations {{and the support}} of the clergy, who claimed to have had visions of angels and victory, <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> Albanians to defend the capital of the League, Krujë, at all costs. After leaving a protective garrison of 4,000 men under his trusted lieutenant Vrana Konti (also known as Kont Urani), Skanderbeg harassed the Ottoman camps around Krujë and attacked the supply caravans of Sultan Murad II's army. By September the Ottoman camp was in disarray as morale sank and disease ran rampant. The Ottoman army acknowledged that the castle of Krujë would not fall by strength of arms, lifted the siege, and made its way to Edirne. Soon thereafter, in the winter of 1450–51, Murad died in Edirne and was succeeded by his son, Mehmed II.|$|E

5|$|The great {{demand for}} Harry Potter books <b>motivated</b> <b>the</b> New York Times {{to create a}} {{separate}} best-seller list for children's literature in 2000, just before the release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. By 24 June 2000, Rowling's novels {{had been on the}} list for 79 straight weeks; the first three novels were each on the hardcover best-seller list. On 12 April 2007, Barnes & Noble declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site. For the release of Goblet of Fire, 9,000 FedEx trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book. Together, Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble pre-sold more than 700,000 copies of the book. In the United States, the book's initial printing run was 3.8million copies. This record statistic was broken by Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, with 8.5million, which was then shattered by Half-Blood Prince with 10.8million copies. 6.9million copies of Prince were sold in the U.S. within the first 24 hours of its release; in the United Kingdom more than two million copies were sold on the first day. The initial U.S. print run for Deathly Hallows was 12million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon and Barnes & Noble.|$|E
5|$|Two {{important}} legal {{decisions in}} the 1930s helped increase the accessibility of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued {{each other in the}} Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.Rose, Melody, Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.Tone, p. 178: Tone calls the ruling a coup d'etat for Sanger.
