The official tally of the state's electoral votes was submitted with an invalid seal (bearing the coat of arms of the office of the Secretary of the State of Arkansas versus the seal of the state of Arkansas bearing the state arms).|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics admired the wit and humour. The book reviewer for The Globe and Mail admitted he grew impatient with the grand and repetitive statements about the changing global food system and the authors' hyperbole regarding their modest culinary discoveries. Compared to Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle, The 100-Mile Diet {{was found to be}} <b>more</b> <b>compelling</b> and easier to read, with Smith and MacKinnon more relatable and sympathetic than Kingsolver.|$|E
5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently <b>more</b> <b>compelling</b> than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with The Sporting News in August 1951, Chandler cited his decision to void a trade between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox for outfielder Dick Wakefield as {{a major factor in}} his inability to secure a new contract. The Yankees traded Wakefield to the White Sox for cash, but Wakefield refused to report to the White Sox after a salary dispute, leading to a disagreement between the teams over who was responsible for his salary. Chandler voided the trade, making Wakefield's contract the Yankees' responsibility and angering their owner, Del Webb. It was not until the 1970s that Chandler began to cite his involvement in the integration of baseball as a reason for his contract not being renewed. Historian John Paul Hill considers this unlikely, however, because two of Chandler's strongest allies, Connie Mack and Walter Briggs, Sr., were ardently opposed to integration while William DeWitt, the second owner in the American League to integrate, voted against him. Hill points to the Dick Wakefield dispute, as well as Chandler's investigations of Del Webb and Cardinals owner Fred Saigh involving their rumored connections to gambling interests, as <b>more</b> <b>compelling</b> reasons for Chandler's dismissal.|$|E

However, Germany was fast becoming an industrialized state with increased rural exodus to the cities.

At the same time, however, his oeuvre includes many original melodies, creative leaps, and relaxed or driving rhythms. Armstrong's playing technique, honed by constant practice, extended the range, tone and capabilities of the trumpet.

The network had planned to join other broadcast and cable networks in the telecast; however, Game 4 of the ALCS between the Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland Athletics did not end until 8:30p.m. Eastern Time, about the time the debate ended. The Blue Jays won the game 7-6 in 11 innings.

2500|$|At a {{keynote speech}} before the International Crisis Group, the {{secretary}} brought her view regarding {{the empowerment of}} women specifically into the area of peacemaking, saying that women's multifaceted ties with a community make them <b>more</b> <b>compelled</b> to concern about social {{and quality of life}} issues that prosper under peacetime conditions. Furthermore, women identify more with minority groups, being discriminated against themselves. Thus, [...] "Women are the largest untapped reservoir of talent in the world. It is past time for women to take their rightful place, side by side with men, in the rooms where the fates of peoples, where their children's and grandchildren's fates, are decided." [...] She also continued to believe that empowerment of women would continue to grow as people saw that it would lead to economic growth.|$|R
5000|$|Bachstrom {{was born}} in 1688 {{the son of a}} barber near Rawicz, Poland. By 1708 he studied {{theology}} in Halle and since March 1710 in Jena [...] in Germany. He moved to Stroppen in Silesia to become a preacher, but was refused based on doubts about his orthodoxy. In 1717 he became a professor at the gymnasium of Toruń. He was expelled from this city after a heterodox sermon had resulted in much disorder. He moved to Wengrow, then a centre for Reformation movements in Poland, where he combined the offices of physician and pastor. By 1729 he, somehow, was in Constantinople where he established a printing shop and undertook to translate the Bible into Turkish. This led to much consternation and he was once <b>more</b> <b>compelled</b> to flee a city.|$|R
50|$|Thompson's second play, White Biting Dog (1984), was an expressionistic {{and poetic}} black comedy about an {{eccentric}} and wildly self-destructive family.

25|$|The {{universality}} of {{many aspects of}} cellular life is often pointed to as supportive evidence to the <b>more</b> <b>compelling</b> evidence listed above. These similarities include the energy carrier adenosine triphosphate (ATP), {{and the fact that}} all amino acids found in proteins are left-handed. It is, however, possible that these similarities resulted because of the laws of physics and chemistry, rather than universal common descent and therefore resulted in convergent evolution. In contrast, there is evidence for homology of the central subunits of Transmembrane ATPases throughout all living organisms, especially how the rotating elements are bound to the membrane. This supports the assumption of a LUCA as a cellular organism, although primordial membranes may have been semipermeamble and evolved later to the membranes of modern bacteria, and on a second path to those of modern archaea also.|$|E
25|$|Skinny Puppy {{formed in}} 1982 {{as a side}} project for Kevin Crompton in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Crompton was {{dissatisfied}} with the pop direction of his then-current band Images in Vogue, and began Skinny Puppy {{with the intention of}} doing something <b>more</b> <b>compelling</b> and experimental. Images in Vogue had become a popular act in Vancouver, achieving several radio hits and opening for groups such as Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, and Roxy Music. Initially Crompton had planned Skinny Puppy to be a side project while he continued his work in Images in Vogue; however, when Images in Vogue later relocated to Toronto, Crompton made Skinny Puppy his full-time project. Crompton had already created the name for the project and recorded several songs when he asked Kevin Graham Ogilvie to join. Ogilvie had been a roommate of Images in Vogue member Gary Blair Smith and had met Crompton at a party in late 1982. To avoid the confusion of having two people named Kevin in one band, the pair created stage names, with Crompton becoming cEvin Key and Ogilvie becoming Nivek Ogre.|$|E
25|$|Early {{evidence}} relating tobacco smoking to {{mortality and}} morbidity came from observational studies employing regression analysis. In {{order to reduce}} spurious correlations when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models {{in addition to the}} variable of primary interest. For example, suppose we have a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of interest, and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years. Researchers might include socio-economic status as an additional independent variable, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to some effect of education or income. However, it is never possible to include all possible confounding variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also cause people to smoke more. For this reason, randomized controlled trials are often able to generate <b>more</b> <b>compelling</b> evidence of causal relationships than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as instrumental variables regression may be used to attempt to estimate causal relationships from observational data.|$|E
30|$|The {{perception}} of insecurity in the destination area can differ {{depending on whether}} the migration decision is domestic or international. This is an important consideration in the case of Mexico, since the high rates of migration to the USA mean that potential movers likely simultaneously consider relocating either to the USA or elsewhere in Mexico (Aguayo-Téllez and Martínez-Navarro, 2012). If a country in its entirety is believed to be unsafe, a household may be <b>more</b> <b>compelled</b> to move abroad. For example, Wood et al. (2010) find that the increase in crime in the 1980 s that plagued most of Latin America increased the probability that people in the region intended to move their entire household to USA. Individuals may believe longer distances increase their safety, and distance can be artificially inflated by the presence of national borders.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the time until a birth and death process reaches a certain level is {{distributed}} as a sum of independent exponential random variables. Diaconis, Miclo and Swart gave a probabilistic proof of this fact by coupling the birth and death process with a pure birth process such that the two processes reach the given level at the same time. Their coupling is of a special type called intertwining of Markov processes. We apply this technique to couple the Wright-Fisher diffusion with reflection at 1 / 2 and a pure birth process. We show that in our coupling the time of absorption of the diffusion is a. s. equal {{to the time of}} explosion of the pure birth process. The coupling also allows us to interpret the diffusion as being initially reluctant to get absorbed, but later getting <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>compelled</b> to get absorbed.

40|$|The 1999 U.

This view posits the United States as a benevolent hegemon militarily intervening in certain circumstances in defense of such universal values as the protection of human rights. This article challenges that view. NATO 2 ̆ 7 s Kosovo intervention does not represent a benign hegemon introducing a new rule of international law.

50|$|Dan Laughey {{describes}} para-social interaction as “the apparent familiarity between media {{personalities and}} audiences”. Seeing a favourite celebrity support a cause can influence fans {{to support the}} same cause—not because the cause is significant to the fans, but because it seems significant to the artist. To feel connected to a celebrity, fans are likely to participate in activities the celebrity considers important. For example, if a benefit concert starred unknown musicians performing songs for unknown people in Africa, the incentive for viewers to donate would be minimal. Bob Geldof, the founder of Live Aid, {{is aware of the}} need of familiarity and para-social interaction on behalf of the viewer. When criticised for not inviting enough African performers to play at Live Aid, (of which the main purpose was famine relief for Africa), Geldof commented that only popular musicians were invited to play at the show because unfamiliar artists would cause viewers to lose interest and “switch off”. In seeing the familiar face of their beloved artist on stage endorsing a cause, fans feel <b>more</b> <b>compelled</b> to support the cause.|$|R

While debate continues about {{advantages and disadvantages}} of mandating community service in universities, the practice of compelling adolescents to participate in community service is increasingly common. This study explores the civic behaviours, opinions, knowledge and dispositions of undergraduate students through their participation in a communitybased intercultural leadership program in Vietnam. In this program, students from six different countries were made to visit poor village entrepreneurs and offer their assistance in business improvement.

40|$|The rise of {{offshore}} water {{caused by the}} high winds of a low pressure weather system, or storm surge, is a hurricane’s greatest threat to human life. As weather forecasters struggle to enable coastal residents to make timely evacuation decisions, the need arises for <b>more</b> visually <b>compelling</b> and interactive storm surge visualization tools. This paper presents an interactive and three-dimensional storm surge visualization system.

Storm surge data are then used to construct a three-dimensional ocean positioned over the terrain models. Ambient details such as wind, vegetation, ocean waves, and traffic are animated based on up-to-date wind and storm surge data.
