40|$|In {{response}} to the request to research government rules and regulations that are relative to <b>Mine</b> <b>Survey</b> and could impact on global mining companies in different countries in Africa, a framework has been established to assist and support many companies working in these countries. The framework guides investigations in determining the legal risks to the Company in general and Mine Surveying in particular. Legally appointed personnel fall directly under this risk profile. Furthermore, the primary activities and overlying acts and regulations form workable matrices to address all areas of compliance and risk within the Mine Surveying areas of responsibility. The framework {{takes into account the}} supporting activities which operate within the acts and regulations. These departments are generally not directly accountable to the legislation, but form part of the mining value chain and depend on Mine Surveying results and service. It is therefore appropriate that the investigation into the international component of the framework was conducted as well. The links to international codes and practices were established with special reference to Mine Surveying association and participation. The mining process was researched in its entirety. It was found that there are numerous government departments and associated laws prescribing compliance for Mine Surveyors. The framework describes the various levels of work so that all risk to people, property and equipment is tabled and applicable working standards and guidelines are put in place to mitigate such risk. A uniform standard can guide all Mine Surveyors in establishing the Survey Manual. This manual of standards drives levels of accuracy and therefore training and development of the individual Mine Surveyor. The major finding was that <b>Mine</b> <b>Survey</b> cannot be researched alone as it interfaces with several other mining departments, legal structures and possible international codes. This research has reported on the Ghanaian portion of a global mining company. The Company’s business units in other countries have been benchmarked as well.

40|$|As the {{military}} moves towards using more unmanned {{vehicles in the}} operational environment, accounting for communications during the mission planning phases is critical to meet the mission objectives. The quality of radio frequency (RF) and acoustic communications in maritime environments are highly dependent on the environmental conditions. Maritime atmospheric and underwater environments provide a complex medium for RF and acoustic communications {{that need to be}} accounted for to meet the robust and reliable communication requirements for unmanned vehicles. This thesis proposes a methodology for predicting the communications network between unmanned vehicles using the Advanced Propagation Model to model the physics of RF electromagnetic wave propagation and probabilistic approaches to make the transmission channel robust to environmental conditions. In particular, a Nakagami-m transmission channel model is suggested for its ability to model a wide range of fluctuation intensities caused by environmental conditions. The stability of the network is assessed using the Finite State Markov Channel model through the use of state transition probabilities that lead to unstable transmission channel states. Network topologies composed of state-of-the-art unmanned vehicles with enhanced communications-based course of actions (COAs) to relay communications and guarantee connectivity and reliability are investigated. The methodology follows the Navy Planning Process closely to provide COAs and schedules that lead to optimal communication measures of performance of the mission. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using the <b>mine</b> <b>survey</b> mission scenario. Results show the benefit of the proposed methodology over conventional approaches to survey target areas in a sea-base operational environment. The methodology is not a final product, but will be upgraded and integrated into the UV-Core environment to provide valuable information during mission planning phases to make crucial decisions and trade-offs.

40|$|A new {{real-time}} in-field {{interpretation and}} visualization scheme and software, using neural networks {{for the detection}} and localization of buried waste, and the boundaries of waste sites, has been developed. The capabilities and limitations of the high-frequency (1 kHz to 1 MHz and 31 kHz to 32 MHz) electromagnetic ellipticity systems are analyzed by numerically studying {{the sensitivity of the}} acquired 3 D-ellipticity to model parameters describing the geometry of the systems and the electrical parameters of layered-earth models. Changes in ellipticity due to coil misalignment in standard operating mode are typically just 1 % to 2 %. Changes due to variations in layered-earth model parameters (resistivity, relative dielectric constant, and thickness) are typically at least one order of magnitude higher. Hence, {{it will be possible to}} resolve these parameters. For conductive models (resistivity < 50 Ωm) it will be hard to determine the relative dielectric constant and for models with high relative dielectric constants it will be hard to determine the resistivity, especially if it is greater than 1000 Ωm. The results of the sensitivity analysis contribute considerably to the training of several neural networks to determine the electrical properties of the subsurface. The two classes of artificial neural network paradigms utilized in this study are the radial basis function and the modular neural network algorithms. One-dimensional layered-earth inversions are performed by neural networks using ellipticity data. The three-dimensional localization of metallic objects (e. g. drums) is done by visualizing the results of one particular halfspace neural network technique. Several small conductive objects have been detected by applying this technique to data collected in controlled physical modeling field experiments. Classification neural networks are trained on field data to categorize ellipticity soundings into either a target or a background class. Two environmental geophysics field case studies were analyzed using the developed interpretation system and the visualization software. The first case study involves mapping subsidence areas caused by an underground coal mine fire in Wyoming. The neural network interpretations from the <b>mine</b> <b>survey</b> match comparable inversion results. The second study documents the successful characterization of a simulated hazardous waste pit at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory...|$|E
