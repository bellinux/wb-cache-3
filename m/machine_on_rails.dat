50|$|The off-railer is {{a system}} of {{installing}} a turnout over and above some plain track, without having to cut or replace that track. It is useful for installing temporary branches on agricultural railways, and sidings for track <b>machines</b> <b>on</b> mainline <b>rails.</b> Special ramps lift the wheels off the normal track, and then the off-railer curves away as required. Decauville has such a system. It {{is a bit like}} a drawbridge crossing.|$|R

50|$|The {{machines}} for washing the building windows are stored {{on the roof}} of the building. There are two types: one is automatic and the other is manual. The automatic window washing <b>machines</b> run <b>on</b> <b>rails</b> <b>on</b> the sides of the building. This machine can clean a window in 2.6 seconds. It consumes 426,000 gallons of water per run to clean the entire tower. The other machine is a manual window washing cradle. Both of these {{machines for}} cleaning the windows are supported by rails that run around the outside of the pyramid roof and that are bolted down into the maintenance floor itself.|$|R

50|$|A new dynamic {{shooting}} mode called Chase Mode {{has been}} added to the game. This mode is similar to arcade shooters wherein the player's <b>machine</b> moves <b>on</b> <b>rails</b> and leaves the targeting weapons for the player to control. Each chase mode section precedes a boss battle; the examples released so far include the battle against the Behemoth from Full Metal Panic! and the battle against Nora Polyansky from Macross Zero. A new ability called Burst Attack appears in this installment. Burst attack is available to all units, and is a special charge attack that changes depending <b>on</b> what <b>machine</b> is being used.|$|R
50|$|Riding on this {{carriage}} costs {{twice that}} of a standard-class journey and passengers are required to buy the first class ticket (at the vending <b>machine</b> <b>on</b> East <b>Rail</b> line stations or ticket counters at the other stations) or second check their Octopus cards on the first class reader (located at the station platforms and beside the gangway door of the First class compartment itself) before entering the first-class car. Ticket Inspectors will perform random checks on train, and failing to produce a valid first class ticket or valiated Octopus Card will be liable to a surcharge of HK$500.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicle was}} based on a Ford F15 4x2 chassis (a single 4x4 vehicle was built). The open-topped {{armoured}} hull was {{similar to that of the}} M3 Scout Car. The armament consisted of one [...]50 inch (12.7 mm) heavy machine gun and two [...]30 inch <b>machine</b> guns <b>on</b> skate <b>rails,</b> operated by the crew of five.|$|R
50|$|The spoil {{from the}} shaft was emptied into the tipping wagon {{which was then}} pushed along the spoil heap on the tracks to the end where it was tipped off, thus forming the {{characteristic}} 'finger' spoil heaps of most small Black country pits. The <b>machine</b> also <b>on</b> the <b>rails</b> behind the spoil wagon is an early electrical coal cutter the arm extending from the front moved through an arc and cut a corresponding arc in the coal seam which then allowed the coal to drop down in big lumps. One the shaft was established the sinking engine would either be dismantled and sold on or kept to use in an emergency.|$|R
50|$|A {{first layer}} of ballast is dumped {{directly}} onto the track, and a tamping-lining-levelling <b>machine,</b> riding <b>on</b> the <b>rails,</b> forces the stones underneath the sleepers. Each pass of this machine can {{raise the level of}} the track by 8 cm (3 in), so several passes of ballasting and of the machine are needed to build up a layer of ballast at least 32 cm (1 ft) thick under the sleepers. The ballast is also piled {{on each side of the}} track for lateral stability. The machine performs the initial alignment of the track. Next, a ballast regulator distributes the ballast evenly. Finally, a dynamic vibrator machine shakes the track to perform the final tamping, effectively simulating the passing of 2,500 axles.|$|R
50|$|The sleepers, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} bi-bloc sleepers, are U41 twin block reinforced concrete, 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in.) wide, and weigh 245 kg (540 lb) each. They {{are equipped with}} hardware for Nabla RNTC spring fasteners, and a 9 mm (3/8 in.) rubber pad. (Rubber pads are always used under the <b>rail</b> <b>on</b> concrete sleepers, to avoid cracking). Next, a rail threader is used to lift the rails onto their final position on the sleepers. This <b>machine</b> rides <b>on</b> the <b>rails</b> just like the gantry cranes, but can also support itself directly on a sleeper. By doing this, it can lift the rails, and shift them inwards over {{the ends of the}} sleepers, to the proper gauge (standard gauge). It then lowers them onto the rubber sleeper cushions, and workers use a pneumatically operated machine to bolt down the Nabla clips with a predetermined torque. The rails are canted inward at a slope of 1 in 20.|$|R

U radu se definira pojam društvene mreže te obrađuje povijest društvenih mreža, od samih početaka do globalnog fenomena koji iz dana u dan broji sve veći broj korisnika. Uvodi se u svijet web razvoja u okviru (eng. framework) Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> te se predočavaju njegove mogućnosti. Velika zajednica Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> programera te mnogo predočenih riješenih problema na internetu uvelike olakšavaju rješavanje bilo kakvih problema pri razvoju aplikacije. Korištenje baze podataka The Movie DB putem API-ja je uvelike olakšano objašnjenjima pronađenima na Git repozitoriju samog gem paketa. Učinkovitost samog okvira Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> predočena je praktičnim radom. Zbog lakše instalacije Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> okvira te prvobitne naklonosti Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> okvira Unix-baziranim operacijskim sustavima, za potrebe samog razvoja aplikacije za operacijski sustav korištena je distribucija Linux operacijskog sustava Ubuntu 17. 04. This bachelor's thesis {{details the}} {{development}} of a social network designed for writing film reviews. The term "social network" will be clearly defined including the history of social networks from their very beginnings, to the global phenomenon of today which is used by a constantly increasing number of users. The thesis also contains an introduction to the environment of the Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> web application framework with an explanation of its capabilities. The large programming community gathered around Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> has already dealt with numerous development issues, which greatly eases correcting any errors while developing the application. Using The Movie DB's database through their API is smooth and straightforward due to the examples found in the Git repository of The Movie DB’s gem package. The effectiveness of the Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> framework is illustrated by its utilization in this thesis. Due to the easier installation of the Ruby <b>on</b> <b>Rails</b> framework, and the framework's initial predisposition towards Unix-based operating systems, this application has been developed using Ubuntu 17. 04., distribution of the Linux operating system...|$|R
