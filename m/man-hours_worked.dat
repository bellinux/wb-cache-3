40|$|AbstractAsphalt shingle roofing is {{performed}} by specialty contractors {{in the construction}} industry with the roofing crew performing tasks in different areas on the roof simultaneously. While asphalt shingle roofing materials have improved, the roofing construction process has not changed significantly over the past 70 years. This paper describes the process, factors that affect the productivity of the workers, and methods for calculating productivity in terms of <b>man-hours</b> <b>worked</b> and cost per unit output. Safety is also a concern in roofing. While falls from roofs are a major cause of injuries on the construction job site, other injuries common to roofers include sprains and strains to the back, knees and ankles. The trend of constructing steep roofs, common in Texas high end residential homes, are implicated in these injuries. Safety plans and worker safety climate are low priorities for financially strapped construction companies. Designing out the hazard would be more effective than Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in preventing accidents in the roofing industry. The paper concludes that research and development are needed to improve roofing construction methods to provide a safe and healthy environment for the worker and reduce costs of construction...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantity}} of man-hours {{available as a}} factor input {{is one of the}} principal determinants of an economy's potential output. Although such a measure of labor supply may be strongly influenced by population developments, there are several aspects of economic behavior that intervene between growth of population and growth of man-hours. These include the willingness of individuals to join the labor force, the aggregate employment rate of those in the labor force, and hours worked per employee. In the United States, for example, the working-age population was 53 percent larger in 1977 than in 1947, yet aggregate <b>man-hours</b> <b>worked</b> increased by only 40 percent, and private man-hours rose by only 27 percent. This paper presents an integrated empirical analysis of the links between population and labor supply. Determinants of labor force participation by age and sex, annual hours per worker, and the unemployment rate are examined for the post-World War II period. The relations estimated for these variables are designed for use in {{a new version of the}} Hickman-Coen annual growth model of the United States, but we take advantage here of the fact that they form a subsystem which jointly determines the supply of man-hours, the high-employment unemployment rate, and the natural rate of unemployment.

40|$|In 2003 Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics) {{introduced}} a new type material handling automation to the world. The system {{is based on the}} principle that the physical infrastructure that contains inventory should be mobile. Kiva achieved this remarkable advancement by employing a fleet of robots to move shelving to human operators. Broadly, these types of systems are defined in the literature as multi-agent robotic systems. Amazon acquired Kiva Systems in 2012 to incorporate the technology into their operations. The goal of this thesis is to optimize the throughput of warehouses employing multi-agent robotic automation. It is assumed that extracting inventory from the automated system is the limiting factor in maximizing throughput (i. e. downstream process are unconstrained). Two strategies are advocated: 1) performing velocity segregation of inventory within the automation via a bifurcation between fast selling and slow selling inventory, 2) maximizing pick rates through policies that increase worker retention. It will be shown that velocity segregation increases machine efficiency by increasing the efficiency of delivering inventory to human operators. This assertion will be investigated by developing a theoretical understanding of how inventory velocity impacts machine efficiency and simulating different types of stow strategies impact on system efficiency. It is estimated that some stow strategies can increase machine efficiency by as much as 30 %. It will also be shown that the number of <b>man-hours</b> <b>worked</b> by inexperienced pickers explains practically all of the variability of aggregate pick cycle times and hence pick rates, which motivates the argument for worker retention. Together, these two modifications are estimated to increase throughput by 10 % over current baseline. by James DeWitt Stowe. Thesis: M. B.

(CH 2 M HILL) {{is pleased}} to {{nominate}} the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) project for the Project Management Institute's consideration as 2007 Project of the Year, Built for the U. S, Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of River Protection (ORP) at the Hanford Site, the IDF is the site's first Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) -compliant disposal facility. The IDF is important to DOE's waste management strategy for the site. Effective management of the IDF project contributed to the project's success. The project was carefully managed to meet three Tri-Party Agreement (TPA) milestones. The completed facility fully satisfied the needs and expectations of the client, regulators and stakeholders. Ultimately, the project, initially estimated to require 48 months and $ 33. 9 million to build, was completed four months ahead of schedule and $ 11. 1 million under budget. DOE directed construction of the IDF to provide additional capacity for disposing of low-level radioactive and mixed (i. e., radioactive and hazardous) solid waste. The facility needed to comply with federal and Washington State environmental laws and meet TPA milestones. The facility had to accommodate over one million cubic yards of the waste material, including immobilized low-activity waste packages from the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP), low-level and mixed low-level waste from WTP failed melters, and alternative immobilized low-activity waste forms, such as bulk-vitrified waste. CH 2 M HILL designed and constructed a disposal facility with a redundant system of containment barriers and a sophisticated leak-detection system. Built on a 168 -area, the facility's construction met all regulatory requirements. The facility's containment system actually exceeds the state's environmental requirements for a hazardous waste landfill. Effective management of the IDF construction project required working through highly political and legal issues as well as challenges with permitting, scheduling, costs, stakeholders and technical issues. To meet the customer's needs and deadlines, the project was managed with conscientious discipline and application of sound project management principles in the Project Management Institute's Project Management Body of Knowledge. Several factors contributed to project success. Extensive planning and preparation were conducted, which was instrumental to contract and procurement management. Anticipating issues and risks, CH 2 M HILL prepared well defined scope and expectations, particularly for safety. To ensure worker safety, the project management team incorporated CH 2 M HILL's Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS) into the project and included safety requirements in contracting documents and baseline planning. The construction contractor DelHur Industries, Inc. adopted CH 2 M HILL's safety program to meet the procurement requirement for a comparable ISMS safety program. This project management approach contributed to an excellent safety record for a project with heavy equipment in constant motion and 63, 555 <b>man-hours</b> <b>worked.</b> The project manager worked closely with ORP and Ecology to keep them involved in project decisions and head off any stakeholder or regulatory concerns. As issues emerged, the project manager addressed them expeditiously to maintain a rigorous schedule. Subcontractors and project contributors were held to contract commitments for performance of the work scope and requirements for quality, budget and schedule. Another element of project success extended to early and continual involvement of all interested in the project scope. Due to the public sensitivity of constructing a landfill planned for radioactive waste as well as offsite waste, there were many stakeholders and {{it was important to}} secure their agreement on scope and time frames. The project had multiple participants involved in quality assurance surveillances, audits and inspections, including the construction contractor, CH 2 M HILL, ORP, the Washington State Department of Ecology, and independent certified quality assurance and engineering inspectors. A QA manager and safety manager were on-site during all project activities. Completion of the project provided a safe and reliable facility that will help DOE ORP meet the growing need for environmentally compliant, on-site disposal of solid waste generated in the cleanup project. Furthermore, the project helped DOE save money and meet TPA milestones ahead of schedule. In the following pages, we detail the tools and techniques used to manage the IDF project. We had a highly competent project management team. Their skillful management of the construction and the stakeholder and regulatory issues resulted in successful project outcomes and lessons learned. We believe their performance merits special recognition...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityBack {{one hundred}} and fifty years ago a man only as "the Frenchman" came to this area in Southeastern Massachusetts to {{establish}} an industry which later was to be stamped the "Jewelry Center of the World". The various skills, which this man exercised as an individual, eventually extended into the specialized skills and varied machines of several thousand workers. Despite the inevitable set-backs which plague any industry periodically, the jewelers prospered. The industry retained all the virtues of small business and a homey relationship between men and management developed. World War I had not disturbed it much, but the Second Great War rocked the local industry right down to its metal bases. Copper, zinc, tin, steel, the platinums and finally even gold and silver [...] the substance of its raw materials [...] were banned by government decree, since these were the essence of modern war instruments. The fact that they knew no other lines of manufacture; that big business was monopolizing war contracts; that both big government and big business looked down upon the jewelers' potentialities as war producers; that everyone regarded this type of manufacture as a luxury anyway [...] these undeniable facts added to the jewelers' pessimism as war clouds grew more menacing. These circumstances, however, did not cause the jewelers to receive such denials and misunderstandings in supine fashion. On the contrary they fought back! Fortunate indeed they ware to have developed over the past half century a high grade of leadership through their trade organization, the New England Manufacturing Jewelers' and Silversmiths' Association. This leadership, fed and propagated by truly democratic methods throughout the years, pursued an intelligent and courageous course. The early restrictions by government, due to the vigor and validity of their leaders' contentions, were modified and extended. Frequent modifications granted the jewelers time. What time so gained was to afford eventually, they could not perceive in those early days. But it proved an effective weapon and brought blessings. Thus the jewelers' arguments for conversation of the industry bore final fruit. The expanding revenue from excise tax [...] first 10, then 20 percent [...] were not to be overlooked in the feeding of so costly a monster as modern war. Their early contention that jewelry was a factor in fortifying the morale of the war worker by psychologically rewarding him for his long hours of labor, likewise can to be acknowledged. Their reasoning that infinitesimal amounts of copper would enable them to karat their gold and produce great quantities of jewelry which would return the Treasury millions in excise revenues proved sound. Their argument that the base metals should be made available in reduced quantities in order to grant the industry time to convert, and that partal continuance of normal manufacturing would keep production teams together and enable the jeweler to accomplish war contracts at a slightly over cost basis, at last became evident. Their opinion that no small business should be sacrificed to war and that big business would finally need their talents and skills were found true. Indeed, all these factors as they were diplomatically yet insistently promulgated by the industrial leaders of the Attleboros were borne out in the long run. Although handicapped by light machinery, handcraft methods, skills which were apparently non-transferable, and managements that were rutted in routine, the Attleboro jewelry industry proved its worth. World War II demanded electrical equipment in quantities never before experienced by the war makers. While the jewelers' initial concepts of war production were based on World War I notions of heavy type manufacture, a more careful analysis of modern war instruments disclosed a need for vast quantities of this electrical equipment and electronics devices. These proved a natural for the jewelry worker. His skills, built around the construction and assembly of small items, could be transferred to the construction and assembly of such products. His knowledge of 'working' metals, the 'plating' of metals, and the small stampings suited to his light power stamps and drop hammers likewise coincided. The ingenuity of the jewelry toolmaker and the long acquaintance of the industry with all types of fine soldering, enabled it to meet a variety of problems. New machines, jigs and fixtures, and new methods were devised in order to accomplish delicate mass soldering operations. These, the larger corporations were pleased to pass on to Attleboro's small industrialists whom they had previously slighted. Management, too, assumed problems and responsibilities with a genuine sense of adventure. Their actual accomplishments, the variety and quantity of war products, astounded both government and big business alike. Tools, taps, and dyes [...] electronic devices, radar parts, airborne radio equipment, crystals, switch contacts, circuit breakers, condenser assemblies [...] the plating of radio and radar parts, wave guides, sheet and wire tubing [...] gun parts, incendiary bomb parts, torpedo components, shells, and ammunition [...] soldering and assembling, welding, forging, 'tinning', stamping [...] military insignia, medals, identification bracelets, dog tags [...] these are but a sample list of the products and processes which the Attleboro jewelers adopted with great success as their contribution to America's war economy. The great record which they spread upon the pages of World War II production was based, nevertheless, on factors other than transferable skill of workers, versatility of management or the all-out efforts of both individuals and their trade association. In plant layout, engineering advice, new production methods, and in contacts with other areas of American industry they were greatly aided by the local W. P. B. engineer. An accelerated war production in the Attleboros dated from the opening of his office. Two surveys of facilities initiated his actions and the successful institution and operation of the 'hen and chicken' methods rapidly followed. The summit of war production for the Attleboros [...] 78 percent of all <b>man-hours</b> <b>worked</b> [...] as reached in January 1944. This, indeed, was {{in sharp contrast to the}} negligible contribution in 1917 - 18, a mere 5 percent conversion. In some individual cases where small plants converted 100 percent and so lost normal contacts, hardship was realized. Generally, however, definite benefits accrued to the industry. Tools and equipment were brought up to date. More streamlined methods were adopted and the advantages of mass production realized. More specialized machines came about and have become a permanent feature in local manutacturing. Many new contacts resulted and a diversification of products has carried over in numerous instances. These benefits are real and tangible. The intangible benefits, likewise, are of great import. Management has assumed a greater degree of initiative, and a willingness to do the unusual. Workers were awakened to a realization of their talents and their limitations as well. Certain it is that this small industrial segment learned great lessons from its war experience. Equally certain it is that both government officials and big business gained a new appreciation of the Attleboros' place in any future war economy Should another emergency suddenly face this country, we can be certain that the men, machines, and management of the Attleboros will swiftly and effectively join battle...|$|E

Most complementary currencies are also local currencies and are limited to a certain region. Barters are another type of alternative currency. These are actually exchange systems, which only trade items; thus without the use of any currency whatsoever. Finally, LETS is a special form of barter which trades points for items. One point stands for one <b>man-hour</b> of <b>work.</b> Often there are issues related to paying tax. Some alternative currencies are considered tax-exempt, but most of them are fully taxed as if they were national currency, with the caveat that the tax must be paid in the national currency. The legality and tax-status of alternative currencies varies widely from country to country; some systems in use in some countries would be illegal in others.|$|R

In order to measure the job site productivity, for instance, basically two types of data such as <b>man-hours</b> and installed <b>work</b> quantities are required as an input and an output factor to calculate the values of the productivity. This paper suggests an efficient automatic man-hours measurement system for analyzing and collecting the data relating to the input factor by the analysis of video images instead of the direct observation of construction job sites by a work manager. The proposed method utilizes the image processing technologies for analyzing the video images of the construction related works operated on the job sites. An image processing based algorithm is developed for tracking the three different groups of construction work crews under the considerations of complex construction work environment. It includes the following main algorithms: BGS (background subtraction), worker detection, and worker tracking algorithm. The proposed method has been applied and verified under various indoor and outdoor experimental test environments. Around 84 % of recognition rate for counting <b>man-hours</b> of construction <b>work</b> crews is achieved by the proposed algorithm. The data acquired by the proposed method can be used as an essential and valuable input data to analyze and control the productivity of construction job site subsequently...|$|R
