5|$|It {{took two}} hours of intense {{discussion}} to elect the presidium of the Seimas. Jonas Basanavičius, officially nonpartisan, was elected as the chairman and Steponas Kairys, leader of the Social Democrats, was chosen as vice-chairman. Other members were Antanas Smetona, priest Petras Būčys, and Juozas Stankūnas; the secretaries were Liudas Gira, Pranas Klimaitis, and Juozas Gabrys-Paršaitis. The organizational committee proposed a rather academic agenda geared toward cultural issues for the assembly; this initial agenda was vetoed by the delegates. They adopted a new schedule that was more political and highlighted two main goals: holding hearings on the current situation in Lithuania, and deciding which political demands should be submitted to the Tsarist authorities. A major portion of the first day's proceedings was devoted to reports presented by delegates from rural areas. The content of these reports was repetitious and did not carry much weight. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> was that of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E

25|$|The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> of the {{elections}} was which party would become the largest, the governing Christian-democratic CDA or the main opposition party, the social-democratic PvdA. This {{was similar to the}} situation of {{the elections}} of 2003. The largest party will have the initiative in the cabinet formation talks. Furthermore, if it becomes part of the cabinet, the largest party supplies the prime minister. The media have framed the elections as a 'Clash of the Titans' between prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende (CDA) and candidate prime minister Wouter Bos (PvdA).|$|E

500|$|Masato Kato {{directed}} {{and wrote the}} main story, leaving sub-plots and minor character events to other staff. The event team sometimes struggled to mesh their work on the plot due {{to the complexity of}} the parallel worlds concept. Masato Kato confirmed that Cross featured a central theme of parallel worlds, as well as the fate of Schala, which he was previously unable to expound upon in Chrono Trigger. Concerning the ending sequences showing Kid searching for someone in a modern city, he hoped to make players realize that alternate futures and possibilities may exist in their own lives, and that this realization would [...] "not... stop with the game". He later added, [...] "Paraphrasing one novelist's favorite words, what's important is not the message or theme, but how it is portrayed as a game. Even in Cross, it was intentionally made so that the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> was left unanswered." [...] Kato described the finished story as [...] "ole' boy-meets-girl type of story" [...] with sometimes-shocking twists. Kato rode his motorcycle to relieve the stress of the game's release schedule. He continued refining event data during the final stages of development {{while the rest of the}} team undertook debugging and quality control work. Square advertised the game by releasing a short demo of the first chapter with purchases of Legend of Mana. The North American version of Cross required three months of translation and two months of debugging before release. Richard Honeywood translated, working with Kato to rewrite certain dialogue for ease of comprehension in English. He also added instances of wordplay and alliteration to compensate for difficult Japanese jokes. To streamline translation for all 45 playable characters, Honeywood created his own version of the accent generator which needed to be more robust than the simple verbal tics of the Japanese cast. Although the trademark Chrono Cross was registered in the European Union, the game was not released in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|In Christian theology, {{the resurrection}} of Jesus is a {{foundation}} of the Christian faith. [...] Christians, through faith in the working of God are spiritually resurrected with Jesus, and are redeemed {{so that they may}} walk in a new way of life. As Paul the Apostle stated: [...] "If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless". The death and resurrection of Jesus are the most important events in Christian Theology. They form the point in scripture where Jesus gives his ultimate demonstration that he has power over life and death, thus {{he has the ability to}} give people eternal life. Terry Miethe, a Christian philosopher at Oxford University, stated, [...] "'Did Jesus rise from the dead?' is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>question</b> regarding the claims of the Christian faith.'" [...] According to the Bible, [...] "God raised him from the dead", he ascended to heaven, to the [...] "right hand of God", and will return again to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy such as the Resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment and establishment of the Kingdom of God; see also Messianism and Messianic Age.|$|E
