METHODS: A total of 111 patients (mean age 56. 2 +/- 16. 1 years) underwent <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> repair with PTFE neochordae, {{in addition to a}} variety of other surgical procedures. Etiologies were degenerative in 82 patients (73. 9 %), Barlow disease in 13 (11. 7 %), rheumatic in 10 (9 %), and infection in six (5. 4 %). Prolapse of the anterior leaflet was present in 78 patients (70. 3 %), of the posterior leaflet in 15 (13. 5 %), a bileaflet prolapse was present in 12 (10. 8 %), and a commissural prolapse in six (5. 4 %). In all cases the anterior annulus was used as the reference level in order to assess the appropriate length of the PTFE neochordae. RESULTS: The mean number of PTFE neochordae used was 6 +/- 4 per patient. In-hospital mortality was 1. 8 % (n = 2); mean follow up was 36. 8 +/- 25. 6 months (range: 12 - 94 months). There were no late deaths.

Therefore, we compared outcomes of robotic <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> repair with those of complete sternotomy, partial sternotomy, and right mini-anterolateral thoracotomy. MethodsFrom January 2006 to January 2009, 759 patients with degenerative <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> disease and posterior leaflet prolapse underwent primary isolated <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> surgery by complete sternotomy (n =  114), partial sternotomy (n =  270), right mini-anterolateral thoracotomy (n =  114), or a robotic approach (n =  261). Outcomes were compared on an intent-to-treat basis using propensity-score matching. ResultsMitral valve repair was achieved in all patients except 1 patient in the complete sternotomy group. In matched groups, median cardiopulmonary bypass time was 42 minutes longer for robotic than complete sternotomy, 39 minutes longer than partial sternotomy, and 11 minutes longer than right mini-anterolateral thoracotomy (P . 1). The robotic group had the lowest occurrences of atrial fibrillation and pleural effusion, contributing to the shortest hospital stay (median 4. 2 days), 1. 0, 1. 6, and 0. 9 days shorter than for complete sternotomy, partial sternotomy, and right mini-anterolateral thoracotomy (all P <. 001), respectively. ConclusionsRobotic repair of posterior <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet <b>prolapse</b> is as safe and effective as conventional approaches.

500|$|Heart murmurs are {{abnormal}} heart sounds {{which can}} be either related to disease or benign, {{and there are several}} kinds. There are normally two heart sounds, and abnormal heart sounds can either be extra sounds, or [...] "murmurs" [...] related to the flow of blood between the sounds. Murmurs are graded by volume, from 1 (the quietest), to 6 (the loudest), and evaluated by their relationship to the heart sounds, position in the cardiac cycle, and additional features such as their radiation to other sites, changes with a person's position, the frequency of the sound as determined {{by the side of the}} stethoscope by which they are heard, and site at which they are heard loudest.Phonocardiograms can record these sounds, and echocardiograms are generally required for their diagnosis.

Hypokalemia most commonly results in anorexic patients when restricting is accompanied by purging (induced vomiting or laxative use). Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common, and symptoms include fatigue and weakness. Orthostatic hypotension, a marked decrease in blood pressure when standing from a supine position, may also occur. Symptoms include lightheadedness upon standing, weakness, and cognitive impairment, and may result in fainting or near-fainting. Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization. [...] Hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes atrophy of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased ability to pump blood, {{a reduction in the}} ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue. Some individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life-threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size normalizes over weeks to months, with recovery. Atrophy of the heart muscle is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or palpitations; these can be a result of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>prolapse.</b> <b>Mitral</b> <b>valve</b> <b>prolapse</b> occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the mitral valve remains the same size.

40|$|Introduction: The {{tricuspid valve}} (TV) {{is a complex}} {{structure}} (Lamers et al. (1995) [1]). The {{most common cause of}} pathologic tricuspid regurgitation is functional, due to annular dilatation with normal leaflet morphology (Sagie et al. (1994) [2]). Myxomatous disease of the tricuspid valve is often associated with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> involvement but isolated tricuspid prolapse has been rarely reported (Tei et al. (1983) [3]). Unlike the common combination between rheumatic <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> stenosis and functional tricuspid regurgitation, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first case of such combination between tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>prolapse</b> and rheumatic <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> stenosis reported with three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3 D-TEE). Case presentation: We are presenting a 43 -year-old female patient that had dyspnea on effort NYHA class III. A transthoracic echocardiography showed severe rheumatic <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> stenosis with severe tricuspid regurgitation. A routine preoperative 2 D-transesophageal echocardiography (2 D-TEE) showed severe rheumatic <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> stenosis with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to prolapse of one of the tricuspid valve leaflets. 3 D-TEE showed prolapse of the medial half of the posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve.

40|$|The <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> is {{the most}} {{commonly}} affected valve in acute and chronic rheumatic heart disease {{in the first and}} second decades of life. Pure or predominant mitral regurgitation with non-significant stenosis (<b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> area > 1. 5 cm(2) on echocardiography) {{is the most}} frequently encountered valvular dysfunction in children. In our experience, based on 428 children operated between 1993 and 2011 at our institution, functional classification based on leaflet motion assessed by echocardiography and reconfirmed peroperatively revealed pure annulus dilatation (type I) in 7 % of patients, anterior leaflet prolapse (type IIa) in 33 %, combination of anterior leaflet pseudoprolapse with restricted motion of the posterior leaflet (type pseudoIIa/IIIp) in 34 %, and restricted anterior and posterior leaflet motion (type IIIa/p) in 26 %. Patients with type III were older than those with type IIa and type pseudoIIa/IIIp. Different techniques can be used to repair rheumatic <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> lesions: <b>prolapse</b> of the anterior leaflet caused by chordal elongation or rupture can be treated by chordal shortening, chordal transfer, or artificial chordal replacement; restricted motion of the anterior and/or posterior leaflet can be treated by commissurotomy, splitting of the papillary muscles, resection of the secondary, or sometimes primary posterior chordae, posterior leaflet free edge suspension, leaflet thinning, and leaflet enlargement using autologous pericardium. Because mitral annulus dilatation is present in almost all patients with mitral regurgitation, concomitant ring annuloplasty offers more stability in valve repair, improving long-term outcome. The major causes for failure of rheumatic <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> repair are the presence of ongoing rheumatic inflammation at the time of surgery, use of inappropriate techniques, technical failures requiring early reoperation, lack of concomitant ring annuloplasty, and progression of leaflet and chordal disease further resulting in more leaflet retraction, thickening, and deformity. Freedom from reoperation depends on mitral regurgitation functional type, the type IIa and type pseudoIIa/IIIp having a better long-term outcome than type I and type III, in our series. In conclusion, <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> repair should be a preferred strategy in children with rheumatic heart disease whenever feasible, providing stable actuarial survival with fewer thromboembolic complications in a pediatric population noncompliant to anticoagulation...|$|R
