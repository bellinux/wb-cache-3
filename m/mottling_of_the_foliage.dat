40|$|Leaves and twigs of {{indigenous}} woody plant species {{are used as}} a source of supplemental animal feed in <b>the</b> mountainous landscapes <b>of</b> central Ethiopia.

The species studied were Hagenia abyssinica (Bruce) J. F. Gmel., Dombeya torrida (J. F. Gmel.) P. Bamps, Buddleja polystachya Fres., and Chamaecytisus palmensis (Christ) Bisby & K. Nicholls.

40|$|A green wall, where <b>foliage</b> covers <b>the</b> {{external}} wall <b>of</b> a building, {{is considered to}} be a sustainable solution as it has many benefits for the direct environment. However, the advantages for the consumer (owner or building occupant) remain limited. One of these advantages is the potential energy savings that come from a reduction in the building 2 Ì† 6 apos;s cooling load. <b>The</b> covering <b>foliage</b> has three properties that will negatively influence <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> heat transfer taking place between the indoor and the outdoor climate. <b>The</b> first property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> cover is <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> wind speed, or convective heat transfer, along the wall. This influence mainly causes <b>the</b> heat resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external air film to rise from 0. 04 to a maximum of 0. 17 m 2 K W- 1, dependent on <b>the</b> density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foliage.</b> <b>The</b> second property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> is <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> solar radiation dissipating in the {{external wall}}. The leaf area index determines <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> this influence. <b>The</b> reduced temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external wall causes less heat transfer to the indoor climate. Finally, <b>the</b> third property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>foliage</b> is <b>the</b> evaporation <b>of</b> water inside <b>the</b> leafs. This process converts sensible heat into latent heat, which is beneficial for the Urban Heat Island effect. The energy needed for this process is mainly taken from incoming solar radiation, but on rare occasions with strong wind and hot and dry air, the sensible heat can be taken from the air, causing a small reduction in air temperature. This property is however not quantified here. Living wall systems could also contribute to energy savings through their insulating capacity. <b>The</b> Rc value <b>of</b> three systems has been computed using THERM 6. 3. <b>The</b> Rc value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greenwave system based on soil varies between the 0. 1 and 0. 2 m 2 K W- 1 dependent on <b>the</b> wetness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growing medium. For the Wonderwall system based on fabric this ranges between the 0. 2 and 0. 3 m 2 K W- 1. <b>The</b> insulating capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LivePanel system (rock wool) was found to be more significant: 0. 9 - 1. 5 m 2 K W- 1. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first two <b>foliage</b> properties and <b>the</b> Rc value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LivePanel are subjected in a HAMBASE energy consumption simulation.
