40|$|AbstractAlgeria has {{experienced}} {{over the past}} four decades, several periods of drought which led to the use of seawater desalination through a vast program initiated in 2003. The program is implemented to achieve 13 seawater desalination units, to produce 2. 3 million m 3 /day in 2011, to meet needs for potable water, {{as well as those of}} small and medium industries in the coastal regions and neighboring regions. This capacity will reach 2. 5 million m 3 /day in 2015, taking into account the tourism development in these regions. Because the program set up is based solely on fossil energy and that desalination technology is a major consumer of energy, to ensure sustainability of water resources and save the energy source (natural gas), it became necessary to initiate prospective studies to replace, for this purpose, fossil energy by other energy sources such as: renewable energy and nuclear energy. Currently, nuclear power is presented as a more attractive solution through the development and technological expertise recorded in the field of nuclear desalination integrated systems. Several demonstration units have been realized which have gained an undeniable know how. The experience accumulated in this area is estimated to 247 reactor-years. For this purpose, a study of nuclear desalination unit is performed for a potential site located in the Western Algerian coast, which is characterized by a very low rainfall rate of 400 mm/year. This study is taken in the national context. Indeed, the energy sources outputs that are candidates in this study are based on the <b>Indicative</b> <b>Program</b> of Electricity Generation developed in Algeria. The outputs related to nuclear energy are in respect with the threshold fixed to 10 % of the maximum power installed. The definition of nuclear desalination unit capacity is fixed to meet the water demand of the population of this region covering a period of 25 years beyond 2025. The cogeneration option is taken into account in this study. In this study, we present the economic evaluation results of coupling several nuclear reactors with two desalination processes MED and RO, using DEEP 3. 1 software.

To understand the mechanism by which herpesviruses induce nucleoplasmic reticulum, i. e. invaginations of the nuclear envelope, during their egress from the host cell nucleus, morphologically similar structures found in laminopathies and after chemical induction were investigated as a potentially more easily accessible model system. For example, anti-retroviral protease inhibitors like Saquinavir also induce invaginations of the nuclear membranes. With the help of newly designed multimodal nanoparticles as alignment and correlation markers, and by optimizing fluorescence cryo-microscopy data acquisition, an elaborate three-dimensional network of nucleoplasmic reticulum was demonstrated in nuclei of Saquinavir-treated rabbit kidney cells expressing a fluorescently labeled inner nuclear membrane protein. In part of the protease inhibitor-treated samples, nuclei exhibited dramatic ultrastructural changes <b>indicative</b> of <b>programmed</b> cell death/apoptosis.

To evaluate further the effects of estramustine, an in vivo rat glioma model using inbred BD-IX rats and the BT 4 C cell line was set up. In order to detect cells with fragmented DNA, tumour and brain specimens were, following fixation for histological examination, processed for in situ end labelling (ISEL) with biotin-labelled nucleotides. Fresh tissue fragments were also used for DNA integrity analysis on agarose gels. It was demonstrated that estramustine induced clusters of ISEL-positive cells and a pronounced typical fragmentation of DNA 0. 5 - 8 h after treatment. In tumours examined 24 or 94 h after estramustine treatment, and in untreated tumours, only occasional single ISEL-positive cells were scattered in the tumour.

40|$|Abstract. Formal {{specifications}} {{can help}} with program testing, optimization, refactoring, documentation, and, most importantly, debugging and repair. Unfortunately, formal specifications are difficult to write manually, while techniques that infer specifications automatically suffer from 90 – 99 % false positive rates. Consequently, neither option is currently practical for most software development projects. We present a novel technique that automatically infers partial correctness specifications with a very low false positive rate. We claim that existing specification miners yield false positives because they assign equal weight to all aspects of program behavior. By using additional information from the software engineering process, {{we are able to}} dramatically reduce this rate. For example, we grant less credence to duplicate code, infrequently-tested code, and code that exhibits high turnover in the version control system. We evaluate our technique in two ways: as a preprocessing step for an existing specification miner and as part of novel specification inference algorithms. Our technique identifies which input is most <b>indicative</b> of <b>program</b> behavior, which allows off-the-shelf techniques to learn the same number of specifications using only 60 % of their original input. Our inference approach has few false positives in practice, while still finding useful specifications on over 800, 000 lines of code. When minimizing false alarms, we obtain a 5 % false positive rate, an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous work. When used to find bugs, our mined specifications locate over 250 policy violations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first specification miner with such a low false positive rate, and thus a low associated burden of manual inspection. ...|$|R
40|$|The plant {{mitochondrial}} electron {{transport chain}} is branched such that electrons at ubiquinol can be diverted to oxygen via the alternative oxidase (AOX). This pathway does {{not contribute to}} ATP synthesis but can dampen the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species. Here, we establish that transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Petit Havana SR 1) cells lacking AOX (AS 8 cells) show increased susceptibility to three different death-inducing compounds (H 2 O 2, salicylic acid [SA], and the protein phosphatase inhibitor cantharidin) in comparison with wild-type cells. The timing and extent of AS 8 cell death are very similar among the three treatments and, in each case, are accompanied by the accumulation of oligonucleosomal fragments of DNA, <b>indicative</b> of <b>programmed</b> cell death. Death induced by H 2 O 2 or SA occurs by a mitochondria-dependent pathway characterized by cytochrome c release from the mitochondrion. Conversely, death induced by cantharidin occurs by a pathway without any obvious mitochondrial involvement. The ability of AOX to attenuate these death pathways may relate to its ability to maintain mitochondrial function after insult with a death-inducing compound or may relate to its ability to prevent chronic oxidative stress within the mitochondrion. In support of the latter, long-term treatment of AS 8 cells with an antioxidant compound increased the resistance of AS 8 cells to SA- or cantharidin-induced death. The results indicate that plants maintain both mitochondria-dependent and -independent pathways of programmed cell death and that AOX may act as an important mitochondrial “survival protein” against such death...|$|R

The sector contributes about 3 % of the GDP and fish contributes about 40 % of animal protein consumption in the country. In 1999, total fisheries production amounted to 1. 8 million t. Of this, 1. 2 million t was derived from marine capture fisheries and 0. 6 million t from aquaculture. Fish exports were valued at US$ 971. 12 million in the same year. VietnamÃ†s marine fisheries and coastal aquaculture have further potential for development. However, overfishing in coastal areas, degradation of the marine environment and conflicts between small-scale and large scale fishers must be resolved to realize the sectorÃ†s potential. This report presents the status of coastal fisheries resources, reviews government fisheries policies and suggested management measures. Based on the recommendations from a multisectoral consultative workshop conducted among the key experts on fisheries and resource management in Vietnam, the following fisheries management objectives were suggested for sustainable development of coastal fisheries in Vietnam: (1) optimization of productivity and efficiency of the fisheries exploitation regime; (2) ensuring that the benefits of production are distributed equitably; (3) ensuring that the productivity generated results in minimum damage to the resource base and the supporting natural environment; and (4) upgrading and strengthening the related institutions. <b>Indicative</b> action <b>programs</b> for improved management are also presented.

40|$|Question: Mutant BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib have {{achieved}} unprecedented {{responses in the}} treatment of melanoma, but the benefits are often of limited duration. On the other hand, durable tumor repression can be achieved by a variety of immunological agents such as the anti-CTLA 4 antibody ipilimumab (Yervoy) and antibodies against PD 1 in a small proportion of melanoma patients. Combinations of BARF inhibitors and immunological agents are emerging as promising therapeutic approaches. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the enhanced efficacy remains to be determined. Methods: Here we show that inhibition of BRAFV 600 E induces programmed necrosis of high immunogenicity in melanoma cells. Results: Although exposure of sensitive BRAFV 600 E melanoma cells to the BRAF inhibitor PLX 4720 triggered strong activation of the caspase cascade, it appeared dispensable for induction of cell death. Instead, PLX 4720 -induced killing was characterized by early rupture of the cell membrane and release of intracellular contents, <b>indicative</b> of <b>programmed</b> necrosis. Strikingly, killing of sensitive cells by PLX 4720 was associated with exposure of calreticulin, characteristic of immunogenic cell death. In contrast, PLX 4720 did not cause calreticulin exposure in resistant BRAFV 600 E melanoma cells, supporting that immunogenicity of melanoma cells triggered by PLX 4720 is the consequence of cell death. Indeed, PLX 4720 stimulated IFN ® production by autologous lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture (MLTC) with sensitive BRAFV 600 E melanoma cells, but not those resistant to PLX 4720 induced killing. Conclusion: Collectively, these results provide a strong rationale for combinations of mutant BRAF inhibitors and immunological agents {{in the treatment of}} melanoma, and suggest that induction of immunogenic cell death may be a useful biomarker for prediction of responses of mutant BRAF melanomas to such combinations. 2 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The coding {{domain of}} the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) 22 gene encodes two proteins, the 420 -amino-acid infected-cell protein 22 (ICP 22) and US 1. 5, a protein {{colinear}} with the carboxyl-terminal domain of ICP 22. In HSV- 1 -infected cells, ICP 22 and US 1. 5 are extensively modified by the UL 13 and US 3 viral protein kinases. In this report, we show that in contrast to other viral proteins defined by their properties as proteins, US 1. 5 becomes detectable and accumulated only at late times after infection. Moreover, significantly more US 1. 5 protein accumulated in cells infected with a mutant lacking the UL 13 gene than in cells infected with wild-type virus. To define the role of viral protein kinases on the accumulation of US 1. 5 protein, rabbit skin cells or Vero cells were exposed to recombinant baculoviruses that expressed US 1. 5, UL 13, or US 3 proteins under a human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. The results were as follows. (i) Accumulation of the US 1. 5 protein was reduced by concurrent expression of the UL 13 protein kinase and augmented by concurrent expression of the US 3 protein kinase. The magnitude of the reduction or increase in the accumulation of the US 1. 5 protein was cell type dependent. The effect of UL 13 kinase appears to be specific inasmuch as it {{did not affect the}} accumulation of glycoprotein D in cells doubly infected by recombinant baculoviruses expressing these genes.

A technology including the utilization of Colored Petri Nets for the generalized description and consequent detection of specific malicious functionalities from system call data has been previously developed, verified and presented. A successful effort was made to neutralize possible attempts to obfuscate this approach. Nevertheless, the approach has two major drawbacks. First, target functionalities have to be initially specified by an expert, which is a time consuming, sometimes subjective and error prone process. Second, the identification of typical functionalities <b>indicative</b> of malicious <b>programs</b> is not generally straightforward and requires reverse engineering and careful study of many instances of malware.

It seems that the attainment of a minimum leaf water potential of − 5 bars may be critical in the control of early chloroplast development. These results demonstrate that the lag phase is not <b>indicative</b> of a <b>programmed</b> event in chloroplast development, but rather is attributable to environmental conditions prevailing during leaf development and greening...|$|R
40|$|The article {{shows that}} {{institutional}} trajectories of catching-up development in successful countries including similar interim institutions; this similarity {{is explained by}} common technological, institutional and cultural limitations which {{need to be taken}} into account and overcome. Corporatism, indicative planning, the availability of the “general” development agency with broad mandate, undervalued exchange rate – these and some other mechanisms provide the countries of the “economic miracle” with an opportunity to initiate and maintain rapid economic growth despite the low level of human capital, underdeveloped civic culture and market failures. Institutions of catching-up development contributed to the formation of collaborative relations between the government, business and society. They eased the limitations and were gradually modified, providing a transition to modern democracies with efficient market economy. The conducted analysis helps outline a plan for an institutional reform taking into account Russia’s institutional features. The principles of administrative reform are considered. The author also sets the objective of forming a “hybrid” system of national planning which includes <b>indicative</b> planning and <b>program</b> budgeting. A combination of public-private partnership and program financing is proposed for the financing of the planned projects. The author proposes to use Japanese experience of promoting temporary association of companies for the development of modernization projects. The principles of reforming the systems of state property and science management are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Recently in {{the organic}} food industry, more lines of organic food are being {{introduced}} in stores as demand for organic products continues to grow. The organic food industry has witnessed high price premiums {{in the past}} which, according to economic theory, would in a perfectly competitive market attract entry until those price premiums decreased {{to the point where}} economic profits were zero. However, the USDA’s National Organic Certification Cost Share Program, or NOCCP, was introduced in its current form in 2009 and offers reimbursement for farmers who are already certified with certification or recertification costs for their organic farming operation. Since the program only reimburses farmers who have endured the required three year transition period, during which a farmer cannot sell their products as organic and receives no price premium and lower yields, a question arises: Is the NOCCP functioning as an effective barrier to entry and keeping potential farmers out of the market who cannot be first certified to qualify to receive a reimbursement from the NOCCP? Utilizing state-level data from the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Census of Agriculture, this paper strives to discover if growth in the organic food industry is inorganic and taking place among farms already certified and utilizing the NOCCP. If price premiums remain high while the NOCCP is in place, that may be <b>indicative</b> of the <b>program</b> serving as an effective barrier to entry and helping existing organic farmers maintain economic rents...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} eighth century B. C., Argishti I, King of Urartu, invaded {{southern}} Transcaucasia {{and began a}} dramatic transformation of the regional landscape, previously occupied by local fortress-states, into an imperial province. This dissertation examines {{the landscape of the}} fortress-states of the Early Iron Age in the Ararat and Shirak Plains and its rapid transformation under the Urartian regime. Rather than being merely inert stages for political processes, the archaeological evidence from southern Transcaucasia suggest that landscapes were active elements in Urartian political strategies for securing political authority. Physical changes in the landscape altered the experience of space, redefining relations between subjects and rulers <b>indicative</b> of unique <b>programs</b> for deploying political power. The Urartian regime also produced representational landscapes [...] scenes portraying gods and rituals against the backdrop of an Urartian fortress. The landscape scenes found in state produced media suggest that Urartian regimes sought to legitimize the physical landscape in reference to a representational program which recast their fortresses as sacred and transcendent rather than as instruments of political domination. The production of the Urartian landscape in southern Transcaucasia changed over time as the constitution of Urartian political authority changed. While Urartu's initial occupation of southern Transcaucasia indicates the regime consisted of numerous tightly integrated institutional elements, by the reign of Rusa II in the seventh century B. C., the internal organization of new fortresses suggests considerable disintegration of institutional coherence. By attending {{to the ways in which}} landscapes are actively involved in the constitution of political authority, this examination of the Urartian occupation of southern Transcaucasia offers epistemological, theoretical and methodological tools for archaeological descriptions of political authority...|$|R
40|$|Speech sound errors {{associated}} with aphasia {{have been attributed}} to disintegration of both phonologic and motoric processes in different subtypes of aphasia (Pierce, 2001). In nonfluent aphasia (NA), which often co-occurs with apraxia of speech (AOS), motor programming and motor planning difficulties are the typically proposed error generating mechanisms. In contrast, phonemic paraphasia observed in fluent aphasia (FA) is typically thought to be related to inability to retrieve and maintain sequences of phonemes for production. Distortion errors, <b>indicative</b> of motor <b>programming</b> deficiency, predominate in AOS; but also have been reported to a lesser extent in FA, in studies involving word or sentence repetition (McNeil, Robin & Schmidt, 2009; Odell, McNeil, Rosenbek & Hunter 1991; Odell, Bonkowski, & Mello, 1995). Associated features of dysfluency and dysprosody have also been reported in AOS (Kent & Rosenbek, 1983). In contrast, undistorted phonemic level errors also occur in both FA and NA subtypes (Blumstien, 1973; Pierce, 2001). This study examines the occurrence of phonemic errors as well as phonetic distortion, dysfluency and dysprosody in speech produced by individuals diagnosed with NA with AOS versus FA with phonemic paraphasia, in comparison with the speech of non-aphasic control speakers. This information is important (1) in order to advance our understanding of AOS, which usually occurs, clinically, in the presence of NA; (2) to further elucidate the role of distortion in FA, wherein speech errors are often described clinically as being fluently produced with little effort or distortion (Seddoh, Robin, Hageman, Moon, & Folkins, 1996); and (3) to help toward differentiating phonological/representational impairments from motorically based aspects of apraxic speech, which may not be mutually exclusive (Ziegler, Aichert & Staiger, 2012) ...|$|R
40|$|Building upon work {{related to}} clearly {{articulated}} <b>program</b> elements being <b>indicative</b> of quality <b>programs</b> (Granger, 2008; Roth & Brooks-Gunn, 2003), {{the purpose of}} this study was to describe what youth practitioners (in a large ASP organization) discuss when describing their program models. There are four main findings from this preliminary work: (1) pro-social outcomes were the most frequent categories of goals described by program staff; (2) individual site coordinators identify slightly different lists of program elements, even when operating within the same organization; (3) associations between activities and outcomes were most frequently correlational; and (4) practitioners rely upon a wide variety of types of information within the practices, but personal beliefs and the youth participants themselves were the most frequently mentioned. Of the goals identified, two major categories emerged from the data: youth-centered goals (i. e., personal/psychological, social development, academic, fun/enjoyment, homework completion, whole-child, outside the program, and physical) and program-centered goals (environment, fill time, and individualized programming). A variety of activity categories also emerged from the program descriptions (i. e., art, games, enrichment, group activities, homework assistance, academic, student choice, behavior management strategies, community involvement, and technology). When describing the associations between goals and activities, the primary relations described were correlational [...] lacking clearly identified mechanisms of association. Of the types of information practitioners discussed they used, four major categories emerged: (1) practitioner-centered information (i. e., belief, personal preference, experience [...] as a professional, personal background, professional development, education, and experience [...] as a participant); (2) site-specific information (i. e., youth participants, logistical pragmatics, tradition, fun, goals, participant families, school affiliation, and trial and error); (3) organizational learning (i. e., knowledge sharing, organizational requirements, supervisors); and (4) external information (i. e., Internet, local community, time of year, contemporary culture and events, written materials, educational policies, research [...] conceptual and explicit, funders) ...|$|R
40|$|Background Anxiety is {{a problem}} for many children, {{particularly}} because of its negative consequences not only on the wellbeing of the child, but also on society. Adequate prevention and treatment might be the key in tackling this problem. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been found effective for treating anxiety disorders. “Coping Cat” {{is one of the few}} evidence-based CBT programs designed to treat anxiety symptoms in children. The main aim of this project is to conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a Dutch version of Coping Cat as an <b>indicative</b> group-based prevention <b>program.</b> The second aim is to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness. Methods/design Coping Cat will be tested in Dutch primary school children grades five through eight (ages 7 to 13) with elevated levels of anxiety. This RCT has two conditions: 130 children will be randomly assigned to the experimental (N= 65, Coping Cat) and control groups (N= 65, no program). All children and their mothers will be asked to complete baseline, post intervention, and 3 -month follow-up assessments. In addition, children in both the experimental and control group will be asked to complete 12 weekly questionnaires matched to the treatment sessions. Main outcome measure will be the child’s anxiety symptoms level (SCAS). Four potential mediators will be examined, namely active coping, positive cognitive restructuring, self efficacy and cognitions about ones coping ability (from now on coping cognitions). Discussion It is hypothesized that children in the experimental condition will experience reduced levels of anxiety in comparison with the control group. Further, active coping, positive cognitive restructuring, and coping cognitions are expected to mediate program effectiveness. If Coping Cat proves effective as a prevention program and working mechanisms can be found, this group-based approach might lead to the development of a cost-effective program suitable for prevention purposes that would be easily implemented on a large scale...|$|R
40|$|Accessibility and use {{of social}} {{services}} by the Romany minority in Prachatice is a very topical issue. All social services provided are specified in the Social Services Act. The main mission of the aforesaid Act {{is to protect the}} rights and legitimate interests of individuals who are disadvantaged in the enforcement of their interests for various reasons. These reasons may include age, race, health handicap, critical life situation, insufficiently stimulating social environment, etc. The objective was to map social services used by the Romany minority in Prachatice. In order to fulfil the objective of the thesis, the following three research questions were put. RQ 1 : What are the problems concerning which the Romany minority contacts social services organizations? RQ 2 : Do the social services offered in Prachatice reflect the issues of the Romany population? RQ 3 : What social needs of the Romany people in Prachatice remain unsatisfied? For the research part a qualitative methodology was used, which allowed to depict the dynamics of opinions and attitudes of all informants. The data were collected by means of a semi-structured interview technique. The research examined both the views of Romany citizens of Prachatice and the views of social workers from the local social services organizations. The data were collected from 17 informants in total. The obtained data were processed while using the grounded theory. As an important finding that resulted from my research, I deem the fact that the Romany population in Prachatice knows only nine social services organizations and uses only five of them (Most naděje, Céčko, Coolna, Lungo Drom, Phénix). Moreover, they use the social services of these organizations only sporadically or not at all. The social services used by the Romany people include leisure time activities, social consultancy, visits at schools, provision and arrangement of meals, provision of accommodation, individual planning, crisis intervention, safekeeping of valuables, financial assistance, outreach work, exchange <b>program,</b> <b>indicative</b> testing, pre-school preparation and catch-up lessons. The Romany people would welcome greater interest of social services organizations and their responsiveness. They would also appreciate more leisure time activities in their quarters, better facilities of the quarters and their surroundings, more culture for Romany people and a Romany club led by a Romany social worker. They would also welcome a Romany social worker in some other social services and at the Municipal Police of Prachatice. Informants lack contact with the majority society and better time availability of the urban mass transport and, last but not least, would welcome changes in the municipal government. Social workers would welcome a social service in Prachatice with a psychologist and psychiatrist available for children and adults, higher frequency of visits of the citizens' association Fokus České Budějovice, establishment of social accommodation facilities and a day-care centre for homeless people, social service for children up to three years, strengthening of the ground social work, and a social service aimed at hiring Romany people for temporary jobs. Based on the results derived from the interviews performed and from the data obtained, it is possible to formulate the following three hypotheses. H 1 : The service most used by the Romany population is social consultancy. H 2 : Organizations providing social services respond to the Romany issues. H 3 : Prachatice needs to strengthen ground social work. The findings revealed by this thesis may be used by the social services organizations in Prachatice as feedback from the Romany minority concerning the given issues. Thus the organizations can respond to the need of particular services, which may result in more frequent use of social services in Prachatice...|$|R
