The most far-reaching dangers that initially come from the nuclear explosion of this, and higher, yield weapons as airbursts, are the initial flash/heat and blast effects and not from fallout. This {{is due to the}} fact that when nuclear weapons are detonated to maximize the range of building destruction, that is, maximize the range of surface blast damage, an airburst is the preferred nuclear fuzing height, as it exploits the <b>mach</b> <b>stem</b> phenomenon. This phenomenon of a blast wave occurs when the blast reaches the ground and is reflected. Below a certain reflection angle the reflected wave and the incident wave merge and form a reinforced horizontal wave, this is known as the 'Mach stem' (named after Ernst Mach) and is a form of constructive interference and consequently extends the range of high pressure. While Air-burst fuzing also increases the range that peoples skin will have a line-of-sight with the nuclear fireball. However, as a result of the high altitude of the explosion, most of the radioactive bomb debris/ is dispersed into the stratosphere, with a great column of air therefore placed between the vast majority of the bomb debris/fission reaction products and people on the ground for a number of crucial days before it falls out of the atmosphere in a comparatively dilute fashion, this [...] "delayed fallout" [...] is henceforth not an immediate concern to those near the blast. On the other hand, the only time that fallout is rapidly concentrated in a potentially lethal fashion in the local/regional area around the explosion is when the nuclear fireball makes contact with the ground surface, with an explosion that does so, being aptly termed a surface burst. For example, in the Operation Crossroads tests of 1946 on Bikini Atoll, using two explosive devices of the same design and yield, the first, Test Able (an air burst) had little local fallout, but the infamous Test Baker a near surface shallow (underwater burst) left the local test targets badly contaminated with radioactive fallout.|$|E

Cooling zones behind the shocks are resolved, so {{it is possible to}} identify which way material flows through a given shock wave. The images show that heterogeneity is paramount in these jets, with clumps dominating the morphologies of both bow shocks and their Mach disks. This clumpiness exists on scales smaller than the jet widths and determines the behavior of many of the features in the jets. Evidence also exists for considerable shear as jets interact with their surrounding molecular clouds, and in several cases we observe shock waves as they form and fade where material emerges from the source and as it proceeds along the beam of the jet. Fine-structure within two extended bow shocks may result from <b>Mach</b> <b>stems</b> that form at the intersection points of oblique shocks within these clumpy objects.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of cavity {{collapse}} in non-ideal explosives {{as a means of}} controlling their sensitivity. The aim is to understand the origin of localised temperature peaks (hot spots) which play a key role at the early stages of ignition. Thus we perform 2 D and 3 D numerical simulations of shock induced gas-cavity collapse in nitromethane. Ignition {{is the result of a}} complex interplay between fluid dynamics and exothermic chemical reaction. To understand the relative contribution between these two processes we consider in this first part of the work the evolution of the physical system in the absence of chemical reactions. We employ a multi-phase mathematical formulation which accounts for the large density difference across the gas-liquid interface without generating spurious temperature peaks. The mathematical and physical models are validated against experimental, analytic and numerical data. Previous studies identified the impact of the upwind side of the cavity wall to the downwind one as the main reason for the generation of a hot-spot outside of the cavity; this is also observed in this work. However, it is apparent that the topology of the temperature field is more complex than previously thought and additional hot spots locations exist, arising from the generation of <b>Mach</b> <b>stems</b> rather than jet impact. To explain the generation mechanisms and topology of the hot spots we follow the complex wave patterns generated and identify the temperature elevation or reduction generated by each wave. This allows to track each hot spot back to its origins. We show that the highest hot spot temperatures can be more than twice the post-incident shock temperature of the neat material and can thus lead to ignition. By comparing the maximum temperature observed in the domain in 2 D and 3 D simulations we show that 3 D calculations are necessary to avoid belated ignition times in reactive scenarios.

The porous medium is composed of inert spheres of equal diameter contained within a detonation tube. The propagation mechanisms were elucidated by means of high-speed Schlieren and open shutter photography of the wave-particle interactions in 2 -D obstacle arrays, to simulate the phenomenon in actual porous media. It is found that a Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation can transmit into a porous medium filled with detonable gas and continue to propagate as a quasi-steady combustion wave. There exists a continuous spectrum of averaged combustion wave velocities ($ rm 0. 3 le V/V sb{CJ} le 1) $ spanning the lean and rich propagation limits and exhibiting a maximum value at the most sensitive composition. A decrease in the particle size of the medium {{has the effect of}} narrowing the detonability range and reducing the velocity for a given mixture.

40|$|Abstract. We study {{a family}} of {{two-dimensional}} Riemann problems for compressible flow modeled by the nonlinear wave system. The initial constant states are separated by two jump discontinuities, x = ±κay, which develop into two interacting shock waves. We consider shock angles in a range where regular reflection is not possible. The solution is symmetric about the y-axis and {{on each side of}} the y-axis consists of an incident shock, a reflected compression wave, and a <b>Mach</b> <b>stem.</b> This has a clear analogy with the problem of shock reflection by a ramp. It is well known that no triple point structure exists in which incident, reflected, and <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> shocks meet at a point. In this paper, we model the reflected wave by a continuous function with a singularity in the derivative. This fails to be a weak solution across the sonic line.

40|$|A {{study of}} the shock-reflection domain for steady flow is presented. Conditions {{defining}} boundaries between different possible shock-reflection solutions are given, and where possible, simple analytic expressions for these conditions are presented. A new, more accurate estimate of the steady-state <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> height is derived based on geometric considerations of the flow. In particular, {{the location of the}} sonic throat through which the subsonic convergent flow behind the <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> is accelerated to divergent supersonic flow is considered. Comparisons with previous computational and experimental work show that the theory presented in this thesis more accurately predicts the <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> height than previous theories. The <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> height theory is generalized to allow for a moving triple point. Based on this moving triple point theory, a <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> growth rate theory is developed. This theory agrees well with computational and experimental results. Numerical computations of the effects of water vapor disturbances are also presented. These disturbances are shown to be sufficient to cause transition from regular reflection to Mach reflection in the dual-solution domain. These disturbances are also modeled as a simple energy deposition on one of the wedges, and an estimate for the minimum energy required to cause transition is derived. Experimental results using an asymmetric wedge configuration in the Ludwieg tube facility at the California institute of Technology are presented. A Mach 4. 0 nozzle was designed and built for the Ludwieg tube facility. This Mach number is sufficient to provide a large dual-solution domain, while being small enough not to require preheating of the test gas. The test time of the facility is 100 ms, which requires the use of high-speed cinematography and a fast motor to rotate one of the two wedges. Hysteresis in the transition between regular to Mach reflection was successfully demonstrated in the Ludwieg tube facility. The experiments show that regular reflection could be maintained up to a shock angle approximately halfway between the von Neumann condition and the detachment condition. Energy deposition studies were performed using an Nd:YAG laser. Triggering transition in this manner is found to depend on the location of the energy deposition. This finding is consistent with the numerical work presented in this thesis. Experiments were also performed to measure the <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> height and its growth rate. These results are compared with the theoretical estimates presented in this thesis. Excellent agreement between the steady-state <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> height and the theoretical estimates is seen.

Clear and measureable photographs of the primary and reflected shock waves with associated <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> formation were obtained over the entire range of investigation. Since this paper represents the first data ever obtained on a laboratory scale of <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> phenomena, correlation of spherical shock wave parameters was necessarily made with available theoretical and experimental data by using primary shock wave data. Correlation results were excellent which shows that the <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> and other data contained herein are accurate and therefore reliable in determining high yield shock wave parameters by the use of appropriate scaling.

A two-dimensional inviscid solver applies finite volume method and unstructured quadrilateral grids were employed to simulate the flow.

The protrusion degree seems to depend on the thermal energy buffer capacity of the testing gas. Approaches to increase the energy buffer capacity, such as vibrational relaxation, molecular dissociation, and increase of frozen heat capacity, all tend to escalate the protrusion effect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{combined}} computational {{and experimental}} study {{was performed to}} investigate {{the effect of a}} single laser energy pulse on the transition from a Mach Reflection (MR) to a Regular Reflection (RR) in the Dual Solution Domain (DSD). The freestream Mach number is 3. 45 and two oblique shock waves are formed by two symmetric 22 ◦ wedges. These conditions correspond to a point midway within the DSD wherein either an MR or an RR is possible. A steady MR was first obtained experimentally and numerically, then a single laser pulse was deposited above the horizontal center plane. In the experiment, the laser beam was focused resulting in a deposition volume of approximately 3 mm 3, while in the simulation, the laser pulse was modeled as an initial variation of the temperature and pressure using Gaussian profile. A grid refinement study was conducted to assess the accuracy of the numerical simulations. For the steady MR, the simulation showed the variation of <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> height along the span due to side effects. The predicted spanwise averaged <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> height was 1. 96 mm within 2 % of the experimental value of 2 mm. The experiment showed that the <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> height decreased to 30 % of its original height due to the interaction with the thermal spot generated by the laser pulse and then returned to its original height by 300 µs. That the <b>Mach</b> <b>stem</b> returned to its original height was most likely due to freestream turbulence in the wind tunnel. The numerical simulation successfully predicted the reverse transition from a stable M...|$|E
