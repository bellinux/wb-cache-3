5|$|The {{battle in}} the nebula was a {{difficult}} sequence to accomplish {{without the aid of}} computer-generated models. The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water. All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement. The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels. Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department. Using matte work, the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot. The destruction of the Reliants engine nacelle was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model.|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{blending}} is {{the process}} of adding the component gases of the mixture together as a continuous process and then compressing the <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> a storage cylinder. The intention is to supply the component gases to the intake of the compressor in a continuous flow at a pressure suited to the compressor design, already mixed to the correct specification. This generally requires equipment to monitor and control the flow of the input gases, which are usually supplied from high-pressure storage cylinders, excepting for air which is normally taken from the ambient surroundings.|$|E
25|$|They are {{analogous}} to the calculation of retention factor for a paper chromatography separation, but describes how well HPLC separates a <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> two or more components that are detected as peaks (bands) on a chromatogram. The HPLC parameters are the: efficiency factor(N), the retention factor (kappa prime), and the separation factor (alpha). Together the factors are variables in a resolution equation, which describes how well two components' peaks separated or overlapped each other. These parameters are mostly only used for describing HPLC reversed phase and HPLC normal phase separations, since those separations {{tend to be more}} subtle than other HPLC modes (e.g. ion exchange and size exclusion).|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{description}} for transient penetration simulations of miscible and immiscible fluid <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> anisotropic porous media, using the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. Our model incorporates hydrodynamic flow, diffusion, surface tension, {{and the possibility}} for global and local viscosity variations to consider various types of hardening fluids. The miscible mixture consists of two fluids, one governed by the hydrodynamic equations and one by diffusion equations. We validate our model on standard problems like Poiseuille flow, the collision of a drop with an impermeable, hydrophobic interface and the deformation of the fluid due to surface tension forces. To demonstrate the applicability to complex geometries, we simulate the invasion process of <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> wood spruce samples. Comment: Submitted to EPJ...|$|R
25|$|Plants {{designed}} for lignite (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations {{as varied as}} Germany, Victoria, Australia and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> the boiler.|$|E
25|$|The police {{issued an}} initial warning for the protesters to disperse, before using water cannons {{to fire a}} diluted tear gas <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> the crowd. The tear gas mixture was {{allegedly}} diluted below the standard ratio owing {{to the presence of}} the elderly and the young at the protest. Nevertheless, protesters would deem the tear gas tactic an inhumane use of police force soon after the event. In a statement, the Korean Federation Medical Activist Groups for Health Rights (보건의료단체연합) criticized the used of tear gas liquid. The police were also publicly criticized for leaving behind tear gas {{at the site of the}} event, owing to the methylene chloride and CS gas that is harmful to humans.|$|E
25|$|The then current {{theory of}} colour held that white light was elementary, and that colours arose from {{mixtures}} {{of light and}} dark. Newton criticised this theory by noting that in that case a printed page, with its juxtaposition of light and dark, would look coloured. In folio 122 he recorded {{for the first time}} his notion that white light is heterogeneous and colour arise, not through the modification of a homogeneous white light, but from the separation of this <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> its components. Newton also mentions Hooke's theory of colour, including his idea that it is a wave. Newton dismisses this theory with the remark that then light should bend around edges of objects as sounds does.|$|E
5000|$|Physical {{changes are}} changes {{affecting}} {{the form of}} a chemical substance, but not its chemical composition. Physical changes are used to separate <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> their component compounds, but can not usually be used to separate compounds into chemical elements or simpler compounds.|$|R
5000|$|Spectroscopy {{techniques}} are useful when the sample being tested is pure, {{or a very}} common mixture. When an unknown mixture is being analyzed it must {{be broken down into}} its individual parts. Chromatography techniques can be used to break apart <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> their components allowing for each part to be analyzed separately.|$|R
50|$|Volatility is the {{readiness}} with which a substance vaporizes. Excessive volatility {{often results in}} the development of pressure within rounds of ammunition and separation of <b>mixtures</b> <b>into</b> their constituents. Volatility affects the chemical composition of the explosive such that a marked reduction in stability may occur, which results in an increase in the danger of handling.|$|R
25|$|Goodfellow was an {{innovative}} physician {{who was forced}} to experiment with differing methods than those utilized by physicians in more civilized eastern practices. He pioneered the idea of treating tuberculosis patients by exposing them to Arizona's dry climate. Goodfellow performed the first appendectomy in the Arizona Territory. During 1891 at St. Mary’s Hospital in Tucson, he performed what many {{consider to be the}} first perineal prostatectomy, an operation he developed to treat bladder problems by removing the enlarged prostate. He traveled extensively across the United States over the next decade, training other physicians to perform the procedure. Among these was Dr. Hugh Young, a well-known and respected urology professor at Johns Hopkins University. Goodfellow completed 78 operations and only two patients died, a remarkable level of success for the time period. He was among the first surgeons anywhere, let alone on the frontier of the United States, who used spinal anesthetic, which he improvised by crushing cocaine crystals in spinal fluid and reinjecting the <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> the patient's spine.|$|E
25|$|In a closed-circuit rebreather {{the oxygen}} partial {{pressure}} in the rebreather is controlled, {{so it can be}} maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial {{pressure in the}} breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen {{at any time during the}} dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems.|$|E
500|$|Continuous distillation, {{a form of}} distillation, is {{an ongoing}} {{separation}} in which a mixture is continuously (without interruption) fed into the process and separated fractions are removed continuously as output streams. [...] Distillation is the separation or partial separation of a liquid feed <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> components or fractions by selective boiling (or evaporation) and condensation. The process produces at least two output fractions. [...] These fractions include at least one volatile distillate fraction, which has boiled and been separately captured as a vapor condensed to a liquid, and practically always a bottoms (or residuum) fraction, which is the least volatile residue {{that has not been}} separately captured as a condensed vapor.|$|E

500|$|The Boom {{novels are}} {{essentially}} modernist novels. [...] They treat time as nonlinear, often use {{more than one}} perspective or narrative voice and feature {{a great number of}} neologisms (the coining of new words or phrases), puns and even profanities. [...] As Pope writes, in reference to the style of the Boom: [...] "It relied on a Cubist superposition of different points of view, it made time and lineal progress questionable, and it was technically complex. Linguistically self assured, it used the vernacular without apologies." [...] Other notable characteristics of the Boom include the treatment of both [...] "rural and urban settings", internationalism, an emphasis on both the historical and the political, as well as [...] "questioning of regional as well as, or more than, national identity; awareness of hemisphereic as well as worldwide economic and ideological issues; polemicism; and timeliness." [...] Boom literature breaks down the barriers between the fantastical and the mundane, transforming this <b>mixture</b> <b>into</b> a new reality. [...] Of the Boom writers, Gabriel García Márquez is most closely {{associated with the use of}} magical realism; indeed, he is credited with bringing it [...] "into vogue" [...] after the publishing of One Hundred Years of Solitude in 1967.|$|E
