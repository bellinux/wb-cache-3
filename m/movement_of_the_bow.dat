40|$|This article {{reviews the}} many {{clinical}} and laboratory investigative research {{reports on the}} frequency, causes, and biomechanics of human cervical spine impact injuries and tolerances. Neck injury mechanisms have been hypothesized from clinically observed cervical spine injuries without laboratory verification.

5000|$|Many classes <b>of</b> boats frequented <b>the</b> Chenango Canal and {{included}} packet boats, scows, lakers and bullheads- {{the name for}} the freight barges, which were the most common boats seen. The bullhead was so named because of its blunt and rounded bow. They were about 14 feet wide and 75 feet long and were sometimes loaded so heavily that they would periodically drag along <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal. The packet boats and barges were drawn at an average speed of four miles an hour by horse or mule teams on the towpath. The passenger boats were usually pulled by horses, which were changed every ten miles. The freight barges were pulled by mules, which were changed every 4 to 6 hours. Each barge had two cabins: one at <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> to stable <b>the</b> animals, usually horses or mules, that pulled the boat, and one at the stern which served as a living quarters for the captain and crew, and sometimes a whole family. The packet boats bore names like <b>The</b> Madison <b>of</b> Solsville, with Captain Bishop, or Fair Play, with Captain Van Slyck, and were manned by a minimum crew of 3. Each boat needed a driver walking on the towpath controlling the animals, a bowsman controlling <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> and direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> and a steersman on the aft deck. The passengers were seated in chairs on the top deck. When the boat would near a town, the crewmen shouted: [...] "Low bridge!" [...] and everyone would retreat to the lower deck to avoid being swept overboard by a bridge.|$|R

40|$|In {{ensemble}} musical performance, players {{strive to}} generate synchronous onsets for notes {{that are supposed}} to be played together. Important cues for correcting phase are available in <b>the</b> acoustic onsets <b>of</b> notes, so that when a pair of players detects an asynchrony, <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next note may be adjusted (Schulze, Cordes & Vorberg, 2005). However, such feedback correction only works in <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music and leaves unsolved <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> how to synchronise entries such as at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> a piece. In such cases vision can be a useful source <b>of</b> information as <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players (eg <b>bowing</b> arm in string players) in preparation for playing may allow others to predict <b>the</b> intended timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next note onset. In order to investigate <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> vision and audition in music ensemble, we prepared an avatar from a motion capture recording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first violinist in a leading chamber group playing <b>the</b> opening <b>of</b> a Haydn quartet. We then selectively edited out the left and right arms and head. When the other three players were asked to play with the reduced cue avatar, we observed <b>the</b> variance <b>of</b> asynchrony was smallest with left arm absent, larger with head absent and highest with right arm absent. We conclude that bowing arm movements provide important cues to timing in chamber music performance. We suggest that this method has promise for investigating other aspects of visual cue utilisation in music...|$|R
40|$|In ancient <b>bows</b> <b>the</b> grip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> was in <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrow. The arrow {{needed to}} get round <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> while being accelerated; this {{phenomenon}} is called the 'Archer's Paradox'. In the forties it was observed experimentally with high-speed cameras that the arrow vibrates in a horizontal plane perpendicular to the vertical median plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b> These <b>movements</b> are started and controlled by <b>the</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two points <b>of</b> contact with <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> viz. <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> string in contact with <b>the</b> rear end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrow and the grip where the arrow slides along <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b> <b>The</b> latter contact imposes a moving-boundary condition.

5000|$|A long-rod {{stabiliser}} holds {{a weight}} in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b> It is usually fitted into the centre section {{in line with}} <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> arm, or just below the hand position. <b>The</b> addition <b>of</b> this weight moves <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> gravity (C <b>of</b> G) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> forwards, with two results. First, [...] "torque" [...] effect (sideways twisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bow-hand) <b>movement</b> is reduced. At full draw, the string prevents <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> from twisting, but on release, <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> can turn sideways to some degree, directing the arrow {{to the left or}} right. But with <b>the</b> forward C <b>of</b> G, <b>the</b> effect is reduced. Similarly, [...] "topping" [...] (upwards) or [...] "heeling" [...] (downwards) inconsistencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bow-hand are reduced. Second, with actual <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bow-hand sideways, up, down, or any combination, because <b>the</b> C <b>of</b> G is in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand, <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> will turn in the opposite direction, to correct, to some degree, the archer's error.|$|R
50|$|Consider the bow {{as being}} {{potentially}} on a pivot at the pressure {{point of the}} bow-hand.

By careful study of the bow's movement, the appropriate positioning and addition of weight(s) may be tried, to reduce errors, although prevention is better than cure.|$|E
5000|$|All {{bodies have}} inertia, {{and it is}} static inertia and non-static inertia that bow-weights [...] "use", {{which means that they}} resist movement. Consequently, on the {{application}} of any force on the bow, e.g. 1) muscular force, whether voluntary or involuntary: 2) the reaction of the bow to the acceleration of the bow limbs, string and arrow: 3) the further reaction of the bow as the string becomes taut and the arrow flies free: the actual physical <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> centre section will be less with the addition of weights {{than it would have been}} without. Clearly, the forces acting on the centre section are potentially the same on any shot, and by increasing the static inertia, movement will be reduced.|$|E
50|$|The kemane {{can be made}} {{in various}} forms. The length varies between 480 and 540 mm, their shape can be either {{straight}} or bent in a curved shape. Older kemane's were made by hacking holes in the instrument in which were inserted horse tail hairs, however the modern kemane's strings are attached to a wooden headstock, similar to that of a violin. It is prepared out of one piece of wood (walnut, maple, or other) with three structural parts: the body (krtuna), neck (shija), and the headstock (glava). The strings are set at different heights, {{so that it can be}} played on two strings simultaneously.

50|$|In {{different}} cultures, {{the arrows}} are released {{from either the}} left or right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> and this affects the hand grip and position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b> In Arab archery, Turkish archery and Kyūdō, the arrows are released from the right hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> and this affects construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b> In western archery, the arrow is usually released from the left hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b>|$|R

5000|$|One {{striking}} {{effect that}} employs open strings is bariolage. This is the repeated alternation of notes played on {{two or more}} strings, {{where one of the}} notes is usually an open string. This string crossing is often rapid, and is best executed with a sinuous <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> arm. Sometimes the same pitch as an open string will be fingered on an adjacent string, so that the alternation is between the same note on two strings, one stopped, one open, giving a rhythmic pulsating effect. Bariolage was a favorite device of Joseph Haydn, who used it for example in his string quartet Opus 50 no. 6, and in the [...] "Farewell" [...] Symphony. It is also prominently featured in the Preludium of Bach's Partita No.3 in E major for solo violin.|$|E
5000|$|Further, {{various types}} of mount have been used, to allow some degree of flexure between the bow and the {{stabiliser}} weight. Similarly, the weight may be on an extension rod that may flex in itself. The object of the exercise {{should be kept in}} mind, and that object is to reduce bow inadvertent movement. Any flexure will allow some <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow,</b> without similar movement of the weight, hence lessening the weight inertia. However, many archers have found an apparent improvement in their precision with the use of flex / mounts. The weight in hand remains unchanged, and so may contribute to steadyness of aim. Also, the flexing gives a [...] "rubbery" [...] feeling, as though the bow wants to remain steady on aim. Consequently, it may be that such effect helps the archer's feeling of confidence on the shot, thereby contributing to precision.|$|E

New York, Feb. 2.: Mr Charles Kellogg, a Californian scientist, give firemen here a demonstration of extinguishing a gas flame two feet high by tonal vibration. Mr Kellogg passed a bow, like an enlarged violin bow, swiftly across an aluminium tuning fork, producing a screech like an intense radio static.

50|$|The body of {{the marine}} trumpet is {{generally}} either three sides of wood joined in an elongated triangle shape with a pegbox at the apex; or a body of three to six ribs, a frontal soundboard, and a distinguishable neck. In most cases the bottom end of the instrument is open; some historical models use sound-holes. The single string, generally the D string of a cello, most often is tuned to the C three octaves below middle C. It attaches at the soundboard and passes over one foot of the bridge, leaving the other foot to vibrate freely on a plate of ivory or glass set into the soundboard, creating a brassy buzz. From its curiously irregular shape, the bridge was {{also known as the}} shoe; it was thick and high at the one side on which rested the string, and low and narrow at the other which was left loose so that it vibrated against the belly with every <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b> A string called a guidon is tied around the playing string below the bridge and runs up to the pegbox where it is wrapped around a peg.

40|$|A skilled string {{performer}} {{is able to}} play {{a series}} of spiccato notes (short strokes played by a bouncing bow) with each onset showing little or no aperiodic motion before a regular slip/stick pattern (Helmholtz motion) is triggered. Kinematic analysis reveals that a well-behaving bow gives nearly vertical impacts on the string, and that the first slip of each note takes place when the normal bow force is near its maximum. The complex <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> stick can be decomposed into a translational and a rotational motion. Within one full cycle of the translational motion (down-up bow), giving two notes, the bow describes two periods of rotational motion.

5000|$|A cable-backed bow is a bow {{reinforced}} with a cable on the back. The cable {{is made from}} either animal, vegetable or synthetic fibers and is tightened to increase <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow.</b> A cable will relieve tension stress from <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> by raising its neutral plane: the border between <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> that stretches and <b>the</b> belly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> that compresses when bent. A good cable-backed bow can thus be made of poor-quality wood, weak in tension. The material, the diameter, the distance from <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wooden element, and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> stress (tightness) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cable determines how much it relieves tension stress from <b>the</b> wooden element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> and increases <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shot.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present certain {{concepts}} and the necessary materials which will lead toward {{the development of a}} thorough foundation for the beginner. This purpose is not new, for it is the intent of any violin method to develop the playing ability of the student, but the approach used is unique in the opinion of the author. An introduction is made by the use of open string double-stops. With the use of double stops, the pupil has a double means of control. He must not only hear two pitches sounding simultaneously, but must also see that his bow is in contact with two strings at all times. He must maintain a steady <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bow</b> arm on the same plane from the frog to the tip of the bow. The resulting bow movement should be free, firm and steady. The introduction of spiccato and staccato to a pupil at this beginning period, is made to bring about a feeling of familiarity with the instrument and a certain degree of control of the bow. From this point on the emphasis is placed on ear training. The correct placement of the third finger of the left hand is determined by adjustment until a perfect octave is formed with the adjacent lower string. With pupils whose hands are fairly well developed in size, the next step will be the placement of the fourth finger in correct position to form a perfect unison with the adjacent higher string. After the correct position is found for the third finger, the second finger is placed on the string close to the third thus forming Fa and Mi. Re and Do are introduced by using the first finger and the open string in that order. The formation of the tetrachord by placing fingers 3, 2, 1 and the open string gives us the basis of the entire text. The tetrachord is given in five positions so that the pupil becomes familiar with the key of C, G, D, A, E, B, F, Bb, Eb and Ab. Nevertheless, the tonal pattern of the tetrachord and the relationship within the four tones of the group remains the same in every key. The pupil has experienced in his schoolroom vocal study the pattern Fa-Mi-Re-Do. He is able to recognize it and when necessary sing it. He is able to determine the placement of each finger on the fingerboard by remembering that only those fingers used to play the third and fourth steps of the tetrachord will be placed in a close position. There is no mention made of high or low finger positions. The placement of each finger is determined aurally. The rhythmic development parallels the melodic. As each new position of the tetrachord is mastered a new rhythmic problem is introduced. The pupil becomes familiar with quarter, half, dotted-half, whole, eighth, dotted quarter, sixteenth notes, their corresponding rests and six-eight time, in the order mentioned. The author has given no bowing indications for a very definite reason. He has felt that an introduction to bowing and slurring can be made after the problems in this method have been mastered. He feels {{that there will be no}} great handicap if this introduction is postponed until that time. He has intended to stress good intonation and its development as the primary objective. With the exception of "America" every song used is a folksong, The songs used are all very melodic, a majority of them familiar and all of a type within a young pupils range of appeal and interest. They have been placed in the text, and in a few instances altered for use with a particular problem. The find feature is also instrumental in making this text unusual. Each song is repeated in many ways. It is presented on different strings so that it is played in a new key each time, yet the finger pattern of the tetrachord remains the same on each string. The songs are also used for review purposes. After a song is mastered in the new pattern, it is presented in the key of one of the pattern previously learned, thus providing a bridge between the new and the old...|$|E
