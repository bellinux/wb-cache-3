40|$|Man-made {{vitreous}} fibre (MMVF) is {{a generic}} name {{used to describe}} an inorganic fibrous material manufactured primarily from glass, rock, minerals, slag and processed inorganic oxides. The MMVFs produced are non-crystalline (glassy, vitreous, amorphous). Other names for MMVFs include manufactured vitreous fibres, man-made mineral fibres (MMMF), <b>machine-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> and synthetic vitreous fibres. Continuous glass filament is sometimes {{also referred to as}} ‘glass textile fibre’. The term ‘mineral wool ’ has been used in the USA to describe only rock (stone) wool and slag wool. In Europe, ‘mineral wool ’ also includes glass wool. In this monograph, the terms rock (stone) wool, slag wool and glass wool are used rather than mineral wool, whenever possible. Man-made vitreous fibres are manufactured by a variety of processes based on the attenuation of a thin stream of molten inorganic oxides at high temperatures. All commercially important MMVFs are silica-based and contain various amounts of other inorganic oxides. The non-silica components typically include, but are not limited to, oxides of alkaline earths, alkalis, aluminium, boron, iron and zirconium. These additional oxides may be constituents of the raw materials used to make the fibres, or they may be added to enhance the manufacturing process or the product performance. Depending on the process of fibre formation, MMVFs are produced either as wool, which is a mass of tangled, discontinuous fibres of variable lengths and diameters, or as filaments, which are continuous fibres (of indeterminate length) with diameters having ranges that are more uniform and typically thicker than those of wool. (a) Categorization The previous IARC Monographs on man-made mineral fibres (IARC, 1988) grouped fibres into five categories based loosely on raw materials, production process and/or product application. These categories were: glass filament, glass wool, rock wool, slag wool and ceramic fibres. To reflect developments in the industry, the categories have been expanded an...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the combined effects of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> and cigarette smoke on the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by alveolar macrophages. Rats were exposed to cigarette smoke in vivo, and production of TNF by alveolar macrophages was measured in the presence of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> in vitro. For smoke exposure, rats were divided into two groups. Five were exposed to a daily concentration of 10 mg/m 3 of cigarette smoke for an eight hour period, and five rats (controls) were not exposed to smoke. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed after exposure to smoke and the recovered alveolar macrophages were incubated with either chrysotile or ceramic fibres on a microplate for 24 hours. Activity of TNF in the supernatant was determined by the L- 929 fibroblast cell bioassay. When alveolar macrophages were not stimulated by <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres,</b> production of TNF by rats exposed to smoke and unexposed rats was essentially the same. When alveolar macrophages were stimulated in vitro by chrysotile or ceramic fibres, production of TNF by alveolar macrophages from rats exposed to smoke was higher than that by alveolar macrophages from unexposed rats.

40|$|Although {{asbestos}} represents today one of {{the most}} harmful contaminant on Earth, in 72 % of the countries worldwide only amphiboles are banned while controlled use of chrysotile is allowed. Uncertainty on the potential toxicity of chrysotile {{is due to the fact}} that the mechanisms by which <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> induces cyto- and geno-toxic damage are still unclear. We have recently started a long term project aimed at the systematic investigation of the crystal-chemistry, bio-interaction and toxicity of the <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres.</b> This work presents a systematic structural investigation of iron in asbestos and erionite (considered the most relevant <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> of social and/or economic-industrial importance) using synchrotron X-ray absorption and Mössbauer spectroscopy. In all investigated <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres,</b> iron in the bulk structure is found in octahedral sites and can be made available at the surface via fibre dissolution. We postulate that the amount of hydroxyl radicals released by the fibers depends, among other factors, upon their dissolution rate; in relation to this, a ranking of ability of asbestos fibres to generate hydroxyl radicals, resulting from available surface iron, is advanced: amosite> crocidolite≈chrysotile > anthophyllite > tremolite. Erionite, with a fairly high toxicity potential, contains only octahedrally coordinated Fe 3 +. Although it needs further experimental evidence, such available surface iron may be present as oxide nanoparticles coating and can be a direct cause of generation of hydroxyl radicals when such coating dissolves...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Mounting {{evidence}} suggests that asbestos fibres can stimulate alveolar macrophages to generate the potent inflammatory and fibrogenic mediator, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and that this may play {{an important part in}} the onset and development of airway inflammation and lung fibrosis due to asbestos fibre inhalation. Little is known, however, about the ability of other <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> to initiate formation and release of TNF-alpha by alveolar macrophages. Therefore the effects of different fibres (crocidolite, chrysotile A, chrysotile B, two man made <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> (MMVF 21 and MMVF 22), a ceramic fibre (RCF 1), and a silicon carbide whisker fibre (SiCwh)) on formation and release of TNF-alpha by rat alveolar macrophages were examined. METHODS [...] Cells were isolated and incubated at 37 degrees C with the different fibres, or with culture medium alone (controls), and the amounts of TNF-alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cells and TNF-alpha bioactivity released into the culture medium were measured at different time points. RESULTS [...] Significantly (P < 0. 05 v control) increased amounts of TNF-alpha mRNA were found in cells exposed to crocidolite, chrysotile A, chrysotile B, MMVF 21, RCF 1, or SiCwh for 90 minutes, and significantly (P < 0. 05 v control) increased activities of TNF-alpha were found in the medium of macrophages exposed to crocidolite, chrysotile A, chrysotile B, or MMVF 21 for four hours.

40|$|Evidence on the {{mechanism}} by which inhaled <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> lead to pulmonary fibrosis has not been forthcoming. As with silica, a biphasic cell culture system was required to distinguish phagocytosis from collagen formation. Synthesis of total protein and collagen by rat fibroblasts was estimated by incorporation of labelled proline after treatment with the medium from rat peritoneal macrophages that had been cultured {{in the presence of}} different types of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre.</b> The influence of fibre length was also examined. All the main varieties of asbestos reacted with macrophages to produce or release a fibrogenic factor. However, chrysotile and the longer amosite fibres evoked the response only after prolonging the period of incubation with macrophages, presumably by permitting more complete phagocytosis of curled or longer fibres. Short amosite fibres proved to be more active than longer ones and under certain conditions were as potent as quartz. Fibrous glass also possessed stimulatory properties and again a sample having a short length gave a stronger response than a long one. Collagen formation by asbestos thus appears to be mediated by a macrophage factor, so operating {{in a manner similar to}} that previously demonstrated for quartz. The conventional view that short fibres are comparatively insignificant in asbestos fibrogenesis cannot, on the present evidence, be sustained. Furthermore, it should not be assumed than man-made <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> of respirable diameter are innocuous or that short ones can be ignored...|$|R

The dissolution of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> in buffered inorganic solutions is the key to understanding their behaviour during weathering processes because it contributes not only to their chemical transformation, but also to the breakdown of the fibres that may be dispersed in the environment. On the other hand, preparation of fluids representing different interstitial conditions in the lung is described, with particular attention to artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF) employed to mimic the environment that inhaled particles would encounter after phagocytosis by alveolar and interstitial macrophages. Moreover, the use of a neutral fluid such as Gamble’s solution (GS) simulates the interstitial lung fluid and airway lining fluid. Finally, the results of studies of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> dissolution in inorganic and body fluids, found in the literature, are discussed. Methodologies for assessing the biodurability of fibres are illustrated, starting from dissolution rate data and focus on in vitro studies.

40|$|Since 2011, a {{research}} project on <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> entitled “Sviluppo di un modello generale di interazioni tra fibre minerali e cellule biologiche”, has been conducted {{as part of the}} long term Italian Research Project of National Interest (PRIN) “Interazione fra minerali e biosfera: conseguenze per l'ambiente e la salute umana”. The research project is specifically focussed on <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> and is aimed at understanding the biochemical reactions that make them cytoand geno-toxic and at the development of a general model capable to classify each <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> based on its toxicity potential. The attempt to understand the complex biochemical mechanisms between the <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> and the organic matter requires a basic systematic mineralogical-crystallographic study. Hence, eight <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> samples have been selected for the study based on their socio-economic and industrial importance: three chrysotile of different origin (UICC, Canada; Balangero and Val Malenco, Italy), four amphibole asbestos species (amosite UICC, anthophyllite UICC, crocidolite UICC and tremolite from Val d'Ala) and the fibrous zeolite erionite (from Jersey, Nevada, USA). The surface reactivity and the chemical environment of iron within the crystal structure of these samples have been recently investigated (Pollastri et al. 2014; 2015). In order to complete the crystal structural characterization, X-ray powder and single crystal diffraction experiments have been conducted using both conventional and synchrotron radiation sources (Elettra, Trieste, Italy; SLS, Villigen, Switzerland), for the determination of impurities and the refinement of the crystalline structures. Concerning the chrysotile samples, because of the low to null effect of conventional grinding techniques on chrysotile fibre bundles, we have opted for a cryo-milling process in wet conditions; this procedure allowed to obtain perfectly powder samples. For chrysotile and erionite samples, diffraction patterns were collected with either resonant radiation at the absorption K-edge of Fe (≈ 7 keV, λ 1. 7428 Å) and with wavelength off of the absorption edge (≈ 10 keV, λ 1. 2408 Å) in order to investigate the crystal chemistry of iron within the fibres. The collected data were analysed both with the TOPAS and GSAS. The results of the structural refinements, in particular occupancy and position of the iron atoms within the crystal structures (a primary cause of toxicity as it generate active oxygen species, mobilization by chelators and iron-catalyzed reactions; Hardy and Aust, 1995), were compared to that obtained from the previously performed spectroscopic investigations. The obtained structures of chrysotile samples are similar to each other and quite similar to the only available structure of chrysotile present in literature (Falini et al., 2004).
