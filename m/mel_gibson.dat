50|$|The Jewish {{magazine}} Heeb {{published a}} 10-page photo feature in its Winter 2004 edition mocking <b>Mel</b> <b>Gibsons</b> movie The Passion of the Christ called Back Off, Braveheart. The editors who introduced the spread {{said that the}} death of Jesus was summarily blamed upon the Jews, until this fondly held belief seemed destined to fade forever after Vatican II. A sexually suggestive Jesus played by artist Carlos J. Da Silva wears a Jewish prayer shawl as a loin cloth, and the Blessed Mother was shown exposing her breasts and body piercing. The occupation of the model photographed as Mary Magdalene was described as Evangelist-cum-nymphomaniac country singer. She was quoted as saying, Who killed Jesus? Ryan Adams. The woman who was photographed as Pontius Pilate was quoted as saying, Christians believe the Jews killed Jesus; that is why {{there is so much}} anti-Semitism in the world. The church was created on that one simple anti-Semitic principle. Christians who say otherwise are making it up or misrepresenting their own religion.|$|R

5000|$|However, Dragojević {{experienced}} {{major problems}} persuading the studios to fund his projects, {{and he also}} mostly didnt like the ideas being offered to him. The closest he got to finishing a movie was the heist-comedy on whose script he was co-credited with Alan Sereboff - The Payback All-Star Revue - that was agreed to be a co-production between Miramax and <b>Mel</b> <b>Gibsons</b> Icon Productions. The announcement was made in November 2000 with Dragojević upbeat about the project he envisioned as a [...] "funny and commercial film containing a unique mix of genres, including Shakespearean subplots and unpredictable structures". The plot revolved around a band of lounge musicians playing in the Riviera casino in Las Vegas who decide to rob {{the place where they}} perform. Though they manage to pull off the heist successfully, they run into troubles during the getaway. Now trapped, they agree to give themselves up on the condition that they are granted an interview with a Rolling Stone reporter to tell their story. The planned plot featured a multitude of characters with many subplots. However, in the middle of pre-production the movie got canceled in 2001 due to an impending SAG strike threat and the Warner Bros. announcement of putting Oceans 11 remake with an all-star cast into pre-production, which Miramax thought would jeopardize Paybacks box-office appeal. Over the following years, by now known for his frank and colourful interviews, Dragojević talked openly about the experience:As mentioned, while in America, there were numerous other projects that he ultimately ended up not getting involved in. Soon upon arriving Dragojević met with Harvey Weinstein who offered him Milčo Mančevskis script Dust, but Dragojević refused it reasoning that its a very personal script that can more or less only be directed by Mančevski, and also due to discovering that, as he put it in one interview, [...] "offering me that script was the Weinsteins little fuck you to Mančevski with whom they were on bad terms at that moment". The studio then offered Dragojević the Heaven, Hell, Purgatory trilogy, while they particularly wanted him to direct Hell, however he vehemently refused, labeling the script [...] "the dumbest thing Ive ever read" [...] in another interview. He was interested in filming Patrick Marbers play Closer as far back as 1999, but the studio turned him down. They then offered him Reindeer Games, but he refused figuring something better would come along. He was by his own admission particularly interested in directing either Frida or View from the Top, however {{in the case of the}} former, the movies producer and star Salma Hayek wanted a female director so the job went to Julie Taymor while in the case of the latter, the films producers as well as its star Gwyneth Paltrow didnt like Dragojevićs ironic take on the screenplay and Bruno Barreto got the job instead. He was also in the running for The Mexican, but the job went to Gore Verbinski. Summing up his Hollywood experience, Dragojević said: ...|$|R
5|$|For {{the role}} of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose {{popularity}} was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for The Terminator. Cameron was dubious about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even bigger to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and <b>Mel</b> <b>Gibson</b> were offered the Terminator role, but both turned it down. The studio suggested O. J.

Before accepting the role, Costner conducted extensive research on Garrison, including meeting the man and his enemies. Two months after finally signing on to play Garrison in January 1991, his film Dances with Wolves won seven Academy Awards and so his presence greatly enhanced JFKs bankability in the studio's eyes.|$|E

Gibson's gamble paved the way for Downey's comeback and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid-2000s with Gothika, for which producer Joel Silver withheld 40 percent of his salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior. Similar clauses have become standard in his contracts since then. Silver, who was getting closer to Downey as he dated his assistant Susan Levin, also got the actor the leading role in the comedy thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, the directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black.|$|E

5|$|Showing acting skill {{early in}} life, Bana began doing {{impressions}} {{of family members}} {{at the age of}} six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather's walk, voice and mannerisms. In school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the <b>Mel</b> <b>Gibson</b> film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, however, so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables.|$|E

After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus.

5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with <b>Mel</b> <b>Gibson,</b> fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|In April 2001, {{while he}} was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him {{wandering}} barefoot in Culver City, just outside Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system. After this last arrest, producer David E. Kelley and other Ally McBeal executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and dismissed Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated Ally McBeals ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film America's Sweethearts, and the subsequent incarceration forced <b>Mel</b> <b>Gibson</b> to shut down his planned stage production of Hamlet, as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, benefiting from the California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.|$|E
