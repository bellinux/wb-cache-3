Although different countries might have used units of <b>measure</b> <b>with</b> the same name, such as the foot, or local language equivalents such as pied, Fuß, and voet, there was no consistency in the magnitude of those units, nor in the relationships with their multiples and submultiples, much like the modern-day differences between the US and the UK pints and gallons.|$|E

Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,37822,499 was seen by the party as a mandate to pursue the relief agenda. An early proposal to reduce the salaries of the Court of Appeals justices to 25 cents per year was discarded without a vote, but the House of Representatives mustered the votes to remove the offending justices. The justices were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the <b>measure</b> <b>with</b> a two-thirds majority. The vote was 2312.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the renal {{function}} <b>measured</b> <b>with</b> either 99 mTc-DTPA or 99 mTc-EC dynamic scintigraphies <b>with</b> that <b>measured</b> using 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy. METHODS: the values of relative renal function measured in 111 renal dynamic scintigraphies performed either with 99 mTc-DTPA (55 studies) or with 99 mTc-EC (56 studies) were compared with the relative function measured using 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy performed within a 1 -month period. The comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. The number of 99 mTc-DTPA and 99 mTc-EC studies that presented relative renal function different by more than 5 % from that <b>measured</b> <b>with</b> 99 mTc-DMSA, using chi square test were also compared. RESULTS: the relative renal function <b>measured</b> <b>with</b> 99 mTc-EC is not statistically different from that <b>measured</b> <b>with</b> 99 mTc-DMSA (p = 0. 97). The relative renal function <b>measured</b> <b>with</b> 99 mTc-DTPA was statistically different from that measured using 99 mTc-DMSA, but with a borderline statistical significance (p = 0. 05). The number of studies with relative renal function different by more than 5 % from that <b>measured</b> <b>with</b> 99 mTc-DMSA is higher for the 99 mTc-DTPA scintigraphy (p = 0. 04) than for 99 mTc-EC. CONCLUSION: the relative renal function <b>measured</b> <b>with</b> 99 mTc-EC dynamic scintigraphy is comparable <b>with</b> that <b>measured</b> <b>with</b> 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy, while the relative renal function <b>measured</b> <b>with</b> 99 mTc-DTPA dynamic scintigraphy presents a significant statistical difference from that <b>measured</b> <b>with</b> 99 mTc-DMSA static scintigraphy...|$|R

Client factors included therapist identification with the client, the number of trauma clients seen, and whether the client improved during therapy. The external factors pertained {{to the amount of}} formal training of the therapist, use of supervision, and the level of supervisee development.
