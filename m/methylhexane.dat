40|$|Hydroconversion of {{methylcyclohexane}} {{was conducted}} over various noble metal-loaded catalysts at 493 K and atmospheric pressure. On {{the bases of}} the proposed reaction route {{and the rate of}} reaction over Ir/H-β zeolite, which was the best catalyst examined, we concluded that the low yield of the desired dimethylpentanes (18 %) and high yield of undesired <b>methylhexanes</b> (25 %) were due to two reasons: (1) formation of ethylcyclopentane with high selectivity at low conversions and (2) higher ring-opening rate of ethylcyclopentane (a precursor of <b>methylhexanes)</b> than that of dimethylcyclopentanes (a precursor of dimethylpentanes). In order to improve the yield of dimethylpentanes, two catalysts for ring contraction from methylcyclohexane to ethyl- or dimethyl-cyclopentanes (Pt-H 4 SiW 12 O 40 /SiO 2 or Pt/H-β) and for ring opening of the produced cyclopentanes (Ir/Al 2 O 3) were used either in one reactor as a physical mixture or in two separate reactors connected in series. When the physical mixture (Pt-H 4 SiW 12 O 40 /SiO 2 and Ir/Al 2 O 3) was used, there was only a slight increase in the dimethylpentanes yield (20 %) with a large amount of undesired products, such as monobranched heptanes and cracked products. In contrast, when two consecutive reactors packed with Ir/H-β and lr/Al 2 O 3 were used, the yield of dimethylpentanes increased to 30 %, which was nearly two times of that of <b>methylhexanes,</b> at a 65 % conversion of methylcyclohexane, while the yield of undesired <b>methylhexanes</b> was about 15 %...|$|R
40|$|A {{suite of}} 18 oils from the Barrow Island oilfield, Australia, and a non-biodegraded {{reference}} oil have been analysed compositionally {{in order to}} detail the effect of minor to moderate biodegradation on C₅ to C₉ hydrocarbons. Carbon isotopic data for individual low molecular weight hydrocarbons were also obtained for six of the oils. The Barrow Island oils came from different production wells, reservoir horizons, and compartments, but have a common source (the Upper Jurassic Dingo Claystone Formation), with some organo-facies differences. Hydrocarbon ratios based on hopanes, steranes, alkylnaphthalenes and alkylphenanthrenes indicate thermal maturities of about 0. 8 % Rc {{for most of the}} oils. The co-occurrence in all the oils of relatively high amounts of 25 -norhopanes with C₅ to C₉ hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and cyclic alkanes implies that the oils are the result of multiple charging, with a heavily biodegraded charge being overprinted by fresher and more pristine oil. The later oil charge was itself variably biodegraded, leading to significant compositional variations across the oilfield, which help delineate compartmentalisation. Biodegradation resulted in strong depletion of n-alkanes (> 95 %) from most of the oils. Benzene and toluene were partially or completely removed from the Barrow Island oils by water washing. However, hydrocarbons with lower water solubility were either not affected by water washing, or water washing had only a minor effect. There are three main controls on the susceptibility to biodegradation of cyclic, branched and aromatic low molecular weight hydrocarbons: carbon skeleton, degree of alkylation, and position of alkylation. Firstly, ring preference ratios at C₆ and C₇ show that isoalkanes are retained preferentially relative to alkylcyclohexanes, and to some extent alkylcyclopentanes. Dimethylpentanes are substantially more resistant to biodegradation than most dimethylcyclopentanes, but <b>methylhexanes</b> are depleted faster than methylpentanes and dimethylcyclopentanes. For C₈ and C₉ hydrocarbons, alkylcyclohexanes are more resistant to biodegradation than linear alkanes. Secondly, there is a trend of lower susceptibility to biodegradation with greater alkyl substitution for isoalkanes, alkylcyclohexanes, alkylcyclopentanes and alkylbenzenes. Thirdly, the position of alkylation has a strong control, with adjacent methyl groups reducing the susceptibility of an isomer to biodegradation. 1, 2, 3 -Trimethylbenzene is the most resistant of the C₃ alkylbenzene isomers during moderate biodegradation. 2 -Methylalkanes are the most susceptible branched alkanes to biodegradation, 3 -methylalkanes are the most resistant and 4 -methylalkanes have intermediate resistance. Therefore, terminal methyl groups are more prone to bacterial attack compared to mid-chain isomers, and C₃ carbon chains are more readily utilised than C₂ carbon chains. 1, 1 -Dimethylcyclopentane and 1, 1 -dimethylcyclohexane are the most resistant of the alkylcyclohexanes and alkylcyclopentanes to biodegradation. The straight-chained and branched C₅–C₉ alkanes are isotopically light (depleted in ¹³C) relative to cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. The effects of biodegradation consistently lead to enrichment in ¹³C for each remaining hydrocarbon, due to preferential removal of ¹²C. Differences in the rates of biodegradation of low molecular weight hydrocarbons shown by compositional data are also reflected in the level of enrichment in ¹³C. The carbon isotopic effects of biodegradation show a decreasing level of isotopic enrichments in ¹³C with increasing molecular weight. This suggests that the kinetic isotope effect associated with biodegradation is site-specific and often related to a terminal carbon, where its impact on the isotopic composition becomes progressively ‘diluted’ with increasing carbon number. 25 page(s...|$|R
