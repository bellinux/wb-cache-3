5|$|A large monsoon trough was {{anchored}} {{south of}} Guam {{towards the end}} of July. By July21, three areas of disturbed weather had formed. Although the westernmost disturbance dissipated, the easternmost two continued to develop, one of which would later become Typhoon Andy. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the easternmost system at 1900UTC on July21 as sea level pressures fell and convection increased within the vicinity of the disturbance. After becoming better organized, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started <b>monitoring</b> <b>the</b> system. Later on July22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started <b>monitoring</b> <b>the</b> same system as it developed rainbands and a further increase in thunderstorm activity. Initially, the JTWC correctly predicted the low to move northwest. Hurricane Hunters indicated that the low and mid-level centers were not vertically aligned. On July23, both the JMA and JTWC upped the depression into a tropical storm. Bess then began to intensify. At 0600UTC on July24, Bess was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA. After the formation of an eye, both agencies classified Bess as a typhoon.|$|E

5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, {{the storm}} weakened rapidly {{as it began}} to move west-northwest. Later that morning, MFR downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. By April 15, MFR downgraded the system into a tropical depression. That very day, the JTWC reported that winds of Helisaonia had fallen below hurricane-force. During the morning hours of April 17, the JTWC downgraded Helisaonina into a depression. Shortly thereafter, MFR stopped <b>monitoring</b> <b>the</b> system. After re-curving just east of Madagascar, Helisanonina dissipated according to the JTWC on April 18. While the storm was weakening, it passed close to Rodrigues without causing any known impact.|$|E

5|$|Early on November 20, the JTWC {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed. Shortly thereafter, MFR {{reported that}} a tropical disturbance had formed. The low moved west-southwest while gradually deepening. Late on November 20, MFR upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm. The storm failed to intensify further as it had moved onshore northern Madagascar. By November 21, MFR estimated that the storm weakened back into a disturbance. After emerging into the Mozambique Channel, Anety reportedly re-intensified back to moderate tropical storm status. While making its closest approach to the African mainland, the storm resumed weakening while turning back southeast. On November 23, both agencies stopped <b>monitoring</b> <b>the</b> system.|$|E

5|$|In late October1991, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed near the Caroline Islands. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the system gradually became more defined. On October31, convection {{associated with the}} system quickly increased, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). Early on November1, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began <b>monitoring</b> <b>the</b> system as {{a tropical}} depression, at which time the system was situated roughly 415km (260mi) north-northeast of Palau. Following a satellite-derived surface wind estimate of 45km/h (30mph) later that day, the JTWC also began <b>monitoring</b> <b>the</b> low as a tropical depression. Initially, forecast models showed the system continuing on an arcing path out to sea; however, the system turned westward on November2 and threatened the Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Uring. Late on November3, the depression turned west-southwestward towards the Visayas {{in response to an}} approaching cold front, an event typical of late-season cyclones in the basin. On November4, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with the latter assigning it the name Thelma.|$|E
