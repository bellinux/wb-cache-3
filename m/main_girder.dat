25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion to the fuselage, the wings were made up of three large units: centre section, port outer wing and {{starboard}} outer wing, which were in turn subdivided. Each section was built up around a <b>main</b> <b>girder</b> spar, leading edge section and trailing edge section. The wing made use of wingtip slots and hydraulically-actuated trailing edge flaps; both the flaps and ailerons incorporated stress-bearing D-spars. According to Moyes, {{the configuration of the}} wing was a key feature of Hampden, being highly tapered and designed to exert low levels of drag; these attributes were responsible for the aircraft's high top speed for the era of 265 MPH while retaining a reasonably low landing speed of 73 MPH.|$|E

40|$|Cable {{force of}} {{construction}} control and alignment control of <b>main</b> <b>girders</b> are key factors for long-span railway cable-stayed bridges. To make both stayed cable force and alignment of <b>main</b> <b>girders</b> under ideal state simultaneously during construction, based on first-order optimum algorithm, this article regards bending strain energy as an objective function, {{and then the}} initial tension can be known through iteration. After analyzing the impact of some factors on alignment control of <b>main</b> <b>girders,</b> such as initial tension of stayed cables and construction load, the formula of alignment control about <b>main</b> <b>girders</b> can be obtained. Finally, taking one of the world's largest railway cable-stayed bridges for an example, the article calculates the initial tension of stayed cables, and analyses the effects of some factors on alignment control of long-span railway cable-stayed bridges. It turns out that this method can keep the alignment and internal force of <b>main</b> <b>girders</b> reasonable. </p...|$|R

2500|$|On December 15, 1973, an 80-foot {{section of}} the {{northbound}} lanes between Little West 12th Street and Gansevoort Street collapsed {{under the weight of}} a dump truck, which was thought to carry over [...] of asphalt for ongoing repairs of the highway.

It was later learned that the truck was actually carrying 30 tons of asphalt, and was 9 tons overloaded. Blame was assigned to the trucking company, Edenwald Construction Corp. of Whitestone, Queens, but they were still awarded a no-bid contract to clean up the mess. The day after, both directions were closed indefintely south of 18th Street. This not only closed off the oldest section (between Canal Street and 18th Street), but also the newest sections (south of Canal Street), because ramps south of the collapse only permitted northbound entrances and southbound exits. The southernmost northbound exit was at 23rd Street.|$|E

50|$|As {{development}} of the testbed design continued at HDL, the problem of high-speed loads on the guideway became obvious. In spite of its light weight compared to conventional train sets, the Tracked Hovercraft operated at such high speeds that its passage induced vibration modes in the guideway {{that needed to be}} damped out. This was a relatively new field for the civil engineers that were working on the guideway design, as their field was more generally concerned with static loads. The train layout was redesigned with a box-like <b>main</b> <b>girder,</b> with a top-mounted reaction plate being used for the LIM, and the vertical sides of the guideway being used for centring. Wing-like extensions extended down from the body of the train and covered the centring pads.

50|$|The {{investigation}} {{was one of}} the first major inquiries conducted by the newly formed Railway Inspectorate.

He tested the remaining girders by driving a locomotive across them, and found that they deflected by several inches under the moving load. He concluded that the design was basically flawed, and that the wrought iron trusses fixed to the girders did not reinforce the girders at all, which was a conclusion also reached by the jury at the inquest. Stephenson's design had depended on the wrought iron trusses to strengthen the final structures, but they were anchored on the cast iron girders themselves, and so deformed with any strain on the bridge.|$|E
