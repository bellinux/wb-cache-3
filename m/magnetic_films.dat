50|$|Conventional {{magnetic}} materials, {{like the}} magnetic tape used in twistor, allowed the magnetic signal {{to be placed}} at any location and to move in any direction. Paul Charles Michaelis working with permalloy magnetic thin films discovered {{that it was possible}} to move magnetic signals in orthogonal directions within the film. This seminal work led to a patent application. The memory device and method of propagation were described in a paper presented at the 13th Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials, Boston, Massachusetts, 15 September 1967. The device used anisotropic thin <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> that required different magnetic pulse combinations for orthogonal propagation directions. The propagation velocity was also dependent on the hard and easy magnetic axes. This difference suggested that an isotropic magnetic medium would be desirable.|$|E
50|$|Spin {{waves are}} {{collective}} perturbations in a magnetic solid. Their properties {{depend on their}} wavelength (or wave vector). For long wavelength (short wave vector) spin wave the resulting spin precession has a very low frequency and the spin waves can be treated classically. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and Brillouin light scattering (BLS) experiments provide information about the long wavelength spin waves in ultrathin <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> and nanostructures. If the wavelength {{is comparable to the}} lattice constant, the spin waves are governed by the microscopic exchange coupling and a quantum mechanical description is needed. Therefore, experimental information on these short wavelength (large wave vector) spin waves in ultrathin films is highly desired and may lead to fundamentally new insights into the spin dynamics in reduced dimensions in the future.|$|E

(An {{example of such}} a 1st order functional is the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction).In all cases the energy term acts to introduce topologically non-trivial solutions to a system of partial differential equations. In other words, the energy term acts to render possible the existence of a topologically non-trivial magnetic configuration that is confined to a finite, localized region, and possesses an intrinsic stability or meta-stability relative to a trivial homogeneously magnetized ground-state — i.e. a magnetic soliton. An example hamiltonian containing one set of energy terms that allows for the existence of skyrmions of the second category is the following:where the first, second, third and fourth sums correspond to the exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, Zeeman (responsible for the [...] "usual" [...] torques and forces observed on a magnetic dipole moment in a magnetic field), and magnetic Anisotropy (typically magnetocrystalline anisotropy) interaction energies respectively.

Dispersion relations of spin waves in thin <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> (in two-dimensional magnetic monolayers and in two-layer <b>magnetic</b> <b>films)</b> and the spin-wave resonance spectrum in N-layer structures are found. For thick <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> generalized Landau-Lifshitz equations {{are derived from}} first principles. Landau-Lifshitz equations have the integral (pseudodifferential) form, but not differential one. Spin excitations are determined by simultaneous solution of the Landau-Lifshitz equations and the equation for the magnetostatic potential. For normal magnetized ferromagnetic films the spin wave damping has been calculated in the one-loop approximation for a diagram expansion of the Green functions at low temperature. In thick <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> the magnetic dipole interaction makes a major contribution to the relaxation of long-wavelength spin waves. Thin films have a region of low relaxation of long-wavelength spin waves. In thin <b>magnetic</b> <b>films</b> four-spin-wave processes take place and the exchange interaction makes a major contribution to the damping.
