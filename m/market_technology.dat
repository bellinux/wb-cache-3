30|$|The {{way that}} {{production}} technology affects business cycles {{is well known}} 1, but research {{on the effects of}} <b>technology</b> such as <b>marketing</b> <b>technology</b> on the macroeconomy has not yet been undertaken at least within the framework of macroeconomics. It is therefore quite interesting to investigate the effects of <b>marketing</b> <b>technology.</b> Our goals are as follows: first, to incorporate the marketing sector into an economic model; second, to assess the effects of the positive shock of <b>marketing</b> <b>technology</b> on the macroeconomy. First of all, we express <b>marketing</b> <b>technology</b> in an economic model by employing a matching or search friction in the goods market. Researchers have frequently employed this assumption in the labor market on the basis of [Mortensen and Pissarides (1994]). Adopting the matching friction suits our purpose because progress in <b>marketing</b> <b>technology</b> can be modeled as a reduction of matching friction between consumers and firms.|$|R
