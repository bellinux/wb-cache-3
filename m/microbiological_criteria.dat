40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} value {{of each of the}} Duke {{criteria}} for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE). METHODS: Detailed review was done of charts of all cases discharged with the diagnosis of IE, and classification as 'definite', 'possible' and 'rejected' cases was made according to the Duke criteria. The diagnostic impact of each criterion was assessed by reclassifying each 'definite' case after subtraction of each individual criterion and by reclassifying each 'possible' and 'rejected' case after addition of each individual criterion. RESULTS: From 1983 to 1993, 179 cases were identified in the databases of two hospitals. When the Duke criteria were applied, 124 (6967 %) were classed as 'definite', 43 (2466 %) as 'possible' and 12 (763 %) as 'rejected' cases. Of the 67 pathologically proven cases, 52 (78610 %) were 'definite' cases when the criteria were applied before pathology. If the major <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> is subtracted, 53 % (69 %) of the 'definite' cases become 'possible' or 'rejected'. When the echocardiographic criterion is subtracted, 34 % (68 %) of the 'definite' cases become possible or rejected. Among minor criteria, fever and predisposition, contributing to the classification of respectively 31 % (68 %) and 27 % (68 %) of the 'definite' cases, were the most powerful. On the other hand, the minor <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> and immunologic phenomena were responsible for the classification of only 2 % (62 %) and 6 % (64 %) respectively, of the 'definite' cases. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the criterion examined, 47 - 98 % of the 'definite' cases of IE would remain 'definite' if this particular criterion were absent. The major <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> had the highest relative importance. In this retrospective study, in which only 32 (18 %) patients had a transesophageal echocardiogram, the echocardiogram contributed to 15 % (66 %) of the 'definite' cases according to the major criterion and to 19 % (66 %) according to the minor criterion.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of postsurgical mediastinitis (PSM) among patients with sternal wound complication (SWC) after cardiac surgery is sometimes difficult, as fever, elevated C-reactive protein levels, and chest pain {{can be caused}} by a general inflammatory reaction to the operative trauma and/or sternal dehiscence without infection. The definitions of PSM usually used emphasize clinical signs and symptoms easily observed by the surgeon. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate whether the use of standardized multiple tissue sampling, optimal culturing methods, and strain typing, together with a <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> for infection, could identify more infected patients than clinical assessment alone. Patients reexplored due to SWC after cardiac artery bypass grafting (CABG) or heart valve replacement (HVR) with or without CABG performed at the Department for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery at the Uppsala University Hospital between 10 March 1998 and 9 September 2000 were investigated prospectively. Tissue samples were taken from the sternum or adjacent mediastinal tissue, preferably before the administration of antibiotics. Culturing was performed both directly (on agar plates) and using enrichment broth. Species identification was performed by standard methods, and strain typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 41 cases with at least five tissue samples each were included in the study group. Of these patients, 32 were infected according to the <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> (i. e., the same strain was found in ≥ 50 % of the samples). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the primary pathogen in 38 % of the cases (12 / 32), S. aureus was the primary pathogen in 31 % (10 / 32), P. acnes was the primary pathogen in 25 % (8 / 32), and S. simulans and S. haemolyticus were the primary pathogens in 3 % (1 / 32) each. All cases of S. aureus infection and 86 % (12 / 14) of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) infections were identified from primary cultures. All cases fulfilling the <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> for S. aureus infection were clinically diagnosed as cases of infection, but among the 14 cases fulfilling the <b>criterion</b> for <b>microbiological</b> {{diagnosis of}} CoNS infection, only 10 appeared to qualify clinically as cases of infection. Among the patients with sternal dehiscence in whom a microbiological diagnosis was established, 67 % (12 / 18) had a CoNS infection, compared to 14 % (2 / 14) of those without sternal dehiscence. The difference was statistically significant. PSM caused by S. aureus is readily identified by the surgeon, whereas 30 % of cases with CoNS infections may be misinterpreted as noninfected. Multiple sampling before administration of antibiotics, primary culturing on agar plates, species identification, strain typing, and susceptibility testing should be used to ensure a fast and microbiologically correct diagnosis which identifies the primary pathogen and infected patients among those with minor infective symptoms. The role of P. acnes as a possible cause of PSM needs further investigation. PSM caused by CoNS is significantly related to sternal dehiscence...|$|R
40|$|In {{this concept}} paper, we have {{developed}} three case scenarios to illustrate how one can derive a <b>Microbiological</b> <b>Criterion</b> (MC) from a Performance Objective (PO) or from a Food Safety Objective (FSO). In the first scenario, we show how one can derive an MC from a PO that is set as a numerical limit to the concentration of a pathogen. In the second scenario, it is shown how one can derive an MC from a PO that is set as the limit to the prevalence or proportion of a microorganism. In the final scenario, we show how to derive an MC from an FSO for a product supporting growth of the target pathogen between the PO and FSO. These case scenarios present guidance on how to derive an MC from risk-based metrics and very explicitly detail all the steps to be taken and assumptions/decisions {{that need to be}} made.

40|$|The use {{of water}} {{treatment}} plant sludge to restore degraded soils is customary agricultural practice, {{but it could be}} dangerous {{from the point of view}} of both health and the environment. A transient increase of either pathogenic or indicator microbial populations, whose persistence in time is variable and attributed to the characteristics of the soil (types of materials in the soil), any amendments (origin and treatments it has undergone) or the weather (humidity and temperature mainly), has often been detected in soils treated with this kind of waste. Given their origin, {{water treatment plant}} sludges could lead to the transmission of a) pathogens and b) antibiotic-resistant microorganisms to human beings through the food chain and cause the spreading of antibiotic resistances as a result of their increase and persistence in the soil for variable periods of time. However, Spanish legislation regulating the use of sludges in the farming industry is based on a very restricted <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion.</b> Thus, we believe better parameters should be established to appropriately inform of the state of health of soils treated with water treatment plant sludge, including aspects which are not presently assessed such as antibiotic resistance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{prevalence}} of acquired resistance to streptogramins, macrolides, and lincosamides and the genetic background of this resistance {{was investigated in}} Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from food-producing animals and hospital patients 45 years after the ban of streptogramins as growth promoters. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D), virginiamycin M 1 (virgM 1), erythromycin (ery), tylosin (tyl), and lincomycin (lin) were determined by the agar dilution method for E. faecium isolates derived from pigs (80), broilers (45), and hospitalized patients (103). Resistance or susceptibility was interpreted using a <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> and breakpoints recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), if available. The isolates were also screened by PCR for erm(B), lnu(A), lnu(B), mef(A/E), vat(D), vat(E), vga(A), vga(B), and vgb(A) genes. Acquired resistance to Q/D, virgM 1, ery, tyl, and lin was detected in 34 %, 96 %, 46 %, 46 %, and 69 % of the porcine strains, respectively. For broiler strains this was 15 % (Q/D), 98 % (virgM 1), 69 % (ery), 71 % (tyl), and 89 % (lin) and for human strains 23 % (Q/D), 65 % (virgM 1), 54 % (ery), 52 % (tyl), and 60 % (lin). Strains showing cross-resistance against macrolides and lincosamides almost always carried the erm(B) gene. This gene was present in 64 % of the Q/D-resistant isolates. Only in two human and three broiler Q/D- and virgM 1 -resistant isolates, {{a combination of the}} erm(B) and vat(D) or vat(E) genes was found. The genetic background of resistance could not be determined in the other Q/D- or virgM 1 -resistant strains.

(2010) Microbiological {{quality of}} bottled water brands sold in retail outlets in New Zealand. Water Science & Technology: Water Supply - WSTWS, 10. 5, 689 - 699. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{determine}} if retailed bottled water in New Zealand complied with the Australia and New Zealand Food Standards (ANZFS) Code (2002) and the New Zealand <b>Microbiological</b> Reference <b>Criteria</b> (1995). The New Zealand <b>Microbiological</b> Reference <b>Criteria</b> for Packaged Waters include Total Coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococci (Group D streptococci) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Standard 1. 6. 1 of the ANZFS includes Total Coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococci (Group D streptococci), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Total Viable Count (TVC). In this study five samples of randomly selected 38 brands of different types of domestic and imported bottled waters were purchased from local retail stores in Wellington region. The samples were tested for Total Coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococci (Group D streptococci), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, TVC, Yeasts and Moulds and Campylobacter spp. Three domestic brands did not comply with both of the above criteria for Total Coliforms. Seventeen brands did not comply with TVC criteria of ANZFS Code (100 CFU/ml) with nine out of 17 being domestic New Zealand brands. Twenty one brands displayed the growth of colonies on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates. Half of them displayed the growth of moulds. Due to high incidence of campylobacteriosis in New Zealand composite samples of brands with TVC counts equal or higher than 100 CFU/ml were tested for Campylobacter spp. All samples were negative for Campylobacter spp. A survey questionnaire was used to assess the impact of manufacturing procedures on bottled water quality. The aim of the survey was to investigate possible significant public health links between the source water quality, type of abstraction, pipework materials, bottling process, staff training, policies and procedures. All four manufacturers, which responded to the questionnaire and represented 11 bottled water brands, bottled at least one brand that did not comply with the ANZFS Code for TVC. Ten years after the initial study was performed by Hasell and Capill in 1999 microbiological contamination in bottled waters in New Zealand was still being detected.

40|$|Foodstuffs {{should not}} contain {{microorganisms}} or their toxins or metabolites in quantities suggesting an unacceptable risk for human health. The detection of food hazards in foods is performed by several tests that produce results {{dependent on the}} analytical method used: an analytical reference method, defined as standard, is associated with each <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion</b> laid down in Regulation 2073 / 2005 /EC, but, analytical methods other than the reference ones, in particular more rapid methods, could be used. Combined screening methods performed by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are currently validated as alternative methods according to the ISO 16140 : 2003 and certified by the Association Française de Normalisation. However, the positive results obtained with these alternative methods, the investigated molecular relations that resulted positive have to be confirmed with cultural methods using the same enrichment media in which the molecular screening was performed. Since {{it is necessary to}} assess if these testing schemes provide equivalent guarantees of food safety, the aim of this retrospective study is to analyse the data collected, from 2012 to 2014 by Emilia Romagna Region in the field of Piano Regionale Alimenti (Food Regional Plan) during official controls monitoring food samples of animal and other than animal origin. Records performed by combined methods of molecular screening of Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and thermophilic Campylobacter and cultural confirmation results were gathered together and the results were compared in order to assess the sensitivity of the methods. A total of 10, 604 food samples were considered in this study: the comparison of the data revealed that the RT-PCR method detected Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and thermophilic Campylobacter in 2. 18, 3. 85 and 3. 73 % of the samples, respectively, whereas by using cultural method these pathogens were isolated in 0. 43, 1. 57 and 1. 57 % of samples, respectively. In spite of the use of the same enrichment broth, the RT-PCR method disclosed a percentage of positive samples that was negative to cultural examination ranging between 20 and 43 %, with a PCR/culture ratio between 2. 37 to 5. 00. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} pose a doubt about the sensitivity of the official cultural methods regarding the isolation of the three investigated foodborne pathogens.

The presence of enterotoxigenic strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci in raw milk during the production process leads to the contamination of products and outbreaks of alimentary intoxication. The problem of Staphylococcus aureus in cheese remains significant on a global level. Domestic cheese contaminated with enterotoxigenic staphylococci can result in the formation of enterotoxin, which can produce foodborne illness when the product is ingested.

30|$|The {{impact of}} urban contamination, {{degrading}} the microbiological quality of La Paz River basin {{can be measured}} by the {{dramatic increase in the}} number of thermotolerant coliforms in surface water at all impacted sites. According to thermotolerant coliform data, site 1 —not impacted by wastewater discharges-, can be classified as a source of water of maximum quality (Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia 1992), opposed to sites 2 – 4, that largely exceeded the standards for recreational water (i.e. 10, 000 MPN/ 100  ml) (Osmond et al. 1997). Moreover, the average density at the agricultural area—site 3, surpassed in two orders of magnitude the allowed concentration for unrestricted irrigation water, according to WHO guidelines (WHO 1989) (i.e. < 1000 MPN/ 100  ml). In this line, the density of thermotolerant coliforms found in fresh produce also exceeded the satisfactory <b>microbiological</b> hygiene <b>criteria</b> level 1000 MPN/ 100  g of fresh weight (ICMSF 1996). Overall, these parameters indicate that La Paz River basin at downstream locations aside from point 1, has a very poor microbiological water quality and is severely polluted by urban contaminants throughout the year.

In addition, a gradual increase in the microbiological load of control samples throughout the storage time was observed, whereas proteolytic, lipolytic and total mould and yeast counts were 6. 39 ± 0. 41, 6. 0 ± 0. 57 and 6. 6 ± 0. 53 log 10 cfu/g, respectively, at day 12 and were rejected. Such counts were slightly lower in treated samples up to day 15 of storage, followed by a gradual increase {{until the end of}} storage.

40|$|<b>Microbiological</b> <b>criteria</b> give {{information}} about the quality or safety of foods. A key component of a microbiological criterion is the sampling plan. Considering: (1) the generally low level of pathogens that are deemed tolerable in foods, (2) large batch sizes, and (3) potentially substantial heterogeneity of food products, very large numbers of samples need to be analyzed to have meaningful results. However, sampling plans must be realistic considering the time and cost for sampling and analysis. No feasible sampling plan can guarantee the absence of microorganisms in a lot.

40|$|Dried {{culinary herbs}} and spices (DCHS) are minor food {{components}} with widespread use. Despite their low water activity, some microorganisms—including pathogenic and toxigenic ones—can survive in DCHS. The addition of microbial contaminated DCHS to ready-to-eat food in combination with improper food storage can pose a serious health risk for the consumer. In the past, several food-borne disease outbreaks were related to microbial contaminated spices. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide an overview on (i) spice/herb production standards important for promoting food safety by preventing microbial contaminations, (ii) public and private standards providing <b>microbiological</b> <b>criteria</b> to assess the microbiological safety of DCHS, and (iii) product testing performed by DCHS producing/processing businesses to comply with these standards. For that, a literature search and a survey among herb/spice businesses were conducted. Several good practices and production guidelines specific for the primary production and/or processing of culinary {{herbs and spices}} were found. <b>Microbiological</b> <b>criteria</b> specific for DCHS are usually rare, but some national standards (mostly of non-EU member states) as well as recommendations by private bodies could be identified. By EU law, no mandatory <b>microbiological</b> <b>criteria</b> specific for DCHS are laid down. The survey indicated a frequent application of business-to-business agreements. The microbiological quality of DCHS was tested by the survey participants mainly in a routine manner by checking every lot or based on buyer–seller agreements. Risk-based testing was less common, which differed to chemical safety testing. Upon import into the EU, testing appeared to be performed predominantly in a routine manner for the pathogenic bacteria Salmonella spp., sulphite-reducing clostridia (including Clostridium perfringens), Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. </p...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{repetitive}} extragenic palindromic PCR (REP-PCR), we genotypically characterized strains causing nosocomial Acinetobacter baumannii {{infections and}} analyzed {{the source of}} bacteremia in 67 patients from an institution in which infections by this bacterium were endemic. Six different genotypes were found, including 21, 27, 3, 9, 3, and 4 strains. The probable source of bacteremia, according to clinical and/or <b>microbiological</b> <b>criteria,</b> was known in 42 patients (63 %) : respiratory tract (n = 19), surgical sites (n = 12), intravascular catheters (n = 5), burns (n = 3), and urinary tract (n = 3). The definite source of bacteremia, according to REP-PCR, could be established in 30 (71 %) out of the 42 patients with strains from blood and other sites; in these cases clinical and <b>microbiological</b> <b>criteria</b> {{for the source of}} bacteremia were thus confirmed. In the remaining 12 patients (29 %) the probable source was refuted by the REP-PCR method. The definite sources of bacteremia according to genotype were as follows: respiratory tract in 13 patients (31 %), surgical sites in 8 (19 %), intravascular catheters in 4 (9 %), burns in 3 (7 %), and urinary tract in 2 (5 %). A comparison of strains from blood cultures and other sites with regard to their REP-PCR and antimicrobial resistance profiles was also made. Taking the REP-PCR as the “gold standard,” the positive predictive value of antibiotype was 77 % and the negative predictive value was 42 %. In summary, the utility of the diagnosis of the source of nosocomial A. baumannii bacteremia using clinical and/or <b>microbiological</b> <b>criteria,</b> including antibiotyping, is limited, as demonstrated by REP-PCR...|$|E

Background. The epidemiology of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in Greece is largely unknown. Objectives. To determine the incidence and the demographic, microbiological, and clinical characteristics of patients with pulmonary NTM infection and pulmonary NTM disease. Methods. A retrospective review of the demographic, microbiological, and clinical characteristics of patients with NTM culture-positive respiratory specimens from January 2007 to May 2013. Results. A total of 120 patients were identified {{with at least one}} respiratory NTM isolate and 56 patients (46 %) fulfilled the <b>microbiological</b> ATS/IDSA <b>criteria</b> for NTM disease. Of patients with adequate data, 16 % fulfilled the complete ATS/IDSA criteria for NTM disease. The incidence of pulmonary NTM infection and disease was 18. 9 and 8. 8 per 100. 000 inpatients and outpatients, respectively. The spectrum of NTM species was high (13 species) and predominated by M. avium-intracellulare complex (M. avium (13 %), M. intracellulare (10 %)),M. gordonae (14 %), andM. fortuitum (12 %). The ratio of isolation of NTM toM. tuberculosis in all hospitalized patients was 0. 59. Conclusions. The first data on the epidemiology of pulmonary NTM in Athens, Greece, are presented. NT...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Rhodococcus equi (R. equi) is an {{important}} cause of bronchopneumonia in foals. Antimicrobial susceptibility data for equine R. equi isolates are still scarce. The goal of the current research {{was to determine the}} antimicrobial susceptibility of recent equine R. equi isolates. MAIN CONCLUSION: Acquired antimicrobial resistance towards macrolides in R. equi isolates from Belgian foals is not very prevalent. The presence of low level acquired resistance towards rifampicin might be clinically relevant and can be attributed to point mutations in the rpoB gene. APPROACH: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on twenty-three R. equi isolates with the agar dilution assay. using Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5 % sheep blood (rifampicin, the macrolides and tetracycline) or 5 % lysed horse blood (sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim). Plates were incubated at 35 °C for 20 - 24 hours in an aerobic atmosphere. Since no clinical breakpoints or wild type cut-off values are available for R. equi, acquired resistance was assumed when MIC values showed a bimodal or multimodal distribution or tailing. The two isolates showing acquired resistance towards rifampicin and three at random selected wild type isolates were used for PCR amplification and sequencing of the rpoB gene. RESULTS: The ranges of MIC values were similar to MIC ranges described earlier. The distribution of the MIC values for the macrolides, tetracycline, sulfisoxazole and trimethoprim showed a unimodal distribution. The distribution of the MIC values for rifampicin showed a trimodal distribution with two isolates (8. 7 %) showing low level acquired resistance. One isolate had an MIC value of 1 µg/ml and one isolate showed an MIC value of 8 µg/ml, while the MIC range of the wild type population was 0. 06 – 0. 25 µg/ml. The three wild type isolates showed identical rpoB sequences. The isolates showing acquired resistance contained point mutations in the rpoB gene when compared to the wild type isolates at the amino acids His 526 and Ser 531, respectively. The isolate with MIC 1 µg/ml showed a His 526 Asn mutation. The isolate with MIC 8 µg/ml showed a Ser 531 Leu mutation. INTERPRETATION: There was no acquired resistance towards the tested antimicrobial agents according to the <b>microbiological</b> <b>criterion,</b> except for rifampicin. Considering that there are no veterinary clinical breakpoints for R. equi and that the therapeutic result is also strongly dependent on the stage of infection, the lack of acquired resistance does not guarantee a successful therapy. On the other hand, the presence of acquired resistance can indeed hamper the in vivo efficiency of the antimicrobial agent. Even though the current collection of isolates is relatively small, these results suggest that acquired antimicrobial resistance against macrolides is not very common in recent equine isolates obtained in Belgium. The presence of rifampicin resistance in more than 8 % of the isolates emphasizes the importance of the combination therapy (rifampicin + macrolide). Even though the clinical importance of low and high level resistance is currently not described, there are serious indications that at least high level resistance is clinically relevant. SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: The current results acknowledge that the combination therapy (rifampicin + macrolide) remains first choice antimicrobial therapy for treating rhodococcosis in horses in Belgium...|$|R

Examination of 2, 981 samples using <b>Microbiological</b> Guidelines <b>criteria</b> revealed that 66 % were of satisfactory or acceptable microbiology quality, 33 % were of unsatisfactory quality mainly due to high aerobic colony counts and Enterobacteriaceae concentrations, and 1 % were of unacceptable quality due to the presence of Listeria monocytogenes at 100 CFU/g or higher (27 samples; range of 102 to 106 CFU/g) and Campylobacter jejuni (1 sample), indicating a risk to health. All samples {{at the end of the}} shelf life had satisfactory (20 CFU/g) and/or acceptable (102 CFU/g) levels of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens, four samples (1 %) had unsatisfactory levels of Escherichia coli (range of 102 to 106 CFU/g) and 5. 5 % of the samples contained L. monocytogenes at 20 CFU/g (4. 8 %) or between 20 and 100 CFU/g (0. 7 %). More samples of chicken (45 %; 224 of 495 samples), beef (43 %; 160 of 371 samples), and turkey (41 %; 219 of 523 samples) were of unsatisfactory or unacceptable quality compared with ham (23 %; 317 of 1, 351 samples) or pork (32 %; 67 of 206 samples). Twelve different L. monocytogenes typing characters (serotype– amplified fragment length polymorphism type–phage type) were evaluated for isolates recovered from samples of unacceptable quality, and the 1 / 2 -IX-NT type was recovered from almost half (48 %) of these samples.
