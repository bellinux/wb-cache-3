Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Brazil, feeding on eggs and small larvae in maize (Zea mays L.) plants. This predator shares the same habitat of the pest, laying their eggs inside the whorl of the plant. Therefore, any application of insecticide to control the pest population affects the predator. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the selectivity of insecticides on nymphs (first and third instars) and adults of D. luteipes, in a semi-field condition. Insects were placed inside the plant whorl and sprayed with backpack equipment (pressure 2. 6 lb in- 2, nozzle type quick Jet 8003 and 282 liters ha- 1). After the application of insecticides, maize plantswere covered with cages made of wire frame and tissue. The assessments were done at 24, 48 and 72 hours after spraying. The insecticides were classified according to international standards (IOBC). The insecticides triflumuron (24 g a. i. ha- 1) and etofenprox (30 g a. i. ha- 1) were slightly harmful (class 2) to nymphs and adults of D. luteipes; the chlorfenapyr (180 g a. i. ha- 1) was <b>moderately</b> <b>harmful</b> (class 3) for nymphs and slightly harmful (class 2) for adults; teflubenzuron/α-cypermethrin (12. 7 / 12. 7 g a. i. ha- 1) was toxic to nymphs (class 4).

Nevertheless, chemicals remain a necessary control tactic for certain insect pests and diseases {{and they can}} have negative impacts on BCAs. The compatibility of some formulated reduced risk insecticides (abamectin, metaflumizone and chlorantraniliprole) and fungicides (myclobutanil, potassium bicarbonate and cyprodinil + fludioxonil) used, or with promise for use, in Canadian greenhouses with Orius insidiosus (Say), Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot) and Eretmocerus eremicus (Rose & Zolnerovich) was determined through laboratory and greenhouse bioassays. RESULTS: Overall, the insecticides and fungicides were harmless as residues to adult BCAs. However, abamectin was slightly to <b>moderately</b> <b>harmful</b> to O. insidiosus and A. swirskii in laboratory bioassays, whereas metaflumizone was slightly harmful to E. eremicus.

40|$|Kampimodromus aberrans is {{the most}} {{important}} predator of herbivorous mites in South-European vineyards treated with selective pesticides. The impact of pesticides on K. aberrans populations has been studied in field conditions whereas few toxicological tests have been conducted in the laboratory because of difficulties in rearing this species. In this paper, a toxicological method to assess the effects of pesticides on K. aberrans is described and the effects of insecticides frequently used in European vineyards on two K. aberrans strains are reported. These strains were collected from vineyards treated with organophosphates. Insecticides characterized by different modes of action were selected for trials. Among these, etofenprox and spinosad were classified as harmful to predatory mites. Chlorpyrifos reduced predatory mite fecundity, and was classified as <b>moderately</b> <b>harmful</b> for both strains.

40|$|The {{silverleaf}} whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is one {{of major}} pests in greenhouses vegetable cultivation. Eretmocerus mundus Mercet (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) has an important role among effective parasitoids used in biological control of the silverleaf whitefly. Nondestructive or less destructive pesticides against this parasitoid should be preferred in the scope of biological control. For this goal, side effects of 8 plant protection products, including spinosad, pyriproxyfen, abamectin, emamectin benzoate, copper oxychloride, kresoxim-methyl+boscalid, dimethoate and propineb+cymoxanil on pupae and adults of E. mundus were tested in this laboratory study conducted according to IOBC standards.

Also, results were matched with that reported by Zappala et al. (2012) for their work on Nesidiocoris tenuis as a natural enemy (predator) for Tuta absoluta in tomato plantation using two sulfur formulations. Sulfur formulation applied weekly on tomato seedlings artificially infested with T. absoluta in greenhouse reduced significantly the rate of infestation and was played as a repellent effect on oviposition. In addition, they mentioned that residual effect test conducted with N. tenuis, revealed that only dustable sulfur was <b>moderately</b> <b>harmful</b> as a fresh residue and slightly harmful as 7 [*]days post treatment; no effects were recorded when the predator was exposed 14 [*]days post treatment. Our obtained results were partially matched with Biondi et al. (2012) for their work on the predator Orius laevigatus, where they mentioned that wettable sulfur (sulfur WP) proved to be harmless (Ex <[*] 30 %, IOBC class 1) with mortality and reproductive capacity levels similar to what was recorded in untreated control group. Both sulfur compounds did not induce mortality in predators, but predator reproductive capacity was reduced by sulfur DP in case of exposure to 1 -h-old residues. This result {{may be related to the}} activity of the compound as an oviposition repellent or as an egg dryer. On the other side, our results were in contrast with that reported by Daniel et al. (2001) on their work for estimation the side effects of sulfur formulation on some predatory mites, i.e., Typhlodromus pyri, in field trails on apple, vine, and plums to control some pests (Panonychus ulmi, Tetranychus urticae and thrips).|$|E

Casais de besouros foram colocados em baldes contendo terra úmida e alimentados com fezes bovinas contendo 1, 0, 5 ou 0, 2 ppm de diflubenzuron e 0, 2 ppm de methoprene. Os insetos e sua prole foram recuperados com o auxílio de armadilhas pitfall. Diflubenzuron e methoprene não afetaram a sobrevivência dos adultos inicialmente expostos, mas interferiram na produção de descendentes. Diflubenzuron, nas concentrações de 1 e 0, 5 ppm, também afetou a duração do ciclo de vida dos besouros. Nenhum dos IGRs alterou a razão sexual dos descendentes obtidos. As concentrações testadas de diflubenzuron mostraram-se moderadamente nocivas ao besouro enquanto methoprene a 0, 2 ppm mostrou ser pouco nocivo, segundo os critérios da International Organization for Biological Control.

This species {{is widely used}} in IPM programs in greenhouses, being essential for its success, to obtain information about the non target effects of the pesticides currently used in those crops where the mite is artificially released. This work describes a laboratory contact residual test for evaluating lethal (mortality after 72 hour exposure to fresh residues) and sublethal effects (fecundity and fertility of the surviving mites) of eleven modern pesticides to adults of A. swirskii. Spiromesifen is lipogenesis inhibitor; flonicamid a selective feeding inhibitor with a mode of action not totally known; flubendiamide a modulator of the rhyanodin receptor, sulfoxaflor has a complex mode of action not totally ascertained; metaflumizone is a voltage dependent sodium channel blocker; methoxyfenozide is an IGR, spirotetramat inhibits lipids; abamectin and emamectin activate the Cl- channel; spinosad is a neurotix naturalyte and deltamethrin a pyrethroid used as positive standard. Selected pesticides are effective against different key pests present in horticultural crop areas and were always applied at the maximum field recommended concentration in Spain if registered, or at the concentration recommended by the supplier. Out of the tested pesticides, spiromesifen, flonicamid, flubendiamide, sulfoxaflor, metaflumizone, methoxyfenozide and spirotetramat were harmless to adults of the predatory mite (IOBC toxicity class 1).

ABSTRACT: If insecticides are not possible to exclude {{in the management of}} some pests, it is relevant that the resposable of an IPM program could known the effects of those products on natural enemies of primary pests of its crop. The objective of the present research was to assess the residual effects, and the lethal and sublethal toxicity of beta-cyfluthrin, bifenazate, clorantraniliprol, flonicamid, spirotetramat and thiametoxam on Catolaccus hunteri, an ectoparasitoid of the pepper weevil. For all experiments the residual contact method was used. We used leaf disks of pepper plants as the surface for exposition. Significant differences were found on lethal toxicity, according to the IOBC thiametoxam was <b>moderately</b> <b>harmful</b> (98 % of mortality, category 3) and beta-cyfluthrin was harmful (100 % of mortality, category 4) on C. hunteri. On the other hand, bifenazate, clorantraniliprol, flonicamid and spirotetramat were harmless (0 % of mortality). Beta-cyfluthrin and thiametoxam showed long residual effects, in both cases it was more than 34 days. Aditionally, beta-cyfluthrin was more residual than thiametoxam for 12 o 18 days. Talking about the sublethal effects the fecundity and the number of larvae eliminated, because of host feeding, were not different from the control. Longevity of C. hunteri disminished because of exposition to bifenazate, clorantraniloprol, spirotetramat and thiametoxam and it was shorter than the control. We only found sublethal effects on a flying test with beta-cyfluthrin, 28 % of females did not fly on the 30 min observation after exposition to that product. We discussed the relevance of those differences and indicated the importance of conducting assays with the same product under different aplication methods...|$|E
40|$|In {{the peach}} crop, the {{chemical}} control {{is the most}} used strategy {{in the management of}} pest insects, however, alternative control measures, such as biological control, based on Integrated Pest Management (IPM), must be prioritized. In this sense, side effects studies of natural enemies can generate important information so that an association of control methods can be made feasible. In this sense, the objective of this work was to evaluate the side effects of nine pesticides used in peach orchards on Chrysoperla externa and Coleomegilla quadrifasciata using the methodology proposed by the International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control of Noxious Animals and Plants (IOBC). In the bioassays eggs and pupae were carried out direct applications. Bioassays with larvae and adults consisted of exposure of insects to dry residues of sprayed pesticides on glass slabs. In the bioassays with eggs and pupae, larval emergence reduction and reduction in adult emergence, respectively, and subsequent fertility and fertility evaluation in surviving adults were evaluated. In larval bioassays the duration of developmental stages, mortality, and fertility and fertility rates of surviving adults. In the adult bioassays, the accumulated mortality at 24, 72 and 120 hours after exposure of the insects to the residues of the phytosanitary products was evaluated. The side effects was calculated by the total effect for all phases, where the pesticides were classified as innocuous ( 99 %), recommended by IOBC. It was concluded that for C. externa all phytosanitary products showed to be innocuous (class 1) for eggs, however, on the pupal phase, abamectin (80) and copper + calcium (1 %) were slightly harmful (class 2). For the egg phase of C. quadrifasciata fenitrothione (100) it was moderately toxic (class 3). Abamectin (80), deltamethrin (40) and malathion (150) were slightly harmful (class 2), the other products were innocuous (class 1), and for the pupae phase the products abamectin (80), fenitrothion (100) and malathion (150) were toxic (class 4), and the other products were innocuous (class 1) to C. quadrifasciata. The ladybug C. quadrifasciata was more sensitive than C. externa to all pesticides tested in the egg and pupal phases. The products Azadirachtin (1 %), chlorantraniliprole (14) and copper + calcium (25 % + 10 %) were innocuous (class 1) to the larval phase of C. externa. The abamectin (80) and copper + calcium (1 %) products were slightly harmful (class 2) to the predator at this stage. Deltamethrin (40), fenitrothione (100) malathion (150) and sulfur + calcium (3. 5 ° Ba) were harmful (class 4) to larvae of this insect. In the adult phase of C. externa the Azadirachtin (1 %), chlorantraniliprole (14) and copper + calcium (25 % + 10 %) were innocuous (class 1), and abamectin (80) was slightly harmful (class 2). The products deltamethrin (40), fenitrothion (100), malathion (150), copper + calcium (1 %) and sulfur + calcium (3. 5 ° Ba) were harmful (class 4) to C. externa adults. For the larval phase of C. quadrifasciata chlorantraniliprole (14) was innocuous (class 1). The product sulfur + calcium (3. 5 ° Ba) was slightly harmful (class 2), while the product copper + calcium (25 % + 10 %) was <b>moderately</b> <b>harmful</b> (class 3), the other products were harmful (class 4). In the adult phase of C. quadrifasciata the products Azadirachtin (1 %) and copper + calcium (25 % + 10 %) were innocuous (class 1).

Abamectin (80), fenitrothione (100) malathione (150) and sulfur + calcium (3. 5 ° Ba) were harmful (class 4). Na cultura do pessegueiro, o controle químico é a estratégia mais utilizada no manejo dos insetos-praga, entretanto, medidas alternativas de controle, como o controle biológico, fundamentadas no Manejo Integrado de Pragas (MIP), devem ser priorizadas. Nesse sentido, estudos de seletividade a inimigos naturais podem gerar informações importantes para que a associação desses métodos de controle possa ser viabilizada. Assim, objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar a seletividade de nove produtos fitossanitarios utilizados em pomares de pêssego sobre os predadores Chrysoperla externa e Coleomegilla quadrifasciata utilizando a metodologia proposta pela “International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control of Noxious Animals and Plants” (IOBC). Nos bioensaios com ovos e pupas foram realizadas aplicações diretas. Os bioensaios com larvas e adultos consistiram na exposição dos insetos a resíduos secos de produtos fitossanitários pulverizados sobre placas de vidro. Nos bioensaios com ovos e pupas foi avaliado a redução de emêrgencia das larvas e redução na emergência dos adultos, respectivamente, e posterior avaliação da fecundidade e fertilidade nos adultos sobreviventes. Nos bioensaios com larvas foram avaliadas a duração dos estágios de des. envolvimento, a mortalidade, e as taxas de fecundidade e fertilidade dos adultos sobreviventes. Nos bioensaios com adultos, foi avaliada a mortalidade acumulada as 24, 72 e 120 horas após a exposição dos insetos aos resíduos dos produtos fitossanitários. A seletividade foi calculada através do efeito total, para todas as fases, onde os produtos fitossanitários foram classificados em inócuos ( 99 %), conforme recomendação da IOBC. Conclui-se que para C. externa todos os produtos fitossanitários (Dosagem comercial) mostraramse inócuo (classe 1) para ovos, entretanto, sobre a fase de pupa, abamectina (80) e cobre + cálcio (1 %), foram levemente nocivos (classe 2). Para a fase de ovo de C. quadrifasciata fenitrotiona (100) apresentou-se moderamente tóxico (classe 3). Abamectina (80), deltametrina (40) e malationa (150) foram levemente nocivo (classe 2), os demais produtos mostraram-se inócuos (classe 1), já para a fase de pupa os produtos abamectina (80), fenitrotiona (100) e malationa (150) foram tóxicos (classe 4), e os demais produtos foram inócuos (classe 1) a C. quadrifasciata. O coccinilideo C. quadrifasciata foi mais sensível que o crisopideo C. externa a todos os produtos fitossanitários testados nas fases de ovo e pupa. Os produtos Azadiractina (1 %), clorantraniliprole (14) e cobre + cálcio (25 %+ 10 %) foram inócuos (classe 1) á fase larval de C. externa. Já os produtos abamectina (80) e cobre + cálcio (1 %) foram levemente nocivos (classe 2) ao predador nesta fase. Deltametrina (40), fenitrotiona (100) malationa (150) e enxofre + cálcio (3, 5 º Ba) foram nocivos (classe 4) á larvas deste crisopideo. Já para a fase adulta de C. externa Azadiractina (1 %), clorantraniliprole (14) e cobre + cálcio (25 %+ 10 %) foram inócuos (classe 1), e abamectina (80) foi levemente nocivo (classe 2). Os produtos deltametrina (40), fenitrotiona (100), malationa (150) e cobre + cálcio (1 %) e enxofre + cálcio (3, 5 ° Ba) foram nocivos (classe 4) á adultos de C. externa. Para a fase larval de C. quadrifasciata clorantraniliprole (14) foi inócuo (classe 1). O produto enxofre + cálcio (3, 5 º Ba) foi levemente nocivo (classe 2), já o produto cobre + cálcio (25 % + 10 %) foi moderamente nocivo (classe 3), os demais produtos foram nocivos (classe 4). Na fase adulta de C. quadrifasciata os produtos Azadiractina (1 %) e cobre + cálcio (25 %+ 10 %) foram inócuos (classe 1). Clorantraniliprole (14), deltametrina (40) e cobre + cálcio (1 %) foram levemente nocivos (classe 2). Abamectina (80), fenitrotiona (100) malationa (150) e enxofre + cálcio (3, 5 º Ba) foram nocivos (classe 4) ...|$|E
