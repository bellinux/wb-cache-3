The applied fatigue model is based on established methods and is incorporated in an iterative numerical design tool for realistic wind turbine blades. All aerodynamic and structural design properties are available in literature. The software tool FAST is used for advanced aero-servo-elastic load calculations and stress-histories are calculated with elementary beam theory. According to wind energy design standards, a turbulent wind load case is implemented. Fatigue loads are estimated based on 100 % availability and a site-specific annual wind distribution. Rainflow cycle counting and <b>Miner</b> <b>s</b> sum for cumulative damage prediction is used together with constant life diagrams tailored to actual material S-N data. Material properties are based on 95 % survival probability, 95 % confidence level, and additional material safety factors to maintain conservative results. Fatigue performance is first evaluated for the baseline blade design of the 10 MW NOWITECH reference wind turbine. Results show that blade damage is dominated by tensile stresses due to poorer tensile fatigue characteristics of the shell glass fiber material. The interaction between turbulent wind and gravitational fluctuations is demonstrated to greatly influence the damage. The need for relevant S-N data to closely predict such blade stress cycle events is investigated to avoid non-conservative conclusions.

The ATS has moved the pilot 2 ̆ 7 s initial training into the Weapon System Trainer (WST).

An LED-based cap lamp using a constant current drive circuit can maintain about 96 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. Real-world tests addressing the effects of ambient temperature and airflow on the light output of an LED and incandescent cap lamp were conducted in the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). The LED cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance improvement of approximately 9. 5 % and the INC cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation o f approximately 4 %. The differences between LED and incandescent cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of mesopic luminance data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i. e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED cap lamp could be up to 38 % more efficient than the incandescent cap lamp with a lead-acid battery {{at the end of the}} 10 -hour driving cycle.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Sex and Gender: Military Contexts track. There has been a significant advancement in military technology recently. A shift has taken place from predominantly male infantry soldiers, with only basic protection and gear; to extremely effective, high-tech, lightweight protective gear and equipment, and some female infantry soldiers. It {{does not seem to be}} the case anymore that sheer brute strength is a necessary for an infantry soldier. Although there is no doubt that soldiers must be physically fit, recent projects like FIST (Future Infantry Soldier Technology) in the United Kingdom, have enabled soldiers to interact and respond to their environment in ways that was not previously possible. My aim in this paper is to discuss how new military technology seems to make traditional sexual distinctions irrelevant for soldiers. I will begin by briefly explaining FIST and the technological aspects that it entails. Secondly, I will explore some aspects of how this technology impacts women as infantry soldiers, and some possible ethical implications of this. It must be noted that information regarding FIST does not specifically address women in the military, but I am going to be using FIST as a case study. I think that the description of FIST lends itself to issues regarding sexual distinctions in the military. It is useful here to briefly describe FIST. FIST is an integration of various systems, which include (but is not limited to) : weapons, GPS, body armour, and communications devices. It is a current military project in the United Kingdom slated to enter service sometime between 2015 and 2020 (www. army-technology. com/projects/fist, 1) It should be noted that the FIST programme is not intended for every infantry soldier. Instead it will at the discretion of unit commanders whether their mission requires the FIST system. According to HYPERLINK 2 ̆ 2 [URL] www. army-technology. com/projects/fist, “The FIST programme covers the development of all areas of technology for the dismounted infantry soldier and emphasises (sic) the integration of the systems. ” This means that they will try to improve conditions for infantry soldiers in the battlefield. Specifically this is done by increasing a soldier 2 ̆ 7 s awareness of their environment, which is crucial. Improved communications and navigation equipment are connected directly to the soldier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>helmet</b> mounted sight, which will be explain shortly (Ibid, 2). The FIST system focuses on lighter, more maneuverable equipment and body armour. By shrinking the size of the equipment, and making it lighter, it will be much easier for a soldier to use. Likewise, body armour would be much more comfortable for the soldier of it was less bulky but nonetheless effective. The helmet mounted display will also be used for weapon sighting systems, which would reduce the amount of equipment the soldier would have to carry with them. Overall, “[T]he helmet-mounted display can show that battlefield situation, with wearer 2 ̆ 7 s position, positions of friendly and hostile troops and equipment and prioritised targets, as well as the downloaded imagery from his weapon sight. ” (Ibid., 3) From this brief description, I will draw some implications for women infantry soldiers. From the description, it seems evident that the goal of FIST is to enable soldiers with a better a chance at survival on the battlefield. The emphasis also seems to be on the accessibility of this equipment and making it much more lightweight. If this is the case, then physical strength will not matter as much when using it. Although there will be an obvious need for a soldier to have a certain level of physical fitness, there still opens the possibility for more people to become infantry soldiers who might have been excluded previously. FIST puts all potential infantry soldiers on the same level, as they will each have equipment that similarly enhances their ability to assess and interact with events on the battlefield. In this way, all traditional markers of sexual distinction, seem to no longer matter, nor even become apparent for the infantry soldier. It will become nearly impossible to distinguish between a female and a male infantry soldier on the battlefield when the FIST system is utilized. This seems to be a positive outcome of the FIST system because it will allow for infantry soldiers to be judged completely on merit. Certainly, while this is for the most part already happening in the military; the FIST system would ensure that more soldiers could participate in areas of their choosing, which could lead to more job satisfaction, hence leading to better job performance. 	Traditionally, the United Kingdom has not allowed women to serve in front-line infantry roles (BBC News, available at: [URL] It is only in the past ten years that they have considered trials to see how women soldiers react in combat situations (Ibid). If all infantry soldiers had access to the FIST system, the argument that women would not be able to cope with the physically demanding work (Ibid), would be all but void. This would allow women the opportunity to participate in the military in areas that were not traditionally open to them, hence allowing them more freedom to pursue their military careers as they see fit...|$|R
40|$|A Paradigm Shift As market economists, mine {{managers}} {{are interested in}} "staying in business" and even "prospering. " Bottom-line results are the "order of the day. " Concern for bottom-line results invokes questions such as: How much was produced? At what cost? And, was anyone injured? While these questions will always carry everyday emphasis at the mine, they are fundamentally lacking in that they often appear, especially to lower levels of management and to the production worker, as preeminent concerns. Driven by market economics, many organizations have decentralized, outsourced, downsized, restructured, and formed new coalitions. Investments in new technology and concentration on productivity have been part and parcel with these changes, contributing to improvements in both safety and efficiency. A reason for (and, perhaps a result of) these improvements has been {{the development of a}} highly experienced and flexible work force. These changes in mining present an interesting opportunity to modify a few paradigms about work life in general, and perhaps a few paradigms about how we invest in the miner, in particular. Studying these issues now might offer some interesting opportunities for the future, as the foundations {{for the next generation of}} mine workers are laid. With the average "experienced" U. <b>S.</b> <b>miner</b> five to fifteen years from retirement, perhaps a key determinant of future success in the world market might be how well we make the transition from today's work force to the work force of tomorrow. We can ill afford to wait a few more years to tap into the special knowledge residing within a veteran mining work force. The WCPM work Crew Performance Model, see pp.) is one approach to defining, capturing, and transferring this expertise...|$|R
40|$|This Information Circular {{from the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{documents}} and supplements {{the information presented}} {{in a series of}} workshops held during 2002 and 2003. The primary intended audience consists of all who are involved in developing and conducting miners' training. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), mine operators reported 240, 000 full-time equivalent workers and independent contractors reported 42, 000 full-time equivalent workers working on mine property during the year 2000. Unfortunately, these workers have a relatively high risk of suffering serious work-related injuries and illnesses. The mining industry has the highest rate of occupational fatalities among all U. S. industries. The fatality rate is 30 deaths per 100, 000 workers compared to 4. 6 for all private industry (Morbidity and Mortality Week Report, 2001; NIOSH, 2002). Compared to workers in other industries, miners also have a relatively high rate of nonfatal lost-time injuries, and their injuries tend to be more severe (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1999). Many miners are also exposed to significant health hazards, including coal and silica dust, diesel exhaust, and noise. More than 1000 U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> die of lung disease each year (NIOSH, 1999). Mine safety and health professionals have long recognized training as a critical element of an effective safety and health program. Federal regulations (30 CFR, Parts 46 and 48) require mine operators to provide initial safety and health training to all new miners, as well as a minimum of 8 hours of refresher training each year. The time and money being spent to train U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> is substantial, and so there is a strong and steady demand for new and better mine training materials and methods. A growing concern among mine safety professionals regards the training of new workers. A major change in the mining workforce is anticipated within the next decade. In major segments of mining, especially coal, relatively few workers have been hired since the 1970 's. Thus, as an entire cohort of miners in the current workforce nears retirement, the replacement of these employees will require an influx of new workers. New miners may be young people who lack the ability to recognize and respond to mining hazards in an appropriate manner. They may also have had different educational experiences than their older counterparts. Many safety professionals believe that these two cohorts require different approaches to training. The papers in this report should help prepare mine trainers for the changes about to occur in the workforce and acquaint them with strategies they can use to enhance the effectiveness of their training. The first three papers present basic principles for teaching adults. The five remaining papers are intended to illustrate how these principles {{can be applied to the}} development and imple 2 of effective training for miners. Below is an overview of these papers. 1. Kowalski and Vaught review the process and principles of adult learning. The learning model they present includes a discussion of goals, content, delivery, assessment, and remediation. Adults are viewed as active learners, experienced-based, expert in their own right in specific areas, independent, real-life centered, task-centered, problem-centered, solution-driven, skill-seeking, self-directing, and internally and externally motivated. Basic aspects of curriculum development are briefly reviewed. For further information about adult learning, see Camm and Cullen's paper. 2. Mallett and Reinke's first paper discusses issues related to training new miners who have recently or will soon be entering the mining workforce. These new generations of miners have different learning style preferences and training needs than Baby Boomers and other older miners. Even trainers who have been highly effective in the past should reassess their training styles and their classroom materials to...|$|R
