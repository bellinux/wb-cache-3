Despite being characterized as [...] "the Kung Fu master at setting up freaks", she struggles to find her own true love. After being contacted by her ex-boyfriend to find his perfect match, she becomes cynical about dating and love, saying [...] "I've been Wing Womaning <b>my</b> <b>butt</b> off". Philipps described the character's love life as a [...] "complete disaster".|$|E
500|$|In February the {{battleship}} returned to Norfolk. There Ziegler complained {{to his wife}} about the morale, training, and safety situation aboard Iowa, stating, [...] "We're shorthanded. Chiefs with seventeen years of service are quitting. I've got to teach these kids to push the right button, or they'll blow us to kingdom come! <b>My</b> <b>butt</b> is on the line!" [...] He added that if he died at sea, {{he wanted to be}} buried at sea. Before leaving Norfolk in early April 1989, Third Class Gunner's Mate Scot Blakey, a member of Turret Two's crew, told his sister, Julie Blakey, [...] "I'm not thrilled with some of the things we're doing on the Iowa. We shouldn't be doing them. Something could go wrong." [...] When Julie asked, [...] "Why are you doing them?" [...] Scot replied, [...] "We don't have a choice." ...|$|E

500|$|Manos Arriba {{consists}} of five tracks. The EP opens with [...] "No Me Mandes Flores" [...] ("Don't Send Me Flowers"), which Agustin Gurza called a [...] "cold kiss-off to a stubborn ex-lover". The second track [...] "A Veces" [...] ("At Times") deals with jealousy, and features salsa horns and tropical influences. The following song [...] "La Duda" [...] ("The Doubt") centers on confusion over a man sending mixed romantic signals; the lyrics {{are accompanied by}} synthesizers. On the fourth track, [...] "Icaro" [...] ("Icarus"), Chana sings about {{the subject of the}} Greek myth. Rather than criticizing Icarus for his hubris, her lyrics have a more positive interpretation that praises his desire to follow his passions despite the risks. Chana identifies closely with Icarus, saying: [...] "I would rather take the risk and fall on <b>my</b> <b>butt.</b> It's about that part of you that says just do it." [...] The EP concludes with [...] "The Whistler", which mocks the practice of catcalling. In his verses, rapper Malverde assumes the role of a cat-caller.|$|E

She also says that living overseas for most of her life has made her a foreigner in the US. She said, [...] "I'm scared to walk through Harlem... more scared than you, because if I walked through Harlem with the weird shoes and the weird accent, I'd get <b>my</b> <b>butt</b> kicked faster than you.

[...] Dread Central said [...] "Halloween 4 is a strong sequel, horror film and Halloween movie."

2500|$|UFC President Dana White {{said that}} the {{incident}} {{had no effect on}} the outcome of the fight although he wished the incident had not happened. Penn did, after all, quit after the fourth round. In his first post-fight interview Penn spoke of his belief that if St-Pierre were found to have been [...] "greased" [...] he would lose all respect for him, while admitting that [...] " [...] definitely got <b>my</b> <b>butt</b> kicked." [...] Penn claims that before the match he warned the NSAC that St-Pierre might use grease intentionally. St-Pierre responded to the allegations by offering to fight a rematch against Penn. Penn went on record as accepting the offer for a re-match. Following his informal acceptance of a proposed second rematch, Penn filed a formal complaint with Nevada State Athletic Commission seeking to prevent St-Pierre from fighting by suspending St-Pierre's fighter's license. In addition, Penn unsuccessfully requested the suspension of St-Pierre's cornermen, Greg Jackson and Phil Nurse, a fine of $250,000, and overturning the result of the fight to a no-contest.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Hetero", with lyrics {{written by}} Stevenson, drew some {{negative}} remarks. Reviewing the band's May 25, 1995 performance at Irving Plaza, Jon Pareles of The New York Times called it [...] "openly homophobic, {{and it goes}} on to describe the narrator as a 'cigarette smokin', seal killin' redneck. Jon Ginoli, openly gay frontman of the queercore band Pansy Division, called it [...] "an obviously anti-gay backlash song. In it [...] proclaims himself as a normal straight guy who can't get laid, and he's blaming gay guys. What? In his words, 'the only way you're cool is if you're gay or dead'. Huh? 'Maybe I should pierce <b>my</b> <b>butt</b> or get a few tattoos / Maybe I should wear a dress and be a homo like you / Normal, hetero, straight guy / Yeah that's right, I'm a straight, normal, girl fuckin', coffee drinkin', titty suckin', cigarette smokin', seal killin', redneck-ass bastard from hell'. Hmm, I don't think the gay guys are to blame for that [...] Hearing the song, {{it was hard not to}} take it personally [...] At the same time I felt sad for the guy, who so obviously appeared threatened by gay people having more visibility and acceptance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, you'll excuse <b>my</b> <b>butting</b> in," [...] he began, [...] "but I {{can see you}} {{are kind}} of disappointed. These suckers"--indicating the ex-detective--"talk {{a lot about what}} they're going to show you, and when they get you round, it all amounts to nothing.

2500|$|After {{weeks of}} trying to get his hands on McMahon's new faction, the Corporation, Mankind {{received}} a title shot against The Rock at [...] Mankind won the match by shoving a stench-ridden sock down The Rock's gullet, but McMahon ruled that the title would not change hands because Mankind did not win by pinfall or submission. After several weeks of going after the Corporation, Mankind had his big night on December 29, where Mankind defeated The Rock and won his first WWF Championship. The taped show was broadcast on January 4, 1999, so that is the date WWE recognizes as beginning the title run. Having title changes on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view was uncommon in professional wrestling, but because of the , TV ratings became more important. The rival WCW, attempting {{to take advantage of the}} fact that their show Monday Nitro aired live while Mankind's title victory was taped the week before, had announcer Tony Schiavone reveal the ending of the Mankind-Rock match before it aired. He then added sarcastically, [...] "That'll put a lot of butts in the seats." [...] The move backfired for WCW, as Nielsen ratings showed that Raw won the ratings battle that night, despite the Hogan vs. Nash main event which led to the reformation of the New World Order. Foley said that the ratings indicate that large numbers of viewers switched from Nitro to Raw to see him win the title and took great personal pride from this, and [...] "Mick Foley put <b>my</b> <b>butt</b> in this seat" [...] signs began showing up at WWF events.|$|E

Let them once get tattling in their parlours, and it's death to me. For I'm in a cruel corner now. I'm down, and I shall get my kicking soon and soon enough. I began it in the lust of life, in a hey-day of mystery and adventure. I felt it great to be a bolder, craftier rogue than the drowsy citizen that called himself my fellow-man. (It was meat and drink to know him in the hollow of my hand, {{hoarding}} that I and mine might squander, pinching that we might wax fat.) It was in the laughter of my heart that I tip-toed into his greasy privacy. I forced the strong-box at his ear while he sprawled beside his wife. He was <b>my</b> <b>butt,</b> my ape, my jumping-jack. And now ... O fool, fool! (Duped by such knaves as are a shame to knavery, crime's rabble, hell's tatterdemalions!) Shorn to the quick! Rooked to my vitals! And I must thieve for my daily bread like any crawling blackguard in the gutter. And my sister ... my kind, innocent sister!

60|$|The air {{was fresh}} and clear; {{and the night}} breeze was delicious after the steamy breath of day. The weary {{confinement}} of walls made the splendid expanse a luxury to the sight, whilst the tumbling of the surf upon the near shore, and {{the music of the}} jackal, predisposed to sweet sleep. We now felt that at length the die was cast. Placing my pistols by my side, with <b>my</b> rifle <b>butt</b> for a pillow, and its barrel as a bed-fellow, I sought repose with none of that apprehension which even the most stout-hearted traveller knows before the start. It is the difference between fancy and reality, between anxiety and certainty: to men gifted with any imaginative powers the anticipation must ever be worse than the event. Thus it happens, that he who feels a thrill of fear before engaging in a peril, exchanges it for a throb of exultation when he finds himself hand to hand with the danger.|$|R
6000|$|... "When we {{are among}} the Kukuanas, my good friend Infadoos, we do as the Kukuanas do," [...] I said majestically, and turned round quickly to address Good, who was {{tramping}} along sullenly behind, his mind fully occupied with unsatisfactory attempts to prevent his flannel shirt from flapping in the evening breeze. To <b>my</b> astonishment I <b>butted</b> into Umbopa, who was walking along immediately behind me, and very evidently had been listening with the greatest interest to my conversation with Infadoos. The {{expression on his face}} was most curious, and gave me the idea {{of a man who was}} struggling with partial success to bring something long ago forgotten back into his mind.|$|R

[...] Barely were the words out of my mouth when I stubbed my toe on some obstacle, pitched forward, and <b>butted</b> <b>my</b> head into {{something}} that FELT very much like a door. I reached out my hand. It WAS a door. I found the knob and turned it. And at once, as the door swung inward on its hinges, the whole interior of the laboratory impinged upon my vision. Greeting Lloyd, I closed the door and backed up the path a few paces. I could see nothing of the building. Returning and opening the door, at once all the furniture and every detail of the interior were visible. It was indeed startling, the sudden transition from void to light and form and color.|$|R
