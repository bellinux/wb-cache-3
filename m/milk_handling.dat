40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess hygienic cow <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> practices of milk producers, traders (informal collectors, transporters and vendors) and consumers across the milk supply chain in the Eastern Ethiopia. Materials and methods: A total of 160 milk producers in Babile district were selected using multistage stratified sampling technique. Moreover, a total of 54 milk collectors and transporters (5, 40, 9 from Jigjiga, Harar and Dire Dawa town, respectively), 152 vendors (40 from Bable, Harar and Dire Dawa town and 32 from Jigjiga town) and 160 consumers (40 from each town) were selected using snowball sampling technique. Data from the selected actors were collected using focus group discussion, questionnaire survey and observations. Results: The study revealed that the majority of <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> operations in the study area is carried out by females. The majority of respondent milk producers (87. 5 - 92. 5 %), collectors and transporters (88. 9 - 100 %), vendors (77. 5 - 90. 7 %) and some consumers (37. 5 - 47. 5 %) performing <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> operations were illiterate. Most of the observed actors in the study area perform malpractices (such as failure to stop <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> while showing disease symptoms, improper hand washing and handling of risk factors) while working with milk. Majority of respondent milk producers (87. 5 - 97. 5 %), all traders and some consumers (12. 5 - 32. 5 %) use plastic containers for <b>milk</b> <b>handling.</b> <b>Milk</b> <b>handling</b> equipments were commonly washed using warm water, detergent and sand; however, in most case they were not properly protected from risk factors after washing. Majority of respondent milk producers (55 - 65 %), collectors and transporters (60 - 66. 7 %), and some vendors (0 - 50 %) and consumers (0 - 55 %) use water from non-tap sources for hygienic practices. Conclusion: In general; the findings indicated that <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> practices performed across the supply chain in the study area were unhygienic and therefore suggested the need for improving hygienic practices.

30|$|Milk {{post-harvest loss}} is the {{measured}} {{qualitative and quantitative}} losses along the dairy value chain (Hodges et al. 2011). Quantitative milk loss is measured as the reduction in its weight or volume due to spillage and forced consumption. Forced milk consumption occurs mostly in areas with surplus, and the family uses the milk or it {{is given to the}} calves or neighbours. On the other hand, qualitative milk losses occur due to physical and microbial spoilage as a result of contamination (Muriuki 2003; Buzby and Hyman 2012). Most often, milk is contaminated during <b>milking,</b> <b>handling,</b> and transportation. <b>Milk</b> is a good growth medium for many micro-organisms because of its high water content, nearly neutral pH, and variety of available essential nutrients. This is more pronounced since Kenya lies in the tropics where temperatures are ideal for quick deterioration of milk quality and safety (Godefay and Molla 2000).|$|R

40|$|Raising consumers' {{awareness}} about food safety issues {{is one of}} the primary objectives of Italian public health organizations. New dynamic and interactive tools, based on web applications, are already playing a leading role in health promotion campaigns targeted at adolescents. Among the web-based tools specifically designed for young people, educational videogames have proved especially effective in furthering learning and disseminating information, as they arouse adolescents' interest and curiosity. When a number of cases of Haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) were reported in 2010, particularly among children, the Italian Ministry of Health stressed the need to implement communication initiatives aimed at raising consumers' awareness of the potential risks associated with raw milk consumption at home. The pilot study described in the article is a relevant example of educational projects implemented in Italy, oriented to transmit knowledge about food risks to young consumers (aged 16 e 18). To provide correct information on safe <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> practices and to reduce health issues, including serious ones, the videogame “A mysterious poisoning” was developed. This tool was administered online to 359 upper secondary school students from four different provinces in Italy. The videogame covered all stages of the milk supply chain, from stable to table, and enabled players to identify the crucial moments when milk can be contaminated and to discover safe <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> practices. By completing a series of tasks, students helped a detective discover the cause of a food poisoning outbreak. This videogame provided an opportunity for students to test their knowledge of the product and to receive more detailed and accurate information.

40|$|Traditional (informal) {{milk market}} {{accounts}} for 97 percent of fresh milk supply I Assam {{and attempts to}} establish dairy cooperatives have had limited success. In areas with relatively poor market access, these informal markets represent the only market opportunity for dairy farmers. However, widespread concerns about milk safety and quality have led to decision makers and government support services to ignore or penalize the traditional milk sector. A series of studies among milk value chain actors was conducted {{to better understand the}} milk sector in Assam, assess the risk to human health posed by the traditional milk sector, and develop an action plan for improving the performance of the traditional milk sector. Key findings of the studies are: (1) most milk samples do not meet microbiological standards; (2) adulteration of milk is widespread but does not appear to represent a risk to human health; (3) <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> practices are very poor and is associated with low levels of food safety; and (4) only a minority of milk is pasteurized, and while this does reduce the level of bacterial count, it does not guarantee absence of adulteration or compliance with standards. The risk assessment of the dairy supply chain suggests the following key results: (1) the majority of milk sampled in urban Assam did not meet local standards and may present a risk to public health and (2) formal milk outlets are no better than informal milk outlets in terms of the level of compliance with milk quality standards. Opportunities to potentially improve food safety in traditional milk markets are thus possible and the most promising intervention is some form of certification scheme involving training of informal milk vendors in <b>milk</b> <b>handling...</b>|$|E

The study investigated raw milk consumption behaviour, factors associated with the consumption of raw milk and <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> practices among dairy farming communities in urban and peri urban areas of Debre-Zeit. A total of 170 dairy farmers were surveyed. Whether the levels of education, income, urbanisation and awareness of milk borne diseases could be associated with raw milk consumption was tested by statistical analyses. Of the 170 participants, 54 (31. 8 %) producers had a habit of consuming raw milk. The proportion of dairy farmers consuming raw milk was significantly higher in peri urban areas (94. 8 %) than in urban areas of Debre-Zeit (13. 0 %, 2 = 89. 3, df= 1, OR= 124. 1, p < 0. 001). Of the factors tested, only residing in peri urban areas was significantly associated with consumption of raw milk (p < 0. 001). All, 29. 4 % and 19. 4 % of the farmers included in this study used plastic containers for transporting, milking and storing milk, respectively. The proportion of farmers who stored milk at room temperature (46. 5 %) was significantly higher than those who stored at refrigeration temperature (24. 1 %, 2 = 13. 9, df= 2, p = 0. 001).

A cross sectional study {{was carried out in}} Lushoto and Handeni districts of Tanga, Tanzania to determine the <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> practices, bacterial contamination and selected milk-borne zoonotic pathogens along the dairy value chain. A total of 93 respondents were interviewed and 184 milk and milk product samples were collected. Laboratory analysis of total and coliform plate counts, detection of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Brucella abortus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were done. Results showed that, most farmers (57 %) milked their cows under unhygienic conditions. More than 60 % of farmers did not clean their hands, wash cow teats and clean animal houses before milking. The majority (92. 1 %) of farmers were not trained on livestock keeping and <b>milk</b> <b>handling.</b> Although the mean TPC was within the East African Community (EAC) standards, general counts ranged between 3. 3 to 5. 8 log 10. Eighty seven and 93 % of milk from farmers and vendors, respectively, did not meet the TPC EAC standards. All the collected milk did not meet the CPC EAC standards, indicating contamination of milk with coliforms. PCR analyses did not detect E. coli O 157 :H 7 in all the tested samples while B. abortus was detected in 37 out of 87 samples tested. It was concluded that unhygienic practices of milking and post-harvest handling along the dairy value chain possibly contributed to microbial contamination of milk. Detection of B. abortus in milk is of public health significance due to its zoonotic potential. It is recommended that veterinary/extension services be provided to livestock farmers on proper animal husbandry and control of zoonotic animal diseases.

40|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{chemistry}} of the build-up of soil resulting from <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> operations. This study was developed to find {{the nature of the}} presoil and its contribution to the fate of the microflora. The microenvironment in soil on <b>milk</b> <b>handling</b> equipment is dependent upon available water as influenced by humidity in the atmosphere. The effect of RH (80, 86, 93, and 100 %) was, therefore, studied using milk products as the soiling. Varying combinations of whole, raw milk and other milk constituents were layered on 1 cm 2 stainless steel surfaces and studied with exposure to controlled humidities. Varying humidity levels were found to have a selective effect on the microflora of the raw milk film. The lower RH (80 %) showed an inhibition of the gram-negative bacteria, while the higher RH (100 %) enhanced the growth of gram-negative bacteria. Stacking and clamping of stainless steel squares, to simulate harborages, produced a microflora similar to that found with a single layer of raw milk using 100 % RH. By reducing the surface area of the film exposed to the atmosphere, more water was made available to the bacterial cells of the milk-soil film. A similar retardation in loss of moisture was obtained through presoiling. Presoiling, to simulate incomplete cleaning plus a layer of raw milk, followed by incubation at 25 C, resulted in a visible yellow film similar to a type of “milkstone” encountered under field conditions. Key constituents were presoiled on stainless steel squares followed by a subsequent film of raw milk. Phospholipids were found to be necessary in the production of the yellow film. Another necessity for the production of the yellow film was growth of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas. Evaluation of the yellow film produced in the laboratory found its production to be dependent on the following factors: 1) inadequate cleaning to yield a presoil of phospholipids, 2) growth of Pseudomonas sp., 3) high population density, and 4) available water.
