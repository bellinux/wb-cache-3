In illustrating the story, McKean blends paintings, drawings, photography, and mixed-media collage to come up with striking page designs, and dense symbols. He has said that he was [...] "trying to make the book despite the subject, rather than because of it. At the end of the day, if you really love to do Batman comics, then that's probably the best thing to do. Not liking them, and then trying to <b>make</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them is just a waste of time." [...] He also came to think that [...] "overpainted, lavish illustrations in every panel just didn't work. It hampers the storytelling." [...] McKean liberally uses symbolism, imagery, and surrealism, and many scenes involve the use of symbols to denote a particular psychological device. For example, a Greek inscription can be seen scratched on the doorway of Maxie Zeus's electroshock chamber, which translates into [...] "Discover thyself." [...] Much of this symbolism was later explained and expanded upon by the release of the 15th Anniversary Edition containing Morrison's annotated script.|$|E

A former professor noted that she [...] "stood {{out from the}} empty-headed, overdressed little sorority girls of that era like a good piece of literature on a shelf of cheap paperbacks." [...] She held part-time jobs on campus, worked as a sales clerk in Bullock's-Wilshire department store, and taught touch typing and shorthand at a high school. She also supplemented her income by working as an extra and bit player in the film industry, for which she took several screen tests. In this capacity she made brief appearances in the films Becky Sharp (1935), The Great Ziegfeld (1936), and Small Town Girl (1936). (People have spotted her in the 1936 Dancing Pirate as well.) In some cases she {{ended up on the}} cutting room floor, such as with her spoken lines in Becky Sharp. She told Hollywood columnist Erskine Johnson in 1959 that her time in films was [...] "too fleeting even for recollections embellished by the years" [...] and that [...] "my choice of a career was teaching school and the many jobs I pursued were merely to help with college expenses." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mounir's single [...] "Maddad" [...] {{from this}} album caused controversy, as its lyrics could be {{interpreted}} as a call for intercession from the prophet Muhammad. Among Muslims, there are differing views as to whether the prophet can provide intercession between Allah and his believers. This resulted in the music video being banned from Egyptian television for a time. Mounir responded by saying [...] "it is this fight against rigid thought that <b>makes</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you".|$|R

40|$|To me, art is funky and random. To me, art is spiky. To me, art is both {{harsh and}} delicate. To me, {{art is a}} {{challenge}} to carry. To me, art doesn’t like sitting around—even if it’s resting on the floor. To me, art doesn’t represent figures or forms from our world. To me, art twists and turns and makes up its own mind as it goes. To me, art colors places that are dull. To me, art makes people happy. To me, art uses the same amount of energy as a morning run. To me, art forgets rules. To me, art is cool for both artists and non-artists. To me, art is confusing. To me, art works as a team. To me, art creates smiles. To me, art talks—but isn’t specific to language. To me, art recycles junk. To me, art <b>makes</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> nothing. To me, art is vibrant and catches the eye. To me, art doesn’t care if it’s hated. To me, art doesn’t care if it’s loved either. To me, art has endless interpretations. To me, art lives. To me, art is free. To me, art does whatever the hell it wants to do...|$|R
