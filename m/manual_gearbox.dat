5|$|The Tiger {{went into}} {{production}} in June 1964, {{little more than}} a year after the completion of the Shelby prototype. Painted and trimmed bodies were supplied by Pressed Steel in Oxfordshire, and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America. Installing the engine required some unusual manufacturing methods, including using a sledgehammer to bash in part of the already primed and painted bulkhead to allow the engine to be slid into place. Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month, which were initially offered for sale only in North America. The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg-Warner 4-speed all-synchromesh <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox,</b> until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang.|$|E
5|$|Thus the FG01 did not promise much {{in terms}} of performance. It was angular and bulky, with poor {{aerodynamic}} performance negatively affecting grip and handling; it had a plump nose, initially no airbox, and was overweight and under-powered, using a small Ford-Cosworth ED V8 customer engine largely financed by Ford do Brasil, which developed an estimated 100bhp less than the most powerful engine in the field, the Renault V10 supplied to the Benetton and Williams teams. It was also the only car to have a <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox</b> in the 1995 F1 season. The car was liveried in a distinctive yellow-and-blue colour scheme accompanied by fluorescent green wheel-rims, illustrating the team's Brazilian influence in its first year. The precise hue of each colour was chosen {{as a tribute to}} Ayrton Senna, who had been killed at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix; the cars were liveried in identical shades to those used on the Brazilian's helmet design.|$|E
25|$|A major {{difference}} in the Vantage S is {{the inclusion of the}} Sportshift II transmission, a seven speed sequential <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox,</b> as standard.|$|E
50|$|Engines are {{coupled with}} 4- or 5-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> A central tire {{inflation}} system is fitted as standard.|$|R
50|$|Indonesia {{models of}} Etios Valco were {{available}} in four trim levels (J, JX, E, G) all standard with 5 speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{available}} with both manual and automatic transmissions. The <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> {{are made by}} ZFhttp://www.zf.com of Ecomid range and automatic transmissions by Allisonhttp://www.allisontransmission.com/There are two <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> with cable linkage system and servo assist to reduce gear changing effort. The 6 speed overdrive has a direct shift pattern and is available with [...] and [...] engines.The 9 speed overdrive range change with so called double H pattern is available for tractor units and higher GCM vehicles.|$|R
25|$|For 1964 an {{overdrive}} {{option was}} added to the four-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox</b> to give more relaxed cruising. Wire wheels and a hard top were also available.|$|E
25|$|A {{six-speed}} Getrag <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox</b> (parts code: 0A3, identification codes: HLD, JMH) is {{the only}} transmission available. The gear ratios are 1st: 3.667, 2nd: 2.211, 3rd: 1.520, 4th: 1.133, 5th: 0.919, 6th: 0.778.|$|E
25|$|Alpine Renault {{continued}} {{to develop their}} range of models all through the 1980s. The A310 was the next modern interpretation of the A110. The Alpine A310 was a sports car with a rear-mounted engine and was initially powered by a four-cylinder 1.6 L sourced Renault 17 TS/Gordini engine. In 1976 the A310 was restyled by Robert Opron and fitted with the more powerful and newly developed V6 PRV engine. The 2.6 L motor was modified by Alpine with a four-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox.</b> Later they would use a Five-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox</b> and with the group 4 model get a higher tune with more cubic capacity and 3 twin barrel Weber carburetors.|$|E
50|$|The Formula Renault 95 used Mygale chassis, {{production}} 2.0L 165 hp {{engines and}} Hewland five-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> The car was last used in 1999.|$|R
50|$|Most {{lubricants}} for <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> and differentials contain {{extreme pressure}} (EP) additives and antiwear additives {{to cope with}} the sliding action of hypoid bevel gears.|$|R
30|$|HÖhn {{introduced}} the future trends of automotive drivetrains in Europe. He {{pointed out that}} automotive transmissions for passenger cars in Europe have changed continuously in the last 20  years. The ratio range for transmissions has increased more and more. He believed that the trend to more gears for automatic transmissions and manual gear boxes would be going on. He predicted that, in the future, different concepts would be the general trends, and semi-automated <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes,</b> CVTs, and hybrid systems would be applied even though in the past there were only <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> and automatic transmissions on the market [10].|$|R
25|$|VW {{offers a}} choice of two engine options; a 1.6 litre {{naturally}} aspirated petrol engine mated to a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic gearbox and a 1.6 litre diesel engine mated only to a five-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox</b> (TDI).|$|E
25|$|The GT500 {{version of}} the car has a {{completely}} different drivetrain compared to the production car. The race car is upgraded to a VK45DE 4.5-litre naturally aspirated V8 instead of the twinturbo V6 VR38DETT. It uses a 6 speed sequential <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox</b> and a RWD layout from its predecessor, the 350Z race car.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicle is}} powered by a Leyland 313 {{turbocharged}} water-cooled four-stroke diesel engine coupled to a five-speed all-synchromesh <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox</b> and two-speed transfer case. There is permanent (4 × 4) drive. The front axle has a rating of 5,000kg, with an offset bowl to reduce overall cab height. The rear axle has a rating of 7,500kg.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2010, Toyota {{announced}} a worldwide recall on several of their vehicles for a faulty sticking accelerator pedal - {{in which the}} Aygo is affected. Under certain circumstances, the pedal can stick in a partially depressed position, or return slowly to the off position. PSA Peugeot Citroën followed suit, announcing a recall of [...] "under 100,000 units" [...] of the Citroën C1 and the Peugeot 107 for the same issue. New information from Toyota has suggested, however, that only Aygos and Peugeot 107s with Aisin Ez-drive automated <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> (Multi-mode/2-Tronic) are affected, and that those with <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> are not.|$|R
50|$|The Aston Martin One-77, Vantage S, V8 Vantage, DB9 and Maserati GranTurismo S use rear {{transaxle}} gearboxes {{while the}} Maserati Quattroporte and Coupé & Spyder Trofeo- GranSport had an MT-AMT (Automated <b>Manual)</b> <b>gearboxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> {{dominated}} the early models, but automatic Tiptronic-style gearboxes (Jatco JF506E) became increasingly popular and were standard on the V6. The Automatic Tiptronic gearbox was also available {{as an option}} on the Td4.|$|R
25|$|The Auto Union's 981 cc {{two-stroke}} three-cylinder engine came {{in various}} states of tune. After 1960, advertised power in the saloon versions was increased to 50bhp (37kW). Power was delivered via a four-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox,</b> controlled using a column-mounted lever. The electrical system was a six-volt one which by this time was beginning to look old fashioned.|$|E
25|$|The Mk5 Polo GTI {{facelift}} {{was launched}} in 2015. It featured a new 1.8 litre turbocharged engine which had been developed by Audi. It produced 190nbsp&bhp and was capable of sprinting from 0-60nbsp&mph in 6.7 seconds. It came standard with a six speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox,</b> unlike its predecessor which was only available with a 7 speed DSG.|$|E
25|$|The SJ {{hatchback}} and SJ Safari wagon models feature soft nylon upholstery, {{cut pile}} carpeting, padded and cloth covered door panels, and a fabric headliner, plus rally instruments, the higher-output two barrel engine, four-speed or automatic (over a three-speed <b>manual)</b> <b>gearbox</b> and radial tires. A GT package {{option for the}} hatchback and Safari wagon combined the lower-line interior with the SJ's performance and handling features.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the Hyundai Solaris for Russian and CIS (were it sold as Hyundai Accent) {{market was}} facelifted. The car got new front fascia and new 6-speed {{automatic}} and 6-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> for 1.6 version.|$|R
30|$|While {{throttle}} {{standard deviations}} {{is a good}} indicator for the drive style of the tested car featuring an automated transmission a further indicator might be required to better classify drive style of vehicles featuring <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bristol Omnibus Company {{received}} six LH buses in 1971 with semi-automatic gearboxes. A further 110 (with <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes)</b> {{were ordered}} for delivery between 1975 and 1980. A few more buses were acquired second hand including two LHSs from London Country.|$|R
25|$|The KPGC10's successor, the KPGC110, was {{released}} in 1973 after its introduction at the 1972 Tokyo motor show. Powered by a 1989cc I6 S20 engine, the second generation GT-R delivered power to the rear wheels through a 5-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox.</b> This car also had both front and rear disk brakes. The suspension was a semi-trailing ring arm setup and minor aerodynamic parts were added.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{only the}} four-door sedan and wagon were offered; the two-door was never available. The 1.6-litre, {{featuring}} the same R16 engine as the SP(L)311 Roadster, was only available in 1967. The 1.2 and 1.3 410 and 411 series' had a <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox,</b> while the 1.6-litre was available {{as either a}} manual or automatic. The cars were labeled DATSUN, with no mention of Bluebird either on the car or in the owner's manual.|$|E
25|$|Because the Moke's A-Series engine, <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox</b> and {{suspension}} {{are identical}} to those of a standard Mini (which was still in production up to October 2000), most spare parts are still readily available. The Moke has no chassis, so the wheels, brake assemblies and suspension are attached to front and rear subframes bolted straight onto the monocoque shell, just as with a standard Mini. Mokes tend to require much structural maintenance {{if they are to}} stay in good running order.|$|E
5000|$|Multitronic offers {{performance}} and economy similar to, {{and in some}} cases better than, the equivalent five-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes,</b> and superior to the traditional automatic transmission. [...] Particular performance advantages are noticed with 'in-gear' seamless acceleration times over equivalent manual transmission cars.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese GT models had various {{differences}} from the ET, LT and ST including the hood flutes, power windows, air conditioning, and specific GT trim, but shared {{a few things}} with the ST - a full-length center console and oil pressure/ammeter gauges while the LT had warning lights for these functions. With {{the exception of the}} American market, the GT had a twincam engine (1600 cc 2T-G or 2000 cc 18R-G, not available on the ET, LT or ST) and always had 5-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> For the American market only, the GT had only a single cam engine (2000 cc 18R or 2200 cc 20R) with a choice of automatic or <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1971, the 2178 cc {{diesel engine}} was {{replaced}} by a larger, 2520 cc version. This engine proved to be better for use with an automatic transmission and gradually fewer cabs with <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> were sold. The petrol engine was discontinued in 1973.|$|R
25|$|TL with {{navigation}} models sport a new {{rear view}} camera with image displayed on the navigation screen as well as XM NavTraffic. In addition to the new standard auxiliary audio jack, the sound system is now MP3/WMA compatible and offers Dolby Pro Logic II decoding and speed-sensitive volume compensation. The manual transmission option had been dropped from the base TL due largely to extremely low sales (roughly 1 out of 40 TLs sold across America were equipped with a <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox).</b>|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the floor}} shift lever also has another plane of operation, for manual mode, with {{spring-loaded}} + and − positions. This plane is selected {{by moving the}} stick away from the driver (in vehicles with the driver's seat on the right, the lever is pushed to the left, and in left-hand drive cars, the stick is pushed to the right) when in D mode only. When this plane is selected, the DSG can now be controlled like a <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox,</b> albeit only under a sequential shift pattern.|$|E
25|$|The 86, BRZ and FR-S {{are offered}} with two 6-speed transmissions, an {{in-house}} developed Toyota TL70 <b>manual</b> <b>gearbox</b> (based on Aisin AI's AZ6) and an Aisin-Warner A960E automatic transmission, which is modified from that {{used on the}} Lexus IS 250. The latter uses a traditional wet torque converter design, but its software has been engineered to mimic the response of a dual-clutch gearbox. The automatic transmission uses three different modes: Sport, Snow, and Normal. A torque sensing limited slip differential is standard on most models.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Ferrari {{recalled}} {{several hundred}} 2005-2007 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti with automated <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> because the clutch sensor in the transmission could malfunction due to {{heat from the}} vehicle under normal operating conditions. This may render the vehicle inoperable and possibly result in a crash.|$|R
5000|$|When launched, {{it had the}} {{following}} ranges: TC, TL, GTL, and Automatic. The entry-level TC had the 956 cc engine (rated at 42 bhp), while the TL had the 1108 cc engine (rated at 47 bhp), and the GTL, Automatic, TS and TSE had the 1397 cc engine (rated at [...] for the GTL, [...] for the Automatic, and [...] for the TS and TSE). The TC and TL had four-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes,</b> while the GTL, TS and TSE had five-speed <b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> (which were optional on the TL), and the Automatic had a three-speed automatic gearbox. 1987 saw {{the introduction of the}} 1721 cc F2N engine in the GTX, GTE (F3N) and Baccara (Monaco in some markets, notably the United Kingdom).|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the wide}} variety of loads the semi may carry, they usually have a manual {{transmission}} to allow the driver to have as much control as possible. However, all truck manufacturers now offer semi-automatic transmissions (<b>manual</b> <b>gearboxes</b> with automated gear change), as well as automatic transmissions.|$|R
