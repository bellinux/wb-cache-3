5|$|The {{battleship}} USS Utah, {{which was}} actually a test dummy, remains submerged off the island. After salvaging the capsized USS Oklahoma with winching cables, the Navy unsuccessfully tried to recover the Utah using the same technique. In 1972, {{the remains of the}} Utah (on the northwest side of the island) were dedicated as a memorial to the fifty-eight <b>men</b> <b>still</b> inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossing}} was not {{secure and}} when the Germans realised something was happening they opened fire with machine-guns and targeted the south bank with artillery fire, sinking some boats or killing their crews. At dawn the evacuation ended with around 500 <b>men</b> <b>still</b> waiting on the north bank. A small number of men tried to swim across and some {{made it to the}} far bank. Of the men left behind, 200 evaded capture and reached the safety of the south bank over the following days.|$|E

5|$|Balakirev's despotism {{strained}} {{the relationship}} between him and Tchaikovsky but both <b>men</b> <b>still</b> appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's King Lear, a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the attack, Major Ormsby advanced from Fort Erie to Frenchman’s Creek with his 80 men of the 49th Regiment, where he was joined by Lieutenant McIntyre’s 70 light infantrymen, Major Hatt’s Lincoln Militia and some British-allied Native Americans under Major Givins. Finding that Boerstler’s invaders had already gone, and being unable to determine any other enemy presence in the pitch dark, Ormsby’s 300 men remained in position until daybreak, when Lieutenant Colonel Bisshopp arrived from Fort Erie. Bisshopp led the force to the Red House, where they found Captain King and his <b>men</b> <b>still</b> waiting to be evacuated. Outnumbered by ten-to-one, King surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Some Australians {{decided to}} delay their {{departure}} and instead joined the British Army {{and went on}} to serve in Northern Russia during the Russian Civil War, although officially the Australian government refused to contribute forces to the campaign. HMAS Yarra, Torrens, Swan and Parramatta served in the Black Sea during the same conflict. Elsewhere, in Egypt in early 1919, a number of Australian light horse units were used to quell a nationalist uprising while they were waiting for passage back to Australia. Despite shortages in shipping, the process of returning the soldiers to Australia was completed faster than expected and by September 1919 there were 10,000 <b>men</b> <b>still</b> left in Britain waiting for repatriation. The last of the main transports conveying Australian troops left England on 23 December 1919, arriving in Australia in early 1920. A year later, on 1 April 1921, the AIF was officially disbanded.|$|E

5|$|The 5th USCC Regimental Commander, Colonel of Volunteers, L. Henry Carpenter, had {{his final}} regimental review on March 16, 1866 in Helena, Arkansas. The names of 46 {{officers}} and <b>men</b> <b>still</b> listed officially as {{missing in action}} and presumed murdered between October 2 & 8, 1864 were read for a final time to the regiment. Then most of the officers, including Carpenter, were honorably discharged by ceremony. Over the next four days the men were mustered out and the regiment was officially retired on March 20, 1866. Official losses from October 24, 1864 to March 16, 1866 were 35 killed in action and 152 died in service from disease, wounds and other causes. After mustering out, Carpenter reverted to his Regular Army rank of first lieutenant and returned home to Philadelphia on leave. After his leave he reported to the new 10th United States Cavalry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Though a {{few small}} factions broke with Smith's {{organization}} during his lifetime, he retained the allegiance {{of the vast majority}} of Latter Day Saints until his death in June 1844. Following Smith's death, the movement experienced a leadership crisis which led to a schism within the church. The largest group, which would become the LDS Church, followed Brigham Young, settling in what would become the Utah Territory. The second-largest faction, the RLDS Church, coalesced around Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Joseph Smith. Other would-be leaders included the senior surviving member of the First Presidency, Sidney Rigdon; the newly baptized James Strang from Wisconsin; and Alpheus Cutler, one of the Council of Fifty. Each of these <b>men</b> <b>still</b> retains a following as of 2014—however tiny it may be in some cases—and all of their organizations have experienced further schisms. Other claimants, such as Granville Hedrick, William Bickerton and Charles B. Thompson, later emerged to start still other factions, some of which have further subdivided.|$|E
5|$|After their victory, the Crusaders rested for a {{while in}} the rich plain of Messenia. Champlitte called a council of war to {{determine}} their future strategy, and sent the fleet, which until then had accompanied them, home. In late 1205 or 1206, the Crusaders went on to capture Arkadia, whose siege lasted for some time, as well as the fortress of Araklovon, whose resistance was led by the celebrated warrior Doxapatres Voutsaras. By this time, the entire northern and western of the peninsula was under the rule of Champlitte. The northwest belonged to the Duchy of Athens under the suzerainty of Boniface of Montferrat, although Leo Sgouros and his <b>men</b> <b>still</b> held out in their two fortresses; and Laconia and the mountains of the Taygetus and Tsakonia remained still unsubdued. Nevertheless, the first stage of the Frankish conquest was complete, and in a letter to Pope Innocent III on 19 November 1205, Champlitte claimed for himself the title princeps totius Achaiae provincie, establishing a new state, the Principality of Achaea.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{popularity}} of rickshaws waned after World War II. No new licenses for rickshaws have been issued since 1975, and licenses became non-transferable.

There were about eight in 1998, and only four left in 2002, and two in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Today, kimono {{are most}} often worn by women, {{particularly}} on special occasions. Traditionally, unmarried women wore a style of kimono called furisode, with almost floor-length sleeves, on special occasions. A few older women and even fewer <b>men</b> <b>still</b> wear the kimono on a daily basis. Men wear the kimono most often at weddings, tea ceremonies, and other very special or very formal occasions. Professional sumo wrestlers are often seen in the kimono because {{they are required to}} wear traditional Japanese dress whenever appearing in public.|$|E
25|$|The third {{battalion}} {{was raised}} at Horsham in November 1813, and was recruited very rapidly; {{within a month}} of its formation, it was reported as ready for service with an establishment of 650 men. It embarked for Holland on 9 December, and fought at the Battle of Merxem on 30 January 1814. After service in the siege of Antwerp, the battalion returned to England after Napoleon's abdication, and was disbanded at Sheerness on 24 October.
