Although <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> conference <b>attendance</b> grow steadily at the American Economic Association, both are stagnant for the regional associations. Membership elasticity for economics associations ranges from - 0. 25 to - 0. 50; conference attendance is very inelastic {{with respect to}} registration fees. While the regional associations may find it challenging to grow, they {{have the capacity to}} expand revenues if that should be necessary to survive.

50|$|Due to {{a decline}} in {{membership}} in the early 19th century, the church began translating its French liturgy into English in 1828.

25|$|As of June 2014, {{the church}} had 983 congregations with a {{reported}} <b>membership</b> of 97,444 <b>and</b> a reported average attendance of 70,811. Because some congregations did not report any membership data, the ACNA released projections of <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> average <b>attendance</b> data as well.

50|$|Currently, {{this shift}} can be {{observed}} {{in a variety of ways}} as mentioned earlier, most visibly in lowered <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> numbers. This situation has been attributed to poor religious offerings, to a modern emphasis on the secular world, to ineffective participation and devotion of believers worldwide, or to the will of God (in some religious circles). While all these may be partially true, the danger is making a synecdoche of the products of decline and overestimating their importance and influence in religion.|$|E
50|$|Deism was a {{religious}} philosophy in common currency in colonial times, and some Founding Fathers (most notably Thomas Paine, {{who was an}} explicit proponent of it, and Benjamin Franklin, who spoke of it in his Autobiography) are identified more or less with this system. Thomas Jefferson became a deist in later life, and Washington, James Madison, James Monroe, and John Tyler are often identified as having some degree of deistic beliefs. Washington, however, maintained a lifelong pattern of church <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>attendance,</b> and there is conflicting testimony from those who knew him.|$|E
50|$|<b>Membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> of {{services}} in Lutheran churches, as {{for all of}} the large, state-affiliated European churches are low and decreasing. Church attendance on Sundays is no longer the norm. Often, people attend religious services only for baptisms, confirmations, weddings, funerals, and possibly at Christmas and Easter. Traditionally, the Lutheran youth would receive preparatory confirmation classes for 1 to 2 years around age 14, to introduce them to Christian doctrines. A large confirmation service is held once the series is completed. In some areas confirmation is now delayed {{until the end of the}} high school.|$|E
5000|$|Off-field, Pelerman {{was losing}} {{millions}} of dollars annually on the club, and he agreed to release the Bears from private ownership and revert to a traditional club structure in which the club's members were able to elect the board. In 1992, the club abandoned its oft-ridiculed [...] "BB" [...] guernsey and adopted a predominantly maroon strip with a gold V and white trim. More significantly, in 1993 the club moved permanently to the Gabba; with the club now playing in its home city, <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>attendances</b> instantly tripled. The greyhound track around the ground was removed, the surface was upgraded and the stands gradually replaced {{over the next few}} years with a view to converting the tired old ground to a state-of-the-art sporting facility.|$|R
50|$|Connecticut {{passed an}} act of toleration in 1784, {{allowing}} any Protestant to avoid taxes supporting the local Congregational Church who could show authorities a document proving <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> regular <b>attendance</b> at another church. In 1791 the same right was extended to all Christians. The act had little practical effect for Catholics, however, {{since there was no}} Catholic parish in the state.|$|R
50|$|In 1945, Abraham Low {{found the}} average member {{improved}} considerably {{after the first}} or second week in the program as it existed at that time. However, members were required to lose their major symptoms within two months of <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> class <b>attendance.</b> If they did not, this was taken as an indication that the member was still sabotaging the physician's efforts.|$|R
5000|$|Perry Townsend Rathbone (July 3, 1911 [...] - [...] January 15, 2000) {{was one of}} {{the leading}} American art museum {{directors}} of the 20th century. As director of the St. Louis Art Museum from 1940-1955, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 1955-1972, he transformed these institutions from quiet repositories of art to vibrant cultural centers. Known for his sensitive installations as well as his bold publicity stunts, he increased the <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> figures of both institutions exponentially, and also added significant works to their permanent collections across the board.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Germantown Baptist needed a larger sanctuary and the church purchased 3 acre {{on the east side of}} its existing lot. In 1975, <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> increased so dramatically that the church had to return to two services and two Sunday School hours in spite of the additional room provided by the interim sanctuary. On March 14, 1975, a ground breaking ceremony was held for a church gymnasium called the Christian Family Center. In January 1977, the Christian Family Center was opened. The new space resulted in an immediate increase in Sunday School attendance and new recreational programs.|$|E
50|$|The name Alpha Kappa Delta {{was chosen}} by the society's founder Dr. Emory Bogardus. That same year the logo was {{designed}} by Dr. Melvin J. Vincent. In 1924 Gertrude A. Stephens wrote the lyrics to Alpha Kappa Delta's hymn in conjuntcion with Charles H. Gabriel who wrote the music. During the 1930s and 40s the leaders of Alpha Kappa Delta namely Kimball Young, Reed Bain, and L.L. Bernard attempted to increase membership. This effort was tested by World War II which dropped both <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> at organizational meetings. L.L. Bernard lead Alpha Kappa Delta through these trying years until A.B. Hollingshead was elected Alpha Kappa Delta's president in 1948.|$|E

She received national recognition for her preaching, especially to youth. She was a keynote speaker at Youth2007, the international youth conference of the UMC. She was also recognized regionally as the first female minister in North Texas to demonstrate high <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> worship <b>attendance</b> growth while serving as senior pastor of a large church.

Sunrise began to embrace more completely the multicultural community that North Miami Dade was becoming. The membership, however, has not returned to its earlier levels.|$|R
40|$|Christians {{worldwide}} {{listen to}} sermons. Despite {{the decline in}} <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> church <b>attendance</b> in the Western world, many believers still consider going to church as a vital means to maintain their faith in God. These ordinary listeners have been subject of empirical studies for several decades as the empirical turn in practical theology has also influenced the field of homiletics. My study, though, differs from these studies {{in at least three}} respects. ...|$|R

50|$|Medvedow was {{appointed}} Director of the ICA in 1998. Her time as Director is most notable {{for the construction}} of a new ICA building on the Boston waterfront, which has established the ICA as a major cultural institution in Boston and facilitated an enormous growth in museum <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>attendance.</b> Under Medvedow, the ICA took a chance on hiring architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro to design the new museum, offering the now-prominent team their first commission for a building in the United States. The new ICA was the first museum built in Boston in a century and a catalyst for the development of Boston's waterfront. In Medvedow's time as ICA Director, annual attendance at the museum has increased from 25,000 to 280,000. Membership has increased sevenfold.|$|E
5000|$|The Minister and Elders have {{no choice}} but to hurriedly wind up the service and bundle Streetman off to the town's lock up. However, the {{building}} is closed and the marshal has to be called from his home with the keys. Streetman uses the time to get on the radiator of an automobile and make an impassioned speech: [...] "Citizens of Washington County, I'm here today to ask if you if you think there's another man in the entire county who can increase the <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> and double the collection in a church, like the man you are now facing!" [...] and is answered by wild cheers from the crowd. When finally locked up he still makes another rousing speech out of the barred window.|$|E
5000|$|Growing <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> conference <b>attendance</b> {{proved the}} success of the organization. By 1873, [...] "we can see the leaven working which was {{scattered}} at the birth of the National Photographic Association, and the result is most promising. The whole body photographic is feeling its influence in one way or another, and the thirst for more knowledge is very apparent in the increased <b>attendance</b> upon <b>and</b> interest in the annual conventions and exhibitions." ...|$|R
50|$|Membership grew {{steadily}} {{up through}} the middle of the Great Depression; however, <b>membership,</b> revenue, <b>and</b> <b>attendance</b> fell off afterward. In the early 1940s, plans were afoot to close the expensive church and perhaps pool with other congregations to open a combined church elsewhere in the city. However, World War II intervened. During the war, the church converted the gymnasium of the Church House into a dormitory for servicemen who were arriving at Fort Street Union Depot located across Third Street. By the war's end, the church had provided transient accommodations for 60,000 men.|$|R
5000|$|European {{countries}} {{have experienced a}} decline in church <b>membership</b> <b>and</b> church <b>attendance.</b> [...] A relevant example of ongoing trend is Sweden where the church of Sweden, previously the state-church until 2000, claimed to have 82.9% of the Swedish population as its flock in 2000. Surveys showed this had dropped to 72.9% by 2008 and 61.2% by 2016. Moreover, in the 2005 Eurobarometer survey 23% of the Swedish population said that they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force and in the 2010 Eurobarometer survey 34% said the same.|$|R
