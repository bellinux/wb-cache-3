5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in <b>mind,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had never}} {{finished}} high school, {{with the help of}} the GI Bill, Rothenberg completed a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in 1954. He attended graduate school at the University of Chicago, where he was recognized as an argumentative, sometimes abrasive, graduate student with a keen <b>mind.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> graduate student, Rothenberg reviewed W.E.D. Allens Caucasian Battlefields: A History of the Wars on the Turco-Caucasian Border, 1828–1921 (Cambridge University Press, 1953) for Journal of Modern History, He wrote his 1956 masters' thesis entitled General Crook and the Apaches, 1871–1874: the campaign in the Tonto Basin. Rothenberg received his doctorate from the University of Illinois: his 1959 dissertation, Antemurales Christianitatis: then military border in Croatia, 1522–1749, was published in 1960 by the University of Chicago Press, as The Military Border in Croatia, 1522–1749; he followed this with a second study, The Military Border in Croatia, 1750–1888: a study of an imperial institution in 1966, also published by University of Chicago Press. Both volumes were translated into German in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Walker finally meets Konrad at his penthouse. Konrad {{appears to}} be the charismatic, villainous force behind the atrocities that Walker was hoping for, until Walker finds his {{decaying}} corpse on the penthouse deck. Walker finds that Konrad committed suicide after his failed evacuation effort, and he has been communicating with a traumatic hallucinatory Konrad, created in his <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dissociative disorder upon the aftermath of the white phosphorus strike. Rationalizing the actions he had witnessed and carried out, Walker distorted many subsequent events of the game to make Konrad look responsible. With this revelation, 'Konrad' forces Walker, at gunpoint, to decide once and for all if he is to blame for his actions in Dubai.|$|E

25|$|I must, however, {{make clear}} what I mean by Judaism; I mean neither a race nor a people nor a {{recognised}} creed.

25|$|Early on in {{his second}} term as Taoiseach, Lynch decided that he would not lead Fianna Fáil into another general {{election}} campaign. The date of January 1980 was in his <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> retirement date, however nothing had been made definite. It was during this time, due to a combination of a large parliamentary majority and the search for a new leader, when party discipline began to break down.|$|E
25|$|When {{the news}} reached Europe, Christians were horrified and Pope Sergius IV sent a {{circular}} letter to all churches {{calling for a}} holy fight in the Middle East and expulsion of Muslims from the Holy land. The events would later be recalled by Pope Urban II in his preaching for the Crusade at Clermont. Although the crusades happened almost a century after the desecration and caused by various other complex political intrigues, it was {{still very much in}} the public <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cause.

25|$|The {{concept of}} mind is {{understood}} {{in many different}} ways by many different cultural and religious traditions. Some see <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. panpsychism and animism), to animals and to deities. Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit) to theories concerning both life after death, and cosmological and natural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster, the Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greek, Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval European philosophers.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Z07 {{had been}} designed with production in <b>mind.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, practical and regulatory considerations necessitated very few changes for the production model. Nevertheless, the windshield of the Z8 was extended upward, and a larger front airdam was fitted. Both changes were implemented to provide aerodynamic stability and a reasonably placid cockpit environment. The four-spoke steering wheel of the concept car {{was replaced by a}} three spoke design. The hardtop was changed from a double-bubble form with a tapering faring to a single dome with a truncated convex backside. The concept's exotic driver's side helmet fairing was eliminated to allow easy operation of the power soft top.|$|E
25|$|The final {{decades of}} the 20th century have seen {{the rise of a}} new {{interdisciplinary}} approach to studying human psychology, known collectively as cognitive science. Cognitive science again considers the <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subject for investigation, using the tools of psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and neurobiology. New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain, such as PET scans and CAT scans, began to exert their influence as well, leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain, rather than cognition. These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as artificial intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Leavis {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} the 'third realm' <b>as</b> <b>a</b> name for the method of existence of literature; works which are not private like a dream or public in the sense of something that can be tripped over, but exist in human <b>minds</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> work of collaborative re-constitution.|$|R

25|$|Boulez had in <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{model the}} Bauhaus, which had {{provided}} {{a meeting place}} for artists and scientists of all disciplines. IRCAM's aims would include research into acoustics, instrumental design {{and the use of}} computers in composition. The original building was constructed underground, partly to isolate it acoustically (an above-ground extension was added later). The institution was criticised for absorbing too much state subsidy, Boulez for wielding too much power. At the same time Boulez founded the Ensemble Intercontemporain, a virtuoso ensemble which specialised in the performance of twentieth-century music and the creation of new works. Around this time he bought an apartment on the 30th floor of a building at 21-25 Quai André Citroën in the Front de Seine district of Paris.|$|E
25|$|Gable {{made three}} {{pictures}} with Spencer Tracy, which boosted Tracy's career and cemented {{them in the}} public <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> team. San Francisco (1936) featured Tracy in a brief but Oscar-nominated role in which he played a priest who knocks Gable, by then the studio's foremost leading man, down in a boxing ring. Despite being onscreen for only 17 minutes, the appearance immediately catapulted Tracy, whose career had floundered for years despite delivering superb performances in quality films, into major stardom {{in the wake of}} the picture becoming the year's biggest box-office attraction. Test Pilot (1938) gave Tracy a larger supporting part as the agonizing friend of Gable's glamorous pilot while Boom Town (1940) depicted an epic rivalry between Gable and Tracy's characters and their oil businesses. Each pairing was a box-office phenomenon. MGM had teamed Tracy with Gable every two years until Tracy finally insisted upon a star billing clause in his contract, ending any further Gable-Tracy collaborations.|$|E
25|$|It was however at Her Majesty's, London on 20 May 1851, {{that she}} and Reeves won very great acclaim for their Fidelio, the first of five {{performances}} which established her in the public <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> leading tragédienne: critics compared her with her great predecessors in the role, Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient and Maria Malibran. Gardoni and Calzolari led the Chorus of Prisoners. For this production, musical recitatives were composed by Michael Balfe imitating Beethoven's style, pointing {{the content of the}} dialogue with motifs drawn from the principal arias. Most appreciated them, but James William Davison, critic of The Times, was angered because he claimed that Cruvelli had altered the music 'in {{such a way as to}} bring it within range of mediocre capabilities.' Chorley, never an admirer, thought this was the turning-point, where her decline began. Then three performances of Norma, in which Cruvelli gave herself free rein, generated much enthusiasm in London. Cruvelli sang at Buckingham Palace on 7 June 1851, and was invited again the following year.|$|E

500|$|Rejection of a {{permanent}} agent {{eventually led to the}} philosophical problems of the seeming continuity of mind and also of explaining how rebirth and karma continue to be relevant doctrines without an eternal mind. This challenge was met by the Theravāda school by introducing the concept of <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> factor of existence. This [...] "life-stream" [...] (Bhavanga-sota) is an undercurrent [...] forming the condition of being. The continuity of a karmic [...] "person" [...] is therefore assured {{in the form of a}} mindstream (citta-santana), a series of flowing mental moments arising from the subliminal life-continuum mind (Bhavanga-citta), mental content, and attention.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Mason {{also takes}} her charges to visit models of virtue, such as Mrs. Trueman, who, though poor, still manages to be {{charitable}} and a comfort to her family.
