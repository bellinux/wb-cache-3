2500|$|Rousey has {{discussed}} how she dealt with body {{image in the}} past and her struggle with it. She explained, [...] "When I was in school, martial arts made you a dork, and I became self-conscious that I was too masculine. I was a 16-year-old girl with ringworm and cauliflower ears. People made fun of <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> called me 'Miss Man'. It wasn't until I got older that I realized: these people are idiots. I'm fabulous." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "In {{the second}} act... I came on {{carrying}} a monkey... On opening night, the monkey went berserk... (he) snatched my black wig from my head, leaped from <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> scampered {{down to the}} footlights. There he paused, peered out at the audience, then waved my wig over his head... The audience had been giggling at the absurd plot even before this simian had at me. Now it became hysterical. What did Tallulah do in this crisis? I turned a cartwheel! The audience roared... After the monkey business I was afraid they might boo me. Instead I received an ovation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chase J. Nielsen, {{one of the}} U.S. airmen {{who flew}} in the Doolittle raid {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors. At their trial for war crimes following the war, he testified [...] "Well, I was put on my back {{on the floor with}} <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> legs stretched out, one guard holding each limb. The towel was wrapped around my face and put across my face and water poured on. They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation, then they would let up until I'd get my breath, then they'd start over again... I felt more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death." [...] In 2007, Senator John McCain claimed that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II. A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years.|$|E
2500|$|The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh {{arrived in}} England on 7 March 1874. The town of Windsor was {{decorated}} in their honour, with Union Jacks and Russian flags, and Maria {{was given a}} great welcome by the waiting crowds. Queen Victoria met them at the South-Western Station and recorded their arrival in her journal: [...] "I took dear Marie in <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> kissed her warmly several times. I was quite nervous and trembling, so long had I been in expectation ... Dear Marie has a very friendly manner, a pleasant face, beautiful skin and fine bright eyes ... She speaks English wonderfully well." [...] Later on, [...] Queen Victoria described her new daughter-in-law as [...] "most pleasing natural, unaffected and civil" [...] even if [...] "she was not pretty or graceful and held herself badly". [...] "I have formed a high opinion of her," [...] Queen Victoria reported, impressed with [...] "her wonderfully even, cheerful, satisfied temper – her kind and indulgent disposition, free from bigotry and intolerance, and her serious, intelligent mind – so entirely free from everything fast – and so full of occupation and interest in everything, makes her a most agreeable companion. Everyone must like her." [...] The queen also noted that Marie was [...] "not a bit afraid of Affie and I hope will have the very best influence upon him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pittsburgh got {{the ball}} back on their own 22-yard line with 2:37 {{left in the game}} and two timeouts remaining. On their first play, a holding penalty pushed them back 10 yards. Roethlisberger then {{completed}} a pass to Holmes for 14 yards. After an incompletion, Roethlisberger threw it to Holmes again for a first down. An 11-yard reception by Nate Washington followed, and a 4-yard run by Roethlisberger forced the Steelers to burn their first timeout. On the very next play, he completed a pass to Holmes, who took it 40 yards to the Cardinals' 6-yard line after safety Aaron Francisco fell down. Two plays later, Roethlisberger found Mewelde Moore covered in the flat, then Ward covered. He looked and then threw to Holmes, who ran a flag route in the right corner. Holmes caught the pass in the back corner of the end zone for a touchdown, managing to land with his toes inbounds before falling out of bounds. [...] "My feet never left the ground," [...] said Holmes. [...] "All I did was extend <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> use my toes as an extension to catch up to the ball." [...] After a booth review, the touchdown pass stood. Reed's ensuing extra point put the Steelers in front 27–23 with 35 seconds remaining. Following the ensuing kickoff, Warner completed a 20-yard pass to Fitzgerald and a 13-yarder to J. J. Arrington, moving the ball to the Steelers 44. With 15 seconds left, Warner prepared to attempt a Hail Mary pass, but linebacker LaMarr Woodley forced a fumble while sacking Warner. Defensive end Brett Keisel recovered the fumble, giving the ball back to Pittsburgh with five seconds left. [...] Many viewers assumed that the play had not been reviewed for a possible incomplete pass, but NFL Head of Officiating Mike Pereira later explained that it actually was reviewed, unnoticed by the public: [...] "We confirmed it was a fumble. The replay assistant in the replay booth saw it was clearly a fumble. The ball got knocked loose and was rolling in his hand before it started forward. He has to have total control." [...] It was the first and only Super Bowl in which Warner was involved not to be decided on the final play of the game. Roethlisberger took a knee, securing the Steelers' sixth Super Bowl victory and surpassing the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers to set a new NFL record for most Super Bowl wins by a team.|$|E
60|$|He put {{his hand}} through <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> walked with {{me up and down}} the lawn.|$|R
60|$|He ran {{his fingers}} down <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> back, and then rang the hall bell violently.|$|R

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
60|$|She lay in <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> I {{thought for}} a moment she had fainted.|$|E
60|$|She swung {{herself down}} into <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> stood beside me face to face.|$|E
60|$|She {{clung to}} <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> pulled at <b>my</b> coat {{in a perfect}} frenzy of fear.|$|R
60|$|I was {{a little}} startled. She laid her hand on <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> sank her voice to a whisper.|$|R
60|$|We {{were walking}} very close together. I felt her fingers {{suddenly}} upon <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> her soft breath upon my cheek.|$|R
60|$|I recoiled before {{contemplation of}} that frightful death, {{and for a}} moment I entertained the wild idea of seizing Maud in <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> leaping overboard. Then I {{resolved}} to wait, and at the last moment, when we entered on the final stretch, to take her in <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> proclaim my love, and, with her in my embrace, to make the desperate struggle and die.|$|E
60|$|She {{slipped from}} <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> paused, {{regarding}} me. For an instant {{the world seemed}} full of fantastic possibilities.|$|E
60|$|She turned away, half-laughing, half-crying; but I {{caught her}} in <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> crushed her sweet lips against mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "High Jack grabs <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> walls {{his eyes}} at me. Just then he looked more like his eminent co-Indian murderer, Crazy Horse.|$|R
60|$|My uncle {{placed his}} hand upon <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> led me slowly towards the gateway, through which my cousin Sibylle had already passed.|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] I cried out, {{in such a}} tone of {{astonished}} indignation that Monna Giuliana seized <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> {{pressed it}} to enjoin prudence.|$|R
60|$|We {{exchanged}} no greetings. She slid {{from her}} saddle into <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> for one instant I held her.|$|E
60|$|Hearing his cry, {{the woman}} came back. A comely, healthy-looking woman. She took him from <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> comforted him.|$|E
60|$|I {{astonished}} {{my little}} American friend by taking her {{then and there}} in <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> giving her my first kiss.|$|E
60|$|I strolled away by myself, waiting. Suddenly, I felt a {{light touch}} on <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and,</b> looking round, I found Lord Langerdale by my side.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} walk will do you good, Harry," [...] {{answered}} Dick kindly. [...] "Here, take <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> Songbird {{can take your}} other arm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All by yourself, Milly?" [...] exclaimed Cecil, {{letting go}} <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> moving to her side. [...] "In tears, too, I believe! No news, I suppose?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then I folded <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> {{stared at}} the statue's stony eyes, which stared back at me, while all the people gasped.|$|E
60|$|Now but for {{the respect}} in which I held her, I could have taken the pretty Duchesse in <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> kissed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "That infamous Laporte," [...] {{she broke}} in, horrified. [...] "He would snatch my sick child from <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> throw {{him to the}} guillotine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pip," [...] said Mr. Jaggers, laying {{his hand}} upon <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> smiling openly, [...] "this man {{must be the}} most cunning impostor in all London." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently Tobin grabs <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> says, excited: [...] "Jawn," [...] says he, [...] "do ye {{know what}} we're doing? We're taking a voyage upon the water." ...|$|R
60|$|The chance-passengers in {{the street}} began to pause and look at us. I offered Minna <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> asked {{permission}} to attend her on the way home.|$|R
