We are interested in genus one curves given as double covers of P 1, plane cubics, or complete intersections of two quadrics in P 3. By minimising such a curve we mean making the invariants associated to its defining equations as small as possible using a suitable change of coordinates. We study <b>the</b> non-uniqueness <b>of</b> <b>minimisations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus one curves described above. To achieve this goal we investigate models of genus one curves over Henselian discrete valuation rings. We give geometric criteria which relate these models to the minimal proper regular models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jacobian elliptic curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus one curves above. We perform explicit computations on <b>the</b> special fibers <b>of</b> minimal proper regular models of elliptic curves.
