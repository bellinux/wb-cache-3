The goal {{of this study is to}} introduce and demonstrate the feasibility of a new concept in <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> that is centered on cellular phone technology and which may provide a solution to <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> in underserved areas. The new system replaces the conventional stand alone <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> device with a new <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> system made of two independent components connected through cellular phone technology. The independent units are: a) a data acquisition device (DAD) at a remote patient site that is simple with limited controls and no image display capability and b) an advanced image reconstruction and hardware control multiserver unit at a central site. The cellular phone technology transmits unprocessed raw data from the patient site DAD and recieves and displays the processed image from the central site. (This is different from conventional telemedicine where the image reconstruction and control is at the patient site and telecommunication is used to transmit processed images from the patient site). The primary goal of this study is to demonstrate that the cellular phone technology can function in the proposed mode. The feasibility of the concept is demonstrated using a new frequency divisions multiplexing electrical impedance tomography system, which we have developed for dynamic <b>medical</b> <b>imaging,</b> as the <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> modality.

40|$|Optical {{detection}} within diffuse {{media is}} a relatively new field whereby low energy photons are used to determine the internal structure of highly scattering media. The primary driving forces for this technology are <b>medical</b> <b>imaging,</b> <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostics,</b> and remote sensing. Use of low energy photons (typically visible and near IR) is not only safer than other traditional methods {{such as the use of}} x-rays, but can potentially supply a wealth of information about tissue structure and composition not available using conventional means. This research is aimed at two primary methods of diffuse optical detection. The first, speckle-based imaging, relies on the loss of coherence as photons traverse the multitude of random paths through the scattering medium. By imaging the speckle at the output of the medium, detection of heterogeneities is possible through various statistical methods. The second technique, Raman spectroscopy, relies on the nonlinear interaction between photons and matter to distinguish compositional differences within the matter. Molecules exhibiting distinct Raman 2 ̆ 2 signatures 2 ̆ 2 are detectable through lasers of scattering media, allowing for detection of distinct molecules within. This detection is useful in localizing objects having finite support, or determining relative concentrations of a dispersed species such as glucose. ...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{detectors}} {{are used}} {{in a number of}} areas, namely in astronomy, microscopy, <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>diagnostic,</b> biological science and material analysis. Demand is rising significantly within the industry for X-ray detectors that do not require a cooling system, e. g. pin-diode detectors. The elimination of the cooling system will facilitate the design of portable detectors. Development of this technology opens opportunities for the design of new instruments and the manufacture of more specialist detectors for customised applications. The rapid progress of the semiconductor industry has enabled the construction of more sophisticated electronic devices. This progress has also resulted in the creation of simulation tools, which enable researchers to simulate the processing of their devices. This method is more time and cost efficient as different models can be tested before actually investing in device processing in a laboratory. For this project we have used Silvaco simulation tools and packages to design nine different pin-diode X-ray detectors and evaluated their electrical performance before manufacturing them. Microfabrication technology has also been employed to make the pin-diode X-ray detectors that are capable of simultaneously detecting low X-ray energies (< 10 keV) and measure the radiation energies with high sensitivity, speed and resolution. The X- ray detectors have been manufactured using the University of Surrey's cleanroom and laboratories. This project is run as a Knowledge Transfer Partnership scheme in partnership with e 2 V Scientific Instruments (e 2 Vsi). To improve efficiency and productivity in industry, recent years have seen increased collaboration between industry and academia. New technologies have been commercialised with varying degrees of success and new applications have emerged, also benefiting academic research. e 2 Vsi is a manufacturing company specialising in the design, development and production of high resolution semiconductor X-ray detectors and the project objectives are therefore closely aligned with industry's needs...|$|R
40|$|Inside the `cavernous sinus` or `parasellar region` {{the human}} {{internal}} carotid artery takes {{the shape of a}} siphon that is twisted and torqued in three dimensions and surrounded by a network of veins. The parasellar section of the {{internal carotid artery}} is of broad biological and medical interest, as its peculiar shape is associated with temperature regulation in the brain and correlated with the occurrence of vascular pathologies. The present study aims to provide anatomical descriptions and objective mathematical characterizations of the shape of the parasellar section of the internal carotid artery in human infants and its modifications during ontogeny. Three-dimensional (3 D) computer models of the parasellar section of the internal carotid artery of infants were generated with a state-of-the-art 3 D reconstruction method and analysed using both traditional morphometric methods and novel mathematical algorithms. We show that four constant, demarcated bends can be described along the infant parasellar section of the internal carotid artery, and we provide measurements of their angles. We further provide calculations of the curvature and torsion energy, and the total complexity of the 3 D skeleton of the parasellar section of the internal carotid artery, and compare the complexity of this in infants and adults. Finally, we examine the relationship between shape parameters of the parasellar section of the internal carotid artery in infants, and the occurrence of intima cushions, and evaluate the reliability of subjective angle measurements for characterizing the complexity of the parasellar section of the internal carotid artery in infants. The results can serve as objective reference data for comparative studies and for <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> They also form the basis for a new hypothesis that explains the mechanisms responsible for the ontogenetic transformation {{in the shape of the}} parasellar section of the internal carotid artery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{interpretation}} of medical images is almost exclusively made by specialized physicians.

Assisted {{interpretation of}} medical images has become one of the major research subjects in <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> and <b>diagnostic</b> radiology. From a methodological point of view, the main attraction for the resolution of this kind of problem arises from the combination of the image reading made by the radiologists, with the results obtained from using Artificial Intelligence based applications that will contribute to the reduction and eventually the elimination of perception errors. This article describes how machine learning algorithms can help distinguish normal readings in brain Computed Tomography from all its variations.

40|$|Purpose: All the European {{member states}} have {{to collect data}} on patient dose from <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imaging.</b> This {{information}} contributes to making conscious choices in medical practice, taking into account the risks and benefits of the use of radiation. The Netherlands collects this information on a yearly base to show the development in medical radiation exposure. Materials & Methods: This study was held among all the Dutch hospitals and institutions that use medical radiation applications (N= 131). Information about the amount of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imaging</b> examinations was gathered with a yearly online questionnaire. The effective patient dose per examination was based on former national patient dose studies. The effective dose per caput was calculated by combining the amount of examinations with the dose per examination. Results: In 2014, the mean effective dose per caput in the Netherlands due to <b>medical</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imaging</b> was 1 mSv. This can be divided in four categories: CT examinations, radiology examinations, nuclear medicine and <b>diagnostic</b> <b>imaging</b> outside the hospital. The category that contributes the most is CT-examinations with 0. 59 mSv. Among CT examinations, the largest contribution is of CT-Abdomen. Within radiology, angiography has the highest effective dose per caput, 0. 11 mSv, due to the high dose per examination. Conclusions: The mean radiation dose per caput due to medical radiation exposure in the Netherlands has increased per year from 0. 52 mSv in 2002 to 1 mSv in 2014. The main cause of the increase in dose is the increasing numbers of CT examinations. However, a smaller increase is seen since 2010...|$|R
