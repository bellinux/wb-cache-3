50|$|A <b>mutual</b> <b>mistake</b> {{occurs when}} the parties to a {{contract}} are both mistaken about the same material fact within their contract. They are at cross-purposes. There is {{a meeting of the}} minds, but the parties are mistaken. Hence the contract is voidable. Collateral mistakes will not afford the right of rescission. A collateral mistake is one that 'does not go to the heart' of the contract. For a <b>mutual</b> <b>mistake</b> to be void, then the item the parties are mistaken about must be material (emphasis added). When there is a material mistake about a material aspect of the contract, the essential purpose of the contract, {{there is the question of}} the assumption of the risk. Who has the risk contractually? Who bears the risk by custom? Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 154 deals with this scenario.|$|R

2500|$|Walker {{was also}} a cattle breeder and was party to a famous {{contracts}} case, Sherwood v. Walker, known as [...] "The Pregnant-Cow Case". (33 N.W. 919 (Mich. 1887).) According to the majority opinion, Walker agreed with Theodore Sherwood, a banker, to sell him a cow of distinguished ancestry known as [...] "Rose 2d of Aberlone". The price was $80, both parties believing Rose to be sterile. When Walker discovered {{that she was pregnant}} and worth between $750 and $1,000, he refused to deliver her. Sherwood sued and prevailed in the trial court, but lost on appeal. This case illustrates the contract law rules of rescission of contract by <b>mutual</b> <b>mistake.</b> Because both parties believed they were contracting for a sterile cow, there was a <b>mutual</b> <b>mistake</b> of fact, and therefore ground for rescission. [...] However, the dissent in the case, written by Justice Sherwood, notes that Sherwood believed that Rose [...] "might be made to breed" [...] and purchased her on that chance.|$|R

5000|$|In this case, {{both parties}} {{believed}} there was a [...] "meeting of the minds," [...] but discovered that they were each mistaken about the other party's different meaning.

50|$|A {{common mistake}} differs from a {{unilateral}} or a <b>mutual</b> <b>mistake</b> {{in that it}} does not lead to dissensus, but nonetheless results in a contract's being void: Both parties make the same mistake, with the important proviso that the mistake does not relate to the intention of either party; in fact, the parties completely agree, but are both mistaken about some underlying and fundamental fact relating to the past or present. For a common error to have an effect on a contract, it must qualify as a term of the contract, either expressly or tacitly, by implication.|$|R

50|$|At first, {{professional}} discussion primarily centred {{round the}} question of the effectiveness of Tandem in comparison with traditional language teaching methodologies.

Results showed that the Tandem participants got better results in listening comprehension and speaking skills while they were less successful in reading and writing, even if their performance in the certificate as a whole was just as good as the control group. Another advantage was <b>mutual</b> <b>mistake</b> correction, which was fostered by increased language intake.|$|R
