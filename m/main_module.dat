25|$|Partitioning is {{a process}} of {{dividing}} the chip into small blocks. This is done mainly to separate different functional blocks and also to make placement and routing easier. Partitioning can be done in the RTL design phase when the design engineer partitions the entire design into sub-blocks and then proceeds to design each module. These modules are linked together in the <b>main</b> <b>module</b> called the TOP LEVEL module. This kind of partitioning is commonly referred to as Logical Partitioning.|$|E
