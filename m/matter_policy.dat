The stability, predictability and strength of LS from each approach are evaluated using cases from European electricity market.

The paper concludes that LS from EMD do not always <b>matter.</b> <b>Policy</b> makers {{should be aware of}} the many factors influencing generation investments when setting up or changing an EMD and assess the potential of the envisaged incentives in relation with other incentives within and outside the EMD. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Food {{production}} systems in south-east Africa face a persistent puzzle: despite {{the implementation of}} numerous plausible food availability policies, the region’s history is characterised by many cases of food {{production systems}} that have underperformed by not feeding the relevant population. This puzzle is addressed by investigating {{the dynamics of the}} region’s food production systems. A theory-based framework is proposed to describe the interaction of biological and socio-economic processes that determine the availability of food calories. The framework is translated into a formal model and computer simulation used to analyse its dynamics in a population growth scenario together with different policy interventions. The results suggest three key concepts for understanding the performance of food production systems: stock management of soil organic <b>matter,</b> <b>policy</b> effort threshold, and land use anticipation. These concepts constitute theoretical approaches to explaining how dynamic interactions can create the puzzle of potentially beneficial policies failing to provide enough food calories...|$|E
40|$|The growing global {{competition}} in which knowledge {{is a prime}} factor for economic growth is increasingly shaping policies and setting {{the agenda for the}} future of European higher education. With its aim to become the world’s leading knowledge economy, the European Union is concerned about its performance in the knowledge sector, in particular in the nexus of research, higher education institutions, and innovation. A major concern is to solve the “European paradox”: whereby Europe has the necessary knowledge and research, but fails to transfer this into innovation and enhanced productivity and economic growth. Further complicating the <b>matter,</b> <b>policy</b> responses are formulated and implemented at different levels within the EU: at the European-wide level, the national, regional, and institutional levels. Moreover, the formulation of policies are often underpinned by different perceptions of the meaning of globalization, the nature of {{global competition}} for the higher education sector, and by differences in the current ability of institutions to effectively promote innovation in the private sector. This paper offers an overview of relevant European higher education policies and responses to global competition, and considers how global competitiveness can best be stimulated and achieved; what rol...|$|E
