Other writings by Sharpe were published in The Builder and The Architect. [...] He also delivered papers to the Architectural Association, and to the Royal Institute of British Architects.

Between January 1874 and February 1875 Sharpe published The Architecture of the Cistercians, which dealt in considerable detail with the design and functions of Cistercian monasteries built in the 12th and 13thcenturies in Britain and in Europe, most of which he had visited.
