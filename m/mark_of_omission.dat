5000|$|Aubrey {{approached}} {{the work of}} the biographer much as his contemporary scientists had begun to approach the work of empirical research by the assembly of vast museums and small collection cabinets. Collating as much information as he could, he left the task of verification largely to Wood, and thereafter to posterity. As a hanger-on in great houses, he had little time and little inclination for systematic work, and he wrote the [...] "Lives" [...] in the early morning while his hosts were sleeping off the effects of the night before. These texts were, as Aubrey entitled them, Schediasmata, [...] "pieces written extempore, {{on the spur of the}} moment". Time after time, he leaves <b>marks</b> <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> in the form of dashes and ellipses for dates and facts, inserting fresh information whenever it is presented to him. The margins of his notebooks are dotted with notes-to-self, most frequently the Latin [...] "quaere". This exhortation, to [...] "go and find out" [...] is often followed. In his life of Thomas Harcourt, Aubrey notes that one Roydon, a brewer living in Southwark, was reputed to be in possession of Harcourt's petrified kidney: [...] "I have seen it", he writes approvingly; [...] "he much values it".|$|R

The three younger young ladies had gone to Hythe, said the housemaid, with a <b>marked</b> <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> the Sea Lady. Melville has an intense dislike of questioning servants on points at issue, so he asked nothing at all concerning Miss Waters. This general absence {{of people from the}} room of familiar occupation conveyed the same suggested warning of crisis as the telegram. The housemaid waited an instant longer and withdrew.|$|R

The study was a case study which used a qualitative approach. The data were obtained from 32 students’ written texts and in-depth interviews. The {{data were analyzed using}} two techniques, namely the quantitative descriptive technique and qualitative descriptive technique. The quantitative descriptive technique consisted of four steps: identification, classification and localization, counting, and description. The results are as follows. (1) four categories of errors were found in the students’ written texts, consisting <b>of</b> <b>omission,</b> addition, selection, and misordering. (a) there are seven kinds <b>of</b> <b>omission</b> errors in the form <b>of</b> plural forms, <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> to be, <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> articles, <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> prepositions, <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> words, <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> auxiliary verbs, and <b>omission</b> <b>of</b> apostrophe as possessive noun markers; (b) three kinds of addition errors in the form of regularization, redundancy and simple addition; (c) six kinds of selection errors in the form of misselection of word, misselection of word form, misselection of preposition, misselection of article, incorrect use of verb form, and the last is incorrect use of to be; (d) 18 errors in the form of misordering errors. Furthermore, from 396 errors found, 2 errors were global errors. (2) selection errors occur most frequently (52. 7...|$|R
