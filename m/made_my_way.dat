500|$|At the {{suggestion}} of manager Lenny Poncher and Hassinger, The Electric Prunes agreed to record a concept album that integrated Gregorian music into psychedelic pop, with the belief it would launch them into commercial success. Poncher recruited David Axelrod, a formally neo-classically trained musician, to compose all of the material for the project. The result, Mass in F Minor, was a complex arrangement of religious-based rock, which was sung entirely in Latin. Although the band did record the songs [...] "Kyrie Eleison", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Credo", the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group. As a consequence, Hassinger enlisted the Canadian group, The Collectors, among other session musicians, in completing the album, although Lowe, Tulin, and Weakley did contribute to every track. Mass in F Minor was released in January 1968 and reached number 135 on the Billboard 200. An eerie version of the opening track, [...] "Kyrie Eleison", became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film, Easy Rider. The Electric Prunes performed with the new songs in concert just once, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which Tulin described: [...] "From the outset the performance was a disaster. We missed the intro on the first song and it never got any better. Amp speakers blew, charts fell off music stands and everyone was, in general, in a complete state of confusion. Ended up each song turned into one long jam. I think we were, at times, {{all in the same}} key. I <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> over to the four celli and four French horns and told them to 'jam in E.' Somehow we would hit a break and James would manage a vocal". As a result of financial and musical issues, Weakley and Lowe left the group in early 1968. Tulin and Williams finished a tour with a line-up that also included Kenny Loggins and Jeremy Stuart, but by mid-1968 they too departed the group.|$|E

60|$|Oh, never, never, never shall I {{forget the}} emotion this letter caused in the house!

Not that I would have had them less sorry--I am afraid not; but the pleasure of it, and the pain of it, and the pride and joy of it, and the humble regret of it were so blended that my heart seemed almost breaking while {{it was full of}} rapture.|$|R

It has been a great piece of luck for him getting out here as General Stewart's aide-de-camp, but I know the general is a friend of my father, and that {{accounts}} for it. Perhaps this sergeant is my father. I did not seem to mind the thought before. I did not even know whether he was alive, and never really faced it; and yet, if Sergeant Bowen is to be my father, he is as good as another. He seems a fine fellow, and has had no hand in this fraud. I ought, indeed, to think myself lucky; for he is steady and respectable, a good soldier, and I can see liked by the officers as well as the men. It was curious that he should have taken a fancy to me.|$|R
60|$|I {{drove to}} the address given me on the paper. It was an odd, half-forgotten street, {{terminating}} in a cul-de-sac, and {{not far from the}} river. The few houses it contained were larger than the majority of those in the neighborhood, but were in a shocking state of repair. The one at which I eventually stopped had a timber yard adjoining, or rather attached to it. I left the taxicab outside, and <b>made</b> <b>my</b> somewhat uncertain <b>way</b> up to the front door. Only a few yards from me a great black dog was straining at his collar and barking furiously. I was somewhat relieved when the door was opened immediately at my knock.|$|R

60|$|A hint {{of winter}} in the autumn air made me {{remember}} the remorseless winds and the iron earth over which the snows swept as if across an icy polar sea. I shuddered as I thought of again fighting <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to that desolate little cabin in McPherson County. I recalled but dimly the exultation with which I had <b>made</b> <b>my</b> claim.

40|$|I {{accompanied}} my mother, Angela Domino, to Methodist Hospital last Friday for {{a breast}} surgery performed by Melissa Lazar, MD. I {{just wanted you}} to know how wonderful our experience was, and I place much of that credit on your employees’ personal efforts at keeping my mother calm, and supported. At 84, my mom was apprehensive about trusting a new surgeon AND a new hospital. Dr. Lazar is a fantastic combination of intelligence; skill and a fast and strong ability to form a bond that <b>made</b> <b>my</b> mother give <b>way</b> her fears. Mom went from great apprehension to complete trust, and I am so grateful for this. My experience at Methodist reminded me of my years in private practice, when I admitted patients to a suburban community hospital, where everyone knew and cared for each other.

60|$|I had an unconquerable repugnance {{to return}} to my chamber; so I found <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to the butler's quarters, <b>made</b> <b>my</b> toilet {{in the best way}} {{circumstances}} would permit, and {{was among the first to}} appear at the breakfast table. Our breakfast was a substantial fox-hunter's repast, and the company were generally assembled at it. When ample justice had been done to the tea, coffee, cold meats, and humming ale, for all these were furnished in abundance, according to the tastes of the different guests, the conversation began to break out, with all the liveliness and freshness of morning mirth.|$|R
