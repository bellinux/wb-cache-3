Principal photography began in November 2008, and concluded in February 2009; filming took place on locations in Hong Kong and Macau, with a crew mainly based in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Totti {{intended}} {{to retire from}} international football after the 2006 World Cup, but reneged on his decision and remained undecided on his future for over a year, not being called up in the meantime. He made his retirement official on 20 July 2007, {{at the beginning of}} the 2007–08 Serie A season, due to recurring physical problems and in order to focus solely on club play with Roma. Italy's coach at the time, Roberto Donadoni, attempted to get Totti to change his <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remaining Euro 2008 qualifiers but was not successful.|$|E

5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{the issue of}} his playing future, Miller was back in a good frame of <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Test in Adelaide. In a high-scoring match, Miller took a wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. England batted first and had reached a strong position of 4/320 {{on the second day}} when Miller bowled Joe Hardstaff junior, who edged a bouncer into his stumps for 67, ending a partnership of 118 with centurion Compton; the hosts lost wickets steadily thereafter to be dismissed for 460, and Miller ended with 1/45 from 16 overs in extreme heat. After Morris and Hassett put on 179 runs for the third wicket, Miller came in at 3/207 late on the third day and reached 33 by the time stumps were drawn with Australia at 4/293, while his partner Johnson was unbeaten on 35.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{discussed}} {{plans with}} his subordinates to integrate {{at least the}} German-speaking parts of Switzerland completely {{with the rest of}} Germany, and had several persons in <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> post of a Reichskommissar for the 're-union' of Switzerland with the German Reich (in analogy to the office that Josef Bürckel held after Austria's absorption into Germany during the Anschluss). Later this official was to subsequently become the new Reichsstatthalter of the area after completing its total assimilation. In August 1940, Gauleiter of Westfalen-South Josef Wagner and the Minister President of Baden Walter Köhler spoke in favor of the amalgamation of Switzerland to Reichsgau Burgund (see below) and suggested that the seat of government for this new administrative territory should be the dormant Palais des Nations in Geneva.|$|E

5|$|Matthews was {{appointed}} general manager at Stoke's rivals Port Vale in July 1965, alongside good friend Jackie Mudie; Matthews was unpaid, though was given expenses. The pair {{had a plan}} of bringing through talented schoolboys and selling one or two off every so often to improve the club's bleak financial picture, whilst {{at the same time}} advancing through the leagues; in his autobiography he said that what Dario Gradi later achieved at Crewe Alexandra is what he had in <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Vale. Matthews concentrated his search in North East England and Central Scotland, where he discovered talented striker Mick Cullerton, though overlooked a teenage Ray Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Off the pitch, Miller privately {{decided that}} he would not honour his Rawtenstall contract. He {{secretly}} accepted an offer to relocate to Sydney to work as a liquor salesman and play cricket. Back in a good frame of <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Test in Adelaide, Miller took one wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. After England had made 460, Miller came in at 3/207, and was 23 not out by the close of the second day. He hit the first ball of the next day for six, and accumulated 67 runs in the opening 71 minutes, to reach his maiden Test century. The Englishmen utilised leg theory to prevent easy scoring, but as the tail began to be dismissed, Miller accelerated, launching drives into the crowd, despite the presence of four men on the fence. Miller ended unbeaten on 141 but the match petered out into a high-scoring draw. Before the last Test, Miller played for Victoria against England, taking 4/65.|$|E
5|$|The various {{agencies}} {{that participated in}} Operation PBHistory had different aims in <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> products of the operation.

The agents in charge of the operation were expected to balance these various interests: however, as the organization behind the operation, the CIA had veto power over any public use. The work done by the PBHistory team assisted two existing CIA operations, Operation Kufire and Operation Kugown, both of which had been a part of Operation PBSUCCESS.|$|E

5|$|Khanna acted {{opposite}} Akshay Kumar in two action films: International Khiladi and Zulmi (both 1999). In {{the former}} {{she played a}} news reporter {{who falls in love}} with a criminal whom she interviews. Both performed poorly at the box office. She was paired with Daggubati Venkatesh in the Telugu film Seenu (1999). Khanna played the lead role in Baadshah (1999), featuring Shah Rukh Khan as a detective. In the same year, she acted opposite Saif Ali Khan in Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan, a romantic comedy directed by Mahesh Bhatt. She was paired opposite Aamir Khan in Dharmesh Darshan's Mela (2000). Similar to The Seven Samurai in story, it was an average grosser at the box office. In October 1999, along with Juhi Chawla, Shah Rukh and Salman Khan, she performed at Awesome Foursome concert held as Shah Alam Outdoor Stadium, Malaysia. Chal Mere Bhai (2000) featured her in a special appearance beside a leading role in the comedy Joru Ka Ghulam, opposite Govinda. She also acted in the David Dhawan-directed comedy Jodi No.1 (2001). Her acting in the film met with poor reviews. Film director Karan Johar admitted in an interview that Khanna was in his <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role of Tina in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, but she refused it, and thus Rani Mukerji was signed. She left the industry after her marriage to Kumar in 2001, citing that she did not enjoy the acting profession anymore. Her last film was Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega (2001), a remake of the Telugu movie Money (1993). It featured her opposite Fardeen Khan and was an average grosser at the box office.|$|E

25|$|Vestiges was {{initially}} well received by polite Victorian society {{and became an}} international bestseller, but its unorthodox themes contradicted the natural theology fashionable {{at the time and}} were reviled by clergymen – and subsequently by scientists who readily found fault with its amateurish deficiencies.

25|$|To {{convince}} the Fox Studio that a Planet of the Apes film could be made, the producers shot a brief test {{scene from a}} Rod Serling draft of the script, using early versions of the ape makeup. Charlton Heston appeared as {{an early version of}} Taylor (named Thomas, as he was in the Serling-penned drafts), Edward G. Robinson appeared as Zaius, while two then-unknown Fox contract actors, James Brolin and Linda Harrison, played Cornelius and Zira. This test footage is included on several DVD releases of the film, as well as the documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes. Linda Harrison, at the time the girlfriend of studio chief Richard Zanuck, went on to play Nova in the 1968 film and its first sequel, and had a cameo in Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes more than 30 years later, which was also produced by Zanuck. Although Harrison often opined that the producers had always had her in <b>mind</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role of Nova, they had, in fact, considered first Ursula Andress, then Raquel Welch, and Angelique Pettyjohn. When these three women proved unavailable or uninterested, Zanuck gave the part to Harrison. Dr. Zaius was originally to have been played by Robinson, but he backed out due to the heavy makeup and long sessions required to apply it. Robinson later made his final film, Soylent Green (1973), opposite his one-time Ten Commandments (1956) co-star Heston.|$|E
