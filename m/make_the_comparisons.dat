5000|$|Nowrasteh was {{attacked}} by Conservatives for an alleged [...] "liberal bias" [...] in his Showtime film, The Day Reagan Was Shot. Former Reagan National Security Advisor, Richard Allen, led the charge with a piece in the Wall Street Journal (December 14, 2001), accusing Nowrasteh and Executive Producer Oliver Stone of [...] "yet another dubious Oliver Stone production" [...] and referring to it as [...] "The Day They Shot the Truth." [...] Mr. Allen based his piece on tapes he had kept from that day, releasing only six minutes to support his position. Nowrasteh responded in the Los Angeles Times (December 24, 2001) and {{a letter to the}} editor in the Wall Street Journal (January 2, 2002), [...] "the clear solution is to have Allen release the entire unedited tape and allow anyone to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>comparisons</b> and draw whatever conclusions seem warranted." [...] Nowrasteh concluded his Los Angeles Times piece by writing, [...] "The Day Reagan Was Shot provides the first-ever dramatization of a constitutional crisis and government cover-up (both amply supported by facts) and the threat they pose to a nation when a president becomes incapacitated. This is important and relevant and raises issues that should be discussed openly." ...|$|E

In particular these techniques derive their impetus from four milestones of option pricing models: Bachelier model, Samuelson model, Black-Scholes-Merton model and Levy model. In this paper we evaluate all related option pricing models based on these milestones, by comparing the corresponding stochastic differential equations and option pricing formulas.

The comparisons are examined to determine the importance of quenching, heavy ions, ionization above the F-layer peak, and the temperature parameter of the model atmosphere. Comparable fits between the observed and calculated intensities are found for several available model atmospheres. The least-squares fitting process, used to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>comparisons,</b> produces comparable fits {{over a wide range}} of combinations of neutral densities and of reaction constants.

Secondly, based on the action-based access control (ABAC) model, we propose a fine-grained control protocol for structured documents by introducing temporal state and environmental state. The protocol covering different stages from document creation, to permission specification and usage control are given by using the Z-notation. Finally, we give the implementation of our mechanism and <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>comparisons</b> between the existing methods and our mechanism.

30|$|Radar imaging of noncooperative targets is an {{interesting}} application of all-weather high-resolution coherent radars. However, these images are usually blurred when using the standard range-Doppler algorithm, if a long coherent processing interval (CPI) is used, and motion compensation techniques are hence necessary to improve imaging quality. If the CPI is reduced enough, target scatterers do not migrate of resolution cells and their corresponding Doppler frequencies are constant. Hence, for a short CPI, motion compensation is not longer necessary, but Doppler resolution gets degraded. In that case, superresolution algorithms may be applied. Here, we compare the superresolution-based focusing techniques with motion compensation-based methods. Our conclusion is that imaging quality after employing the superresolution approaches is not improved and, consequently, the use of motion compensation-based approaches to focus the radar images cannot be circumvented. Simulated and real data from high-resolution radars {{have been used to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>comparisons.</b>|$|E
