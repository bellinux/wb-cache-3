Based on their current approach, the requirements of their release and rollout management should be determined, together with the problems addressed by the approach. Enriched by knowledge from related disciplines, like e. g. project management, <b>multiproject</b> <b>management,</b> release management and the critical path method these requirements {{should be addressed by}} appropriate EAM Patterns [Er 08 a]. These EAM patterns should provide a proven-practice approach for a global release and rollout management. To prove the validity of the developed EAM patterns, they are tested with reasonable data from the reinsurance company...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} SimHiProS, {{a hybrid}} simulation model of software production. The {{goal is to}} gain insight on the dynamics induced by resource sharing in <b>multiproject</b> <b>management.</b> In order to achieve it the hierarchy of decisions in a multiproject organization is modeled and some resource allocation methods based on algorithms from the OR/AI domain are used. Other critical {{issues such as the}} hybrid nature of software production and the effects of measurement and control are also incorporated in the model. Some first results are presented.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{implementation}} of <b>multiproject</b> <b>management</b> in terms of international business organization and its IT department. The aim of this thesis is to describe the current state of project management in the IT department using methodology for measuring the maturity of processes. Define the management requirements for project portfolio tool, establish criteria for the selection and also tools comparison. After choosing the tool which satisfies all the requirements and criteria, proposal for implementation of this tool will follow. The conclusion is devoted to a summary of the results and proposals for change, to encourage improvement in the level of maturity of the project management process and project portfolio...|$|E
40|$|In {{complex product}} development, {{corporations}} are running product development {{in many different}} projects. The number of more or less interdependent projects creates a web-like multiproject situation. It {{is characterized by the}} multitude of relations and dependencies that exist among projects, comprising tasks, people, knowledge, technologies, products, and components. In this paper we present a tentative framework, built on the assumption that complexity creates uncertainty that management has to handle. In multiproject situation the sources of complexity are: functionality of the product, people performing management and engineering work, chosen technology to fulfill functional demands, and shared resources in projects. The dimensions of uncertainty in <b>multiproject</b> situation that <b>management</b> has to handle are: the design of the process to transform functionality and technology to complete product design, organizing people in dual organizational settings basic as well as temporary projects, designing the product architecture based on functionality, technology and project interdependencies. This paper will shed some light on these problems and investigate how a participatory approach based on the Dependence Structure Matrix (DSM) as a process enabling tool can be used to manage complex multiproject situations. The results show that even a single project needs to be understood {{in the light of the}} situational and organizational complexity that is the actual outcome of project-based product development work. The analysis shows Who, What, Where, When, and Why coordination and integration need to take place in a complex multiproject situation on different levels of the organization. The process of communication among people creates a mutual understanding of the situational visibility and of why communication is essential in problem solving...|$|R
40|$|Multi-project {{management}} is {{fundamentally different from}} the control of a particular project or a set of slightly interconnected projects in terms of complexity and specifics. In <b>multiproject</b> <b>management</b> of the company production {{it is important to}} analyze the innovation interaction {{and its impact on the}} commercialization stage. A multiparameter factor of innovations interaction was introduced. The optimization problem which considers this factor was mathematically defined. The solution of this problem produces a schedule of innovations launches. This problem definition allows updating the objective function that corresponds to the aims of a manufacturing company. For example, it can help maximize the number of interdependent innovations with restrictions to current tangible and intangible resources or minimize the number of used tangible resources at a fixed number of innovations implemented. In order to verify the optimization problem an evolutionary approach based on genetic algorithm and local search is used. The verification was performed by the Solver a Microsoft Excel add-in. The readiness for practical use of the proposed solution was proved by the experiment...|$|E
