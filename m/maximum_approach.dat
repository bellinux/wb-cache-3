That statement seven elicited relatively more positive reactions from the participants seems to attest to a possible connection between attitudes towards the EO approach and its comprehensibility.|$|E
40|$|The {{main results}} of the extreme value theory {{developed}} for {{the investigation of the}} observables of dynamical systems rely, up to now, on the block <b>maxima</b> <b>approach.</b> In this framework, extremes are identified with the block maxima of the time series of the chosen observable, in the limit of infinitely long blocks. It has been proved that, assuming suitable mixing conditions for the underlying dynamical systems, the extremes of a specific class of observables are distributed according to the so called Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Direct calculations show {{that in the case of}} quasi-periodic dynamics the block maxima are not distributed according to the GEV distribution. In this paper we show that considering the exceedances over a given threshold instead of the block-maxima approach it is possible to obtain a Generalised Pareto Distribution also for extremes computed in systems which do not satisfy mixing conditions. Requiring that the invariant measure locally scales with a well defined exponent-the local dimension-, we show that the limiting distribution for the exceedances of the observables previously studied with the block <b>maxima</b> <b>approach</b> is a Generalised Pareto distribution where the parameters depend only on the local dimensions and the values of the threshold but not on the number of observations considered. We also provide connections with the results obtained with the block <b>maxima</b> <b>approach.</b> In order to provide further support to our findings, we present the results of numerical experiments carried out considering the well-known Chirikov standard map...|$|R

Obviously, fish screening facilities are constructed to protect juvenile fish from mortality associated with water diversions. This basic goal can be broken into two primary objectives. First, a fish screen facility must physically exclude the critical species and life stage from the water diversion. Secondly, the facility must safely and rapidly return the fish to the parent water body. Approach velocity, screen orientation and bypass criteria address this objective.

Regional organisation is attractive because it offers flexible responses to the challenges of globalisation. However, the uncertainty with respect to regional organisation is endemic since governments tend to postpone or renege on ambitious plans for far-reaching regionalisation, not knowing what its implications would be. When a regional organisation engages in a common market project, then the question of the ratio of benefits against costs becomes so highly relevant that constitutional decision-making is called for. A new structure for economic regulation must be designed and enforced, the consequences of which spill over into other state regulations.

40|$|The entropy <b>maximum</b> <b>approach</b> (Maxent) was {{developed}} as a minimization of the subjective uncertainty measured by the Boltzmann [...] Gibbs [...] Shannon entropy. Many new entropies have been invented {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century. Now there exists a rich choice of entropies for fitting needs. This diversity of entropies gave rise to a Maxent "anarchism". Maxent approach is now the conditional maximization of an appropriate entropy for the evaluation of the probability distribution when our information is partial and incomplete. The rich choice of non-classical entropies causes a new problem: which entropy is better for a given class of applications? We understand entropy as a measure of uncertainty which increases in Markov processes. In this work, we describe the most general ordering of the distribution space, with respect to which all continuous-time Markov processes are monotonic (the Markov order). For inference, this approach results in a set of conditionally "most random" distributions. Each distribution from this set is a maximizer of its own entropy. This "uncertainty of uncertainty" is unavoidable in analysis of non-equilibrium systems. Surprisingly, the constructive description of this set of maximizers is possible. Two decomposition theorems for Markov processes provide a tool for this description. Comment: 23 pages, 4 figures, Correction in Conclusion (postprint...|$|E

Summary: “When a file {{is to be}} transmitted from a sender to a recipient and when the latter already has a file somewhat similar to it, remote differential compression seeks to determine the similarities interactively so as to transmit only {{the part of the}} new file not already in the recipient’s old file. Content-dependent chunking means that the sender and recipient chop their files into chunks, with the cutpoints determined by some internal features of the files, so that when segments of the two files agree (possibly in different locations within the files) the cutpoints in such segments tend to be in corresponding locations, and so the chunks agree. By exchanging hash values of the chunks, the sender and recipient can determine which chunks of the new file are absent from the old one and thus need to be transmitted. “We propose two new algorithms for content-dependent chunking, and we compare their behavior, on random files, {{with each other and with}} previously used algorithms.

Instead {{of relying on}} the purely stochastic internal model method, which banks currently apply {{in line with the}} Basel regulatory requirements, we propose to include also alternative price mechanisms from the financial literature into the regulatory framework. For this purpose {{a modified version of the}} model by Lux and Marchesi (2000) is developed, capturing the realistic feature that parts of the investors do not follow the assumption of no arbitrage, but are motivated by rules of thumb and market psychology instead. Although both the standard stochastic as well as the behavioral model are restricted to 250 trading days, the latter is able to capitalize possible turbulences on financial markets and likewise the well-known phenomenon of excess volatility - even if the last 250 days reflect a calm market for which the efficient-market hypothesis could hold.

All the inverse resistivity models were processed using the PCI Geomatica software package commonly used for remote sensing data sets.

Four Raster layers were created, three of these layers were used for the input images and the fourth layer was used as the output of the combined images. The data sets were merged using basic statistical approach. Interpreted results show that all images resolved and reconstructed the essential features of the models. An assessment of the accuracy of the images for the four geologic models was performed using four criteria: the mean absolute error and mean percentage absolute error, resistivity values of the reconstructed blocks and their displacements from the true models. Generally, the blocks of the images of <b>maximum</b> <b>approach</b> give the least estimated errors. Also, the displacement of the reconstructed blocks from the true blocks is the least and the reconstructed resistivities of the blocks are closer to the true blocks than any other combined used.
