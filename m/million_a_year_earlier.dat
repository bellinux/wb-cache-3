5000|$|Further {{research}} suggests that the derelict pod carried techno-organic nanobots which they call [...] "the Beast", that can take control of machinery and even people. The Kuun-Lan seeks a Bentusi trading ship for help, and find it being attacked by a Beast fleet. The trading ship is hit with an infection beam and self-destructs to avoid being subverted. While other ships are assimilated by the Beast, the Kuun-Lan discovers that while the true origins of the Beast are unknown, it was first discovered by an alien vessel called the Naggarok, which had come from another galaxy <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier</b> and had picked up the Beast in hyperspace. Before the Naggarok was fully assimilated, the drives and communications of the ship were destroyed by the crew, but the ship automatically released a distress beacon - still infected by the Beast - which the Kuun-Lan discovered. As the Kuun-Lan hunts for the Naggarok, they must also contend with the Imperialist Taiidani, who are experimenting with the Beast in an attempt to weaponize it.|$|R
50|$|Three {{species are}} recognized, all of great size. Deinotherium giganteum {{is the type}} species, and is {{described}} above. It is primarily a late Miocene species, most common in Europe, {{and is the only}} species known from the circum-Mediterranean. Its last reported occurrence is from the middle Pliocene of Romania (2 to 4 million BP). An entire skull, found in the Lower Pliocene beds of Eppelsheim, Hesse-Darmstadt in 1836, was 1.2 m long and 0.9 m wide, indicating an animal exceeding modern elephants in size. Deinotherium indicum is the Asian species, known from India and Pakistan. It is distinguished by a more robust dentition and p4-m3 intravalley tubercles. D. indicum appears in the middle Miocene, and is most common in the late Miocene. It disappeared from the fossil record about 7 million years BP (late Miocene). Deinotherium bozasi is the African species. It is characterized by a narrower rostral trough, a smaller but higher nasal aperture, a higher and narrower cranium, and a shorter mandibular symphysis than the other two species. D. bozasi appears {{at the beginning of the}} late Miocene, and continues there after the other two species have died out elsewhere. The youngest fossils are from the Kanjera Formation, Kenya, about <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>years</b> old (<b>early</b> Pleistocene).|$|R
40|$|The large {{expansion}} in national product {{during the past}} year has been accompanied by strong demands for manpower. Employment in nonagricultural establishments in May, seasonally adjusted, was at an alltime high, 1. 5 <b>million</b> greater than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>earlier.</b> Increased manpower needs in nonfarm activities have been met by additions to the civilian labor force and a continued shift out of farm employment. The armed services, which earlier had risen rapidly, have shown little change in the past year. Unemployment has been exceptionally low, with monthly changes reflecting mainly seasonal influences. Employment gains over the past year have reflected stronger private demands as defense spending has tended to level off. Increased availability of basic metals has permitted elimination of restraints on the use of steel, copper, and aluminum and has allowed expansion of civilian durable goods output, particularly automobiles. Personal incomes after taxes have increased considerably and consumer prices have been relatively stable. Both the dollar and the physical volume of consumer purchases of goods and services have expanded sharply to alltime highs. Plant and equipment outlays have been at record levels. Business inventories have risen substantially in durable goods lines but have declined moderately in nondurable goods lines. The bulk of the employment increase over the past 12 months has been in manufacturing activities. In durable goods manufacturing industries employment has risen by 900, 000; most of this growth occurred in the last half of 1952 following the settlement of the steel strike in July. Increases have been especially sharp in the automobile, aircraft, and electrical machinery industries, as may be seen from the chart. Employment in nondurable goods industrie...|$|R

He was promoted to the first team scene in the 1994-95 season when the club were in the old First Division. However, he didn't make his debut until the 1996-97 campaign where he made his debut in a 3-1 win away at Charlton Athletic on 26 November 1996. Oster and Town were thrust into a relegation battle that was ultimately unsuccessful and while in his only first team season at Blundell Park he was seemingly thrown in at the deep end by his manager Brian Laws, but managed to pull of some outstanding performances, scoring three league goals in the process. He also managed to score a 30-yard drive in the FA Cup defeat against Sheffield Wednesday which was his first senior career goal. Following Grimsby's relegation from the First Division, Oster was sold by The Mariners, for a fee of £1.5 million that saw him break the club's record transfer sale that was initially held by Gary Croft following his move to Blackburn Rovers for £1 <b>million</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>earlier.</b> Oster's transfer fee still remains the club's record transfer fee received.
