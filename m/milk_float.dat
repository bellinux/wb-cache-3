50|$|Before BEVs, dairy {{supplies}} were delivered using horse-drawn <b>milk</b> <b>floats.</b> This lasted {{from the late}} 19th century until the 1950s. Today, with rounds expanding in coverage to ensure profitability {{in the face of}} falling levels of patronage, the limited range and speed of electric <b>milk</b> <b>floats</b> have resulted in many being replaced by diesel-powered converted vans.|$|R

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, milk-buying {{patterns}} have changed drastically in the UK. The classic milkman, who travels his local milk round (route) using a <b>milk</b> <b>float</b> (often battery powered) {{during the early}} hours and delivers milk in 1 pint glass bottles with aluminium foil tops directly to households, has almost disappeared. Two {{of the main reasons}} for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping). Another factor is that it is cheaper to purchase milk from a supermarket than from home delivery. In 1996, more than 2.5 billion liters of milk were still being delivered by milkmen, but by 2006 only 637 million liters (13% of milk consumed) was delivered by some 9,500 milkmen. By 2010, the estimated number of milkmen had dropped to 6,000. Assuming that delivery per milkman is {{the same as it was}} in 2006, this means milkmen deliveries now only account for 6â€“7% of all milk consumed by UK households (6.7 billion liters in 2008/2009).|$|E

[...] The Simpsons episode [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] (2001) features a scene on a racing school bus where character Milhouse Van Houten says [...] "It's like Speed2, only with a bus instead of a boat!"

50|$|Most {{electric}} <b>milk</b> <b>floats</b> do {{not have}} seat belts, and {{the law in the}} United Kingdom only requires wearing seat belts where these are fitted in the vehicle. While there was previously an exemption in the law meaning those making local deliveries were not required to wear a seat belt, which would in theory have included drivers and passengers in <b>milk</b> <b>floats</b> with seat belts fitted, the law was changed in 2005 to deliveries less than 50 m apart.|$|R
2500|$|Westbrook {{has said}} that the cast and crew became like a second family to her, with the roles in the soap {{mirroring}} their relationships off-screen. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "Sid [...] and I became very close [...] we were as thick as thieves. When we weren't shooting together we'd hang out [...] Once Sid and I got so bored hanging around on set that we decided to take the <b>milk</b> <b>float</b> for a spin around Albert Square, but Sid drove it too fast and turned it over [...] we couldn't stop laughing, but the producers didn't seem to share our amusement. We were seriously told off that day." [...] She has described other actors like Michelle Gayle, Letitia Dean, Adam Woodyatt and Nick Berry like brothers and sisters, and has said she was very close to older cast members such as June Brown, Wendy Richard, Mike Reid and Gillian Taylforth. She has also revealed that her off-screen relationship with actors McFadden and Kemp mirrored her character's on-screen one: [...] "In the soap they were my older brothers, always looking out for me, making sure I didn't get into trouble, and off set they were exactly the same." ...|$|E

25|$|Most {{electric}} car makers stopped production {{at some point}} in the 1910s. Electric vehicles became popular for certain applications where their limited range did not pose major problems. Forklift trucks were electrically powered when they were introduced by Yale in 1923. In Europe, especially the United Kingdom, <b>milk</b> <b>floats</b> were powered by electricity, and for most of the 20th century the majority of the world's battery electric road vehicles were British <b>milk</b> <b>floats.</b> Electric golf carts were produced by Lektro as early as 1954. By the 1920s, the early heyday of {{electric car}}s had passed, and a decade later, the electric automobile industry had effectively disappeared.
