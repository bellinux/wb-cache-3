40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were (i) to design a central-type jet pump model to remove wheat grains from water channels and (ii) to establish a test-rig for jet pump model performance test. Experiments were performed using wheat grains and water. The experiments deals with the performance and choice of suitable nozzle distance ratio and area ratio (area of <b>motive</b> <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle</b> to area of mixing chamber) for a central-type jet pump model with the following parameter: 7. 25 mixing chamber length ratio (length of mixing chamber to mixing chamber diameter), diffuser angle of 5. 5 º and wheat concentration ratio from 5 % to 35 %. The experimental rig was constructed such a way it can be changing the driving nozzle diameter and {{the distance between the}} nozzles to throat. In this study three different diameters of driving nozzles, namely (10, 12. 7 and 16 mm) have been used with one mixing chamber of 25. 4 mm diameter (i. e. three different area ratios of R = 0. 155, 0. 25 and 0. 4). The effect of nozzle to throat spacing to nozzle diameter ratio "X " with values of 1, 1. 5 and 2, on the jet pump performance was also tested under different flow rates and motive pressures. From the experimental work, the beast and suitable nozzle distance ratio and area ratio are obtained. The effect of wheat concentration on jet pump efficiency was also measured. The research proved the ability to use a centraltype jet pump model successfully for the first time for wheat grains removing from water channels up to 35 %. The results allow prediction of how a similar practical unit behaves in order to remove the wheat grains from the bottom of water channels...|$|E
40|$|An ejector is {{a device}} that entrains a {{secondary}} flow into a high speed stream that is generated by expansion of high pressure motive gas [1]. These ejectors can be broadly classified into central ejectors and annular ejectors. A large majority of applications involve central ejectors where the <b>motive</b> gas <b>flow</b> is injected along {{the centre of the}} flow passage of the secondary flow. Dutton and Carroll [2] proposed an optimization procedure for such ejectors without taking the mixed supersonic flow region into account and generated the design curves considering the constant Total temperature, Molecular weight and Specific heat ratios. However in some applications involving high temperature gases such as in ramjet/ scramjet and gas turbine test facilities, an annular supersonic ejector is more appropriate where annular injection of the motive gas at the periphery of the flow passage is desired to avoid the exposure of the <b>motive</b> gas <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle</b> to the high temperature combustion product gases. A design and optimization procedure for an annular supersonic ejector based on the earlier approach [2] with the mixed supersonic flow region and incorporating variable Total temperature, Molecular weight and Specific heat ratios in the model has been developed based on simplified one dimensional constant area mixing model and verified using CFD software Fluen...|$|R

40|$|At {{times it}} would seem that {{practical}} application of things learned in analytical work is not readily identifiable. Such is not the case with this paper. I would like to point out one very practical application of the knowledge available to the reader. The knowledge I refer to is the reduction in overall pressure loss associated {{with the addition of a}} properly-proportioned dif-fuser to a <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Let us consider the situation. As the electric utilities install larger turbine-generator units, higher capacity flow-measuring sections are required when running ASME Performance Tests. We find that there are practical limits to the design of these flow sections. First, pipe size is limited by laboratory calibration capability and by space in the power plant heat cycle. Second, the ASME PTC 6 limits the beta ratio of a <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle</b> to 0. 5. Third, we are limited as to design nozzle pressure drop by manometer capability, and finally, by pumping head available. Multiple flow sections used in parallel are one viable solution, particularly useful in cycles with multiple strings of feedwater heaters. But there are ob-jections to this arrangement also. The cost of each additional flow section puts pressure on the engineer to search for an alternative way to accurately measure water flow in a turbine cycle. The addition of a diffuser to a <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle</b> offers some temporary relief to the <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle</b> capacity problem. Thus for the same overall pressure loss as obtained without a diffuser, as shown in the figure, one can increase the flow capability 30 percent by the use of a diffuser. This curve assumes a multiplate flow straightener, a device with a relatively high pressure drop within itself. If we instead assume a tube-type flow straightener, the flow increase is somewhat greater, on the order of 35 percent. By using a separable diffuser we can continue to design the throat-tap <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle</b> in accordance with the strict require-ments of PTC 6 — 1964. The authors assure us that the diffuser does not appreciably affect the flow coefficient. This assuranc...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. Natural refrigerant such as carbon dioxide which is a safe refrigerant without toxicity and flammability attracts attention from a viewpoint of environmental load-reducing. However, the energy loss at the expansion valve in carbon dioxide refrigerant cycle is three times larger {{than that of the}} usual cycle using refrigerant R- 134 a. The two-phase ejector is one of those devices which improve Coefficient Of Performance (COP) by using the expansion energy of the refrigerant. The object of the present paper is to elucidate the twophase <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle</b> performance of carbon dioxide from the experiment using the precise measurement of the pressure along the nozzle. It is found by the present experiment that the maximum energy conversion efficiency of two-phase <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle</b> for carbon dioxide is about the order of 95 %. The experimental results show that there is some suitable length in divergent section of two-phase <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle.</b> In the shortest nozzle, the pressure decreases from the saturation are measured at the nozzle throat because of requirements for large superheat of liquid refrigerants.

They are observed at heights of between 500 and 1500 pc, falling onto the Galactic plane at velocities from 50 to 140 km s$^{- 1 }$. To explain the origin of these clouds, we present a galactic fountain model, driven by the wind from a super stellar cluster (SSC). We solve the equations for a steady, radiative de Laval <b>nozzle</b> <b>flow.</b> We consider two effects not considered previously in astrophysical <b>nozzle</b> <b>flow</b> models: cooling functions for different metallicities, and the direct action of the galactic gravitational field on the gas <b>flowing</b> along the <b>nozzle.</b> For an adiabatic <b>nozzle</b> <b>flow,</b> the gravity acting directly on the gas within the nozzle "stalls" the <b>nozzle</b> <b>flow</b> for initial wind velocities lower than the escape velocity from the Galaxy. For the same wind velocity, a radiative <b>nozzle</b> <b>flow</b> stalls at lower altitudes above the galactic plane. We find that SSC winds with velocities of $v_w= 500 - 800 $ km s$^{- 1 }$ produce nozzles stall at heights of $x_m= 1 - 15 $ kpc.

40|$|A project history review, {{literature}} review, and vendor search {{were conducted}} to identify a flowmeter that would improve the accuracy of gaseous flow measurements in the White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) Calibration Laboratory and the Hydrogen High Flow Facility. Both facilities currently use sonic <b>flow</b> <b>nozzles</b> to measure flowrates. The <b>flow</b> <b>nozzle</b> pressure drops combined with corresponding pressure and temperature measurements have been estimated to produce uncertainties in flowrate measurements of 2 to 5 percent. This study investigated the state of flowmeter technology to make recommendations that would reduce those uncertainties. Most flowmeters measure velocity and volume, therefore mass flow measurement must be calculated based on additional pressures and temperature measurement which contribute to the error. The two exceptions are thermal dispersion meters and Coriolis mass flowmeters. The thermal dispersion meters are accurate to 1 to 5 percent. The Coriolis meters are significantly more accurate, at least for liquids.

Due to its greater density and partial contact with the wall, the equilibrium velocity of the liquid phase appreciably lags that of the lighter gas phase.
