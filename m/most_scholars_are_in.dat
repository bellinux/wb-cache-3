It is more likely that the mice described by Herodotus were the cause of the pestilence described by Berossus.

5000|$|Evidence: stylistically, Midsummer Night is {{very much}} part of the 'lyrical plays', which would suggest a date of {{composition}} in 1594 or 1595. A strong argument that it was written immediately after Romeo and Juliet {{is the nature of}} Pyramus and Thisbe, which features a pair of ill-fated lovers who arrange to meet in secret and which ends with the heroine killing herself over the body of her dead love. In his 1979 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, Harold F. Brooks argues that Shakespeare used the source story from Ovid's Metamorphoses first to examine the tragic potential and then to exploit its comic and farcical elements in his next play. A possible topical allusion is the line [...] "the death/Of learning, late decreased in beggary" [...] (5.1.52-53), which could refer to the spate of deaths of popular playwrights in the early 1590s; Robert Greene in 1592, Christopher Marlowe in 1593 and Thomas Kyd in 1594. That the play culminates with the marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta has led some to theorise it may have been written specifically for a wedding, with the most likely candidates being either the marriage of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby and Elizabeth de Vere on 26 January 1595, or that of Sir Thomas Berkeley and Elizabeth Carey on 19 February 1596. That the second is the more likely of the two {{is due to the fact}} that Elizabeth's grandfather was Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon and her father was George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, successive patrons of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. If the play was written for a wedding in February 1596, it was most likely composed in 1595. However, there is no solid evidence to suggest that the play was in fact written for a wedding, and <b>most</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> agreement that stylistic evidence alone is sufficient to date the play to c.1595.|$|E
5000|$|The {{widespread}} {{claims about}} Reincken's exceptional longevity stem from Johann Mattheson, who, writing in 1722, gave his {{date of birth}} as 27 April 1623.

40|$|Weblogs (blogs) {{emerged as}} a {{grassroots}} phenomenon in the late 1990 s and since then their growth has been staggering. There {{has also been a}} growing body of scholarship with an underlying assumption that there is consensus about the definition of the word ‘blog’, which there is not. This article reviews some of the varied ways the term is being used, addresses the distinction as to whether a blog should be considered a medium or a genre, and considers whether links and comment-threads are defining characteristics. This article argues that the real problem is not that the term blog is difficult to define (it <b>is)</b> but that <b>most</b> <b>scholars</b> <b>are</b> using it <b>in</b> vague, contradictory, ambiguous and imprecise ways.

60|$|The {{objections}} to this method are so numerous {{that it is}} difficult to state them briefly. The attempt, however, must be made. To desert the path opened by the <b>most</b> eminent <b>scholars</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> itself presumptuous; the least that an innovator can do is to give his reasons for advancing in a novel direction. If this were a question of scholarship merely, it would be simply foolhardy to differ from men like Max Muller, Adalbert Kuhn, Breal, and many others. But a revolutionary mythologist is encouraged by finding that these scholars usually differ from each other. Examples will <b>be</b> found chiefly <b>in</b> the essays styled 'The Myth of Cronus,' 'A Far- travelled Tale,' and 'Cupid and Psyche.' Why, then, do distinguished scholars and mythologists reach such different goals? Clearly because their method is so precarious. They all analyse the names in myths; but, where one scholar decides that the name is originally Sanskrit, another holds that it is purely Greek, and a third, perhaps, is all for an Accadian etymology, or a Semitic derivation. Again, even when scholars agree as to the original root from which a name springs, they differ as much as ever as to the meaning of the name in its present place. The inference is, that the analysis of names, on which the whole edifice of philological 'comparative mythology' rests, is a foundation of shifting sand. The method is called 'orthodox,' but, among those who practise it, there is none of the beautiful unanimity of orthodoxy.|$|R
40|$|The Internet epitomizes globalisation. There are {{not many}} {{international}} treaties on Internet issues so far. For the time being, governance of the Internet by law will thus basically have to be governance by national law. <b>Most</b> cyber <b>scholars</b> <b>are</b> therefore <b>in</b> the business of exploring alternative governance tools. The typical approach is hybrid, combining state with non-state inputs, and using soft forms of governance, not command and control regulation. Against this background, this papers makes two related points. The preoccupation of the legal discourse with globalisation is partly misleading. The Internet has more and even more profound challenges to governance by law: the libertarian beliefs of many Internet activists; the egalitarian culture of Netizens; the ultra high speed of evolution; and the almost complete decontextualisation of Internet communication. Despite these many and profound challenges, Internet governance by law is not pointless. Separately, the law is able to parry each of these challenges, albeit to a varying degree. The law comes in more troubled waters, if these challenges compound. But even then, there is room left for the law. Policy makers should thus not rule the law out a limine. They should properly weigh the many advantages governance by law has over alternative institutions...|$|R
5000|$|Additional {{information}} (publication): {{although the}} 1608 quarto text {{is not usually}} considered a bad quarto per se, it does differ substantially from the Folio text; Q1 contains 285 lines not in F1, and F1 contains about 115 lines not in Q1. Additionally, over one thousand individual words are different between the two texts, each text has completely different punctuation, much of the verse <b>in</b> F1 <b>is</b> printed as prose in Q1, several speeches are given to different characters (including the final speech of the play - Albany in Q1, Edgar in F1) and each text features different scene divisions. The New Cambridge Shakespeare has published scholarly editions of both texts; F1 in 1992, and Q1 in 1994 {{as part of their}} Early Quartos series, both versions edited by Jay L. Halio. The 1999 Pelican Shakespeare edition of the play, edited by Stephen Orgel included both Q1 and F1, as well as the conflated text originally created by Alexander Pope in 1725. Similarly, the Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works also included both versions of the play in their second edition of 2005, each edited by Gary Taylor. The Q1 text appears under the title The History of King Lear, and is dated 1605-1606. The Folio text appears under the title The Tragedy of King Lear and is dated 1610. Taylor believes Q1 represents an early draft of the play, written prior to performance, and F1 represents a revision written four or five years later, after numerous performances. He feels the differences in the two texts represent a [...] "more theatrical" [...] version of the play, which streamlines the plot and improves the characterisation of Edgar, at the expense of Kent and Albany. Although Halio disagrees with Taylor's assessment of F1 as [...] "more theatrical," [...] he reaches the same conclusion regarding the provenance of the text; Q1 was probably set from Shakespeare's foul papers, whilst F1 represents a performance text, probably altered by Shakespeare himself. <b>Most</b> <b>scholars</b> today <b>are</b> <b>in</b> agreement with this theory.|$|R
40|$|Community {{studies of}} the modern civil rights {{movement}} have {{tended to focus on}} the South or the Northeast, but Gretchen Eick makes a convincing case that important developments, long ignored by <b>most</b> <b>scholars,</b> <b>were</b> happening <b>in</b> the Midwest too. Eick surveys a broad range of topics, including education, employment, housing, and relations between the national and local NAACP. Much of the story in Wichita resembles that {{in other parts of the}} nation. Real estate agents thwarted efforts at neighborhood integration. Local officials dragged their heels on school integration until pressure from the federal government forced change. The aircraft industry, the center of Wichita 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturing economy, often discriminated in employment practices. Civil rights advocates had to overcome fierce white opposition that sometimes included vigilante action. The Midwest, she persuasively shows, was no bastion of racial tolerance. Eick 2 ̆ 7 s conclusion nicely highlights the parallels and differences between what happened in Wichita and developments in southern cities. Eick presents rich portraits of many activists who engaged in this struggle yet avoids romanticizing her subjects. She breaks important new ground in telling the story of Chester Lewis Jr., a talented lawyer who played key roles in local battles over housing, employment, and schooling. Nationally, he led a movement of 2 ̆ 2 Young Turks 2 ̆ 2 in a five-year struggle (1964 - 1968) to challenge the leadership of the NAACP, which he believed ran the group in an undemocratic fashion and had grown isolated from the needs of most African Americans. Eick vividly chronicles how NAACP leader Roy Wilkins employed heavy handed tactics to turn back the insurgents. Eick also demonstrates the importance of Wichita in discussing the sit-ins that occurred at local drug stores in 1958. The Greensboro, North Carolina, sit-ins two years later <b>are</b> standard fare <b>in</b> movement historiography, but those <b>in</b> Wichita <b>were</b> the first successful sitins of the freedom struggle. Based on solid archival research as well as interviews with dozens of activists, this work will appeal to specialists in the modern civil rights movement and to scholars and teachers of Midwestern history. One minor criticism is how Eick handles shifting her focus from the national to the local scene. At times her attention to broaden national trends helps illuminate local developments, but in other places the national narrative is too extensive, needlessly interrupting the local story...|$|R
2500|$|The {{symbolism}} {{behind the}} action of the couple's joined hands has also <b>been</b> debated among <b>scholars.</b> Many point to this gesture as proof of the painting's purpose. Is it a marriage contract or something else? Panofsky interprets the gesture as an act of fides, Latin for [...] "marital oath". He calls the representation of the couple [...] "qui desponsari videbantur per fidem" [...] which means, [...] "who were contracting their marriage by marital oath". The man is grasping the woman's right hand with his left which is the basis for the controversy. Some scholars like Jan Baptist Bedaux and Peter Schabacker argue that if this painting does show a marriage ceremony, then the use of the left hand points to the marriage being morganatic and not [...] A marriage is said to be morganatic if a man marries a woman of unequal rank. However, the subjects originally thought by <b>most</b> <b>scholars</b> to <b>be</b> represented <b>in</b> this painting, Giovanni Arnolfini and Giovanna Cenami, were of equal status and rank in the courtly system, so the theory would not hold true.
