In 2003, he spoke out against the plans for the US and UK to launch a war in Iraq, describing it as [...] "a tragedy" [...] and lambasting US President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for undermining the UN, saying, [...] "All that (<b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush)</b> wants is Iraqi oil". He attacked the US more generally, asserting that it had committed more [...] "unspeakable atrocities" [...] across the world than any other nation, citing the atomic bombing of Japan; this attracted international controversy, although he later improved his relationship with Blair. Retaining an interest in Libyan-UK relations, he visited Megrahi in Barlinnie prison and spoke out against the conditions of his treatment, referring to them as [...] "psychological persecution".|$|E

5000|$|In 2003, Parini {{along with}} Julia Alvarez and Galway Kinnell {{were invited to}} read their poetry at the White House. However, First Lady Laura Bush {{canceled}} the event after learning the poets were intending to protest against the Iraq War. Noelia Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> said: “While <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush</b> respects the right of all Americans to express their opinions, she, too, has opinions and believes {{it would be inappropriate}} to turn a literary event into a political forum.” Parini was disgusted by this decision: [...] "For poets to remain silent at a time of national crisis is unconscionable," [...] he said. Fellow poet Julia Alvarez added: [...] "Why be afraid of us, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush?</b> You're married to a scarier fellow." [...] Parini said it was naive for organizers to think he and other poets would check their politics at the door of an event sponsored by the first lady. In response to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Bush's</b> decision, Parini joined a group of poets that took part in a reading on February 16, 2003 at the Congregational Church in Manchester, Vermont, called [...] "A Poetry Reading in Honor of the Right to Protest as a Patriotic and Historical Tradition".

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to design a {{semi-active}} magnetorheological (<b>MR)</b> hydraulic <b>bushing.</b> The semi-active bushing {{is intended to be}} used to isolate a cylinder deactivating engine. Cylinder deactivation causes high transient torsional loading in addition to changing the magnitude and mode of engine vibrations requiring an adaptive or controllable isolator. Practical and simple semi-active control strategies are inspired by investigating the optimization of linear and slightly cubic nonlinear single degree of freedom isolators. Experimental verification of the optimization technique, which minimizes the root mean square (RMS) of engine acceleration frequency response and RMS of the force transmitted frequency response, shows that this method can be implemented on real linear systems to isolate the engine from harmonic inputs. This optimization technique is also applied to tune selected model parameters of existing two degree of freedom hydraulic bushings. This thesis also details the development of a <b>MR</b> hydraulic <b>bushing.</b> The <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> design retrofits an existing bushing with a pressure driven flow mode valve on the inertia track. A new efficient valve design is selected and developed for the application. The <b>MR</b> hydraulic <b>bushing</b> is designed, mathematically modeled, and numerically simulated. The simulation results show that the <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> tends to increase the low frequency dynamic stiffness magnitude while simultaneously decreasing the phase. The next stage of the project is fabrication and testing of the semi-active bushing. The performance of the manufactured <b>MR</b> <b>bushing</b> is tested on a base excitation apparatus. Varying the current input to the MR valve was found to have a small effect on the response of the suspended mass. The results are in agreement with the effects demonstrated by the dynamic stiffness numerical simulation...|$|R

This denouement does great harm to Mr Bush's credibility and to that of the United States; it has got us into a ghastly mess in Iraq; and it has diverted attention, resources and military might from the war that should have commanded the Bush administration's highest priority - the Afghan war against al-Qa'ida and international terrorism.
