5|$|A {{manuscript}} normally {{known as}} the Orus Apollo also exists in the Lyon municipal library, where upwards of 2,000 original documents relating to Nostradamus are stored {{under the aegis of}} Michel Chomarat. It is a purported translation of an ancient Greek work on Egyptian hieroglyphs based on later Latin versions, all of them unfortunately ignorant of the true <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient Egyptian script, which was not correctly deciphered until Champollion in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Even some nonhuman animals show {{a limited}} ability to add, {{particularly}} primates. In a 1995 experiment imitating Wynn's 1992 result (but using eggplants instead of dolls), rhesus macaque and cottontop tamarin monkeys performed similarly to human infants. More dramatically, after being taught the <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arabic numerals 0 through 4, one chimpanzee {{was able to}} compute the sum of two numerals without further training.

50|$|It {{would be}} foolish to deride such an {{etymology}} as unscientific if it helped <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> its time to arrive at a deeper signification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word, since it was precisely <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> etymology at that time to illuminate <b>the</b> spiritual <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word.

Part history book, part comic book, the movie rushes toward {{judgment}} for three breathless hours, lassoing facts and factoids by the thousands, then bundling them together into an incendiary device that would frag any viewer's complacency. Stone's picture is, in both <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word, sensational: it's tip-top tabloid journalism.

5|$|British {{archaeologist}} and anthropologist Katherine Routledge {{undertook a}} 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui {{with her husband}} to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an idiosyncratic mnemonic device that did not directly represent language, in other words, proto-writing, and that the <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the kohau rongorongo could not be read by someone not trained in that specific text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly tapu, that recorded the island's history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had been forgotten, and the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.|$|E
