40|$|Positive and {{negative}} time-lags are general timing restrictions between the starting times of jobs {{which have been}} introduced by Roy {{in connection with the}} <b>Metra</b> <b>Potential</b> <b>Method.</b> They allow the consideration of positive {{and negative}} time-lags between the starting times of jobs. It is shown that complex scheduling problems like general shop problems, problems with multi-processor tasks, problems with multi-purpose machines, and problems with changeover times can be reduced to single-machine problems with positive and negative time-lags between jobs. Furthermore, a branch and bound algorithm is developed for solving such single-machine scheduling problems. The reductions can be used to construct test problems for this algorithm. Computational results for randomly generated single-machine problems and for shop scheduling problems (without time-lags) are reported...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} lattice QCD {{study of the}} phase shift of I= 2 ππ {{scattering}} {{on the basis of}} two different approaches: the standard finite volume approach by Luscher and the recently introduced HAL QCD <b>potential</b> <b>method.</b> Quenched QCD simulations are performed on lattices with extents N_s= 16, 24, 32, 48 and N_t= 128 as well as lattice spacing a∼ 0. 115 fm and a pion mass of m_π∼ 940 MeV. The phase shift and the scattering length are calculated in these two <b>methods.</b> In the <b>potential</b> <b>method,</b> the error is dominated by the systematic uncertainty associated with the violation of rotational symmetry due to finite lattice spacing. In Luscher's approach, such systematic uncertainty is difficult to be evaluated and thus is not included in this work. A systematic uncertainty attributed to the quenched approximation, however, is not evaluated in both methods. In case of the <b>potential</b> <b>method,</b> the phase shift can be calculated for arbitrary energies below the inelastic threshold. The energy dependence of the phase shift is also obtained from Luscher's method using different volumes and/or nonrest-frame extension of it. The results are found to agree well with the <b>potential</b> <b>method.</b> Comment: Version 2, consistent with published versio...|$|R
40|$|Using an {{effective}} <b>potential</b> <b>method</b> we examine binary black holes where the individual holes carry spin. We trace out sequences of quasi-circular orbits and locate the innermost stable circular orbit {{as a function}} of spin. At large separations, the sequences of quasi-circular orbits match well with post-Newtonian expansions, although a clear signature of the simplifying assumption of conformal flatness is seen. The position of the ISCO is found to be strongly dependent on the magnitude of the spin on each black hole. At close separations of the holes, the effective <b>potential</b> <b>method</b> breaks down. In all cases where an ISCO could be determined, we found that an apparent horizon encompassing both holes forms for separations well inside the ISCO. Nevertheless, we argue that the formation of a common horizon is still associated with the breakdown of the effective <b>potential</b> <b>method.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to PR...|$|R
