5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has some}} of the most ancient rocks found in any U.S. National Park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12million years old, though even older rocks are {{believed}} to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5billion years ago), these <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> include gneiss, schist and amphibolites. <b>Metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545million years ago, the <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> were intruded by igneous granitic rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magma intrusions of diabase rocks 765million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granite and pegmatite intrusions also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss. Precambrian rocks in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary deposits, as well as Pleistocene glacial deposits.|$|E
5|$|A major {{geological}} {{structure in}} the region is the Northern Patagonian Batholith. This structure, formed by plutonic rocks including granodiorite and tonalite, is crossed north-south by the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone and surrounded by <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> west and volcanic rocks east of the batholith.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Blue Ridge Mountains {{contains}} low-to-high-grade <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks.</b> Many of {{the rocks}} of the Blue Ridge {{appear to be the}} metamorphosed equivalents of Proterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Others are metamorphosed igneous rocks, including Corbin metagranite, Fort Mountain gneiss, varieties of mafic and ultramafic rocks, and the metavolcanic rocks of the Gold Belt.|$|E

50|$|Slate is a {{fine-grained}} <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock</b> that splits into thin, smooth-surfaced layers. <b>Metamorphic</b> <b>rock</b> is rock {{which has}} changed from one form of matter into another and is not as was originally laid down by nature. It is used extensively in the building industry, particularly for roofing tiles. The production of slate is estimated at 4 million tons per year.|$|R

5|$|The Trout Creek Mountains are {{composed}} mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, {{which was then}} beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land {{now known as the}} Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period.|$|E
5|$|Both {{coastline}} and the Coast Ranges can {{be found}} within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the parks {{are part of the}} Franciscan Assemblage, uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These sedimentary rocks are primarily sandstone, siltstone, shale, and chert, with lesser amounts of <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> such as greenstone. For the most part, these rocks are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault; along {{the west bank of the}} creek, schist and other <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> {{can be found}}, while sedimentary rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank.|$|E
5|$|Many {{varieties}} of Precambrian bedrock are exposed including: granite, basalt, greenstone, gneiss, {{as well as}} <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Greenstone of the Superior craton located near Ely, Minnesota, is up to 2.7billion years old. Igneous rocks of the Duluth Complex comprise the bedrock of the eastern Boundary Waters. Ancient microfossils {{have been found in}} the banded iron formations of the Gunflint Chert.|$|E

5|$|The {{superficial}} rock of Orkney {{is almost}} entirely Old Red Sandstone, mostly of Middle Devonian age. As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness, this sandstone rests upon the <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Moine series, as may {{be seen on the}} Mainland, where a narrow strip is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, and again in the small island of Graemsay; they are represented by grey gneiss and granite.|$|E
5|$|These Precambrian igneous and <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> {{underlie}} {{most of the}} state, and {{are exposed}} in three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso. Sedimentary rocks overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or passive margin that developed during Cambrian time.|$|E

50|$|Migmatite is a {{rock that}} {{is a mixture of}} <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock</b> and igneous rock. It is created when a <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock</b> such as gneiss {{partially}} melts, and then that melt recrystallizes into an igneous rock, creating a mixture of the unmelted metamorphic part with the recrystallized igneous part. They can also be known as diatexite.|$|R
50|$|Slate is a fine-grained, foliated, {{homogeneous}} <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock</b> {{derived from}} an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade regional metamorphism.

5|$|The geology of Shetland {{is complex}} with {{numerous}} faults and folds. These islands are Scotland's most northerly area of Caledonian orogenic rocks {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalradian and Moine <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. Similarly, there are also Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor. Much of Shetland's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas.|$|E

5|$|The {{mountains}} {{are characteristic of}} the Great Basin's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, which came from an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks.</b> The {{southern end of the}} range, however, features many granitic outcrops. As a whole, the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons.|$|E
5|$|Metagreywackes and metapelites {{from two}} areas {{traversing}} {{one of these}} aureoles near Yellowknife have been studied. Most of the Slave province rocks are granitic with metamorphosed Yellowknife metasedimentary and volcanic rocks. Isotopic ages of these rocks is around , {{the time of the}} Kenoran orogeny. Rocks comprising the Slave province represent a high grade of metamorphism, intrusion and basement remobilization typical of Archean terranes. Migmatites, batholithic intrusive and granulitic <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> show foliation and compositional banding; the rocks are uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little foliation exists. Most Yellowknife Supergroup metasediments are tightly folded (isoclinal) or occur in plunging anticlines.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent erosion lasting 300million years {{stripped}} much of {{the exposed}} sediments and the mountains away. This reduced the very high mountains to small hills a few tens to hundreds of feet (tens of meters) high. Geologist John Wesley Powell called this major gap in the geologic record, which is also seen {{in other parts of}} the world, the Great Unconformity. Other sediments may have been added but, if they ever existed, were completely removed by erosion. Such gaps in the geologic record are called unconformities by geologists. The Great Unconformity is one of the best examples of an exposed nonconformity, which is a type of unconformity that has bedded rock units above igneous or <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|E

5|$|The NCVP is {{underlain}} by {{four large}} crustal fragments, namely Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana, Cassiar and Cache Creek. Stikinia comprises volcanic, plutonic and sedimentary rocks that {{were created in}} an island arc environment during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Mélange and abyssal peridotites, formed largely in an ancient oceanic basin, are the primary rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. These are also Paleozoic to Mesozoic in age and are intersected by younger granitic intrusions. Yukon-Tanana and Cassiar consist of sedimentary and <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> derived from the North American continent. The rocks of these two terranes are displaced and autochthonous in nature.|$|E
5|$|The central {{mass of the}} Raft River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rocks</b> with Elba quartzite and interlayered schist on the southern slopes and Cambrian quartzite outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal phosphorite overlain by a thick sequence of chert and cherty sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka Ranger District, soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on steep slopes, and deep in the lowlands.|$|E

50|$|The Adamawa {{is one of}} Cameroon's more geologically diverse areas. The Gotel and Mambila Mountains at {{the border}} with Nigeria are largely {{composed}} of granite, which gives way to crystalline and <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock</b> such as mica, schists, and gneiss. These are often covered in volcanic basalt, a combination that dominates until the Faro River. East of this, granites once again prevail, though sedimentary rock forms {{the valley of the}} Mbéré River, and a zone of <b>metamorphic</b> <b>rock</b> surrounds this.
