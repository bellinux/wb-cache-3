500|$|Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone {{commented that}} the album, which starts with [...] " [...] {{cauldron}} of energy" [...] on [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] (2003), ends by contrast with [...] "Daddy" [...] which he described as a five-minute tribute to her manager-father, and considered to be [...] "an anthology of vocal and lyrical cliches." [...] MTV News wrote that [...] "Daddy" [...] {{is different from the}} other relationship songs on Dangerously in Love, and added that it has a powerful message. By contrast, Allison Stewart of The Washington Post and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times both called [...] "Daddy" [...] a [...] "creepy bonus track". Similarly, Spence D., writing for IGN Music stated that [...] "Daddy" [...] is not really worth uncovering, as it follows suit in terms of being [...] "a by-the-books contempo R rendition", and he commented that [...] "there is something oddly eerie about an attractive woman such as Beyoncé crooning the words 'I want <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>to</b> be like my Daddy.'" [...] Mike Wass of the website Idolator called the song one of the [...] "duds" [...] on the album and added that it was a [...] "best forgotten ode to the superstar's father complete with stomach-churning lyrics like 'I want <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>to</b> be like my daddy'". In 2014, Louis Virtel of the website HitFix reviewed the song negatively, calling it the worst on Dangerously in Love and describing its lyrics as [...] "seriously simplistic". [...] "Daddy" [...] peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot RingMasters charts in the United States in 2014.|$|E
500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{a nearly}} five-minute long R song. The first verse {{of the song}} begins with Beyoncé reminiscing about the times she and her father/manager, Mathew Knowles shared {{as a child and}} through her adolescence. She sings about wanting to be with a man and a child who has similar qualities as her father. This is {{illustrated}} in the lyrics: [...] "I treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why I want my unborn son to be like my daddy, I want <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>to</b> be like my daddy, there is no one else like my daddy." [...] According to Marc Anthony Neal of the PopMatters, Beyoncé also confidently embraces her womanhood in the song. In a way, Beyoncé pays tribute to her father through this song.|$|E
500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>to</b> go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Missouri Republican Party filed {{a formal}} {{complaint}} with the Senate Ethics Committee on March 16. In response McCaskill said, [...] "The Missouri Republican Party {{is going to try}} to ride this horse as long as they can. They're going to try to make this as big a deal as they can. Them filing the ethics complaint is about as surprising as the sun coming up." [...] On March 21, 2011, Politico reported that McCaskill had failed to pay more than $280,000 in property taxes on the plane and was planning to sell it. [...] "I have convinced <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>to</b> sell the damn plane", McCaskill said on a conference call with reporters. [...] "I will never set foot on the plane again".

60|$|While <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> and Mr. Henley {{were engaged}} in writing plays in Bournemouth they {{made a number of}} titles, hoping to use them in the future. Dramatic {{composition}} was not what <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> preferred, but the torrent of Mr. Henley's enthusiasm swept him off his feet. However, after several plays had been finished, and his health seriously impaired by his endeavours to keep up with Mr. Henley, play writing was abandoned forever, and <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> returned <b>to</b> his legitimate vocation. Having added one of the titles, The Hanging Judge, to the list of projected plays, now thrown aside, and emboldened by <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> offer <b>to</b> give me any help needed, I concluded to try and write it myself.|$|R
