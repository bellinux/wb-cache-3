5|$|Southern Min dialects undergo {{considerable}} tone sandhi, i.e. {{changes to}} the tone depending on {{the position of the}} syllable in any given sentence or utterance. However, like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese, POJ always marks the citation tone (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi tone) rather than the tone which is actually spoken. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> reading aloud the reader must adjust the tone markings on the page to account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist the learner.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Zobel network filters {{is that they}} have a constant resistance image impedance and for this reason are also known as constant resistance networks. Clearly, the Zobel network filter does not have a problem matching to its terminations and this is its main advantage. However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and sharper cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as equalisation filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> used in combination with other image filter sections the same problem of matching arises as with end terminations. Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|E

25|$|This is {{confirmed}} by the finding of a prehispanic characteristics burial, in which several European glass pieces were found, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> these materials {{were present in the}} Mexico plateau, in western Mesoamerica prevailed prehispanic cultural patterns.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Commonwealth, Scandinavia and {{for books}} in Dutch, titles are usually written top-to-bottom on the spine.

25|$|The {{first term}} is a {{constant}} contribution to the free energy, and can be ignored. The second term is a finite shift in t. The third term is a quantity that scales to zero at long distances. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> analyzing the scaling of t by dimensional analysis, it is the shifted t that is important. This was historically very confusing, because the shift in t at any finite λ is finite, but near the transition t is very small. The fractional change in t is very large, and in units where t is fixed the shift looks infinite.|$|E
25|$|Recall that {{vertical}} coordinate {{lines in}} our chart represent the world {{lines of the}} dust particles, but despite their straight appearance in our chart, the congruence formed by these curves has nonzero vorticity, so the world lines are actually twisting about each other. The fact that the null geodesics spiral inwards in the manner shown above <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> our observer looks radially outwards, he sees nearby dust particles, not at their current locations, but at their earlier locations. This is just what we would expect if the dust particles are in fact rotating about one another.|$|E
25|$|Netzer {{discovered}} the Roman Theatre {{just before his}} death in late 2010. A loggia, or a theatre box, was discovered. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Herod or other notable officials went to see a play, they would receive luxury treatment. The rest of the audience would be seated below on benches that could accommodate about 650 people. What is quite unique about this find is that frescoes of landscapes were discovered. This suggests that the painters were well traveled; they depict scenes of Italy and even the Nile River in Egypt. It is also assumed that the painters were on loan to Herod from Caesar in Rome.|$|E

25|$|The euphonium, {{like the}} tenor trombone, is pitched in concert B. For a valved brass {{instrument}} like the euphonium, this <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> no valves are in use the instrument will produce partials of the B harmonic series. It is generally orchestrated as a non-transposing instrument like the trombone, written at concert {{pitch in the}} bass clef with higher passages in the tenor clef. Treble clef euphonium parts transposing down a major ninth are included in much concert band music: in the British-style brass band tradition, euphonium music is always written this way. In continental European band music, parts for the euphonium may be written in the bass clef as a B transposing instrument sounding a major second lower than written.|$|E
25|$|In Europe {{there exists}} a type of asset-backed bond called a covered bond, {{commonly}} known by the German term Pfandbriefe. Covered bonds were first created in 19th-century Germany when Frankfurter Hypo began issuing mortgage covered bonds. The market has been regulated since {{the creation of a}} law governing the securities in Germany in 1900. The key difference between covered bonds and mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities is that banks that make loans and package them into covered bonds keep those loans on their books. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a company with mortgage assets on its books issues the covered bond, its balance sheet grows, which would not occur if it issued an MBS, although it may still guarantee the securities payments.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Fairtrade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on {{increasing}} yields and quality. Economists state that, {{if this is}} indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade minimum price <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of custom plate options in Victoria, issued by V Plates on behalf of VicRoads. Custom or personalised plates come with the {{optional}} purchase of a contract. This contract allows the plate holder to retain the plates whether on a vehicle or not. Holding a contract on certain plates, <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the plates are no longer registered they cannot be resold/issued to another person unless the contract holder sells the contract. VicRoads (who own V Plates) do not know the cumulative figure {{of the total number of}} custom registration plates sold since they were first launched in 1986. This is because many personalised plates are not on vehicles, or they are held on self-retention, or have been handed back to VicRoads. However, VicRoads do know that around 30,000 sets of custom registration plates are made every year, and they estimate 10 percent of registered vehicles have custom registration plates.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, ZFS {{allocate}} writes across vdevs {{based on the}} free space in each vdev. This ensures that vdevs which have proportionately less data already, are given more writes when new data is to be stored. This helps to ensure that as the pool becomes more used, the situation does not develop that some vdevs become full, forcing writes to occur on {{a limited number of}} devices. It also <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> data is read (and reads are much more frequent than writes in most uses), different parts of the data can be read from as many disks as possible at the same time, giving much higher read performance. Therefore, as a general rule, pools and vdevs should be managed and new storage added, so that the situation does not arise that some vdevs in a pool are almost full and others almost empty, as this will make the pool less efficient.|$|E
25|$|For {{experimental}} physics, hotness <b>means</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> comparing any two given {{bodies in}} their respective separate thermodynamic equilibria, any two suitably given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings will agree as to which is the hotter of the two given bodies, or {{that they have the}} same temperature. This does not require the two thermometers to have a linear relation between their numerical scale readings, but it does require that the relation between their numerical readings shall be strictly monotonic. A definite sense of greater hotness can be had, independently of calorimetry, of thermodynamics, and of properties of particular materials, from Wien's displacement law of thermal radiation: the temperature of a bath of thermal radiation is proportional, by a universal constant, to the frequency of the maximum of its frequency spectrum; this frequency is always positive, but can have values that tend to zero. Thermal radiation is initially defined for a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium. These physical facts justify a mathematical statement that hotness exists on an ordered one-dimensional manifold. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E

500|$|First, Pluto's {{argument}} of perihelion, the angle between {{the point where}} it crosses the ecliptic and {{the point where it}} is closest to the Sun, librates around 90°. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Pluto is closest to the Sun, it is at its farthest above the plane of the Solar System, preventing encounters with Neptune. This is a consequence of the Kozai mechanism, which relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing body—in this case Neptune. Relative to Neptune, the amplitude of libration is 38°, and so the angular separation of Pluto's perihelion to the orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52° [...] The closest such angular separation occurs every 10,000 years.|$|E

2500|$|Old Norse {{inherited}} the Proto-Germanic feature of having neuter as the default gender. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{the gender of}} a noun is unknown, adjectives and pronouns referencing it use the neuter gender forms, rather than the masculine or feminine. Thus, if speaking or writing to a general audience, one would say velkomit, [...] "well is it come," [...] rather than velkominn or velkomin, [...] "well is [...] come," [...] as one does not know whether the person hearing {{it is going to}} be male or female.|$|E
25|$|Hawking {{interpreted}} this to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{black holes}} absorb some photons in a pure state {{described by a}} wave function, they re-emit new photons in a thermal mixed state described by a density matrix. This would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> quantum mechanics {{would have to be}} modified because, in quantum mechanics, states which are superpositions with probability amplitudes never become states which are probabilistic mixtures of different possibilities.|$|R
