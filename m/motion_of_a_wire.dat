40|$|Abstract. The {{magnetization}} {{reversal process}} of magnetic nano-wires was investigated using a moving mesh finite element method. The nucleation {{and expansion of}} reversed domains is calculated solving the Gilbert equation <b>of</b> <b>motion.</b> For <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> diameter <b>of</b> d = 20 nm either a transverse wall or a vortex wall is formed, depending {{on the strength of}} the initial applied field. Once a reversed domain is nucle-ated, the wall configuration remains the same during the complete reversal process. The vortex wall moves faster than the transverse wall. The domain wall velocities are in the order of 300 m/s to 800 m/s for an external field in the range from 300 kA/m to 600 kA/m for a Gilbert damping constant α = 1. The domain wall velocity increases with increasing wire diameter and decreasing damping constant, reach-ing 2000 m/s for d = 40 nm, α = 0. 05, and <b>an</b> applied field <b>of</b> 250 kA/m...|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of last century, Gerlach and Lehrer observed the rotational Brownian <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> very fine <b>wire</b> immersed in <b>an</b> equilibrium environment, a gas. This simple experiment eventually permitted the full development {{of one of the}} most important ideas of equilibrium statistical mechanics: the very complicated many-particle problem <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large number <b>of</b> molecules colliding with the wire, can be represented by two macroscopic parameters only, namely viscosity and the temperature. Can this idea, mathematically developed in the so-called Langevin model and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem be used to describe systems that are far from equilibrium? Here we address the question and reproduce the Gerlach and Lehrer experiment in an archetype non-equilibrium system, by immersing a sensitive torsion oscillator in <b>a</b> granular system <b>of</b> millimetre-size grains, fluidized by strong external vibrations. The vibro-fluidized granular medium is a driven environment, with continuous injection and dissipation of energy, and the immersed oscillator can be seen as analogous to an elastically bound Brownian particle. We show, by measuring the noise and the susceptibility, that the experiment can be treated, in first approximation, with the same formalism as in the equilibrium case, giving experimental access to a ''granular viscosity'' and an ''effective temperature'', however anisotropic and inhomogeneous, and yielding the surprising result that the vibro-fluidized granular matter behaves as a ''thermal'' bath satisfying a fluctuation-dissipation relation...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{electric}} and magnetic fields may change when they are observed from different frames of reference. For example, the <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> charged probe particle moving parallel to <b>a</b> current-carrying <b>wire</b> would be described by utilizing different electric or magnetic fields, depending on from which frame of reference the system is observed and described. To describe the situation in all frames by utilizing the theory of relativity, one has to first describe the situation in one particular frame, and this choice in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> current-carrying <b>wire</b> is the topic of this paper. In this study I examine an alternative to the standard choice, and consider its theoretical and experimental validity. An outcome of the alternative approach is that in the rest frame <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire,</b> running <b>a</b> current introduces also an electric field by giving rise to a minute charge. Present day experimental sensitivities, specifically those of cold ions, may be able to differentiate between the observable signatures predicted by the different approaches...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT − The paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> V-dipole by Time-Domain Method of Moments (TD-MoM) and with approximating full-wave results by an artificial neural network. In the first part, the numerical analysis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> V-dipole is described and implemented in MATLAB. The numerical solution is compared with published results. In the second part, the numerical model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> V-dipole is used as <b>a</b> teacher <b>of</b> <b>an</b> artificial neural network (ANN) from the Neural Network Toolbox of Matlab. The input patterns of ANN consist of doublets [the length of the antenna arm; the angle between the arms]. The output targets of ANN are corresponding current responses in the source cell. For modeling, three different types of ANN are used and their properties are compared. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} theoretically {{the possibility}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electron acceleration in quantum wire by short magnetic pulses lasted bewteen several to few tens of picoseconds. We show that such possibility exists provided that, the electron is initially localized {{in part of}} nanowire that consists of two vertically aligned layers which are tunnel coupled. When a horizontally directed magnetic field, changeable in time, is also perpendicular to the main axis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire,</b> it generates <b>a</b> rotational electric field in it which pushes the upper and the lower parts of the electron wavepacket in opposite directions. We have found however, that for an asymmetric vertical confinement, the majority part of charge density starts {{to move in the}} direction of local electric field in its layer but it also drags the minority part in the same direction what results in coherent <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entire wavepacket.
