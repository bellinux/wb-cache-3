25|$|Approximately 235 {{vertebrate}} {{species were}} identified {{within the boundaries}} of the park, of which 200 are threatened or under protection. These include three species of bat under pressure (of the eight that exist): greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat (Rhinoloplus euryale). Other species of particular importance: the Iberian shrew (Sorex granarius), the European pine marten (Martes martes), the wildcat (Felis silvestris), the gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica) and the snub-nosed viper (Vipera latastei). A few of the local species are protected by the Bern Convention. The red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) whose habitat is restricted and marginal in continental Portugal, is another species that is common to the park. After four centuries absent from Portuguese territory, its population began to be recorded in 1985-1986, in Viana do Castelo. There were also registered sightings in Albergaria, Lamas de Mouro and Serra da Paneda, while comparable encounters in Spain were identified across the border. Roe deer, which are a symbol of the park are encountered in prolific quantity, along the margins of the park, where they find shelter and food.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} eco paths in Bulgaria passes through the Emen Gorge {{on its way to}} the Momin Skok Waterfall. The Emen cave is located at the very {{beginning}} of the eco path. With its length of 3,113 meters, it is the 17th longest cave in Bulgaria. This has made it suitable for all kinds of human activities during the years. It has consecutively been used to grow mushrooms and mature cheese. In Communist times it even became an arms depot of a military base located immediately above it. Currently, human presence in the cave is, at least officially, restricted to allow for bats to breed uninterrupted. Bat species inhabiting the cave include: greater horseshoe bat, Blasius's horseshoe bat, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat, common bent-wing bat, greater and lesser mouse-eared bat.|$|E

50|$|European mammal fauna {{consists}} of 270 species, 78 of them endemic to Europe (15% {{of them are}} threatened with extinction and 27% {{have been identified as}} declining). There are no endemic mammal orders in the region.There live about 25 species insectivores in Europe (European hedgehog, southern white-breasted hedgehog, common shrew, Eurasian pygmy shrew, European mole, blind mole, Eurasian water shrew). Of the 35 European bats, the most widespread are the greater horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe bat, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat, greater mouse-eared bat, lesser mouse-eared bat, Bechstein's bat, Natterer's bat, whiskered bat, Daubenton's bat, brown long-eared bat, grey long-eared bat, barbastelle, serotine bat, parti-coloured bat, common pipistrelle, Nathusius' pipistrelle, lesser noctule and common noctule.The rodents include several voles (common vole, field vole, European pine vole etc.), harvest mice, hazel dormouse, garden dormouse, edible dormouse, red squirrel, striped field mouse, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, black rat, brown rat, house mouse, water vole, Cricetus. The European beaver was hunted almost to extinction, but is now being re-introduced throughout Europe. The three European lagomorphs are the European rabbit, mountain hare and European hare.Widespread and locally common ungulates are boar, moose, roe deer, red deer, reindeer, wisent, chamois and argali.Today the larger carnivores (wolves and bears) are endangered. The brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula, Scandinavia and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.). In addition, wolverine is found in the Scandinavian Mountains and polar bears may be found on Svalbard. The Eurasian wolf, the second largest predator in Europe after the bear, can be found primarily in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, with various packs in pockets of Western Europe (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.). The Italian wolf is a distinct sub-species of wolf found in the Italian Peninsula, especially amongst the Apennines. Other important European carnivores are Eurasian lynx, Iberian lynx (a distinct, yet critically endangered species), European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), European jackal, stoat, Eurasian otter, European mink, Eurasian badger and different species of martens. The only primate species (besides humans) is the re-introduced Barbary macaque; moreover, in prehistory this primate was more widely distributed in southern Europe.|$|E
40|$|During the winter, bats use {{hibernation}} as a {{means of}} surviving the period of low prey offer. However, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat (Rhinolophus euryale) arouses from torpor quite frequently. Based on the actual climatic conditions, it can profit from occasional foraging oportunities, when they occur. We analysed faeces collected on four nights during the period from November 2012 to February 2013 from the Domica-Baradla cave system (Slovakia and Hungary). In mid-November, the largest proportion of faecal contents were from Lepidoptera. Later on, the proportion of non-consumptive mass in the faeces increased and prey remnants disappeared. We analysed the activity of digestive enzymes (amylase, chitobiase, endochitinase and glukosaminidase) in faeces. The activity of these enzymes was detected in fresh faeces throughout the whole winter. The faecal activity of the chitinases was relatively stable during the monitored period, whilst the activity of amylase was highest during late November and December. Some level of active digestive enzymes during the winter could be an adaptation to occasional winter foraging...|$|E
40|$|Main goal of {{this thesis}} was to compare {{geographical}} variability of sizes of colonies in {{the relationship with the}} type of roost of 6 models of originally cave bats species: Greater mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis), Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), Common bent-wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii), Greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), Lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) a <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat (Rhinolophus euryale). The selected data set was also analyzed the possible influence of the composition of land cover in roosts around the variability {{of the size of the}} colonies. Based on compilation of literature and active communication with regional bat-monitoring coordinators, entries about size of colonies from 2 603 locations in 24 countries of Europe were collected. 1 952 entries were from roosts in buildings and 651 from caves. Based on statistical analysis, conclusive influence of type of roost on size of colonies by M. schreibersii, M. myotis a R. hipposideros was discovered. While in M. schreibersii and M. myotis are human colonies in smaller buildings, in R. hipposideros by contrast, they are larger. Simultaneously, north-west gradient in geographical distribution of maternal bat- colonies in dependence on type of roost (caves vs. buildings) : in southern areas [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In the pre-lacation, {{lactation}} and post-lactation {{periods in}} 2010 and 2011 and the pre-lactation period in 2012 we used radio-telemetry to determine changes in home range and habitat activity and preference of the maternity colony of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat (Rhinolophus euryale) in Slovak Karst. The colony roosted {{in the attic}} of the monastery in Jasov. This area represents the northern margin of the species distribution range. In total, we tagged 35 females that were radio-tracked for 31 nights. For the all pre- lactation periods 17 females were marked, in the lactation periods 12 females were marked, and 6 females were marked in the post-lactation periods. The females were marked with radiotags and the VHF telemetry (radio telemetry using very high frequencies) was used. We compared the spatial and habitat preferences in the above defined seasons of the annual reproductive cycle. The total number of recorded locations was 858 for all reported periods. We compared the varios aspects of activity of the females during {{the night in the}} particular periods. We have shown that the females left their roost in the pre-lactation periods as the most late. These were followed by the females in the lactation periods and as the most early after the sunsetthe roost was left by the females in the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Hibernating mammals arouse {{periodically}} {{from their}} torpor {{under the influence}} of an unknown mechanism to perform activities necessary for the correct functioning of metabolism. Our model species, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>horseshoe</b> bat (Rhinolophus euryale Blasius, 1853), wakes up during the winter and produces both typical consumptive as well as non-consumptive faeces (produced after no feeding activity). The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the composition of the latter droppings of R. euryale in comparison to summer droppings to better understand the processes involved in such arousals from winter hibernation. The non-consumptive samples were morphologically similar and consisted of mucous material on the outside and a homogeneous mass inside. The internal homogenous mass inside the faeces was composed of organic as well as inorganic material, consisting of phosphate, calcium carbonate, quartz particles, and clay. We also confirmed the overall presence of faecal spherulites, calcite crystals and siliceous needles. The faeces contained no cells or if some, merely fragments of them. In contrast, summer faeces were composed of insect fragments; i. e. they were typically consumptive. In addition, we found no trace of insect-prey DNA in the winter droppings, which contained bat DNA instead. We also found peptides belonging to Mammalia as well as to other craniate and eukaryotes, but Arthropoda peptides occurred in only a rudimental occurrence. We found Bacteria peptides as well. Internal parasites were also visually retrieved. The high concentration of inorganic material and virtual lack of prey observed in the non-consumptive faeces indicate that drinking as well as direct sediment consumption occur inside the cave environment during the hibernation period. We conclude that winter arousals are unlikely to be aimed at gaining energy through foraging but most likely allow regulating water balance by active drinking...|$|E
