5|$|Talking of {{the people}} who lived above the falls, Tuckey said that fowls, eggs, <b>manioc</b> and fruits were the {{property}} of women. The items were never dealt with by the men without a discussion with their wives. Beads were given as presents from the men.|$|E
5|$|Exploration and {{colonisation}} of North and South America {{resulted in}} the introduction into Europe of such crops as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and <b>manioc,</b> while the principal Old World livestock – cattle, horses, sheep and goats – were introduced into the New World {{for the first time}} along with wheat, barley, rice and turnips.|$|E
5|$|The Andes in South America has Chicha, {{made from}} germinated maize (corn); while the {{indigenous}} peoples in Brazil have Cauim, a traditional beverage made since pre-Columbian times by chewing <b>manioc</b> so that an enzyme (amylase) present in human saliva can break down the starch into fermentable sugars; {{this is similar to}} Masato in Peru.|$|E
5|$|Cuisine {{varies by}} region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common {{throughout}} the country. A typical dish {{is based on}} cocoyams, maize, cassava (<b>manioc),</b> millet, plantains, potatoes, rice, or yams, often pounded into dough-like fufu. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, groundnuts, palm oil, or other ingredients. Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions. Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and Maggi.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{he founded}} {{a mission to}} work with the Asháninka due to {{deforestation}} caused by settlers. He maintained the Cutivereni (alternate spelling Cutivireni) mission of the Ene River parish in the Peruvian Amazon, southeast of Satipo. Cutivereni was a hub for 5,000 Asháninkas who lived in the area. The mission, located at the confluence of three rivers, had 91 buildings and housed 700 people. The mission was equipped with a plaza, a chapel, a generator building, an infirmary, a bilingual school, workshops, and a landing strip. The Asháninka hunted, and farmed <b>manioc</b> other foods. They also grew cocao, a cash-crop.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{both in the}} Islamic {{world and}} in Europe, {{agriculture}} was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to Europe by way of Al-Andalus. After 1492, the Columbian exchange brought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and <b>manioc</b> to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice, and turnips, and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats to the Americas.|$|E
5|$|Much of Morondava on {{the west}} coast was flooded, after a dam near the city collapsed. Maintirano along the west coast was also damaged, as was Soavinandriana in the island's interior. In the capital city Antananarivo, 90km/h (56mph) wind gusts caused power outages and damaged part of the Rova, or the Queen's Palace. In Midongy Atismo in southeastern Madagascar, heavy {{rainfall}} flooded 80% of rice crop, and the corn and <b>manioc</b> crops were both similarly affected. These represent the staple foods of the population.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} crop of the Mikea is corn, which {{was introduced to}} Madagascar in the 1890s. They also occasionally grow <b>manioc.</b> The dry season is used to cut new corn fields, which are burned in October (swidden agriculture, locally termed hatsaky) and planted in November and December as the rains begin to fall. This corn is harvested three months later and consumed during the wet season; surplus is dried and sold, with some saved for the following year's planting and consumption. The traders who gather the maize from the Mikea process it for international export at a significant profit.|$|E
5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and <b>manioc</b> were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
5|$|Rice is the {{foundation}} of every meal, and is often eaten with fish broth, greens, beans or squash. <b>Manioc</b> and green bananas are staples most commonly eaten when other more preferable foods are too expensive or out of season. The Antankarana were historically herders and although they are now generally agriculturalists, cattle are kept for milk. They are also viewed as a form of wealth; the number of cattle one gives away indicates generosity, and the number sacrificed to the ancestors is a measure of loyalty. The sacrifice of zebu is a typical element of many major rituals and celebrations ranging from Muslim holidays to life events like marriage, death and birth.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Maya had {{diverse and}} {{sophisticated}} methods of food production. It {{was believed that}} shifting cultivation (swidden) agriculture provided most of their food, but it is now thought that permanent raised fields, terracing, intensive gardening, forest gardens, and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting the large populations of the Classic period in some areas. Indeed, evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals {{can be seen on}} aerial photographs. Contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in pre-Columbian times, and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize, <b>manioc,</b> sunflower seeds, cotton, and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC.|$|E
5|$|The toxins in A.muscaria are water-soluble. When sliced thinly, or {{finely diced}} and boiled in {{plentiful}} water until thoroughly cooked, {{it seems to}} be detoxified. Although its consumption as a food has never been widespread, the consumption of detoxified A.muscaria has been practiced in some parts of Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Félix Archimède Pouchet was a populariser and advocate of A.muscaria consumption, comparing it to <b>manioc,</b> an important food source in tropical South America that must be detoxified before consumption.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (<b>manioc).</b> Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E
25|$|Maize and <b>manioc</b> were {{introduced}} into Africa in the 16th century by the Portuguese. They are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops. Alfred W. Crosby speculated that increased production of maize, <b>manioc,</b> and other New World crops led to heavier concentrations of {{population in the}} areas from which slavers captured their victims.|$|E
25|$|The Ashanti {{prepared}} the fields by burning before {{the onset of}} the rainy season and cultivated with an iron hoe. Fields are left fallow for a couple years, usually after two to four years of cultivation. Plants cultivated include plantains, yams, <b>manioc,</b> corn, sweet potatoes, millet, beans, onions, peanuts, tomatoes, and many fruits. <b>Manioc</b> and corn are New World transplants introduced during the Atlantic European trade. Many of these vegetable crops could be harvested twice a year and the cassava (<b>manioc),</b> after a two-year growth, provides a starchy root. The Ashanti transformed palm wine, maize and millet into beer, a favorite drink; and made use of the oil from palm for many culinary and domestic uses.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of farming in the South Province {{is done on}} the sustenance level. Plantains are the major crop grown, with cocoyams being common north of Ebolowa. Maize, groundnuts, <b>manioc,</b> yams, beans, and other foodstuffs are raised in more modest quantities.|$|E
25|$|Congo's {{farmland}} is {{the source}} {{of a wide variety of}} crops. These include maize, rice, cassava (<b>manioc),</b> sweet potato, yam, taro, plantain, tomato, pumpkin and varieties of peas and nuts. These foods are eaten throughout the country, but there are also regional dishes. The most important crops for export are coffee and palm oil.|$|E
25|$|The Antandroy consume less rice {{than the}} average Malagasy because of the extreme aridity of Toliara province. They have rather subsisted on a {{traditional}} diet of maize, sweet potato, <b>manioc,</b> and zebu milk and curd. Other staples include yams, taro root, and millet, generally boiled in water and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts.|$|E
25|$|In {{other parts}} of the world very {{different}} species were domesticated. In the Americas squash, maize, beans, and perhaps <b>manioc</b> (also known as cassava) formed the core of the diet. In East Asia millet, rice, and soy were the most important crops. Some areas of the world such as Southern Africa, Australia, California and southern South America never saw local species domesticated.|$|E
25|$|The Aché {{economy was}} {{traditionally}} centered on hunting vertebrate game with bow and arrow, extracting wild honey, and exploiting palm starch and insect larvae. Numerous fruits were also exploited seasonally, but they constitute {{only a small}} fraction of the energy in the yearly diet. In the last half century before pacification, Aché groups occasionally raided their settled neighbors for <b>manioc</b> root (a starchy staple), domestic animals, and metal tools.|$|E
25|$|Recife cuisine is {{the cuisine}} of its region, Pernambuco and the Northeast, and the culinary {{influences}} {{of the area}} {{can be traced to}} a dynamic assortment of cultures: the Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, Moors, Africans and Indigenous. Many dishes come with a delicious coconut sauce, palm oil (dendê) and feature corn, <b>manioc</b> roots, yam, fresh seafood (shrimp, crab, lobster cooked with exotic sauces) and native fruits. Grilled meats are also widely served, especially goat and beef dishes.|$|E
25|$|The Valdivia people farmed maize, a small bean (now rare) of the Canavalia family, cotton, and achira (Canna edulis). Indirect {{evidence}} suggests that maté, coca, and <b>manioc</b> were also cultivated. They also consumed substantial amounts of fish. Archaeological evidence from the Late Valdivia shows a decline in life expectancy to approximately 21 years. This decline is attributed {{to an increase in}} infectious disease, accumulation of waste, water pollution, and a deterioration in diet, all of which are associated with agriculture itself.|$|E
25|$|Cyanides are {{produced}} by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found {{in a number of}} plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches. In plants, cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called <b>manioc),</b> an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Ages, {{both in the}} Islamic {{world and}} in Europe, {{agriculture}} was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to Europe by way of Al-Andalus. After 1492, the Columbian exchange brought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and <b>manioc</b> to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice and turnips, and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep and goats to the Americas.|$|E
25|$|Cauim is a {{traditional}} alcoholic beverage of the Native American populations of Brazil since pre-Columbian times. It is still made today in remote areas throughout Panama and South America. Cauim {{is very similar to}} chicha and it is also made by fermenting <b>manioc</b> or maize, sometimes flavored with fruit juices. The Kuna Indians of Panama use plantains. A characteristic feature of the beverage is that the starting material is cooked, chewed, and re-cooked prior to fermentation. As in the making of chicha, enzymes from the saliva of the cauim maker breakdown the starches into fermentable sugars.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a total}} {{absence of}} comals, metates and manos meaning the Totonacs did not eat tortillas; however, even though corn was grown it did not form {{a large part of}} their diet. The Totonacs ate fruit, most notably zapotes, guavas, papayas, plantains and avocados. Men hunted and fished shark, turtle, deer, armadillo, opossums, and frogs. Women raised turkeys and dogs. Peasants as well as nobles ate corn {{porridge}} in the morning. Lunch was the main meal of the day and consisted of <b>manioc,</b> bean stew or even a rich meat sauce for the nobles. Fish and seafood as well as game was eaten by both nobles and farmers. The agave provided liquor.|$|E
25|$|For dessert, Recife offers bolo de rolo (cake roll), cake Souza Leão, and cartola (top hat cake) which {{consists}} of fried long bananas with cheese topped with cinnamon and sugar. The diversity continues for the breakfast as one can find cuscuz of sweet corn or <b>manioc,</b> yams and cassava with charque (corned beef or beef jerky), sweet potato, goiabada, fried long banana, mugunzá, regional fruits, bread, tapioca, rice pudding, porridge, yogurt, queijo coalho, corn bread, hominy and pamonha. Breakfast is often accompanied by coffee and/or milk and juices from regional fruits such as cashew, pineapple, mangoes, acerola, guava, passion fruit, umbu, hog plum, pitanga, jackfruit, orange, avocado and the regionally most famous caldo-de-cana and água-de-coco juices.|$|E
25|$|By the 15th century AD, {{the farming}} Bakongo people (ba being the plural prefix) were unified as the Kingdom of Kongo under a ruler called the manikongo, {{residing}} in the fertile Pool Malebo area on the lower Congo River. The capital was M'banza-Kongo. With superior organization, {{they were able to}} conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the manikongo. Later, maize (corn) and cassava (<b>manioc)</b> would be introduced to the region via trade with the Portuguese at their ports at Luanda and Benguela. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing millet as a main staple.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{regional}} main dishes include caldeirada (seafood stew with octopus {{cooked with}} various spices and coconut milk, {{which may be}} served with white beans or toasted cassava flour), feijoada Pernambucana (made with brown beans instead of black), sarapatel, buchada (goat stew), dobradinha (bean stew), roast goat, mão de vaca (cow's foot stew), Rabada (ox tail stew with <b>manioc</b> flour), cozido Pernambucano (beef stew), chambaril, galinha de cabidela (chicken in blood sauce), peixada Pernambucana (fish stew), macaxeira com charque (cassava with beef jerky), quiabada (okra with beef), feijão com arroz (rice and beans), and guaiamuns (giant crabs). One of the most traditional dishes, is Carne-de-sol (Sun-dried beef), which consists of beef dried {{in the sun and}} usually served with green beans.|$|E
25|$|P. sericea is {{a species}} that is {{historically}} and culturally significant to the Pankararé Indians who live in northwest Brazil. They have developed a folk taxonomy of many social bees and wasps that inhabit the area. Polybia sericea is classified as a fierce wasp {{that is likely to}} bite more than once. This classification contrasts with other findings that describe this species as docile, and not aggressive unless provoked. The Pankararé often roast the combs of Polybia sericea larvae, and then extract them to be eaten alone or mixed with <b>manioc</b> flour. In addition, they use this species in their healing practices. A bath of smoke from burning the nests of Polybia sericea is used to treat evil eye and stroke.|$|E
25|$|Maize (corn), {{beans and}} squash {{were among the}} {{earliest}} crops domesticated in Mesoamerica, with maize beginning about 7500 BC, squash, as early as 8000 to 6000 BC and beans by no later than 4000 BC. Potatoes and <b>manioc</b> were domesticated in South America. In {{what is now the}} eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated sunflower, sumpweed and goosefoot around 2500 BC. At Guilá Naquitz cave in the Mexican highlands, fragments of maize pollen, bottle gourd and pepo squash were recovered and variously dated between 8000 and 7000 BC. In this area of the world people relied on hunting and gathering for several millennia to come. Sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the second millennium BC, referred to as the formative period.|$|E
25|$|The {{abolition}} {{of slavery in}} European colonies in 1834, however, posed a problem for sugar plantations as their operations were highly dependent on slave labor. There was a demand for cheaper intensive labor, as the now emancipated slaves were negotiating for higher wages and better living conditions. As a result, {{the government of the}} British Empire conceived of a plan to replace the former enslaved Africans with laborers {{from other parts of the}} world. The first wave of new plantation workers were laborers from the Portuguese island of Madeira, freed African slaves from America and impoverished Chinese seeking greener pasture. Even though the ethnicity of the plantation workers had changed, the poor working conditions and low living standards remained. These laborers, in the end, could not withstand the <b>manioc</b> root and subsistence cultivation.|$|E
25|$|The {{archaeological site}} was {{occupied}} from approximately AD 600 to AD 1700 continuously {{and into the}} present, intermittently. This site participated in the Indian Ocean trade network and is currently the most southern located site on the eastern African coast. Archaeological samples at the site revealed that Chibuene's occupation contained two major periods of occupation. The objects presented in the lower deposits contained glazed and unglazed pottery, glass, iron fragments, and beads made of shell and glass. The upper layers contained a distinguishable change in ceramic typology. In addition, two types of imported glazed pottery have been recovered from the site. The main subsistence pattern of {{the inhabitants of the}} site appeared to derive from the coast which included fish, marine mammals, and reptiles. Additionally, contemporary farmers in the region produce maize, sorghum, <b>manioc,</b> beans, and peanuts.|$|E
25|$|Ehoala {{phase of}} Anosy with focus on {{irrigated}} rice, but <b>manioc</b> {{had also been}} introduced. Settlements were smaller and located primarily in upper valleys away from coast. Cattle and slaves continued to be exported. By {{the time of the}} arrival of French in Anosy, warfare in the region had been happening for so long it was endemic. This was {{in part because of the}} multiple chiefdoms and even mini-kingdoms in this area. Most villages were found up to a day's walk from the ocean—possibly a defensive response to the growing number of vazaha (foreigners) anchoring in their bays. The various Raondriana ("princes") power was a function of their alliances with ombiasy (traditional diviner-healers) and scribes (using a form of Arabic script to write Malagasy), as well as how many soldiers they had available for battles with other Raondriana (Rakotoarisoa, 1998).|$|E
25|$|In Latin America, chicha {{is still}} widely {{produced}} {{by women and}} consumed daily by adults and children, as it typically has a low alcohol content. In Ecuador women harvest yucca, boil the roots, pound it into a paste and then chew the paste, {{in much the same}} way as their ancestors did, to break down the starches and begin the fermentation process. Peruvian women make their version of chicha using the same method, but with corn. In Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, among Amazonian Indians, chicha, made from corn, or algarroba beer made from carob seed, as well as beer produced from mixing corn or <b>manioc</b> with apples, melons, papaya, pears, pumpkin, quince, strawberries and sweet potatoes are brewed by women. Bolivian women make beer from roasted barley, which is then chewed to begin the fermentation process and is served daily as a dietary supplement.|$|E
25|$|In {{variation}} to {{rice and}} beans, Brazilians usually eat pasta (including spaghetti, lasagne, yakisoba, lamen, and bīfun), pasta salad, various dishes using either potato or <b>manioc,</b> and polenta as substitutions for rice, {{as well as}} salads, dumplings or soups of green peas, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, broad beans, , soybeans, lentils, moyashi (which came to Brazil due to the Japanese tradition of eating its sprouts), azuki, and other legumes in substitution for the common beans cultivated in South America since Pre-Columbian times. It is more common to eat substitutions for daily rice and beans in festivities such as Christmas and New Year's Eve (the tradition is lentils), as follow-up of churrasco (mainly potato salad/carrot salad, called maionese, due to {{the widespread use of}} both industrial and home-made mayonnaise, which can include egg whites, raw onion, green peas, sweetcorn or even chayote squashes, and pronounced almost exactly as in English and French) and in other special occasions.|$|E
