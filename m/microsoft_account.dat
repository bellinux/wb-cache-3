5|$|Windows Mobile 6.5, Windows RT {{and core}} edition of Windows 8.1 include device encryption, a feature-limited version of BitLocker that encrypts the whole system. Logging {{in with a}} <b>Microsoft</b> <b>account</b> with {{administrative}} privileges automatically begins the encryption process. The recovery key is stored to either the <b>Microsoft</b> <b>account</b> or Active Directory, allowing it to be retrieved from any computer. While device encryption is offered on all versions of 8.1, unlike BitLocker, device encryption requires that the device meet the InstantGo (formerly Connected Standby) specifications, which requires solid-state drives, non-removable RAM (to protect against cold boot attacks) and a TPM 2.0 chip.|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, Microsoft {{discontinued}} the Nokia Sync service, {{which used}} Nokia's account service to synchronize contacts and general phone information, {{in favour of}} other offerings such as Microsoft OneDrive, which uses <b>Microsoft</b> <b>accounts</b> {{as part of the}} transition from Nokia <b>accounts</b> to <b>Microsoft</b> <b>accounts.</b>|$|R

The ability to automatically install a Windows Store app across all devices associated with an account was also removed.|$|E

25|$|Windows 8 {{provides}} heavier {{integration with}} online services from Microsoft and others. A user can now log into Windows with a <b>Microsoft</b> <b>account,</b> {{which can be}} used to access services and synchronize applications and settings between devices. Windows 8 also ships with a client app for Microsoft's SkyDrive cloud storage service, which also allows apps to save files directly to SkyDrive. A SkyDrive client for the desktop and File Explorer is not included in Windows 8, and must be downloaded separately. Bundled multimedia apps are provided under the Xbox brand, including Xbox Music, Xbox Video, and the Xbox SmartGlass companion for use with an Xbox 360 console.

500|$|Certain {{aspects of}} Windows 8.1 were also {{cause for concern}} because of their privacy implications. In his review of Windows 8.1, Joel Hruska noted that Microsoft had {{deliberately}} made it harder for users to create a [...] "Local" [...] account that is not tied to a <b>Microsoft</b> <b>account</b> for syncing, as it [...] " [...] clear that the company really, really, wants you to share everything you do with it, and that’s not something {{an increasing number of}} people and businesses are comfortable doing." [...] Woody Leonhard of InfoWorld noted that by default Windows 8.1's [...] "Smart Search" [...] system sends search queries and other information to Microsoft, which could be used for targeted advertising. Leonhard considered this to be ironic, given that Microsoft had criticized Google's use of similar tactics with its [...] "Scroogled" [...] advertising campaign.|$|E
500|$|On {{compatible}} hardware, Windows 8.1 {{also features}} a transparent [...] "device encryption" [...] system based on BitLocker. Encryption begins {{as soon as a}} user begins using the system; the recovery key is stored to either the user's <b>Microsoft</b> <b>account</b> or an Active Directory login, allowing it to be retrieved from any computer. While device encryption is offered on all versions of Windows 8.1 unlike BitLocker (which is exclusive to the Pro and Enterprise editions), device encryption requires that the device meet the Connected Standby specification and have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 chip. Windows 8.1 also introduces improved fingerprint recognition APIs, which allows user login, User Account Control, Windows Store and Windows Store apps to use enrolled fingerprints as an authentication method. A new kiosk mode known as [...] "Assigned Access" [...] was also added, allowing a device to be configured to use a single app in a restricted environment. Additionally, Windows Defender includes an intrusion detection system which can scan network activity for signs of malware. Windows 8.1 also allows third-party VPN clients to automatically trigger connections.|$|E
500|$|Microsoft Services Agreement reads {{that the}} company's online {{services}} may automatically [...] "download software updates or configuration changes, {{including those that}} prevent you from accessing the Services, playing counterfeit games, or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices." [...] Critics interpreted this statement as implying that Microsoft would scan for and delete unlicensed software installed on devices running Windows10. However, others pointed out that this agreement was specifically for Microsoft online services such as <b>Microsoft</b> <b>account,</b> Office 365, Skype, as well as Xbox Live, and that the offending passage most likely referred to digital rights management on Xbox consoles and first-party games, and not plans to police pirated video games installed on Windows10 PCs. Despite this, some torrent trackers announced plans to block Windows10 users, also arguing that the operating system could send information to anti-piracy groups that are affiliated with Microsoft. Writing about these allegations, Ed Bott of ZDNet compared Microsoft's privacy policy to Apple's and Google's and concluded that [...] "after carefully reading the Microsoft Services Agreement, the Windows license agreement...and the Microsoft Privacy Statement carefully, I don't see anything that looks remotely like Big Brother." [...] Columnist Kim Komando argued that [...] "Microsoft might in the future run scans and disable software or hardware it sees as a security threat," [...] consistent with the Windows10 update policy.|$|E

On January 8, 2013, Microsoft emailed Messenger users and informed them that with the exception of mainland China, the Messenger service would stop working on March 15, 2013, and users would not be able to sign in.|$|R

500|$|On May 26, 1995, Bill Gates {{sent the}} [...] "Internet Tidal Wave" [...] {{memorandum}} to Microsoft executives. The memo described Netscape with their Netscape Navigator as a [...] "new competitor 'born' on the Internet." [...] The memo outlines Microsoft's failure {{to grasp the}} Internet's importance, and in it Gates assigned [...] "the Internet {{the highest level of}} importance" [...] from then on. Microsoft began to expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web. On August 24, 1995, it launched a major online service, MSN (Microsoft Network), as a direct competitor to AOL. MSN became an umbrella service for Microsoft's online services, using Microsoft Passport (now called a <b>Microsoft</b> <b>account)</b> as a universal login system for all of its web sites. The company continued to branch out into new markets in 1996, starting with a joint venture with NBC to create a new 24-hour cable news television station, MSNBC. The station was launched on July 15, 1996 to compete with similar news outlets such as CNN. Microsoft also launched Slate, an online magazine edited by Michael Kinsley, which offered political and social commentary along with the cartoon Doonesbury. In an attempt to extend its reach in the consumer market, the company acquired WebTV, which enabled consumers to access the Web from their televisions. Microsoft entered the personal digital assistant (PDA) market in November with Windows CE 1.0, a new built-from-scratch version of their flagship operating system, designed to run on low-memory, low-performance machines, such as handhelds and other small computers. 1996 saw the release of Windows NT 4.0, which brought the Windows 95 GUI and Windows NT kernel together.|$|E
2500|$|Sarah Mitroff of CNET {{criticized the}} {{requirement}} of having a <b>Microsoft</b> <b>account</b> to make edits. For the Windows 10 version, Barry Collins said [...] "we’re largely underwhelmed by the Office apps on Windows. At best, they’re {{as good as the}} equivalents for iOS and Android.

2500|$|Messenger (formerly MSN Messenger Service, [...]NET Messenger Service and Windows Live Messenger Service) was {{an instant}} {{messaging}} and presence system developed by Microsoft in 1999 for use with its MSN Messenger software.
