5|$|Pong {{quickly became}} a success {{and was the first}} commercially {{successful}} video game, which helped to establish the video game industry along with the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that copied Pongs gameplay, and eventually released new types of games. As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce <b>more</b> <b>innovative</b> games. The company released several sequels that built upon the original's gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores. It was also a commercial success and led to numerous copies. The game has been remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. Pong has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows and video games, and {{has been a part of}} several video game and cultural exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} only Mario at the journey's beginning. Ultimately, {{the player}} will gain {{a party of}} five characters, though only three members can be used during a battle at any given time. Mario is always in the player's party, but the other two characters can be selected before battles. Each of the five characters has {{a unique set of}} attacks and techniques. For example, Princess Toadstool's abilities are primarily healing techniques, whereas Geno and Bowser have offensive attacks that deal high amounts of damage. The combat is based on a traditional turn based battle system with the addition of action commands that amplify a move's effects. The player starts each turn by choosing to attack, defend, run, use an item, or perform magic from the combat menu. The action command consists of timed button presses during an attack, special move, defense, or item usage. This is one of the <b>more</b> <b>innovative</b> features of gameplay, becoming a mainstay of later Mario RPGs.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{state-owned}} enterprises {{are owned by}} a variety of actors such as local governments and governmental agencies. They may benefit from advantages not available for smaller, <b>more</b> <b>innovative</b> firms which have been seen as problematic. In 2010 state owned enterprises won many biddings for renewable energy projects since they did not have worry about paying off investments for several decades and could ignore risks and costs. The owners may attempt to protect their enterprises from competition by regulations or otherwise use their influence in an unfair manner which may stifle <b>more</b> <b>innovative,</b> private competitors. Private enterprises surpassed stated owned enterprises during the 2002-2007 period regarding rapidity of increase of research spending, patent applications, and R laboratories. The number of research scientists and engineers increased rapidly in private enterprises while they declined in state owned enterprises.|$|E

25|$|The fu style {{typical of}} Han poetry also took shape {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu in his court, with poet and {{official}} Sima Xiangru as a leading figure. However, Sima's initial interest in the chu ci style later gave way to his interest in <b>more</b> <b>innovative</b> forms of poetry. After his patronage of poets familiar with the Chu ci style {{in the early part of}} his reign, Emperor Wu later seems to have turned his interest and his court's interest to other literary fashions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of artistic movements, Harvey Quaytman was {{considered}} an anachronism. During his career, from the late 1960s to late 1990s, he continued to relentlessly explore Geometric Abstraction and Modernism - fields in which the innovation had been considered largely developed {{by the end of}} the 1950s and 1960s. Yet he pushed ahead, and according to critics he became bolder over time - <b>more</b> <b>innovative,</b> assured and successful in each decade.

The grammatical number of nouns is indicated by the use of articles; the nouns themselves are unmarked for number.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>more</b> <b>innovative</b> {{areas of}} YCT’s {{curriculum}} is an unprecedented emphasis on pastoral care and professional development. Whereas {{it is common}} in other rabbinical schools to offer a semester or a year of pastoral counseling courses, YCT’s program spans the entire four year curriculum. The pastoral counseling program is taught by leading psychiatric professionals, and includes formal classroom instruction, role-playing, clinical experience and mentored field work. The program places particular emphasis on topics that rabbis regularly encounter: religious doubt and personal change; rites of passage; adolescence; substance abuse; marital and family problems; sexual function and dysfunction; homosexuality; domestic violence; loss, tragedy and bereavement; and response to catastrophe.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd {{selected}} the Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX radial engine {{to power the}} Whitley, which was capable of generating 795 horsepower. One of the <b>more</b> <b>innovative</b> features of the Whitley's design was {{the adoption of a}} three-bladed two-position variable-pitch propeller built by de Havilland; the Whitley was the first aircraft to fly with such an arrangement. As Lloyd was unfamiliar with the use of flaps on a large heavy monoplane, they were initially omitted from the design. To compensate, the mid-set wings were set at a high angle of incidence (8.5°) to confer good take-off and landing performance. Although flaps were included late in the design stage, the wing remained unaltered; as a result, the Whitley flew with a pronounced nose-down attitude when flown with the wings in the cruising position, resulting in considerable drag.|$|E
