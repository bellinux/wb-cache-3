5|$|The Pleasure Beach Bridge is a movable Warren through-truss {{bridge in}} Bridgeport, Connecticut. Completed in 1927, it {{functioned as a}} toll bridge until the Great Depression, when it was {{transferred}} to the city of Bridgeport. Its service life came to an end after it was badly damaged by fire in 1996, cutting off access to Pleasure Beach. In the decade following the fire, several bonds to fund a new bridge were proposed, but ultimately fell through. Pleasure Beach has become the subject of debate, whether it will become an undisturbed protected salt marsh or be revitalized. An alternate method of access via water taxi service, first <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> grant in 2009, was not realized until 2013.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} cases where RTHK's {{editorial}} independence has been fully exemplified. There was one episode in Letter to Hong Kong (香港家書) (a programme in which important government officials read letters on Hong Kong matters on air to the public) was rescheduled for another more timely and newsworthy one.

25|$|GPCRs {{respond to}} {{extracellular}} signals mediated {{by a huge}} diversity of agonists, ranging from proteins to biogenic amines to protons, but all transduce this signal via a mechanism of G-protein coupling.

25|$|Some squamate species (e.g., pythons {{and monitor}} lizards) have three-chambered hearts that become {{functionally}} four-chambered hearts during contraction. This is <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> muscular ridge that subdivides the ventricle during ventricular diastole and completely divides it during ventricular systole. Because of this ridge, {{some of these}} squamates are capable of producing ventricular pressure differentials that are equivalent to those seen in mammalian and avian hearts.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-16th century, Portugal {{had succeeded}} in {{establishing}} a sugar economy {{in parts of the}} colony's northeastern coast. Sugar production, the first large-scale colonial agricultural enterprise, was <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of favorable conditions. Portugal had the agricultural and manufacturing know-how from its Atlantic islands and manufactured its own equipment for extracting sugar from sugarcane. Furthermore, being involved in the African slave trade, it had access to the necessary manpower. Finally, Portugal relied on the commercial skills of the Dutch and financing from Holland to enable a rapid penetration of sugar in Europe's markets.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Reformation of 1560 decisively {{shaped the}} Church of Scotland.
