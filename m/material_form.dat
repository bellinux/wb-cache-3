5|$|In the Computer Edge case, the Australian court {{decided against}} the then-prevailing {{opinions}} in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) and ruled object code was not copyrightable, while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v. Mackintosh reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was {{a translation of}} source code and embodied in a silicon chip, it was therefore a translation of an original literary work expressed in a <b>material</b> <b>form</b> and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of copyright. The Canadian court opined that programs within ROM silicon chips are protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code {{is a form of}} translation. It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an idea in another form, but rather only applies to the expression of an idea in another language, and that a translation has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages.|$|E
5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in <b>material</b> <b>form</b> and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E

25|$|Ajivikas {{believed}} {{that in every}} being there is a soul (Atman). However, unlike Jains and various orthodox schools of Hinduism that held that soul is formless, Ajivikas asserted that soul has a <b>material</b> <b>form,</b> one that helps meditation. They also {{believed that}} the soul passes through many births and ultimately progresses unto its pre-destined nirvana (salvation). Basham states, that some texts suggest evidence of Vaishnavism-type devotional practices among some Ajivikas.|$|E
25|$|Buddhist teachings {{explain the}} moment-to-moment {{manifestation of the}} mind-stream. The {{components}} {{that make up the}} mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., <b>material</b> <b>form,</b> feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws. The Buddhist practice of mindfulness involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.|$|E
25|$|The Pancaratra texts {{present the}} Vyuhas theory of avatars {{to explain how}} the {{absolute}} reality (Brahman) manifests into <b>material</b> <b>form</b> of ever changing reality (Vishnu avatar). Vasudeva, state the Pancaratra texts, goes through a series of emanations, where new avatars of him appear. This theory of avatar formation syncretically integrates the theories of evolution of matter and life developed by the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy. These texts also present cosmology, methods of worship, tantra, Yoga and principles behind the design and building of Vaishnava temples (Mandira nirmana). These texts have guided religiosity and temple ceremonies in many Vaishnava communities, particularly in South India.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{division of}} the material and spiritual is not altogether foreign to the Avesta; Geti and Mainyu (middle Persian: menog) are terms in Mazdaist tradition, where Ahura Mazda {{is said to have}} created all first in its spiritual, then later in its <b>material</b> <b>form.</b> But the material Zurvanites redefined menog to suit Aristotelian principles to mean ‘that which did not (yet) have matter’, or alternatively, ‘that which was still the unformed primal matter’. Even this is not necessarily a violation of orthodox Zoroastrian tradition, since the divinity Vayu is present in the middle space between Ormuzd and Ahriman, the void separating the kingdoms of light and darkness.|$|E
25|$|In Vaishnava mythology, such {{as those}} {{presented}} in the Bhagavata Purana and the Pancaratra, whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because the evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance, an avatar of Vishnu appears in a <b>material</b> <b>form,</b> to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the everpresent forces of good and evil. The most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism, are Krishna, Rama, Narayana and Vasudeva. These names have extensive literature associated with them, {{each has its own}} characteristics, legends and associated arts. The Mahabharata, for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana includes Rama.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the {{organization}} of covalent bonds, recall that classic molecular solids, as stated above, consist of small, non-polar covalent molecules. The example given, paraffin wax, {{is a member of}} a family of hydrocarbon molecules of differing chain lengths, with high-density polyethylene at the long-chain end of the series. High-density polyethylene can be a strong material: when the hydrocarbon chains are well aligned, the resulting fibers rival the strength of steel. The covalent bonds in this <b>material</b> <b>form</b> extended structures, but do not form a continuous network. With cross-linking, however, polymer networks can become continuous, and a series of materials spans the range from Cross-linked polyethylene, to rigid thermosetting resins, to hydrogen-rich amorphous solids, to vitreous carbon, diamond-like carbons, and ultimately to diamond itself. As this example shows, there can be no sharp boundary between molecular and network covalent solids.|$|E

The semi-analytical method of sensitivity analysis of inverse problems is very attractive thanks to the compromise between computational time and ease of derivatives evaluation.

Individuals composing society do not directly cause suicide: suicide, {{as a social}} fact, exists independently in society, and is caused by other social facts (such as rules governing behavior and group attachment), whether an individual likes it or not. Whether a person [...] "leaves" [...] a society does not alter {{the fact that this}} society will still contain suicides. Suicide, like other immaterial social facts, exists independently of the will of an individual, cannot be eliminated, and is as influential – coercive – as physical laws such as gravity. Sociology's task thus consists of discovering the qualities and characteristics of such social facts, which can be discovered through a quantitative or experimental approach (Durkheim extensively relied on statistics).|$|E
