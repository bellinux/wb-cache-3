50|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>damage</b> {{may occur}} from over-speeding (running at a {{rotational}} speed {{in excess of}} design limits) if the unit is operated with no significant mechanical load. On larger motors, sudden loss of load is to be avoided, {{and the possibility of}} such an occurrence is incorporated into the motor's protection and control schemes. In some smaller applications, a fan blade attached to the shaft often acts as an artificial load to limit the motor speed to a safe level, as well as a means to circulate cooling airflow over the armature and field windings. If there were no mechanical limits placed on a universal motor it could theoretically speed out of control in the same way any series-wound DC motor can.|$|E

However, the snow - which was not deep enough for snowploughs or snow blowers to be effective - was unusually soft and powdery, finding its way into electrical systems and causing short circuits and traction <b>motor</b> <b>damage</b> in trains. For traction motors with integral cooling fans and air intakes pointing downwards - the type that is still common on British electric multiple units - the problem was made worse as the air intakes sucked up the loose snow. Meanwhile, the snow also became packed into sliding door mechanisms and into points, causing them to fail. In addition, low temperatures resulted in problems with electric current collection from the third rail.|$|E

50|$|The main {{generator}} was a 12-pole machine with the rating changed to , 780/545V, 1050/1500A at 750 rpm. (The continuous rating {{has also been}} quoted as , 630V, 1300A). The four traction motors were now connected as series parallel pairs being rated at , 315V, 650A at 460 rpm, with a gear ratio 18:67. Pairs of motors connected in series provided a higher maximum tractive effort (usually quoted as 45000 lbf kN although 47000 lbf kN could be achieved) but the downside being that a series pair connected machine was more prone to slipping than one with an all parallel grouping. Full power was available between 7 and 77.5 mi/h km/h, an improvement over Class 25/0 locomotives with all other ratings unchanged from the earlier series. The traction motor’s continuous rating of 650 amps was not far removed from its one-hour short term or 'emergency' rating of 680 amps, and this could only be monitored manually. On heavy trains close monitoring of the ammeters was necessary to avoid <b>motor</b> <b>damage.</b> Though the body shell remained similar to D5151 {{there were a number}} of refinements. The air horns were relocated to either side of the headcode panel. The cab skirt and body fairing were discontinued, though the support lugs remained. A new driving control panel was fitted. The fuel and water tanks were also redesigned with a fuel capacity of 510 imp gal (also quoted in sources as being 500 or 560 imp gal).|$|E

40|$|Insurance is a fi nancial {{service in}} which {{consumption}} is highly {{affected by the}} characteristics of the potential buyer and his perceptions about the offered product. Motor insurance with its two components – the Motor Third Party Liability Insurance (MTPL) and the <b>Motor</b> <b>Damage</b> insurance – constitutes the largest line of business of the non-life insurance sector in Europe. The present study models the voluntary <b>motor</b> <b>damage</b> insurance consumer behaviour using discrete choice models, hypothesizing a hierarchical and a non-hierarchical decision. The sample consists of 311 car owners from Cluj County, Romania. The econometric estimations use binary logit, multinomial logit and nested logit models. The predictive power of these models is compared by means of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for discrete choice models. The results reveal that the main factors affecting the purchase of a voluntary motor insurance policy are risk preference/aversion, the distance travelled by car, the driver’s education level and the ratio between the driver’s income and the car price. In contrast to previous studies who estimated the risk profi le only through proxy variables without accounting for any behavioural aspects, our study has successfully integrated the risk profi le of the policyholders as a self-standing explanatory variable. Since the explanatory variables are representative not only for a particular geographical area, the highlighted behaviour may be applied to all cases where <b>motor</b> <b>damage</b> insurance is voluntary...|$|E
40|$|In {{over thirty}} years of {{clinical}} observation of cerebral palsied (CP) children, especially among premature babies with bilateral <b>motor</b> <b>damage,</b> we have repeatedly found a group of patients with a unique combination of clinical characteristics which, we believe, could represent a specific group within the CP categorization. For convenience, we have termed them dysperceptive {{and we have been}} studying their behavior in a fairly large group of patients in order to see if some phenomena, unmistakably observed in single cases, were recognizable, also in different degrees, in larger groups. We have maintained the term perceptual disturbance or dysperception for the first and most interesting hypothesis that the errors performed by these children could happen during the collection, interpretation, and re-elaboration of information, especially of the sense of movement, even if other fascinating theories can be found especially in the field of psychology. These complex behaviors, for example fear, can be observed during clinical examination or physiotherapeutic treatments. In addition, parents and older children often describe some specific situations, which are recurrent and typical, that take place in everyday life in different settings (at school, on holiday, with friends, etc.), often underlining the limitations produced by these phenomena regarding motor independence and quality of life. These signs can be observed in CP children with diverse <b>motor</b> <b>damage</b> (diplegia, tetraplegia, but not hemiplegia) and at different development levels. In order to explore consistency and recurrence of the more important or frequent dysperceptive signs, describe them in detail and collect evidence by suitable instruments, we have been and are still employing video recording sessions (natural history of these signs).

It is inapplicable when some parties may want to keep the confidentiality of their collaborative partners for privacy and other business reasons, or the trustworthy party is not available. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that allows each party to jointly conduct local atomicity checking with its direct partners. It is based on iterative forwarding and regression of compensability properties between each pair of direct partners. This approach is applied to a case study based on a real-life insurance process in the <b>motor</b> <b>damage</b> claims domain...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea that}} the damaged brain can {{functionally}} reorganize itself ⎯ so when one part fails, there lies the possibility for another to substitute ⎯ is an exciting discovery of the twentieth century. We now know that motor circuits once presumed to be hardwired are not, and motor-skill learning, exercise, and even mental rehearsal of motor tasks can turn genes on or off to shape brain architecture, function and, consequently, behavior. This is a very significant alteration from our previously static view of the brain, and has profound implications for the rescue of function after a motor injury. Presentation of the right cues, applied in relevant spatiotemporal geometries, is required to awaken the dormant plastic forces essential for repair. The focus of this review is to highlight {{some of the recent}} progress in neural interfaces designed to harness motor plasticity, and the role of miniaturization in development of strategies that engage diverse elements of the neuronal machinery to synergistically facilitate recovery of function after <b>motor</b> <b>damage...</b>|$|E

Regarding to this important role, the early detection of induction <b>motor</b> <b>damage</b> becomes important for system operation, so that it could not stopped without scheduled. The types of damage that often occur in induction motor are mechanical unbalance, rotor damage and bearing damage. The usual detection method which uses vibration measurments has some disadvanteages such as it is very expensive, physical contact with the induction motor that occurs and the sensors are less heat resistant on induction motor. The author uses sound signal detection method that is cheaper regarding to the cost, it has no physiscal contact with the induction motor and heat resistant. The sound signal is generated by the exicitation of the artificial damage which is provided to the induction motor. Artificial damage is given by damaging the bearing, rotor and mass unbalance. Sound signal data from artificial damage test result on induction motor is processed by using fast fourier transform method. The result of the research obtains the amplitude increased number for one time motor rotation 2970 rpm (1 xrpm) is 49. 5 Hz, 144. 5 Hz for bearing damage frequency and 78. 5 Hz for the rotor damage frequency...|$|E

Here, we analyze this complex response in Escherichia coli using standard fluorescence microscope optics for excitation at 440 � 5 nm. The slow swimming and paralysis occurred only in dye-containing growth media or buffers. Excitation elicited complete paralysis within a second in 1 �M proflavine dye, implying specific <b>motor</b> <b>damage,</b> but prolonged tumbling in buffer alone. The tumbling half-response times were subsecond for onset {{but more than}} a minute for recovery. The response required the chemotaxis signal protein CheY and receptordependent activation of its kinase CheA. The study of deletion mutants revealed a specific requirement for either the aerotaxis receptor Aer or the chemoreceptor Tar but not the Tar homolog Tsr. The action spectrum of the wild-type response was consistent with a flavin, but the chromophores remain to be identified. The motile response processed via Aer was sustained, with recovery to either step-up or-down taking {{more than a minute}}. The response processed via Tar was transient, recovering on second time scales comparable to chemotactic responses. The response duration and amplitude were dependent on relative expression of Aer, Tar, and Tsr. The main response features were reproduced when each receptor was expressed singly from a plasmid in a receptorless host strain. However, time-resolved motion analysis revealed subtle kinetic differences that reflect the role of receptor cluster interactions in kinase activation-deactivation dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Objective and setting: To {{quantify}} electromyographic and neurographic {{changes and}} correlate {{them with the}} clinical data of a consecutive, non select, series of outpatients with herpes zoster (HZ). Design: Prospective study of case series. Patients: 158 cases of herpes zoster of head and limbs: 88 women, 70 men, mean age 64 years. Methods: Blink reflex (BR) and electromyography, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities of nerves and muscles of the myotomes corresponding to affected dermatomes. Results: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), segmental zoster paresis (SZP) and polyneuropathy were found in 31 %, 19 % and 2. 5 % of cases. Absence of reduction of sensory action potential amplitudes, BR areas and compound muscle action potential amplitudes were found in 60 %, 32 % and 18 % of cases. Sensory and motor conduction velocities, and motor and BR latencies were nearly always normal or only slightly slowed. Electromyographic signs of denervation were found in 36 % of cases. Electrophysiological alterations were correlated among themselves, with age, with presence of SZP and with absence of antiviral therapy. The extension of the skin manifestations was the only variable predictive of disappearance or improvement of PHN. Conclusions: Sensory axonal neuropathy, often associated with similar involvement of the motor system, can be demonstrated by classical electrophysiological methods in HZ. The severity of damage to the motor fibres {{was found to be}} related to damage to sensory fibres, but no relation was found between peripheral axon damage and PHN. <b>Motor</b> <b>damage</b> may be to the ventral roots, plexus or peripheral nerve. The probability of complications and the severity of axonal damage of peripheral fibres increased with age of patients. Appropriate antiviral therapy was found to reduce risk of SZP and severity of damage to the peripheral nervous system.

40|$|Low level metal {{contaminations}} are a prevalent {{issue with}} often unknown consequences {{for health and}} the environment. Effect-based, multifactorial test systems with zebrafish embryos to assess in particular developmental toxicity are beneficial but rarely used in this context. We therefore exposed wild-type embryos to the metals copper (CuSO 4), cadmium (CdCl 2) and cobalt (CoSO 4) for 72 h to determine lethal as well as sublethal morphological effects. <b>Motor</b> neuron <b>damage</b> was investigated by immunofluorescence staining of primary motor neurons (PMNs) and secondary motor neurons (SMNs). In vivo stainings using the vital dye DASPEI were used to quantify neuromast development and damage. The consequences of metal toxicity were also assessed functionally, by testing fish behavior following tactile stimulation. The median effective concentration (EC 50) values for morphological effects 72 h post fertilization (hpf) were 14. 6 mg/L for cadmium and 0. 018 mg/L for copper, whereas embryos exposed up to 45. 8 mg/L cobalt showed no morphological effects. All three metals caused a concentration-dependent reduction {{in the numbers of}} normal PMNs and SMNs, and in the fluorescence intensity of neuromasts. The results for <b>motor</b> neuron <b>damage</b> and behavior were coincident for all three metals. Even the lowest metal concentrations (cadmium 2 mg/L, copper 0. 01 mg/L and cobalt 0. 8 mg/L) resulted in neuromast damage.
