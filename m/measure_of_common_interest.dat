40|$|Mobile crowdsensing {{allows a}} large number of mobile devices to <b>measure</b> {{phenomena}} <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interests</b> and form a body of knowledge about natural and social environments. In order to get location annotations for indoor mobile crowdsensing, reference tags are usually deployed which are susceptible to tampering and compromises by attackers. In this work, we consider three types of location-related attacks including tag forgery, tag misplacement, and tag removal. Different detection algorithms are proposed to deal with these attacks. First, we introduce location-dependent fingerprints as supplementary information for better location identification. A truth discovery algorithm is then proposed to detect falsified data. Moreover, visiting patterns are utilized for the detection of tag misplacement and removal. Experiments on both crowdsensed and emulated dataset show that the proposed algorithms can detect all three types of attacks with high accuracy. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
40|$|CrowdSensing often {{refers to}} sharing data {{collected}} by sensing devices with the aim <b>of</b> <b>measure</b> a phenomena <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest.</b> Within this thesis we will describe MC^ 2 S, a novel Component-based framework suitable for the easy development of multiple, secure, portable, interopeable and concurrent MCS applications. The framework has been built in collaboration between University of Pisa and Trinity College Dublin, starting from September 2015. It exploits both Apache Felix implementation of OSGi framework specifications to ensure composite applications and Java environment to guarantee portability over an huge range of heterogeneous hardaware. However, even if MC^ 2 S framework already offers several forefront capabilities, a lot of additional features may be introduced during the development of its next versions...|$|R
40|$|Joint {{development}} in the South China Sea has been suggested {{as a solution to}} the Spratly Islands disputes since the 1980 s. China was one of the earliest proponents of ‘setting aside the dispute and pursuing joint development’. The South China Sea Workshops on Managing Potential Conflicts in the South China Sea discussed joint development but ran into a number of obstacles, notably because of longstanding sensitivities over sovereignty issues and conflicting maritime claims. Consequently, the Workshops sought to focus on less contentious issues such as cooperation on marine biodiversity and the safety of navigation. Through this non- confrontational, non-binding and incremental approach, the Workshops were instrumental in building trust and confidence among the claimants and in getting them to consider co-operative <b>measures</b> in areas <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest...</b>|$|R

To {{the extent that}} these projects have higher risks, {{we need to make}} sure that the regulatory frameworks also incentivize investment at the high end of the risk spectrum. • In this brief we discuss whether an adequate framework for projects <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest</b> implies moving towards a dedicated regulatory framework, concluding that this is not necessarily necessary. • Some Member States might prefer to apply their default regulatory framework to projects <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest.</b> This approach avoids the additional costs of administering another framework. However, the conventional default framework provides the same return for all infrastructure investment, implying a risk of underpaying for high-risk investment and overpaying for low-risk investment. • Other Member States might prefer to apply a dedicated regulatory framework for important infrastructure investment to projects <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest.</b> These dedicated frameworks allow dealing with underpaying for important investment as well as mitigating the risk of overpaying by adjusting incentives to the value and risk of a project. • In both cases, the EU and ACER have important roles to play in ensuring that the regulatory framework applying to projects <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest</b> is adequate. Their roles could include assessing the applicable frameworks, assisting NRAs with multi-jurisdictional coordination, ensuring dedicated frameworks for investment of national importance apply also to projects <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>interest,</b> and assisting NRAs on a voluntary basis with performing case-by-case assessments...|$|R
