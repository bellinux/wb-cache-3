40|$|About the book: The stock <b>market</b> <b>globalization</b> {{process has}} {{produced}} historic {{changes in the}} structure of stock markets, the effects of which are evident throughout the world. Despite these transformations, there are relatively few sources examining the connections between the globalization process currently under way and previous periods of stock <b>market</b> <b>globalization.</b> This seminal volume fills that gap. The chapters in the first section examine previous globalization periods through the lens of the corporate economy, valuing equities and managed funds. Further chapters address current issues such as the social closure of the exchange, demutualization and mergers and acquisitions as well as cross-listing and liquidity. The final chapters consider the regulatory challenges posed by stock <b>market</b> <b>globalization.</b> These include the pressures on regulators from rent-seeking stock market participants, the demise of exchange trading floors and Latin America’s stock market. Timely, multi-disciplinary and practical, this informative Handbook will be an essential reference for students and scholars of economics, finance and accounting, finance professionals and security market regulators. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} financial <b>market</b> <b>globalization</b> on the cross-country pattern of development in the world economy. To this end, it develops a dynamic macroeconomic model of imperfect credit markets, in which the domestic investment becomes borrowing-constrained at the lower stage of development. In {{the absence of the}} international financial market, the world economy converges to the symmetric steady state, and the cross-country difference disappears in the long run. It is shown that, under some parameter values, financial <b>market</b> <b>globalization</b> causes the instability of the symmetric steady state and generates stable asymmetric steady states, in which the world economy is polarized into the rich and the poor. The world output is smaller, the rich are richer and the poor are poorer in these asymmetric steady states than in the (unstable) symmetric steady state. The model thus demonstrates the possibility that financial <b>market</b> <b>globalization</b> may cause, or at least magnify, inequality among nations, and that the international financial market is a mechanism through which some countries become rich at the expense of others. Furthermore, the poor countries cannot jointly escape from the poverty trap by merely cutting their links to the rich. Nor would foreign aids from the rich to the poor eliminate inequality; as in a game of musical chairs, some countries must be excluded from being rich...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} structural changes, both quantitative {{as well as}} qualitative, {{taking place}} in trade {{as a result of}} the <b>market</b> <b>globalization</b> processes. The changes in the trade sector, which is considered to be a dispersed sector, are characterized by: internationalisation, increasing concentration due to mergers and acquisitions, as well as co-operation. <b>Market</b> <b>globalization</b> directly results in the growing number of companies deciding to operate on an international scale and in the quick proliferation of new institutional forms of trade and innovation. The main indicators of qualitative changes in trade include: consumer behavior and expectations, competition, the use of information technologies and the transfer of know-how as a consequence of foreign investment in the trade sector.
