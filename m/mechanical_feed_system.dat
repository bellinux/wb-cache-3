50|$|The {{key element}} of a vacuum filler is the vacuum filling principle. The filling product is fed into the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> {{mechanically}} via a hopper with actively driven feeding auger, as well as via vertical “vacuum suction”. Pre-evacuated cells of a vane cell <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> move underneath the hopper. The pressure difference relative to the ambient pressure (underpressure) caused by the evacuation ensures that the cells are filled with product. The <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> moves continuously, thus generating a continuous filling flow. The product is portioned by means of cyclic movements of the <b>feed</b> <b>system.</b> Each cell of the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> has a particular volume. The portion {{is defined by the}} rotation distance of the rotor. The portioning volume is therefore set in the control system by multiplying the rotor’s rotation distance by the number of the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> cells within it.

40|$|The {{successful}} implementation of ion thruster technology on the Deep Space 1 technology demonstration mission {{paved the way for}} its first use on the Dawn science mission, which launched in September 2007. Both Deep Space 1 and Dawn used a "bang-bang" xenon <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> which has proven to be highly successful. This type of <b>feed</b> <b>system,</b> however, is complex with many parts and requires a significant amount of engineering work for architecture changes. A simplified <b>feed</b> <b>system,</b> with fewer parts and less engineering work for architecture changes, is desirable to reduce the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> cost to future missions. An attractive new path for ion thruster <b>feed</b> <b>systems</b> is based on new components developed by industry in support of commercial applications of electric propulsion systems. For example, since the launch of Deep Space 1 tens of mechanical xenon pressure regulators have successfully flown on commercial spacecraft using electric propulsion. In addition, active proportional flow controllers have flown on the Hall-thruster-equipped Tacsat- 2, are flying on the ion thruster GOCE mission, and will fly next year on the Advanced EHF spacecraft. This present paper briefly reviews the Dawn xenon <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> and those implemented on other xenon electric propulsion flight missions. A simplified <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> architecture is presented that is based on assembling flight-qualified components in a manner that will reduce non-recurring engineering associated with propulsion system architecture changes, and is compared to the NASA Dawn standard.

A low energy grass diet with only 15 % of concentrate (LowGS) was compared with a high-energy maize silage diet with 30 % concentrate (HighMS). Thirty-four Holstein (Hp) and 34 Normande (No) cows in early lactation were {{assigned to one of}} two <b>feeding</b> <b>systems</b> for a 6 -week period Cows on the LowGS <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> had lower milk yield, fat and protein content In both <b>feeding</b> <b>systems,</b> No cows had lower milk yields but higher milk protein contents than Ho cows. The LowGS <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> altered milk fatty acid (FA) composition by reducing saturated FA. Breed had only a small impact on milk FA. Concerning milk coagulating properties, only the firmness was reduced by the LowGS feeding and the Ho breed. The effects of breed and <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> on the protein content of cheeses were more marked in Camembert cheese than in Pont-l'Eveque cheese. However the Camembert cheese from Ho-LowGS was, in fact characterized especially by lower protein content. LowGS <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> and No breed produced more yellow cheeses. <b>Feeding</b> <b>systems</b> had limited effects on the firmness of Camembert and Pont-l'Eveque cheeses measured by penetrometry. In sensory analysis, Ho breed and LowGS feeding produced a Camembert cheese with a more melting texture in the mouth due to the increase of spreadability index and of proteolysis. The type of cheese also had an influence: the effects were more important on Camembert cheese than on Pont-l'Eveque cheese. Only the Ho-LowGS treatment produced a very specific Camembert cheese different from the others.
