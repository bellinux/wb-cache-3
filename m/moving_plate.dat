The element-free Galerkin {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to solve the}} stability of the <b>moving</b> rectangular <b>plates.</b> Utilizing the extended Hamilton’s principle for the elastic dynamics system, the variational expression of the <b>moving</b> thin <b>plate</b> are established. The dimensionless equations of motion of the <b>moving</b> thin <b>plate</b> are obtained by the element-free Galerkin method, and the complex eigenvalue equation is presented. Via numerical calculation, the variation relationship between the first three complex frequencies of the system and the moving speed is obtained.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of freely <b>moving</b> <b>plates</b> connected by a shallow liquid bridge via analytic and experimental methods. The gap between the plates {{is used as a}} small parameter within a lubrication approximation, reducing the problem to an Abel equation of the second kind. Analysis of the governing differential equation yields two novel physical phenomena: (1) An impulse-like peak in the force applied by the liquid bridge on the plates, obtained from a uniform asymptotic solution for small capillary numbers. (2) Both linear and non-linear oscillations of the system for the case of surfaces with low wettability, obtained from small perturbations of the system around the equilibrium point. An experimental setup examining the motion of freely <b>moving</b> <b>plates</b> was constructed, yielding experimental data which compared favorably with the analytic results and specifically displayed the predicted oscillations and impulse-like peak of the applied force. The application of the current analysis to the manipulation of solid bodies and possible future research directions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{recently}} {{reported on the}} existence of a singular resonance in moving media which arises due to perfect amplitude and phase balance of evanescent waves. We show here that the nonequilibrium vacuum friction (lateral Casimir-Lifshitz force) between <b>moving</b> <b>plates</b> separated by a finite gap is fundamentally dominated by this resonance. Our result is robust to losses and dispersion as well as polarization mixing which occurs in the relativistic limit. ...|$|R
50|$|The stair walker types use a {{long screw}} thread to extend and retract a 'foot' from the {{position}} at which the load is held. The two <b>moving</b> <b>plates</b> allow the item to be stepped down an arbitrary number of steps at any one time. To date the largest weight limit to be lifted by this method is 680 kg (cite). Some models using this approach also employ a third section to allow the load to be manipulated up and down independently of the base and wheel sections.|$|R
5000|$|The zero-trace part [...] of [...] is a {{symmetric}} 3 × 3 tensor {{that describes}} {{the rate at which}} the medium is being deformed by shearing, ignoring any changes in its volume. Thus the zero-trace part [...] of [...] is the familiar viscous shear stress that is associated to progressive shearing deformation. It is the viscous stress that occurs in fluid moving through a tube with uniform cross-section (a Poiseuille flow) or between two parallel <b>moving</b> <b>plates</b> (a Couette flow), and resists those motions.|$|R

50|$|The {{capacitance}} of {{the pickup}} is changed by {{the motion of the}} <b>moving</b> <b>plate.</b> As a result of the changing capacitance, a varying current flows into or out of the plates as needed to maintain the proper charge for the new amount of capacitance.

40|$|Abstract. Friction {{force is}} present in most {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS), since they have a large ratio of surface area to their volume. To improve the performance and reliability of MEMS devices, {{it is necessary to}} full understand the effect of friction which exists in the majority of MEMS. The model of electrostatic tangential force for MEMS’s <b>moving</b> <b>plates</b> is established based on the rule of energy conservation, further it is revised considering the edge effects by the conformal mapping method for smooth and opening holes plates. Three types of the electrostatic tangential resistance, which are the unrevised theoretical value and revised theoretical value and simulation value, were compared. The effects of microscale and applied voltage and holes are investigated, and the electrostatic tangential resistance between two charged <b>moving</b> <b>plates</b> with respect to each other is analyzed. It is found that the three types of the electrostatic tangential resistance will be increased with the rate of the plate width over the gap of two plates or the applied voltage increasing. And the opening holes did not significantly reduce the value of the electrostatic tangential resistance {{because of the presence of}} edge effects. The revised analytic results are larger than the ones not revised, and the former are close to results of ANSYS simulation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{an exact}} finite strip method is {{developed}} for the free vibration analysis of axially <b>moving</b> viscoelastic <b>plates.</b> Using the differential equation that governs the vibration of plates traveling at a constant axial speed, and utilizing the rheological models to model the viscoelastic behavior of materials, the exact stiffness matrix of a finite strip of plate is extracted in the frequency domain. Terms of this matrix are implicit functions of the eigenvalues of free vibration, in-plane forces, viscoelasticity parameters, axial speed and the geometry of the plate. By assembling the stiffness matrices of these finite strips, the global stiffness matrix of a <b>plate</b> <b>moving</b> on intermediate rollers is obtained, from which the eigenvalues defining the free vibration of the plate are extracted within the domain of complex numbers using a suitable algorithm. These values (that represent the exact frequencies of the plate vibration and damping) {{can be used as}} a benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of other numerical techniques. Finally, by presenting a set of numerical examples, the effects of axial speed and viscoelastic parameters on the free vibration of <b>moving</b> <b>plates</b> are examined in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Because most {{stresses}} {{relate to}} the tectonic activity of <b>moving</b> <b>plates,</b> most motion between blocks is horizontal, that {{is parallel to the}} Earth's crust by strike-slip faults. However vertical movement of blocks produces much more dramatic results. Landforms (mountains, hills, ridges, lakes, valleys, etc.) are sometimes formed when the faults have a large vertical displacement. Adjacent raised blocks (horsts) and down-dropped blocks (grabens) can form high escarpments. Often the movement of these blocks is accompanied by tilting, due to compaction or stretching of the crust at that point.|$|R
50|$|Geologically, an oceanic basin may be {{actively}} changing size {{or may be}} relatively, tectonically inactive, depending on {{whether there is a}} <b>moving</b> <b>plate</b> tectonic boundary associated with it. The elements of an active - and growing - oceanic basin include an elevated mid-ocean ridge, flanking abyssal hills leading down to abyssal plains. The elements of an active oceanic basin often include the oceanic trench associated with a subduction zone.|$|E
50|$|Symmetrical {{sandwiches}} {{are used}} in some Reactive armor applications, on heavily armored vehicles such as main battle tanks. The inward-firing flyer will impact the vehicle main armor, causing damage if the armor is not thick enough, so these can only be used on heavier armored vehicles. Lighter vehicles use open-face sandwich reactive armor (see below). However, the dual <b>moving</b> <b>plate</b> method of operation of a symmetrical sandwich offers the best armor protection.|$|E
50|$|Most center pivot systems {{now have}} drops {{hanging from a}} {{u-shaped}} pipe called a gooseneck attached {{at the top of}} the pipe with sprinkler heads that are positioned a few feet (at most) above the crop, thus limiting evaporative losses and wind drift. There are many different nozzle configurations available including static plate, <b>moving</b> <b>plate</b> and part circle. Pressure regulators are typically installed upstream of each nozzle to ensure each is operating at the correct design pressure.|$|E

In order to validate the device, we carried out an experiment of remote tactile interaction. A glove, instrumented with five force sensors, registered the contact forces at the remote site, while the HapBand mimicked the registered sensation to the user’s forearm. Results showed the HapBand to well resemble the squeezing sensation on the forearm...|$|R
50|$|The {{disruption}} {{is attributed}} to two mechanisms. First, the <b>moving</b> <b>plates</b> change the effective velocity and angle of impact of the shaped charge jet, reducing the angle of incidence and increasing the effective jet velocity versus the plate element. Second, since the plates are angled compared to the usual impact direction of shaped charge warheads, as the plates move outwards the impact point on the plate moves over time, requiring the jet to cut through fresh plate material. This second effect significantly increases the effective plate thickness during the impact.|$|R

Internal plates that take the force of the water weren't strong enough and finding a solution has taken some time.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} drive mechanisms, the linear motor is {{typically}} maintenance-free. The pole faces {{on the track}} and <b>moving</b> <b>plate</b> attached to the car {{do not need to}} touch, and the gap between them can be quite wide to accommodate any side-to-side car motion, so there is no friction or wear between them. Further, the magnetic coil assembly on the driving pole plates are either potted or sealed in a weathertight enclosure, so that rain, vibration, and dust do not affect motor performance or cause drive motor slippage.|$|E

Our model considers irregular polygonal particles compressed between two <b>moving</b> <b>plates.</b> At the occurrence of an avalanche, we monitor the time evolution of the underlying contact force network. When all contact forces are considered, topological and dynamical quantities vary {{as a reaction to}} the avalanche, while the decomposition of the contact force network into strong and weak contacts uncovers a topology that is strongly correlated with the occurrence of avalanches...|$|R
40|$|The zero-temperature Casimir-Lifshitz force {{between two}} <b>plates</b> <b>moving</b> {{parallel}} {{to each other}} at arbitrary constant speed was found in [New J. Phys. 11, 033035 (2009) ].

The perpendicular force on the plates has contributions from the quantum vacuum and from the thermal radiation; both of these contributions are influenced by the motion.

40|$|In {{the present}} research, {{vibration}} and instability of axially <b>moving</b> sandwich <b>plate</b> made of soft core and composite face sheets under initial tension is investigated. Single-walled carbon nano-tubes (SWCNTs) are selected as a reinforcement of composite face sheets inside Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. Higher order shear deformation theory (HSDT) is utilized {{due to its}} accuracy of polynomial functions than other plate theories. Based on extended rule of mixture, the structural properties of composite face sheets are taken into consideration. Motion equations are obtained by means of Hamilton’s principle and solved analytically. Influences of various parameters such as axially moving speed, volume fraction of CNTs, pre-tension, thickness and aspect ratio of sandwich plate on the vibration characteristics of moving system are discussed in details. The {{results indicated that the}} critical speed of <b>moving</b> sandwich <b>plate</b> is strongly dependent on the volume fraction of CNTs. Therefore, the critical speed of <b>moving</b> sandwich <b>plate</b> can be improved by adding appropriate values of CNTs.

50|$|The linear {{induction}} motor is a simple but powerful type of electric motor used to propel the cars. Rather than using a standard enclosed spinning rotor and drive wheels, {{there is a long}} flat magnetic pole plate with closely spaced electric coils. This pole plate mounts on the track underneath the car and a matching metal plate attached to the car moves across the magnetic pole faces. By applying a multiphase alternating current to the poles, the pole plate induces eddy currents into the <b>moving</b> <b>plate</b> and can be used to accelerate or brake the car.|$|E
50|$|An {{abyssal plain}} is an {{underwater}} plain on the deep ocean floor, usually found at depths between 3000 m and 6000 m. Lying generally between {{the foot of}} a continental rise and a mid-ocean ridge, abyssal plains cover more than 50% of the Earth’s surface. They are among the flattest, smoothest and least explored regions on Earth. Abyssal plains are key geologic elements of oceanic basins (the other elements being an elevated mid-ocean ridge and flanking abyssal hills). In addition to these elements, active oceanic basins (those that are associated with a <b>moving</b> <b>plate</b> tectonic boundary) also typically include an oceanic trench and a subduction zone.|$|E
5000|$|... {{slipping}} slides with masking: black {{paint on}} {{portions of the}} <b>moving</b> <b>plate</b> would mask parts of the underlying image - with a black background - on the stationary glass. This {{made it possible to}} hide and then reveal the previous position of a part, for instance a limb, to suggest repetitious movement. The suggested movement would be rather jerky and usually operated quickly. Masking in slides was also often used to create change rather than movement (see: Fig. 6 on the illustration by Petrus van Musschenbroek: a man, his wig and his hat): for instance a person's head could be replaced with that of an animal. More gradual and natural movement was also possible; for instance to make a nose grow very long by slowly moving a masking glass.|$|E
