5|$|Ida's {{regolith}} {{is composed}} of the silicate minerals olivine and pyroxene. Its appearance changes over time through a process called space weathering. Because of this process, older regolith appears <b>more</b> <b>red</b> in color compared to freshly exposed material.|$|E
5|$|Repeat {{this process}} {{a number of}} times, {{randomly}} reproducing each generation of marbles to form the next. The numbers of red and blue marbles picked each generation fluctuates; sometimes <b>more</b> <b>red</b> and sometimes more blue. This fluctuation is analogous to genetic drift– {{a change in the}} population's allele frequency resulting from a random variation in the distribution of alleles {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
5|$|T. m. nigrideus breeds from coastal {{northern}} Quebec to Labrador and Newfoundland and winters {{from southern}} Newfoundland south {{through most of}} the eastern US states to southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi and northern Georgia. It is uniformly darker or blackish on the head, with a dark gray back. The underparts are slightly <b>more</b> <b>red</b> than those of the nominate subspecies.|$|E

50|$|Dispersive prisms {{are used}} to break up light into its {{constituent}} spectral colors because the refractive index depends on frequency; the white light entering the prism {{is a mixture of}} different frequencies, each of which gets bent slightly differently. Blue light is slowed down <b>more</b> than <b>red</b> light and will therefore be bent <b>more</b> than <b>red</b> light.|$|R
5|$|The Galileo images {{also led}} to the {{discovery}} that space weathering was taking place on Ida, a process which causes older regions to become <b>more</b> <b>red</b> in color over time. The same process affects both Ida and its moon, although Dactyl shows a lesser change. The weathering of Ida's surface revealed another detail about its composition: the reflection spectra of freshly exposed parts of the surface resembled that of OC meteorites, but the older regions matched the spectra of S-type asteroids.|$|E
5|$|The authors {{began work}} on a sequel to Better than Life, called The Last Human, but Rob Grant was drawn away from Red Dwarf by an {{interest}} in other projects. Still owing Penguin Publishing two <b>more</b> <b>Red</b> Dwarf novels, Grant and Naylor decided to each write an alternative sequel to Better than Life. Two completely different sequels were made as a result, each presenting a possible version of the story's continuation. Last Human, by Doug Naylor, adds Kochanski to the crew and places more emphasis on the science-fiction and plot elements, while Rob Grant's novel Backwards, is more {{in keeping with the}} previous two novels, and borrows more extensively from established television stories.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Du Tertre's crude 1667 {{drawing and}} Labat's 1722 derivative, a few {{contemporary}} paintings depict red macaws {{that may be}} the Lesser Antillean macaw. A color plate accompanying a 1765 volume of Buffon's encyclopaedia Histoire Naturelle (no. 12 in Planches Enluminées, entitled L'Ara Rouge) shows a red macaw with entirely red tail feathers and <b>more</b> <b>red</b> on the tertial and scapular feathers of the wing than are present on the scarlet macaw. Copies of the plate differ in the nuances used, but are identical in pattern. The painting suggests that a specimen may have been present in Europe at the time. The Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus cited the plate in his 1766 description of the scarlet macaw, but his description does not match the bird shown. A 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, which also includes a dodo, shows a red macaw that agrees with the descriptions of the Lesser Antillean macaw. A second macaw in the painting may be the hypothetical extinct Martinique macaw (A. martinicus), but though many parrots were imported into Europe at the time from all over the world, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of such paintings today.|$|E

5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on scale models, which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: {{one has a}} red strip for the whole length of the train, with the window backgrounds painted grey. The other is more similar to the final result, but {{the front of the}} train includes <b>more</b> <b>red</b> and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled to a combination of both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. The bottom of the carriages is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey. Red colouring {{at the end of each}} car forms red parallelograms when the carriages are combined. When asked why the trains were not blue and white, VR's CEO answered that red and white fits the train and its design the best.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings are {{not highly}} territorial, and, {{although}} normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together {{where there are}} a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have <b>more</b> <b>red</b> tips to the wings and are preferred by females.|$|E
25|$|Downstream of the Wachau {{lies the}} Kremstal region, centred {{on the town}} of Krems. The valley opens out a little, the climate is a little warmer {{allowing}} <b>more</b> <b>red</b> wine to be produced, but otherwise Kremstal is quite similar to the Wachau.|$|E

25|$|To {{the north}} of Krems lies Langenlois, which is the main town of Kamptal, {{the valley of the}} river Kamp. The {{sandstone}} slopes are so steep that only a thin layer of soil is retained, and exposure to the sun is high. Riesling thrives on these steep slopes; closer to the Danube the valley broadens and <b>more</b> <b>red</b> grapes are grown.|$|E
25|$|In HbSS, the {{complete}} blood count reveals haemoglobin levels {{in the range of}} 6–8g/dl with a high reticulocyte count (as the bone marrow compensates for the destruction of sickled cells by producing <b>more</b> <b>red</b> blood cells). In other forms of sickle-cell disease, Hb levels tend to be higher. A blood film may show features of hyposplenism (target cells and Howell-Jolly bodies).|$|E
25|$|Peach {{breeding}} has favored cultivars {{with more}} firmness, <b>more</b> <b>red</b> color, and shorter fuzz on the fruit surface. These characteristics ease shipping and supermarket sales by improving eye appeal. However, this selection process has not necessarily led to increased flavor. Peaches {{have a short}} shelf life, so commercial growers typically plant a mix of different cultivars to have fruit to ship all season long.|$|E

25|$|Adult {{humans have}} roughly 20–30 {{trillion}} {{red blood cells}} at any given time, comprising approximately 70% all cells by number. Women have about 4–5 million red blood cells per microliter (cubic millimeter) of blood and men about 5–6 million; people living at high altitudes with low oxygen tension will have <b>more.</b> <b>Red</b> blood cells are thus much more common than the other blood particles: there are about 4,000–11,000 white blood cells and about 150,000–400,000 platelets per microliter.|$|E
25|$|Polya's urn {{contains}} {{a number of}} different coloured marbles; at each iteration a marble is randomly selected from the urn and replaced with several more of that same colour. For any given colour, the fraction of marbles in the urn with that colour is a martingale. For example, if currently 95% of the marbles are red then, though the next iteration is more likely to add red marbles than another color, this bias is exactly balanced out by the fact that adding <b>more</b> <b>red</b> marbles alters the fraction much less significantly than adding the same number of non-red marbles would.|$|E
25|$|The life-cycles of Plasmodium species involve several {{different}} stages {{both in the}} insect and the vertebrate host. These stages include sporozoites, which are injected by the insect vector into the vertebrate host's blood. Sporozoites infect the host liver, giving rise to merozoites and (in some species) hypnozoites. These move into the blood where they infect red blood cells. In the red blood cells, the parasites can either form more merozoites to infect <b>more</b> <b>red</b> blood cells, or produce gametocytes which are taken up by insects which feed on the vertebrate host. In the insect host, gametocytes merge to sexually reproduce. After sexual reproduction, parasites grow into new sporozoites, which move to the insect's salivary glands, from which they can infect a vertebrate host bitten by the insect.|$|E

25|$|If humans move to {{a higher}} altitude, {{respiration}} and physical exertion become a problem, but after spending time in high altitude conditions they acclimatize to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen, such as by producing <b>more</b> <b>red</b> blood cells. The ability to acclimatize is an adaptation, but the acclimatization itself is not. Fecundity goes down, but deaths from some tropical diseases also goes down. Over {{a longer period of}} time, some people are better able to reproduce at high altitudes than others. They contribute more heavily to later generations, and gradually by natural selection the whole population becomes adapted to the new conditions. This has demonstrably occurred, as the observed performance of long-term communities at higher altitude is significantly better than the performance of new arrivals, even when the new arrivals have had time to acclimatize.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{vineyards}} of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia {{are located in}} the southern half of the region, including the large wine regions of Collio Goriziano, Colli Orientali del Friuli, Isonzo and Carso. The Lison-Pramaggiore region is shared with the Veneto. Smaller regions such as the Annia, Aquileia, Grave and Latisana {{are located in the}} central and western part of the region around the city of Pordenone. These smaller regions are located on alluvial plains with soils composed of gravel and sand. The wines made here are lighter and less elegant than the Friuli wines made in the major southern wine regions. Unlike other Friuli regions which require 100%, a varietal wine in the Graves and Aquileia zones only need 85% of the grape variety with the Latisana and Annia zones requiring 90%. <b>More</b> <b>red</b> wine is produced in these zones than {{in the rest of the}} Friuli with Merlot, Cabernet franc and Cabernet Sauvignon being the leading varietals. With wine production still, frizzante and spumante styles are produced from Chardonnay, Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio, Friulano and Verduzzo.|$|E
500|$|Two {{subspecies}} are recognised: the nominate race M. e. erythrocephala, and M.

Forbes noted there was <b>more</b> <b>red</b> on the back, and the upperparts are a lighter brown. The Sumba myzomela (Myzomela dammermani) was until 2008 regarded as a subspecies of the red-headed myzomela, as was the crimson-hooded myzomela (M. kuehni) which is endemic to the Indonesian island of Wetar.|$|E
