From 1947, experiments were made with locomotives on the tramways, and they soon replaced horses. A total of 23 had worked on the system {{by the time it was}} closed down. The extraction process was mechanised in the 1960s, with the introduction of machines that could cut and stack the peat turves. In 1981 <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> of the turves into the trains was introduced. Surface milling of the peat was introduced in 1985, which completely stripped the surface of large areas of the moors.|$|E

40|$|Pituitary {{adenylate cyclase}} {{activating}} polypeptide (PACAP) is a neurohormone exerting protective function during various stress conditions either in mature or developing tissues. Previously we proved {{the presence of}} PACAP signaling elements in chicken limb bud-derived chondrogenic cells in micromass cell cultures. Since no data can be found if PACAP signaling is playing any role during mechanical stress in any tissues, we aimed to investigate its contribution in mechanotransduction during chondrogenesis. Expressions of the mRNAs of PACAP and its major receptor, PAC 1 increased, while that of other receptors, VPAC 1, VPAC 2 decreased upon <b>mechanical</b> stimulus. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>load</b> enhanced the expression of collagen type X, a marker of hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and PACAP addition attenuated this elevation. Moreover, exogenous PACAP also prevented the <b>mechanical</b> <b>load</b> evoked activation of hedgehog signaling: protein levels of Sonic and Indian Hedgehogs and Gli 1 transcription factor were lowered while expressions of Gli 2 and Gli 3 were elevated by PACAP application during <b>mechanical</b> <b>load.</b> Our results suggest that <b>mechanical</b> <b>load</b> activates PACAP signaling and exogenous PACAP acts against the hypertrophy inducing effect of <b>mechanical</b> <b>load...</b>|$|R
500|$|On {{either side}} of the terreplein, wide of the 64-pound guns, are two small rooms known as the expense stores. They were used for {{ready-to-use}} ammunition for the adjacent guns, except for armour piercing shells which were stored in the rear-defence wall's archways. Between the 64-pounders and the 10" [...] gun positions are two raised observation platforms set into the structure for gun commanders to spot the fall of outgoing shells. Ranging was either performed from here or from a ranging position set in the sand hills to the fort's north. Between the 10" [...] guns is a T-shaped loading gallery that draws shells and gunpowder via a hoist system from the magazine below. Either side of the gallery was installed the Armstrong <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> systems for the 10" [...] guns. These mechanical systems proved unsuccessful and were removed in the 1890s, though the southern one has been reconstructed. The magazine is accessed from the manning parade and is directly beneath the 10" [...] gun loading gallery.

500|$|Early {{plans for}} the fort's {{armament}} were drawn up by Harding Stewart of the British War Office. They called for four [...] rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns, two mounted in turrets and two behind vertical iron shields. This configuration of siege artillery had not been tried before and the plan was abandoned due to the large expected cost. Two of the 9in guns had been in South Australia since c.1868 after a Colonial Government request, but were not used in the eventual fort design. The final Jervois/Scratchley design omitted the turret and iron shields. 64-pounder RML guns were substituted {{for two of the}} 9in guns and 10in 20ton RML guns for the remaining two. The 20ton guns were chosen over the then standard 18ton gun by Jervois after he saw the plans in England, the decision influenced by the then fully committed nature of the Royal Arsenal. Jervois had originally ordered the 18ton guns but cancelled the order and changed to the Armstrong 20ton when the arsenal was unable fulfil the order. He also ordered Armstrong's <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> and protected barbette system for the 20ton guns. This original battery of four heavy guns remains in place at the fort.|$|E

Figure 1 : An example of cardiac adaptive processes. Left: An elevated blood pressure causes an increase in wall thickness. Right: Normal heart [2]. Understanding the mechanism underlying the adaptive processes in the heart may lead to insight in several growth related heart diseases. Adaptive processes are triggered by a local elevated <b>mechanical</b> <b>load.</b> Since measurement of the local <b>mechanical</b> <b>load</b> is difficult, a numerical model is necessary. We hypothesize that the heart is designed such that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>load</b> is distributed evenly over the tissue [1].

2500|$|The {{structure}} of {{the skin of the}} patagia and accessory areas for the patagia of a Ptychozoon kuhli, flying gecko, exhibiting the passive gliding mechanism consists of five layers; a layer of adipose tissue is surrounded by a layer of dermis on each side (ventral and dorsal) and a layer of epidermis is [...] external to the two dermal layers. The distribution of the adipose tissue IS thickest close to the body wall. This thick layer of adipose tissue at close to the body wall is believed to provide a [...] "safety factor" [...] for the structural elements of the skin ( [...] i.e. collagen fibers) near the body wall. The thick layer of adipose tissue is more compliant than the structural elements of the body wall (i.e. ribs, muscles), therefore will more readily deform(absorb force) before the structural elements of the skin experience a force. The layer of adipose tissue also [...] aids {{in the creation of the}} domed and cambered shape of the patagia. With regards to the {{structure of}} the dermal layer of the patagia, there is a thick layer of collagen fibers oriented parallel to the axis of the patagial ribs. These collagen fibers act as the structural support for the shape of the patagia, and provide the stiffness necessary to resist shape chang [...] The most prominent features of the epidermal layer of the patagia are the scales. The [...] morphology of the dorsal scales of the patagia change as a result of their functional role. A large portion of the dorsal scales of the patagia are arranged in regular rib-like pattern, which guide the flow of air and allow for the lizard to behave as an airfoil. However at the hinge joints (places where patagia folds and attaches to limbs), the regular rib like structure of scales breakdown into a more random distribution of scales. This breakdown of scales is believed to aid in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>loading</b> of the patagia during the unfurling process and also determining the extent the patagia unfurling during flight.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new methodology to conduct modelling {{and analysis of}} soft tissue deformation from the physicochemical viewpoint of soft tissues for surgery simulation. The novelty of this methodology is that soft tissue deformation is converted into a reaction-diffusion process coupled with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>load,</b> and thus reaction-diffusion of <b>mechanical</b> <b>load</b> and non-rigid mechanics of motion are combined to govern the dynamics of soft tissue deformation. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>load</b> applied to a soft tissue to cause a deformation is incorporated into the reaction-diffusion system and consequently distributed among mass points of the soft tissue. An improved reaction-diffusion model is developed to describe {{the distribution of the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>load</b> in the tissue. A generic finite difference scheme is presented for construction of the reaction-diffusion model on a 3 D tissue surface. A gradient method is established for derivation of internal forces from the distribution of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>load.</b> Real-time interactive deformation of virtual human organs with haptic feedback has been achieved by the proposed methodology for surgery simulation.
