25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, Wetu Telu syncretism was {{widespread}} in Lombok. Then, another, stricter, version of Islam began to gain ground, known as the Waktu Lima. Waktu Lima ("five times") is similar to <b>mainstream</b> <b>Islam,</b> but more orthodox in the way that it tries to eliminate Wetu Telu. Waktu Lima originated when the 19th century purist reforms in the Arab world were brought to Lombok by Sasak hajjis (pilgrims to Mecca and Medina). Concerned by the version of Islam practiced by their countrymen, the hajjis attempted to purify the faith by removing all lingering traces of animism. Waktu Lima first spread among the rich, then slowly to other broader layers of society.|$|E
25|$|After the 27th Dai, Syedna Dawood bin Qutub Shah, {{there was}} another split; the ones {{following}} Syedna Dawood {{came to be called}} Dawoodi Bohra, and followers of Suleman were then called Sulaimani. Dawoodi Bohra's present Dai al Mutlaq, the 53rd, is Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, and he and his devout followers tread the same path, following the same tradition of the Aimmat Fatimiyyeen. The Sulaymani are mostly concentrated in Yemen and Saudi Arabia with some communities in the South Asia. The Dawoodi Bohra and Alavi Bohra are mostly exclusive to South Asia, after the migration of the Da'wah from Yemen to India. Other groups include Atba-i-Malak and Hebtiahs Bohra. Mustaali beliefs and practices, unlike those of the Nizari and Druze, are completely compatible with <b>mainstream</b> <b>Islam,</b> representing a continuation of Fatimid tradition and fiqh.|$|E

This group evolved from the Black separatist Nation of Islam (1930–1975). The majority of its members are African Americans. This has been a 23-year process of religious reorientation and organizational decentralization, in the course of which the group was known by other names, such as the American Muslim Mission, W.Deen Mohammed guided its members to the practice of <b>mainstream</b> <b>Islam</b> such as salat or fasting, and teaching the basic creed of Islam the shahadah.|$|E
25|$|Islam {{made its}} deepest and longest lasting impact in Sudan through the {{activity}} of the Islamic religious brotherhoods or orders. These orders emerged in the Middle East in the twelfth century in connection with the development of Sufism, a reaction based in mysticism to the strongly legalistic orientation of <b>mainstream</b> <b>Islam.</b> These orders first came to Sudan in the sixteenth century and became significant in the eighteenth. Sufism seeks for its adherents a closer personal relationship with God through special spiritual disciplines. The exercises (or dhikr) include reciting prayers and passages of the Qur'an and repeating the names, or attributes, of God while performing physical movements according to the formula established by the founder of the particular order. Singing and dancing may be introduced. The outcome of an exercise, which lasts much longer than the usual daily prayer, is often a state of ecstatic abandon.|$|E
