The company installed a rolling mill, five reverberatory furnaces, 20 nail manufacturing machines, and one spike <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machine.</b> Needing more cash, the company was reorganized in September 1846, taking the new name of Scrantons and Grant. New partners were brought in, including Joseph H. Scranton (a cousin from Georgia), Erastus C. Scranton (a cousin from Connecticut), and John Howland (a banker and businessman from New York). The Scranton family retained 51.6 percent of the company's stock.|$|E

30|$|Failures {{often occur}} in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machines,</b> which may cause {{disastrous}} accidents, such as economic losses, environmental pollution, and even casualties. Effective diagnosis of these failures {{is essential in}} order to enhance reliability and reduce costs for operation and maintenance of the manufacturing equipment. As a result, research on fault diagnosis of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machines</b> that utilizes data acquired by advanced sensors and makes decisions using processed sensor data has been seen success in various applications [1 – 3]. Induction motors, as the source of actuation, have been widely used in many <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machines,</b> and their working states directly influence system performance, thus affecting the production quality. Therefore, proper grasping of data reflecting the working states of induction motors can obtain early identification of potential failures [4]. During recent years, various approaches for induction motor fault diagnosis have been developed and innovated continuously [5 – 8].|$|R

50|$|The Flexible Straw Corporation was {{incorporated}} on April 24, 1939 in California.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} in <b>machining</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems is increasingly of interest due to concern for {{global climate change}} and manufacturing sustainability. To utilise energy more effectively, it is paramount to understand and characterise the energy consumption of <b>machining</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems. To this end, a framework to analyse energy consumption characteristics in <b>machining</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems from a holistic {{point of view is}} proposed in this paper. Taking into account the complexity of energy {{consumption in}} <b>machining</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems, energy flow is described in terms of three layers of <b>machining</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems including <b>machine</b> tool layer, task layer and auxiliary production layer. Furthermore, the energy consumption of <b>machining</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems is modelled in the spatial and temporal dimensions, respectively, in order to quantitatively characterise the energy flow. The application of the proposed modelling framework is demonstrated by employing a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption for a real-world machining workshop. The characteristics of energy consumption for machine tool layer, task layer and auxiliary production layer are, respectively, obtained using quantitative models in the spatial and temporal dimensions, which provides a valuable insight into energy consumption to support the exploration of energy-saving potentials for the <b>machining</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} {{generated in}} deep drawing processes gives {{information about the}} friction and the forming processes between tool and workpiece. This information {{can be used to}} supervise or improve the forming process. Measurements of acoustic emission in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machines</b> in production lines shows that different events such as, galling, tool wear, lubricating failure, different viscosity of lubricants, stick-slip, necking and cracking of the sheet metal can be separated in time- and frequency domain. Laboratory tests show that proportionality exists between the effective output of the friction surfaces and the measured effective output of the AE-sensor in drawing a sheet metal between flat dies. The measured acoustic emission has been influenced by the smoothness, lubricants, relative speeds between the friction surfaces, the contact pressure between the surfaces, galling, changed geometry's of friction surfaces and different types of material in contact. In a forming process will different lubricants result in different lubricity and the measured effective output of the AE-sensor result in a ranking method. The proportionality between the effective output of the friction surfaces and the measured effective output of the AE-sensor established in the laboratory tests has been applied in measurements of acoustic emission in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machines</b> in production lines. By monitoring the acoustic emission in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>machines,</b> we are able to detect different events, i. e. galling, cracks, toolwear...|$|R
