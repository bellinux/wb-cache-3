It is, of course, the interest of the employer to disguise it from the persons employed; and for his own comfort and complacency he often desires no less to disguise it from himself. And it is matter of much doubt with me, how far the foolish arguments used habitually on this subject are indeed the honest expressions of foolish convictions,--or rather (as I am sometimes forced to conclude from the irritation with which they are advanced) are resolutely dishonest, wilful sophisms, arranged so as to mask to the last moment the real state of economy, and future duties of men.

A comprehensive approach to taxation of business profits in the Ottoman empire - rather than the traditional <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxing</b> specific outputs or assets - only really became possible after a thorough cadastral survey carried out in 1858-1860, which collected detailed information {{on the status of}} businesses throughout the empire.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the content <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> {{changes and the}} <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> policymaking, in the United Kingdom and in Ireland are {{compared}} and contrasted. Since 1965 there {{have been at least}} six new mainstream taxes introduced in each country, with much similarity of content, which in part, is a result of a common tax-heritage, of common membership of the EEC and of similar external pressures. The <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> policymaking reveal rather more differences, not least because of the differing source of the division between the main parties; but even here, similarities are marked. In both, the party stage has been crucial and policymaking in government has been bedevilled by rash commitments in opposition. In both countries, tax policy has tended to become more open, with the United Kingdom offering rather more scope for Parliamentary input to the policymaking process. In both, pressure groups have exercised a significant influence on the outcome <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> proposals. Whilst both countries have had special ad hoc committees on taxation, their influence on policy has been much less than the quality of their reports deserved. The new taxes have, themselves, been subject to frequent change and, in some cases, to abolition; the fruits of two decades of feverish activity in tax policymaking are pitifully small. ...|$|R
