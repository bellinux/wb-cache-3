5|$|Marcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and Doña Dolores Paterno (composer) {{were some}} of the {{recognized}} musicians in this era.

Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk <b>music</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers.|$|E

Modern Donegal fiddle music is often played in concerts and recorded on albums.|$|E
5|$|The lyricism in Delius's early {{compositions}} {{reflected the}} music {{he had heard}} in America and the influences of European composers such as Edvard Grieg and Richard Wagner. As his skills matured, he developed a style uniquely his own, characterised by his individual orchestration and his uses of chromatic harmony. Delius's <b>music</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> only intermittently popular, and often subject to critical attacks. The Delius Society, formed in 1962 by his more dedicated followers, continues to promote knowledge of the composer's life and works, and sponsors the annual Delius Prize competition for young musicians.|$|E
