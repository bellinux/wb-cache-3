The study objectives were to investigate breeding places, vector species of <b>malariae,</b> and lenght of flying influence of Anopheles mosquito to <b>malariae</b> incidence among children under five years. The study was an observational research with cross sectional design which conducted in Sambelia Subdistrict East Lombok District. The sample size was 347 children under five years. The study showed that most of childrens age (47, 3 %) was 37  59 months with no differences according to sex. The nature of breeding places were 134, 70  750 m 2 in average width, with algae, grass, and moss area in water biota, and mostly muddy on turbidity level except at breeding places in two sub-villages. The study founded two genus of mosquitoes, Culex and Anopheles. The species of Anopheles that are found in the study area are An. sundaicus, An. subpictus, An. aconitus, An. barbirostris, An. minimus dan An. Anullaris. There were 9 sub villages near from the breeding places (less than 1000 m), 7 sub-villages with midlle distance from the breeding places (1000  2000 m), and 8 sub-villages far from it (more than 2000 m). The risk of <b>malariae</b> occurence was 1, 78 more for children who lived near from breeding places than children who lived far from it.

50|$|The food vacuole is the {{specialized}} compartment that degrades hemoglobin during the asexual erythrocytic {{stage of the}} parasite. It is implied that effective drug treatments can be developed by targeting the proteolytic enzymes of the food vacuole. In a paper published in 1997, Westling et al. focused their attention on the aspartic endopeptidase class of enzymes, simply called plasmepsins. They sought to characterize the specificity for the enzymes cloned from P. vivax and P. <b>malariae.</b> Using substrate specificity studies and inhibitor analysis, {{it was found that}} the plasmepsins for P. <b>malariae</b> and P. vivax showed less specificity than that for P. falciparum. Unfortunately, this means that the development of a selective inhibitor for P. <b>malariae</b> may prove more challenging than the development of one for P. falciparum.Another study by Bruce et al. presented evidence that there may be regular genetic exchange within P. <b>malariae</b> populations. Six polymorphic genetic markers from P. <b>malariae</b> were isolated and analyzed in 70 samples of naturally acquired P. <b>malariae</b> infections from different parts of the world.

IgG with anti-P. <b>malariae</b> specificity was found in eluates of kidney tissues from such patients and P. <b>malariae</b> antigen was identified in the GBM by immunofluorescence studies employing human antiserum to P. <b>malariae.</b> These observations are compatible with the concept that the nephropathy associated with P. <b>malariae</b> infections {{is a form of}} immune-complex nephritis initiated by circulating P. <b>malariae</b> antigen(s) and anti-P. <b>malariae</b> antibodies. This concept is supported by electron microscope studies showing electron-dense material associated with the GBM of certain diseased kidneys in which immune complexes had been detected in glomeruli by immunofluorescence. The concept of malaria-associated renal disease as a form of immune-complex disease should be useful in developing new approaches to research on the pathogenesis of both the initiating and the perpetuating immunopathological lesion.

5|$|In {{the book}} , the author Charles Mann, cites sources that {{speculate}} that the reason African slaves {{were brought to the}} British Americas was because of their immunity to <b>malaria.</b> Britain did not have large number of African slaves, there were plenty of unemployed workers who could come as indentured servants. In the area above the Mason–Dixon line, the <b>malaria</b> protozoa did not fare well, the English-speaking indentured servant proved more profitable as he would work toward his freedom and hence worked with less supervision and coercion. As <b>malaria</b> spread, places such as the tidewater of Virginia and South Carolina which had previously been habitable by white people became endemic with <b>malaria.</b> Small white landholders were at a disadvantage to plantation owners, as they risk complete economic ruin when they were sick, while plantation owners relied on more <b>malaria</b> resistant West African slaves. <b>Malaria</b> caused huge losses to British forces in the South during the revolutionary war as well as to Union forces during the Civil War. <b>Malaria</b> also helped weaken the Native American population and make them more susceptible to other diseases.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, before antibiotics, {{patients}} with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with <b>malaria</b> to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese psychiatrist, began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced Plasmodium vivax <b>malaria.</b> Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (Spirochaeta pallida also known as Treponema pallidum). P. vivax infections were then terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling the fever with quinine, the effects of both syphilis and <b>malaria</b> could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from <b>malaria,</b> this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. Therapeutic <b>malaria</b> opened up a wide field of chemotherapeutic research and was practised until 1950.

5|$|Efforts {{to control}} the spread of <b>malaria</b> {{suffered}} a major setback in 1930: entomologist Raymond Corbett Shannon discovered imported disease-bearing Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes living in Brazil (DNA analysis later revealed the actual species to be A. arabiensis).

In 1938, the introduction of this vector caused the greatest epidemic of <b>malaria</b> ever seen in the New World.

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, traditional herbal remedies {{have been used}} to treat <b>malaria.</b> The first effective treatment for <b>malaria</b> came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the insecticide DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic quinine was prescribed in <b>malaria</b> endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and artemisinins, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of <b>malaria.</b> After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.|$|E

50|$|Both {{of these}} {{experiments}} illustrate that development of vaccine options will prove challenging, if not impossible. Dr. William Collins doubts that anyone is currently looking for possible vaccines for P. <b>malariae</b> {{and given the}} complexity of the parasite it can be inferred why.

Collins cites the great restrictions of studies with chimpanzees and monkeys as a sizeable barrier.

50|$|Plasmodium <b>malariae</b> {{causes a}} chronic {{infection}} {{that in some}} cases can last a lifetime. The P. <b>malariae</b> parasite has several differences between it and the other Plasmodium parasites, one being that maximum parasite counts are usually low compared to those in patients infected with P. falciparum or P. vivax. The reason for this can be accounted for by the lower number of merozoites produced per erythrocytic cycle, the longer 72-hour developmental cycle (compared to the 48-hour cycle of P. vivax and P. falciparum), the preference for development in older erythrocytes and the resulting earlier development of immunity by the human host.Another defining feature of P. <b>malariae</b> is that the fever manifestations of the parasite are more moderate relative to those of P. falciparum and P. vivax and fevers show quartan periodicity. Along with bouts of fever and more general clinical symptoms such as chills and nausea, the presence of edema and the nephrotic syndrome has been documented with some P. <b>malariae</b> infections. It has been suggested that immune complexes may cause structural glomerular damage and that renal disease may also occur. Although P. <b>malariae</b> alone has a low morbidity rate, it does contribute to the total morbidity caused by all Plasmodium species, as manifested in the incidences of anemia, low birth rate and reduced resistance to other infections.|$|R
