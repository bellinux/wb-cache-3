Three dispersion compensation techniques are used to compensate the dispersion in 40 Gbps OTDM system: pre-, post- and symmetrical over an Alcatel Dispersion Compensated Fiber (DCF) having dispersion 8 ps/nm-km. These three techniques pre, post and symmetrical are compared. With pre- dispersion compensation technique, <b>maximum</b> distance <b>travelled</b> by a signal was 572 km.

40|$|Abstract The Asymmetric <b>Maximum</b> <b>Travelling</b> Salesperson problem, {{also known}} as the Taxicab Ripoff problem, is the problem of finding a maximally {{weighted}} tour in a complete asymmetric graph with non-negative weights. We propose a polynomial time approximation algorithm for the problem with a 58 approximation guarantee. This (1) improves upon the approximation factors of previous results and (2) presents a simpler solution to the previously fairly involved algorithms. Our solution uses a simple LP formulation. Previous solutions were combinatorial. We make use of the LP in a novel manner and strengthen the Path-Coloring method originally proposed in [13]. 1 Introduction Problem Formulation In the <b>maximum</b> asymmetric <b>travelling</b> salesman problem, Max TSP for short, we are given a complete weighted directed graph G = (V; E; w) with nonnegative edge weights wuv * 0; (u; v) 2 E and need to find a closed tour of maximum weight visiting all vertices exactly once.

40|$|Abstract: Vehicle routing {{problem is}} a classic combinational {{optimization}} problem, which has been attracting research attentions in logistics and optimization area. Conventional static vehicle routing problem assumes the logistics information is accurate and timely, and {{does not take into}} account the uncertainties, which is therefore inadequate during practical applications. In this paper, a vehicle initial routing optimization model considering uncertainties is proposed, the vehicle capacity, customer time-window, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>travelling</b> distance as well as the road capacity are considered. In the cyber-physical logistics system background, a routing adjustment model is proposed to minimize the total distribution cost considering the road congestion, and the static and dynamic models are proposed for traffic information transmission network to quantitatively analyse the impact of the traffic information transmission delay on the vehicle routing optimization. The learnable genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the initial routing optimization model and the routing adjustment model. The simulation results have verified its effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Capacitated minimax {{facility}} location-allocation (LA) {{is a type}} of facility {{problem which}} is of prime importance for emergency situation, since it directly affects the service response time to customers. Capacitated minimax LA problem is concerned with locating some new facilities and allocating their capacity to customers when the <b>maximum</b> <b>travelled</b> distance from customers to facilities is minimized. This study involves a fixed line barrier in a region with some border crossings along it which divides the area into two subregions. Although several studies have recently been done on this problem in which the customer locations are known with certainty, much less attention has been devoted to developing a comprehensive mathematical model for the probabilistic extension of customer locations when there are some restrictions in the region. In order to fill this gap, a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model is proposed for facility LA when customer locations are randomly distributed according to a bivariate normal probability distribution. Finally, the BARON solver in the GAMS software is used to solve the model, and a numerical example is provided to demonstrate its efficiency...|$|R
40|$|European Commission {{preparations}} for a revised draft directive on animal transport {{are now at}} an advanced stage of preparation.

Comment: There have been some suggestions from EU officials in international fora that the EU may seek an extension of its regulations on animal transport to animals whose carcasses are later exported to the EU market.

5000|$|Vision Zero {{suggests}} the following [...] "possible long term <b>maximum</b> <b>travel</b> speeds {{related to the}} infrastructure, given best practice in vehicle design and 100% restraint use". These speeds are based on human and automobile limits. For example, the human tolerance for a pedestrian hit by a well-designed car is approximately 30 km/h. If a higher speed in urban areas is desired, the option is to separate pedestrian crossings from the traffic. If not, pedestrian crossings, or zones (or vehicles), must be designed to generate speeds of a maximum of 30 km/h. Similarly, the inherent safety of well-designed cars can be anticipated to be a maximum of 70 km/h in frontal impacts, and 50 km/h in side impacts. Speeds over 100 km/h can be tolerated if the infrastructure is designed to prevent frontal and side impacts.|$|E

H is the piston, which is {{required}} to move vertically but not horizontally. The heart of the design is the four-bar linkage consisting of AB, BE and EG and the base link is AG, both joints on {{the framework of the}} engine. As the beam rocks, point F (which is drawn to aid this explanation, but which is not visible on the machine itself) describes an elongated figure-of-eight (more precisely, a lemniscate of Bernoulli) in mid-air. Since the motion of the walking beam is constrained to a small angle, F describes only a short section of the figure-of-eight, which is quite close to a vertical straight line. The figure-of-eight is symmetrical as long as arms AB and EG are equal in length, and straightest when the ratio of BF to FE matches that of AB to EG.

The effect of sex, year of study, breeding site, number and age of chicks and the timing of tracking on foraging behaviour were investigated using a General Estimation Equation model. A range of sampling scenarios reflecting likely field sampling were also tested to compare how foraging behaviour differed depending on composition of the sample of birds tracked.
