He {{was active in the}} formation of the Rural Housing and Development Corporation and served on the Council on Higher Education. He also served on President Jimmy Carter's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the arms}} of the encirclement had now made contact, the Allies were not yet astride Seventh Army's escape route in any great {{strength}} and their positions came under frenzied assault. During the day an armoured column from the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, capturing half the village and <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> open road for six hours until being forced out. Many Germans escaped along this route and numerous small parties infiltrated on foot through to the River Dives during the night.|$|E

5|$|As Hurricane Two {{intensified}} over open waters, the season's third {{storm was}} identified on August9. Initially tracking westward, the hurricane turned sharply north, <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> intensity of 85mph (140km/h) during its known existence. Briefly slowing on August11, the system quickly picked up forward speed {{as it turned}} northwestward, paralleling the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula. On August14, the hurricane turned north once more; however, it lost its identity the following day {{off the coast of}} Baja California.|$|E
5|$|As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's {{military}} {{structure was}} cut back and reorganized, with new forces {{such as the}} Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes {{brought about by the}} collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> independent nuclear deterrent.|$|E
5|$|By September25, Georges {{entered the}} Gulf of Mexico and {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane. The storm re-organized over the gulf, with the eye fully reforming and deep convection persisting around {{the center of}} circulation. By September27, Georges reached an intensity of 110mph (175km/h). Several hours prior to landfall the next day, the hurricane weakened slightly and tracked inland near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105mph (165km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed, executing a brief clockwise loop before <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> eastward drift. Gradually weakening, the hurricane was only a tropical depression by the afternoon of September29. Two days later, Georges fully dissipated near the Atlantic coast of Florida.|$|E

5|$|Cora was {{an unusual}} cyclone, <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> unusually low {{latitude}} for the Atlantic in August at high speeds, similar to the tracks of Tropical Storm Alma in 1974 and Tropical Storm Fran in 1990. The hurricane was also upgraded into a hurricane based solely on satellite photography, {{the second time this}} occurred. Although it passed through the Windward Islands and the Lesser Antilles, only minor effects were reported. Cora was also responsible for altering weather conditions allowing for a takeoff of the historical flight of the Double Eagle II hot air balloon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the short}} time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford {{engineers}} produced many significant technological advances. As {{no one had ever}} built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> adequate safety margin, DuPont engineers installed ammonia-based refrigeration systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.|$|E
5|$|In {{their work}} Pleasure Able: Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities, authors Kate Naphtali and Edith MacHattie of the Disabilities Health Research Network under the {{supervision}} of doctors Andrei Krassioukov and Stacy L Elliott recommended use of the Magic Wand in sexual activity for people with disabilities. The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or limited use of their hands. They also said it was well-suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper extremities.|$|E

5|$|<b>Maintaining</b> <b>an</b> {{affordable}} {{food supply}} {{to the city of}} Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (annona) to citizens who registered for it. About 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome received the dole, amounting to about 33kg. per month, for a per annum total of about 100,000 tons of wheat primarily from Sicily, north Africa, and Egypt. The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions and family life among the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on the estates of the landowning class.|$|E
5|$|Mitch Hawker's {{worldwide}} Best Roller Coaster Poll is {{an annual}} survey of roller coasters {{from around the}} world. It {{is widely regarded as}} the best and most accurate of any roller coaster poll available due to its ranking algorithm which prevents the poll from becoming a popularity contest. In the poll, Thunder Run entered at position 30 in 1994, <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> average of 54 for the 17 years that followed.

5|$|The {{difficulty}} of <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> air force with little funding {{during a time}} of rapid technological development was compounded by the Swiss militia system: all but a handful of military personnel were citizen soldiers who served only a few weeks each year following their initial recruitment phase. Military pilot candidates underwent the same recruit training, NCO school and officer candidate school as other Swiss army officers, followed by a pilot school of 173days, then re-entered civilian life. During his first two years of service, a pilot's training continued with ten logged flight hours per month, and thereafter he was required to fly fifty hours per year at his convenience.|$|E
5|$|The simple {{appearance}} of MiGs could often accomplish their mission by causing American pilots to jettison their bomb loads {{as a defensive}} measure. In 1966, the MiG-17 were joined by more modern Soviet-built MiG-21 Fishbeds, which could fight on a more equal footing with the U.S. aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force was <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> interceptor force of 100 aircraft, {{many of which were}} based on PRC airfields and out of reach of American air attack.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was {{the northern city of}} Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E

5|$|Ellis was {{selected}} in the second round, 22nd overall, by the Windsor Spitfires in the 2007 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Draft. Establishing himself as a top defenceman in the League during his rookie campaign, he scored 15 goals and 63 points over 63 games. His points total and +30 plus-minus rating led all OHL rookie defencemen. In the 2008 playoffs, Ellis added five points in five games as the Spitfires were eliminated by the Sarnia Sting. He {{was named to the}} Canadian Hockey League (CHL) and OHL All-Rookie Teams, along with Spitfires teammate Taylor Hall. Ellis was further recognized for his academic performance, <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> 81 percent average in university preparation courses at St. Anne Catholic High School in Belle River, earning him the League's Bobby Smith Trophy as scholastic player of the year. He received the award over fellow nominee Steven Stamkos of the Sting, who had won it the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collision}} Prime Minister Menzies ordered a Royal Commission {{to investigate the}} event. The Commissioner concluded that {{the collision}} was primarily the fault of Voyagers bridge crew not <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> effective lookout, but also placed blame on Melbournes Captain John Robertson (who resigned shortly after) and two other officers for failing to alert Voyager or take effective measures to avoid collision. The handing of the Royal Commission was seen as poor, and after a combination of public pressure and claims that Stevens had a drinking problem, a second Royal Commission was announced: the only time two Commissions have been held for the same incident. The second Royal Commission found that Stevens was likely medically unfit for command, {{that some of the}} first Commission's conclusions were therefore incorrect, and the Melbourne officers were not at fault. The two commissions caused great anguish in the hierarchy of the RAN, which was not accustomed to such tight scrutiny, and led to the eventual dismantling of the Naval Board's isolation from the civilian world.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{interaction}} between a cold front, multiple tropical waves, {{and a broad}} {{area of low pressure}} in the wake of Nicole {{led to the formation of}} a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on October11 about 115mi (185km) southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios. The nascent cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Paula six hours later, briefly moving ashore the northeastern tip of Honduras early on October11 before re-emerging into the northwestern Caribbean. Amid a favorable environment, Paula intensified into a hurricane by 00:00UTC on October12 and attained peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) at 18:00UTC while <b>maintaining</b> <b>an</b> unusually small size. An increase in shear prompted a steady weakening trend as the system turned north and then east. Paula fell to tropical storm intensity early on October14, making landfall between Santa Lucia and Puerto Esperanza with winds of 65mph (100km/h). The system further weakened to a tropical depression early on October15 and degenerated into a remnant low by 12:00UTC. The remnant low quickly became diffuse, dissipating at 18:00UTC.|$|E
