However since July 1, 2016 users have had a 15 minute grace period to exit the station; those who do so will receive a rebate of the amount paid as an autoload to their SmarTrip card.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009 the Network Railcard {{terms were}} revised again, making the card both more {{expensive}} and raising the <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> for a discount to £13.00.|$|E
25|$|Further {{criticism}} has arisen from the set-up {{costs of the}} SmartRider card. The total cost of set up is $20 {{and the cost of}} the card itself is $10. Although Transperth claim this is {{to cover the cost of}} a passenger travelling four zones on a lesser-zone fare, this is contradicted by the inability to travel without a <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> on the card.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minimum</b> <b>fares</b> are payable on some {{services}} to discourage passengers wishing to travel short distances from using seats {{that could be}} used by those who wish to travel longer distances.|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{original}} success of Oasis Hong Kong {{was due to the}} airline's widely advertised <b>minimum</b> <b>fares</b> beginning at just GBP£75 one way. However, fares later became much less competitive.|$|R
2500|$|From 15 September 1978, <b>minimum</b> <b>fares</b> {{no longer}} applied at weekends, on bank {{holidays}} {{or at any}} time during July and August; at these times, the full 50% discount was applied to all available ticket types, no matter how low the resulting discounted fare became. [...] On 1 September 1980, <b>minimum</b> <b>fares</b> no longer applied after 6.00pm on weekdays; and in 1986, this was changed to 10.00am. [...] The latter condition remains in force today, meaning that the full discount is available at all times except in the morning peak (before 10.00am). [...] Weekends, bank holidays, July and August are still unrestricted.|$|R
25|$|The rail {{portion of}} the race was {{achieved}} with no financial cost to the licence payer, due to fare-paying passengers being on the tour, and through savings achieved by the railway companies providing their services at cost. The helicopter {{was provided by the}} BBC. More than 100 passengers were on the train, paying a <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> of £250 a head with dining service throughout.|$|E
25|$|On June 14, 1952, Hunting Air Transport began {{operating}} quasi-scheduled low-fare {{services from}} the UK to East, Central, Southern and West Africa using Vikings. These services {{were part of}} a joint operation with Airwork, another wholly private British independent airline of that era. Flights initially operated on a fortnightly basis. International Air Transport Association (IATA) <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> rules did not apply to these services because the governments that owned most of IATA's member airlines had not empowered it to set and control domestic air fares, which included dependent overseas territories.|$|E
25|$|Labour costs rose {{considerably}} {{during the}} latter part of the war, and a further wage award by the Committee on Production, together with increased cost of materials, made it necessary to consider further fare increases. The first scheme in March consisted of children’s fares being made half adult fares and an alteration to ordinary stages, with no alteration to workmen’s fares; this scheme was amended in April to revert to the old stages, with children’s fares fixed at half the adult fare, with a 1d. <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> rising to 1½d. over a 2½d. and 3d. adult stage, and to 2d. over a 3½d. and 4d. stage. Ordinary fares of 1d. and 1½d. were increased by ½d. and all fares of 2d. and over were increased by 1d., the 1½d. minimum taking effect from Sunday 14 April.|$|E
25|$|From 17 May 2009, <b>minimum</b> <b>fares</b> were {{standardised}} at £12 {{for both}} single and return journeys before 10.00am. Cards were also entitled to discount on First Class advance fares and Anytime Day Travelcards.|$|R

The farthest possible trip, from Pittsburg/Bay Point to Millbrae, costs less {{because of the}} $4 additional charge added to SFO trips and $6 additional charge added to OAK trips. Entering and exiting the same station within three hours accrues an excursion fare of $5.75. Passengers without sufficient fare to complete their journey must use a cash-only AddFare machine to pay the remaining balance in order to exit the station.|$|E

30|$|The third variable, price dispersion, is more {{controversial}} {{in the literature}} and bears elaboration. Several definitions have been employed: the range between the maximum and <b>minimum</b> <b>fares</b> [29], the coefficient of variation [30], and the power divergence statistic [12]. The power divergence statistic (PDS) accounts for time-dependent pricing and measures the similarity of price distributions in different airfare histories. Thus, if a carrier applies different temporal fare curves for different flights, their PDS will increase. We want to separate this kind of behaviour from price adjustments “unplanned” related to greater demand uncertainty and other strategic interactions. Thus, we shall depart from previous works by decomposing the price volatility into two effects: one connected to variations of the predicted temporal fare curve, {{and the other to}} daily price adjustments around the predicted curve.|$|R
50|$|Although NSE {{ceased to}} exist in 1994, the {{grouping}} of services that it defined before privatisation remain grouped by the Network Railcard, which can be bought for £30 and which offers a 34% discount for adults and 60% discount for accompanying children after 10:00 on weekdays and all day at weekends (subject to a <b>minimum</b> weekday <b>fare</b> of £13).|$|R
2500|$|The {{first version}} of the Railcard, the [...] "Student Card" [...] of 1974, gave 50% {{discounts}} on Second Class Single and Ordinary Return fares, as they were then known. [...] (Ordinary Returns were valid for travel at all times, and the return journey could take place on a later date. [...] They later became [...] "Standard Returns", and are now known as [...] "Anytime Returns".) [...] The higher-rate <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> (see Price and <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> below) applied to Ordinary Returns, while the lower-rate fare {{was used as the}} baseline for other fares.|$|E
2500|$|From the beginning, {{discounted}} tickets {{bought with}} the Railcard {{were subject to}} a [...] "minimum fare", although its level and {{the circumstances in which}} it was applied have varied considerably over time. [...] For the first 4½ years, until 15 September 1978, minimum fares applied at all times; if the price of the ticket including the full discount was lower than the relevant <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> level, the latter would be charged and the full discount would not be given. [...] For example, if the date was June 1974, the journey in question was a [...] "Higher rate" [...] Ordinary Return and its published full fare was £1.30, the passenger would be charged the £1.00 <b>minimum</b> <b>fare,</b> because the discounted fare would be lower than this (50% discount = £1.30 ÷ 2 = £0.65). [...] If the £1.30 fare was on a [...] "Lower Rate" [...] ticket, however, the full discount would be applied, as the <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> for lower-rate tickets (£0.50) was less than the discounted fare (£0.65).|$|E
2500|$|Express buses (branded [...] "Xpresso") {{operate on}} similar routes, {{but have a}} limited number of stops and a higher <b>minimum</b> <b>fare.</b> These {{services}} run Monday to Friday at peak times and do not operate on public holidays.|$|E
5000|$|In the end, the {{authorities}} {{as well as}} the industry admitted that the absurd [...] "affinity group" [...] system worked to nobody's satisfaction. They also admitted that the real purpose of travel of an overwhelming majority of those who were travelling under the old [...] "affinity group" [...] rules was to avail themselves of a cheap flight. It was therefore decided to scrap the entire system and to replace it with a new system that recognised as well as legalised the growing demand for cheap transatlantic air travel at fares below the official IATA <b>minimum</b> <b>fares.</b> This was also the time Laker Airways was battling {{the authorities}} {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic to gain approval for its revolutionary [...] "Skytrain" [...] low-fare, [...] "no frills" [...] transatlantic scheduled service that it intended to operate between London and New York City on a daily basis.|$|R

2500|$|The One Day Capitalcard {{became the}} One Day Travelcard in 1989, and as from April 1993 only all-zone tickets (Zones 1-6) could be {{purchased}} at a discount, again subject to a <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> restriction. [...] As of 2010, this is £5.00.|$|E

2500|$|To avoid Hutt Valley {{passengers}} overcrowding the service, passengers boarding a Masterton-bound Wairarapa Connection {{service at}} Wellington and alighting before Maymorn station must pay the full fare from Wellington to Maymorn ($10.50 [...] ). Those using ten-trip tickets and monthly passes must pay the cash fare difference as a surcharge, i.e. $5.00 for Petone and Waterloo, $1.00 for Upper Hutt. Warnings about the <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> {{are placed on}} the doors of all SW and SE carriages. Until April 2011, the <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> also applied to those boarding Wellington-bound services after Maymorn. This was temporarily removed in April 2011 to help alleviate a rolling stock shortage bought about by the delayed introduction of the Matangi electric multiple units, and was later made permanent in October 2011.|$|E
50|$|Fares are rounded to {{the nearest}} $0.05 for single-ride fares and day passes and $1.00 for monthly passes, after fare {{multiples}} are applied.

50|$|The <b>minimum</b> {{and maximum}} <b>fares</b> {{on the line}} are 10 and 40 respectively, roughly 1.5 times the current {{unsubsidized}} BEST bus fare for a given distance. Line 1 utilizes an Automatic Fare Collection System (AFC). Riders can pay their fare using tokens or refillable smart cards. Smart cards can be recharged online.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, public {{transportation}} systems that receive federal funding {{are required to}} offer, at <b>minimum,</b> half <b>fares</b> to the older adults and people with disabilities during off-peak travel. To define an older adult, they must be 65 {{years of age or}} over but the transit authority may be more inclusive in its application. A person with a disability is defined as an individual who by reasons of illness, injury, age, congenital malfunction, or other permanent or temporary incapacity or disability, including those who use those with semi-ambulatory capabilities, are unable without special facilities or special planning or design to utilize mass transportation facilities and services as effectively as persons who are not so affected.|$|R
2500|$|Dublin Bus operate an 'exact fare' policy. Passengers {{place the}} exact fare in coins (notes are not accepted) in the fare box before the ticket is issued. In {{the case of}} overpayment, a [...] "change ticket" [...] is issued which can be {{exchanged}} at the company's head office on O'Connell Street. Routes 747 and 757, the express routes to and from Dublin Airport have a <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> of €7; banknotes are accepted, and change is given in cash.|$|E
2500|$|Holders {{of annual}} season tickets for {{journeys}} within the Network Rail area, including on London Underground, are issued with a [...] "Gold Card" [...] which gives them similar privileges to the Network Railcard, {{as well as}} being able to purchase a Network Railcard for a friend or family member for a discounted price of £10.00 [...] There is no <b>minimum</b> <b>fare</b> for [...] "Gold Card" [...] discounts, and the ability to upgrade to First Class for a flat fare also remains. [...] This includes cases where the annual season ticket is applied to an Oyster card.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most recent}} change {{involving}} the discount structure happened as from 29 May 2000, and involved {{the introduction of}} another new ticket stock with a changed logo, red upper band and new form number (RSP 4599/253; all previous APTIS Family Railcards had used BR 4599/19, or RSP 4599/19 after privatisation.) [...] All adult fares received a 34% discount, representing an improvement in respect of Saver and Supersaver fares; but the child discount was amended from a flat fare of £2.00 to a 60% discount on the full child fare (equivalent to an 81% discount on the full adult fare). [...] This was subject to a £1.00 <b>minimum</b> <b>fare.</b> [...] These conditions and discounts remain in place as of 2007.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} minimum wage legislation {{during a period of}} economic recession. In particular, I examine whether states with minimum wages higher than the federal <b>minimum</b> wage <b>fared</b> better or worse during the recession that began December 2007. Since minimum wages raise the price of labor above market price, firms subject to this additional cost might experience greater adverse effects of the recession. On the other hand, since state minimum wages are often enacted in states with relatively high market wages, the disemployment effects of minimum wage legislation might be negligible. Despite a large increase in minimum wages during this period, no significant disemployment effects were estimated. EconomicsMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

2500|$|Thaksin {{was accused}} of [...] "policy corruption", such as {{infrastructure}} and liberalisation policies that, while legal and a potential benefit to society, also aided companies that were owned by his family members. Supannee Chai-amporn and Sirinthip Arun-rue of the National Institute of Development Administration claimed that policy corruption caused the state to spend nearly 30 per cent more than it otherwise should have spent, costing the state an additional 400billion baht. Other examples cited were the Board of Investment's granting tax breaks worth a total of THB16.4billion to Shin Satellite for its iPSTAR project in 2003, and the Transport Ministry's decision the same year to abolish the <b>minimum</b> air <b>fare</b> of THB3.8 /km when Shin Corp was about {{to enter into a}} joint venture with low-cost carrier AirAsia to open a Thai subsidiary.|$|R
