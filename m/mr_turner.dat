500|$|In February 2006, Stork {{became the}} last {{perpetrator}} sentenced {{in the political}} assassination plot, after ten months of negotiations with Oregon prosecutors. Stork offered to turn herself in {{and return to the}} United States after learning of her son's terminal brain tumor. Prior to sentencing, the court allowed her to travel to Australia to visit her son. In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, Stork also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law. An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years probation, and three months time already served in a German jail. Turner thought she should have received a harsher sentence, and commented [...] "This was a lying-in-wait conspiracy to murder me, a presidential appointee, {{and for a long time}} I slept with a loaded gun beside my bed." [...] Though Stork could have faced life in prison, U.S. District Judge Judge Malcolm F. Marsh thought she had [...] "seen the error of her ways." [...] A federal prosecutor in the case described Stork as the [...] "MVP" [...] of the conspiracy, and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner. After her sentencing, Stork stated: [...] "I actually conspired to kill <b>Mr.</b> <b>Turner,</b> it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth ... No person has the right to do what I did. I'm truly sorry." [...] Stork returned to Germany after her sentencing.|$|E

2500|$|Julian Dalrymple-Sykes (Ben Aris) (Series 5, Series 8–9) Dancing Instructor – Julian was {{a former}} lover of Yvonne's who stood in for Barry when he was {{incapacitated}} with a bad back during the 1959 season. He then joined Yvonne full-time at the camp following Barry's departure mid-way through the 1960 season. Julian was a pig farmer by profession and had a very successful business, which he left {{in the care of}} his assistant <b>Mr</b> <b>Turner</b> (Billy Burden) when he went to work at Maplins. He was also a championship boxer having been ABA welterweight champion four years running in the 1940s, and challenged Ted to a fight after an argument in one episode. After joining Maplins full-time, he briefly shared Ted and Spike's chalet before being given one of his own, and annoyed Ted with his habit of getting up early to go for a morning swim. Throughout the series he desperately tried to rekindle his past romance with Yvonne, but she frequently played hard-to-get, which frustrated him enormously. He tried to persuade Yvonne to leave Maplins and live with him at his pig farm, but she refused, claiming that she [...] "couldn't stand the mud". After the 1960 season, he sold his farm and took Yvonne travelling around the world.|$|E
2500|$|He {{then moved}} on to William Rowland Sandiford 'who kept a small stud of flat racers and steeplechasers' at Colkirk House, Colkirk, Norfolk. [...] Bailey's Magazine of Sports & Pastimes {{illustrates}} Green's work ethic with three rides in two days for William Rowland Sandiford at the Norfolk and Norwich Steeple Chases on 10 & 11 September 1839 on the 4yr-old bay colt Oliver Twist. A small biography when he hit the public consciousness ten years later mentions that 'in 1839-40 was successful with Thought, Corringham and Longwaist' and there are several race reports of 1840 that mention his wins on these horses. Indeed, one account of a Chase at Diss waxes quite lyrical over Green's handling of the race-winning heavyweight chestnut Thought - 'Mr Green was rider for Mr Sandiford, and <b>Mr</b> <b>Turner</b> of Carlton, was seen mounted on Modesty. It would be hard to find two better Steeple Chase Riders than them ... Green on Thought had a tremendous fall, by his horse swerving against a gate post; although much stunned he was up [...] "as quick as Thought," [...] and away went horse and rider at an increased speed ... The riding of Green was much admired, he is not only a good but a most fortunate rider, and has almost invariably ridden the winner, wherever he has appeared this season'.|$|E
