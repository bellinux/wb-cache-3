While some {{progress is being made}} in reducing child <b>marriage,</b> particularly for girls under fifteen, the prospects are daunting. The indicator for this will be the percentage of women aged 20–24 who were married or in a union before the age of eighteen.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his governorship, Romney opposed same-sex <b>marriage</b> and civil unions, but advocated tolerance and supported some domestic partnership benefits. A November 2003 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision required the state to recognize same-sex marriages (Goodridge v. Department of Public Health). Romney reluctantly backed a state constitutional amendment in February 2004 that would have banned those marriages but still allowed civil unions, viewing it as the only feasible way to accomplish the former. In May 2004, in compliance with the court decision, the governor instructed town clerks to begin issuing <b>marriage</b> licenses to same-sex couples. However, citing a 1913 law that barred out-of-state residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their union would be illegal in their home state, he said no <b>marriage</b> licenses were to be issued to those people not planning to move to Massachusetts. In June 2005, Romney abandoned his support for the compromise amendment, stating that it confused voters who opposed both same-sex <b>marriage</b> and civil unions. Instead, he endorsed a ballot initiative led by the Coalition for <b>Marriage</b> and Family (an alliance of socially conservative organizations) that would have banned same-sex <b>marriage</b> and made no provisions for civil unions. In 2004 and 2006, he urged the U.S. Senate to vote in favor of the Federal <b>Marriage</b> Amendment.|$|E
