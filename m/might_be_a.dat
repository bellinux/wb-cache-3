5|$|Herennianus and Timolaus: the {{two were}} {{mentioned}} in the Augustan History and are not attested in any other source; Herennianus <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> conflation of Hairan and Herodianus while Timolaus is most probably a fabrication, although Dietmar Kienast suggest {{that he might be}} Vaballathus.|$|E
5|$|A call {{like this}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bit ambiguous, {{but it was}} unsettling {{to those who were}} {{on the side of the}} status quo. Yiddish theater was banned in Russia {{starting}} September 14, 1883, as part of the anti-Jewish reaction following the assassination of Czar Alexander II. Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} breed associations have been testing the F94L status of cattle registered in their herd books. The absence of F94L genes in some tested cattle <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{result of a}} sire or dam ancestor that had double muscling (MH) genes, or {{more likely that the}} myostatin gene was the normal or wild type variant found most commonly in beef cattle. In the latter case, loss of the F94L variant will arise when grading up to purebred when base animals are not Limousins.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes drum, {{although}} the male does {{so much more}} often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As late as {{the early twentieth century}} it was thought that the drumming <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> vocalisation, and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Hittite {{accounts}} {{about the}} campaigns of Attarsiya and the Ahhiya in general {{may indicate that}} there was a possible Mycenaean empire centered on late Bronze Age Greece.

Anna was also enchanted by Sabrina, who became the link between Day and the Seward family. Anna took a keen interest in Sabrina's story, as her father had taken in Honora Sneyd when Sneyd's mother had died.|$|E
5|$|Fairley was {{acutely aware}} that much {{remained}} unknown about malaria.

Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.|$|E

5|$|Szilárd was {{concerned}} that German scientists might also attempt this experiment. The German nuclear physicist Siegfried Flügge published two influential articles on the exploitation of nuclear energy in 1939. After discussing this prospect with fellow Hungarian physicist Eugene Wigner, they decided that they should warn the Belgians, as the Belgian Congo was the best source of uranium ore. Wigner suggested that Albert Einstein <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> suitable person to do this, as he knew the Belgian Royal Family.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a massive companion brings many other possibilities.

This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.|$|E
