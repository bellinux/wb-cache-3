5|$|As {{a proven}} Test player {{and the senior}} spin bowler, Ring was chosen for his second tour of England in 1953, this time under the {{captaincy}} of Hassett. It proved not <b>much</b> <b>happier</b> than his 1948 experience, though in a less strong side his eventual wicket tally, 68 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 19.89, placed him third among the regular bowlers.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry for the Saturday-morning practice sessions. Häkkinen set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the third}} session at 1:51.043, quicker than his best on Friday and ahead of Frentzen, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher. Coulthard, who had an engine problem early in the session, was fifth-fastest (ahead of Button and Michael Schumacher). Alesi, Villeneuve and Sauber driver Nick Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. During the final practice session Häkkinen could not improve his time, although he remained the fastest. Button, <b>much</b> <b>happier</b> with his car's handling, set the second-fastest time. The Jordan drivers were third and fourth, with Trulli ahead of Frentzen. Ralf Schumacher and Coulthard completed the top six. Of the slower drivers, Marc Gené had an anxious moment when his Minardi car shed its engine cover but was {{able to return to}} his garage.|$|E
5|$|Shining Armor, Princess Celestia and {{the others}} {{apologize}} to Twilight for not believing her, and Princess Celestia commends Twilight Sparkle, for it was her instincts and conviction to them that ultimately saved the day; she is heralded as the one, true hero. The wedding ceremony is quickly rescheduled, with Twilight eagerly overseeing preparations for a <b>much</b> <b>happier</b> and profoundly appreciative Cadance. Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are married, and a celebration ensues, with Twilight as the wedding singer ("Love is in Bloom"). During the ceremony and the reception, Twilight's ingering anxiety of losing touch with her brother is finally put to rest when Shining confesses that he persuaded Cadance to accept his proposal when he mentioned she would gain Twilight as a sister-in-law. Furthermore, just before the couple departs for their honeymoon, Shining thanks his sister for all she has done and the siblings reaffirm their love.|$|E

5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a pea comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although it will be <b>much</b> <b>happier</b> and produce better if allowed to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken wellsuited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{returned}} to {{action at the}} Masters, to a mixed response from the audience (being both booed and clapped). He won his first round match 6–1 on 16 January 2007, against Ali Carter, making two century breaks in the process. However, he then created more controversy by failing to attend a post-match press conference. He did record a short interview with Steve Davis for the BBC, stating that he was <b>much</b> <b>happier</b> than at the UK Championship, {{and that he was}} playing well once again. Sir Rodney Walker later issued a statement declaring that O'Sullivan had been excused from dealing with the media because of the exceptional circumstances affecting him. This decision was criticised by Shaun Murphy. O'Sullivan {{went on to win the}} tournament against Ding Junhui, on 21 January 2007. In the match, he was noted for his good sportsmanship by Steve Davis, specifically for comforting Ding after the twelfth frame, during which Ding had become visibly upset by an overly partisan member of the crowd, who was later ejected. O'Sullivan was leading 9–3 at the time, and won the next frame for a 10–3 victory.|$|E

5000|$|How <b>Much</b> for <b>Happy</b> is Canadian {{actress and}} singer-songwriter Cassie Steele's debut album. How <b>Much</b> for <b>Happy</b> was {{released}} in Canada on March 15, 2005 and in the US on April 26, 2005. The album was sold on iTunes in the US for a few months, but after having an argument with Rob'N'Steal Productions about the distribution of How <b>Much</b> for <b>Happy,</b> the album was removed from iTunes, yet was still available on Amazon.com. Physically, the album is now out of print in the US, but it was put back on iTunes. Steele wrote 12 out of the 13 tracks on her debut album. The thirteenth was a remake of the popular song by Jimi Hendrix, [...] "Hey Joe".|$|R
25|$|Sri Lanka on {{the other}} hand were <b>much</b> <b>happier.</b> Their side had climbed to 3rd place in the ICC Test Match rankings, with England {{slipping}} from 2nd to 5th.

25|$|To {{escape the}} Spanish Civil War, Maria Pia de Bragança moved {{with her mother}} to Rome. In 1939 she married Giuseppe Manlio Blais, a general in the Italian carabinieri. At the time, members of the carabinieri were {{forbidden}} from marrying foreigners. The marriage was, therefore, celebrated clandestinely, and was not registered civilly until 5 August 1946. The union proved <b>much</b> <b>happier</b> and together they had a daughter, Maria da Glória Cristina Amélia Valéria Antónia Blais de Saxe-Coburgo Gotha e Bragança, born in 1946. Maria Cristina de Bragança married the Spanish sculptor Miguel Ortíz y Berrocal (1933–2006) and together they lived in Verona and had two sons: Carlos Miguel Berrocal de Saxe-Coburgo Gotha e Bragança (born 1976) and Beltrão José Berrocal de Saxe-Coburgo Gotha e Bragança (born 1978).|$|E

25|$|In 1900, Zemlinsky met {{and fell}} in love with Alma Schindler, one of his {{composition}} students. She reciprocated his feelings initially; however, Alma felt a great deal of pressure from close friends and family to end the relationship. They were primarily concerned with Zemlinsky's lack of an international reputation and by an unappealing physical appearance. She broke off the relationship with Zemlinsky and subsequently married composer Gustav Mahler in 1902. Zemlinsky married Ida Guttmann in 1907, but the marriage was an unhappy one. Following Ida's death in 1929, Zemlinsky married Luise Sachsel in 1930, a woman twenty-nine years his junior, and to whom he had given singing lessons since 1914. This was a <b>much</b> <b>happier</b> relationship, lasting until Zemlinsky's death.|$|E
25|$|Doc and Marty {{return to}} 1986 where all is normal. In this timeline, {{there was no}} estate sale because Doc {{had been able to}} {{reconcile}} with his father, thus giving him and his family reason to stay part-time in Hill Valley. They find that Edna and Kid had fallen in love while in jail, and afterwards married and both became <b>much</b> <b>happier</b> and friendlier since. Doc reveals his previous absence to Marty, that he had been traveling in time to compile a history of the McFly family to present to Marty as a graduation gift. Suddenly, three separate DeLoreans appear, each with a different future version of Marty driving them. They approach Marty and Doc and insist they come to help assure that their respective futures occur as they are supposed to. Doc and his Marty leave the Marties arguing with each other, saying the future can wait until after they have enjoyed the present for a while; they then depart to an unknown time.|$|E
25|$|Darras {{formally}} enlisted as an esquire in the retinue of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel in 1387. Among {{others to}} do so, and probably thereby form a political and personal bond with Arundel, was Thomas Whitton, a long-term associate of Darras. At this point Arundel {{was one of the}} Lords Appellant, a leader of the opposition to Richard II's favourites and his policy of peace with France. Darras served with him in a naval campaign against the French, which culminated in a significant victory off Margate. As a client of the earl, and in association with two other members of his affinity, John Burley and Fulk Sprenghose, Darras was made trustee of estates belonging to Richard, 4th Lord Talbot, who was married to Arundel's niece, Ankaret le Strange of Blackmere. In 1393 he represented his county in the parliament that began on 20 January and lasted about three weeks. His fellow MP was Sir William Hugford, who was closely associated with John le Strange, 6th Baron Strange of Knockin: although powerful, the 11th Earl of Arundel seems to have been <b>much</b> <b>happier</b> to share influence than was to prove the case with his son.|$|E

500|$|On October 30, 1613, Kepler {{married the}} 24-year-old Susanna Reuttinger. Following {{the death of}} his first wife Barbara, Kepler had {{considered}} 11 different matches over two years (a decision process formalized later as the marriage problem). He eventually returned to Reuttinger (the fifth match) who, he wrote, [...] "won me over with love, humble loyalty, economy of household, diligence, and the love she gave the stepchildren." [...] The first three children of this marriage (Margareta Regina, Katharina, and Sebald) died in childhood. Three more survived into adulthood: Cordula (born 1621); Fridmar (born 1623); and Hildebert (born 1625).

Like The Witches, the film version of Quatermass and the Pit took several years to reach the screen, eventually being released in 1967. Roy Ward Baker directed, with Andrew Keir starring as Quatermass. Kneale was <b>much</b> <b>happier</b> with this version than the previous Hammer Quatermass adaptations, and the film was described by The Independent in 2006 as [...] "one of the best ever Hammer productions."

When Kelly insists the party needs a theme, Jim and Dwight are unable to think of anything. They finally settle on offering her one hour of napping or one hour of watching television.
