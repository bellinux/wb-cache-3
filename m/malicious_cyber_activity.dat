40|$|Introduction Is cybercrime, cyber espionage, {{and other}} {{malicious}} cyber activities {{what some call}} “the greatest transfer of wealth in human history,” or is it what others say is a “rounding error in a fourteen trillion dollar economy?” The wide range of existing estimates of the annual loss—from a few billion dollars to hundreds of billions—reflects several difficulties. Companies conceal their losses and some {{are not aware of}} what has been taken. Intellectual property is hard to value. Some estimates relied on surveys, which provide very imprecise results unless carefully constructed. One common problem with cybersecurity surveys is that those who answer the questions “self-select,” introducing a possible source of distortion into the results. Given the data collection problems, loss estimates are based on assumptions about scale and effect— change the assumption and you get very different results. These problems leave many estimates open to question. The Components of <b>Malicious</b> <b>Cyber</b> <b>Activity</b> In this initial report we start by asking what we should count in estimating losses from cybercrime and cyber espionage. We can break <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> <b>activity</b> into six parts: 	The loss of intellectual property and business confidential information 	Cybercrime, which costs the world {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} every year 	The loss of sensitive business information, including possible stock market manipulation 	Opportunity costs, including service and employment disruptions, and reduced trust for online activities 	The additional cost of securing networks, insurance, and recovery from cyber attacks 	Reputational damage to the hacked company Put these together and the cost of cybercrime and cyber espionage to the global economy is probably measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars. To put this in perspective, the World Bank says that global GDP was about $ 70 trillion in 2011. A $ 400 billion loss—the high end of the range of probable costs—would be a fraction of a percent of global income. But this begs several important questions about the full benefit to the acquirers and the damage to the victims from the cumulative effect of cybercrime and cyber espionage...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Network {{security}} {{has always been}} a critical concern of not only businesses and governments but also of single computer users. Increased dependency on telecommunication and particularly on Internet has made us more vulnerable to <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> <b>activities.</b> The exponential growth of Internet has unveiled a much damaging aspect of DoS attacks. The victim is flooded with attack traffic caused by various DoS and Distributed DoS attack, which in turn cause congestion on network links. In the third world countries where bandwidth is inadequate, the problem is further exasperated. Such shifting scenario necessitates a robust and resilient security approach, which effectively and efficiently identifies these attacks and reacts aptly. This paper focuses on development of such a real-time DoS sensor. Initially, the sensor will concentrate on detecting TCP SYN flood attack, with minimum number of false negatives and false positives. The primary objective of this optimized sensor is to conserve valuable bandwidth by identifying the malicious traffic. Then based on this identification, an intelligent and appropriate discard policy can be adopted. The sensor would provide the flexibility to be placed at diverse backbone locations and operate independently.

40|$|Malware (e. g., trojans, bots, and spyware) {{is still}} a {{pervasive}} threat on the Internet. It is able to infect computer systems to further launch a variety of malicious activities such as sending spam, stealing sensitive information and launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In order to continue malevolent activities without being detected and to improve the efficiency of malicious activities, cyber-criminals tend to build <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> infrastructures to communicate with their malware and to exploit benign users. In these infrastructures, multiple servers are set to be efficient and anonymous in (i) malware distribution (using redirectors and exploit servers), (ii) control (using C&C servers), (iii) monetization (using payment servers), and (iv) robustness against server takedowns (using multiple backups {{for each type of}} server). The most straightforward way to counteract the malware threat is to detect malware directly on infected hosts. However, it is difficult since packing and obfuscation techniques are frequently used by malware to evade state-of-the-art anti-virus tools. Therefore, an alternate solution is to detect and disrupt the <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> infrastructures used by malware. In this dissertation, we take an important step in this direction and focus on identifying malicious servers behind those <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> infrastructures. We present a comprehensive inferring framework to infer servers involved in <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> infrastructure based on the three roles of those servers: compromised server, malicious server accessed through redirection and malicious server accessed through directly connecting. We characterize these three roles from four novel perspectives and demonstrate our detection technologies in four systems: PoisonAmplifier, SMASH, VisHunter and NeighbourWatcher. PoisonAmplifier focuses on compromised servers. It explores the fact that cybercriminals tend to use compromised servers to trick benign users during the attacking process. Therefore, it is designed to proactively find more compromised servers. SMASH focuses on malicious servers accessed through directly connecting. It explores the fact that multiple backups are usually used in <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> infrastructures to avoid server takedowns. Therefore, it leverages the correlation among malicious servers to infer a group of malicious servers. VisHunter focuses on the redirections from compromised servers to malicious servers. It explores the fact that cybercriminals usually conceal their core malicious servers. Therefore, it is designed to detect those ?invisible? malicious servers. NeighbourWatcher focuses on all general malicious servers promoted by spammers. It explores the observation that spammers intend to promote some servers (e. g., phishing servers) on the special websites (e. g., forum and wikis) to trick benign users and to improve the reputation of their malicious servers. In short, we build a comprehensive inferring framework to identify servers involved in <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> infrastructures from four novel perspectives and implement different inference techniques in different systems that complement each other. Our inferring framework has been evaluated in live networks and/or real-world network traces. The evaluation results show that it can accurately detect malicious servers involved in <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> infrastructures with a very low false positive rate. We found the three roles of malicious servers we proposed can characterize most of servers involved in <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> infrastructures, and the four principles we developed for the detection are invariable across different <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> infrastructures. We believe our experience and lessons are of great benefit to the future <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> infrastructure study and detection...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} regulation of phishing in Taiwan, particularly focusing on legal regulation but within a context of a multi-dimensional regulatory framework which also necessarily includes an examination of international regulation and the interaction between international and Taiwan regulatory interfaces given the transnational nature of phishing. Phishing is a <b>malicious</b> <b>cyber</b> <b>activity</b> which targets the acquisition of various types of confidential information by deception {{through the use of}} spoofed emails and/or websites. The increasing threat of phishing to information security has inspired a growing demand for regulation. Significant effort has been made in academic research and by industry to develop regulatory measures for phishing, which is dominated by technological work with comparatively little research on legal regulation. The current legal discussion of phishing, both international and Taiwan, very often concentrates on the criminal liability of phishers and pays little attention to the alternative role of law in {{the regulation of}} phishing. Thus this research suggests a broader approach to legal regulation that goes beyond criminal law and particularly addresses the role of information privacy law which constrains phishing by ensuring the protection of personal information. Phishing has posed crucial challenges to the traditional system in terms of both criminalization and legal enforcement. The solution that has been mostly addressed by the existing research is cooperation. As phishing is frequently a global phenomenon, this research suggests that an international approach involving coordination of legal standards and cross-border cooperation of law enforcement is necessary to tackle phishing, and also suggests that the fundamental step lies in a converged regulation of phishing consistent with its true context. Weak legal enforcement is a major deterrent to the effectiveness of legal regulation which highlights a need for a broad from of regulation that goes beyond law. In addition, a successful phishing episode involves a complex of factors including not only weakness in law but also vulnerability of technical infrastructure, administrative system and user awareness. A single solution is thus unlikely to deal with phishing. This research therefore suggests a multi-dimensional regulatory framework comprising different countermeasures developed especially in the areas of law, technology, education, and institutional network. It examines the anti-phishing approach undertaken in Taiwan employing qualitative methods to supplement the doctrinal research. In the context of a shortage of Taiwan scholarship on this subject, the research provides a set of suggestions to Taiwan development of a multi-dimensional regulatory scheme...|$|E
