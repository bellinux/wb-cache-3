50|$|With {{the advent}} of NC, <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> diverged into two classes, {{mechanical}} and NC. This distinction continues today with mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> and CNC <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> However, in shop-floor jargon, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> by itself is still often understood in context to imply a mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine,</b> so the retronym mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is not consistently used.|$|R

50|$|The number {{series of}} <b>machine</b> <b>screws</b> once {{included}} more odd numbers {{and went up}} to #16 or more. Standardization efforts in the late 19th and {{the early part of the}} 20th century reduced the range of sizes considerably. Now, it is less common to see <b>machine</b> <b>screws</b> larger than #14, or odd number sizes other than #1, #3 and #5. Even though #14 and #16 screws are still available, they are not as common as sizes #0 through #12.|$|R
50|$|The {{same year}} (1828), Clement began making fluted {{screw-cutting}} tap and dies and urged {{the adoption of}} a standard system of screw threads where every <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> of a particular length should have a set number of threads of a predetermined pitch and determined the number of threads for each length. Joseph Whitworth, at that time one of Clement's journeymen afterwards {{played a major role in}} such standardisation, the Whitworth thread becoming a standard for <b>machine</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 1876, Hartford <b>Machine</b> <b>Screw</b> {{was granted}} a charter [...] "for the purpose of {{manufacturing}} screws, hardware and machinery of every variety." [...] The basis for its incorporation was {{the invention of the}} first single-spindle automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine.</b> For its next four years, the new firm occupied one of Weed's buildings, milling thousands of screws daily on over 50 machines. Its president was George Fairfield, who ran Weed, and its superintendent was Christopher Spencer, one of Connecticut's most versatile inventors. Soon Hartford <b>Machine</b> <b>Screw</b> outgrew its quarters and built a new factory adjacent to Weed, where it remained until 1948.|$|R
5000|$|ASME {{standards}} {{specify a}} variety of [...] "Machine Screws" [...] in diameters ranging up to 0.75 in. These fasteners are often used with nuts but also often driven into tapped holes (without nuts). They might be considered a screw or a bolt based on the Machinery's Handbook distinction. In practice, {{they tend to be}} mostly available in smaller sizes and the smaller sizes are referred to as screws or less ambiguously as <b>machine</b> <b>screws,</b> although some kinds of <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> can be referred to as stove bolts.|$|R

40|$|A new basic space {{fastener}} {{has been}} developed and tested by the GSFC. The purposes of this fastener are to permit assembly and servicing in space by astronauts and/or robots and to facilitate qualification of payloads on Earth prior to launch by saving time and money during the systems integration and component testing and qualification processes. The space fastener is a rework of the basic <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> such that crossthreading is impossible; it is self-locking and will not work its way out during launch (vibration proof); it will not wear out despite repeated use; it occupies a small foot print which is comparable to its <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> equivalent, and it provides force and exhibits strength comparable to its <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> equivalent. Construction is ultra-simple and cost effective and the principle is applicable across {{the full range of}} screw sizes ranging from a # 10 screw to 2. 5 cm (1 in) or more. In this paper, the fastener principles of operation will be discussed along with test results and construction details. The new fastener also has considerable potential in the commercial sector. A few promising applications will be presented...|$|R
50|$|The name <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is {{somewhat}} of a , because <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> {{spend much of their}} time making things that are not screws and that in many cases are not even threaded. However, the archetypal use for which <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> were named was screw-making.|$|R

This {{is an unusual}} design for {{the head of a}} screw, atop a standard <b>machine</b> <b>screw</b> thread. It has no relation, other than a similar name, with the pentalobular thread.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> {{have been}} {{replaced}} to some extent by CNC lathes (turning centers) and CNC <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> However, they are still commonly in operation, and for high-volume production of turned components it is still often true that nothing is as cost-efficient as a mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Today {{the threads}} of {{threaded}} fasteners (such as <b>machine</b> <b>screws,</b> wood screws, wallboard screws, and sheetmetal screws) {{are usually not}} cut via single-point screw-cutting; instead most are generated by other, faster processes, such as thread forming and rolling and cutting with die heads. The latter processes are the ones employed in modern <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> These machines, although they are lathes specialized for making screws, are not screw-cutting lathes {{in the sense of}} employing single-point screw-cutting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{definition}} of the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> has changed with changing technology. Any use of the term prior to the 1840s, if it occurred, would have referred ad hoc to any machine tool used to produce screws, that is, {{there would have been no}} established differentiation from the term screw-cutting lathe. When turret lathes were developed in the 1840s, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied to them in overlapping usage with the term turret lathe. In 1860, when some of the movements, such as turret indexing, were mechanically automated, the term automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied, and the term hand <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> or manual <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was retronymously applied to the earlier machines. Within 15 years, the entire part-cutting cycle had been mechanically automated, and machines of the 1860 type were retronymously called semi-automatic. From that time on, machines with fully automated cycles were usually called automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines,</b> and eventually, in the usage of most people in the machining industries, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> no longer was used to refer to manual or semi-automatic turret lathes, having become reserved for one class of machine, the fully mechanically automated type. This narrow meaning of <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> remained stable from about the 1890s until the 1950s. (Brown & Sharpe continued to call some of their hand-operated turret lathe models [...] "screw machines", but most machinists reserved the term for automatics.) Within this class called <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> there were variations, such as single-spindle versus multispindle, horizontal-turret versus vertical-turret, etc.|$|R
50|$|A clevis bracket {{generally}} {{takes the}} form of a solid metal piece with a flat rectangular base, fitted with holes for bolts or <b>machine</b> <b>screws,</b> and two rounded wings in parallel forming a clevis. Commonly used in aircraft and cars, clevis brackets allow mounting of rods to flat surfaces.|$|R
50|$|The M19 {{was shipped}} to South Africa with two floppy disk drives (360 KB format). A hard drive option was made {{available}} later, {{which was a}} 5 MB hard drive in an add-on case (later 10 MB hard drive) attached to the LHS of the computer via four <b>machine</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R

In 1980, preliminary <b>aircraft</b> <b>specifications</b> of the variant, dubbed 737-300, were released at the Farnborough Airshow.|$|R

50|$|The {{fastener}} is an anchor, an {{expandable sleeve}} that slides {{into a hole}} drilled into the wall. A lip wider than the hole prevents it from falling behind the wall.
