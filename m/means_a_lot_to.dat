500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} James Christopher Monger said [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] {{would gain}} an extra [...] "life in countless montages on MTV reality shows and 30-second cola commercials". Monger {{said that the}} album consisted [...] "of perfectly executed and fairly standard clean vocal post-hardcore emo-pop" [...] which shows the [...] "limitations of the genre". Monger called the backing vocals [...] "exciting at first", but felt that they [...] "eventually dissolve into the waves of distortion mid-album", becoming an [...] "audio equivalent of an energy drink crash". The final track, [...] "If It <b>Means</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lot</b> <b>to</b> You", as Monger noted, {{was different from the}} preceding tracks, as they were [...] "deafening, ultimately forgettable, over-compressed slabs of twentysomething angst". Sputnikmusic's John Hanson said the album was an [...] "incredibly derivative and plodding record" [...] that was filled with [...] "laughable moments". He also noted the band [...] "haven't seemed to progress that basic combination of ideas" [...] in combining pop-punk and metalcore, and that the intro to [...] "The Downfall of Us All" [...] is [...] "just one example of embarrassing decisions".|$|E

An instrumental entitled [...] "Money Maker" [...] was also recorded during the sessions, but McKinnon had difficulties with it. He later explained: [...] "when {{it came down to}} writing vocal parts [...] I just couldn't get that song done. [...] I think it was the best music for the whole record.
