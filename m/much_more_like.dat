5|$|The arts {{scene in}} Fairbanks also grew during this time. The Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra {{was founded in}} 1959, and the Fairbanks Drama Association was created in 1963. The Alaska Goldpanners {{baseball}} team was founded in 1959 as the city's first professional sports team. The next year, the Goldpanners hosted their first annual Midnight Sun Baseball Game, a tradition that had been conducted since 1905 and continues under the Goldpanners' auspices today. Through the 1960s, Fairbanks became <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> small towns in the Lower 48 as communications, transportation, and utilities improved.|$|E
25|$|At first, Braille was a {{one-to-one}} transliteration of French orthography, {{but soon}} various abbreviations, contractions, and even logograms were developed, creating a system <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> shorthand. The expanded English system, called Grade-2 Braille, was complete by 1905. For blind readers, Braille {{is an independent}} writing system, rather than a code of printed orthography.|$|E
25|$|On 12 April 1571, de Vere {{attained}} his {{majority and}} took his seat in the House of Lords.

25|$|The {{scholarly}} conclusion {{has largely}} been that the settlement of New Amsterdam is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> current New York than previously thought. Cultural diversity and a mind-set that resembles the American Dream were already present {{in the first few}} years of this colony. Writers like Russell Shorto argue that the large influence of New Amsterdam on the American psyche {{has largely been}} overlooked in the classic telling of American beginnings, because of animosity between the English victors and the conquered Dutch.|$|E
25|$|The Greek Revival style {{used for}} the Second Bank {{contrasts}} with the earlier, Federal style in architecture {{used for the}} First Bank of the United States, which also still stands and is located nearby in Philadelphia. This {{can be seen in}} the more Roman-influenced Federal structure's ornate, colossal Corinthian columns of its façade, which is also embellished by Corinthian pilasters and a symmetric arrangement of sash windows piercing the two stories of the façade. The roofline is also topped by a balustrade and the heavy modillions adorning the pediment give the First Bank an appearance <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a Roman villa than a Greek temple.|$|E
25|$|The C-Lab programmers {{left that}} company to form Emagic, and in 1993 {{released}} a new program, Notator Logic, which attempted to fuse both track- and pattern-based operation (but looked <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> track-based sequencers than Notator). While rich in features, early versions of Logic on the Atari lacked the intuitiveness and immediacy of either Cubase or Notator, and never achieved the same success. However, {{by this time}} the Atari was becoming obsolete, and {{part of the reason why}} Notator Logic had been written from scratch with an object oriented GUI (though it shared the same nomenclature as its predecessor) was to make it easier to port to other platforms. The Notator preface was dropped from the product name and the software became known as simply Logic.|$|E
50|$|Later in 2003, Tactical Sekt {{released}} Burn Process. Exploring new directions, Mather surprised {{many fans}} {{with a new}} dance oriented energy.

25|$|Using {{this many}} landing gear on a swept wing would produce {{considerable}} problems when the aircraft {{tried to turn}} on the ground. It was possible to use steerable landing gear legs for this, but only at the cost of added complexity. An easier solution was to simply use a straight wing so the landing gear were in a line. However, this would limit the design to slower speeds below about Mach 0.7 (see wave drag). This was perfectly acceptable for short-haul role, where the cruise times were so short that added speed would have little actual effect on round-trip times. By limiting themselves to speeds not much greater than propeller transports, the engineers were free to select a wing designed solely for low-speed high-lift performance. The result looked <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the wing from a 1930s airliner than a modern jet aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Diver Down {{performed}} better. The band then {{earned a}} spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest-paid single appearance of a band: $1.5million for a 90-minute set at the 1983 US Festival. Despite this return to form, Roth and Eddie's differences continued, and this caused friction with other band members. Billy Sheehan, after his band Talas completed a tour with Van Halen, claims he was approached by Eddie Van Halen to replace Michael Anthony. The reasons for this were never clear to Sheehan because nothing came of it. During this time, Eddie and Alex Van Halen contributed the score and instrumental songs to the movie The Wild Life, starring Eric Stoltz. The score was heavy on the keyboards, similar to the sound used on the previous two albums and <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the sound coming in their next album.|$|E
25|$|Was it a mistake? No, said Lise Meitner; Hahn was {{too good}} a chemist for that. But how could barium be formed from uranium? No larger {{fragments}} than protons or helium nuclei (alpha particles) had ever been chipped away from nuclei, and to chip off a large number not nearly enough energy was available. Nor {{was it possible that}} the uranium nucleus could have been cleaved right across. A nucleus was not like a brittle solid that can be cleaved or broken; George Gamow had suggested early on, and Bohr had given good arguments that a nucleus was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a liquid drop. Perhaps a drop could divide itself into two smaller drops in a more gradual manner, by first becoming elongated, then constricted, and finally being torn rather than broken in two? We knew that there were strong forces that would resist such a process, just as the surface tension of an ordinary liquid drop tends to resist its division into two smaller ones. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops in one important way: they were electrically charged, and that was known to counteract the surface tension.|$|E

500|$|A {{little after}} 13:00, I Corps' attack began in large columns. Bernard Cornwell writes [...] " [...] {{suggests}} an elongated formation with its narrow end aimed like a spear at the enemy line, while in truth it was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a brick advancing sideways and d'Erlon's assault {{was made up}} of four such bricks, each one a division of French infantry". Each division, with one exception, was drawn up in huge masses, consisting of the eight or nine battalions of which they were formed, deployed, and placed in a column one behind the other, with only five paces interval between the battalions.|$|E
500|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that {{billions of years ago}} Venus's atmosphere was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Earth's than it is now, and {{that there may have been}} substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface, but after a period of 600 million to several billion years, a runaway greenhouse effect was caused by the evaporation of that original water, which generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere. Although the surface conditions on Venus are no longer hospitable to any Earthlike life that may have formed before this event, there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the [...] upper cloud layers of Venus, [...] up from the surface, where the temperature ranges between [...] but the environment is acidic.|$|E

500|$|In 1836, Ernest and Albert visited their matrimonially {{eligible}} cousin Princess Victoria of Kent, {{spending a}} few weeks at Windsor. Both boys, and especially Albert were considered by his family to be a potential husband for the young princess, and they were both taught to speak competent English. Their father first thought that Ernest would make a better husband to Victoria than Albert, possibly because his sporting interests would be better received by the British public. Most others favored Albert over Ernest as a possible husband however. Temperamentally, Victoria was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Ernest, as both were lively and sociable with a love for dancing, gossip, and late nights; conversely, this fast pace made Albert physically ill. Victoria believed Ernest had a [...] "most kind, honest, and intelligent expression in his countenance", while Albert [...] "seemed full of goodness and sweetness, and very clever and intelligent". No offer of marriage was forthcoming for either brother however, and they returned home.|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, Feige {{said that}} the project was [...] "as close as it's ever been" [...] while Wright teased the film by tweeting a {{pictogram}} of Ant-Man. In June, Wright spent just under a week shooting footage for a reel {{that would be used}} to test out the potential look and tone of his movie, as well as to decide how convincing Ant-Man's powers look on screen. The test footage was screened to audiences during the Marvel Studios panel at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, with Wright confirming that Ant-Man would be happening. Germain Lussier of /Film felt the footage worked and was [...] "awesome", as [...] "it had a totally different vibe from the other Marvel films. It was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> something you'd recognize from Hot Fuzz." [...] Lussier, along with Katy Rich of CinemaBlend, also enjoyed the costume design choice. That October, Disney scheduled the film for release on November 6, 2015.|$|E
500|$|During this period, {{the remains}} of small hollow-crested duckbills were {{described}} as their own genera and species. The first of these that figure {{into the history of}} Hypacrosaurus was Cheneosaurus tolmanensis, based on a skull and assorted limb bones, vertebrae, and pelvic bones from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. Not long after, Richard Swann Lull and Nelda Wright identified an American Museum of Natural History skeleton (AMNH 5461) from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana as a specimen of Procheneosaurus. These and other taxa were accepted as valid genera until the 1970s, when Peter Dodson showed that it was more likely that the [...] "cheneosaurs" [...] were the juveniles of other established lambeosaurines. Although he was mostly concerned with the earlier, Dinosaur Park Formation genera Corythosaurus and Lambeosaurus, he suggested that Cheneosaurus {{would turn out to be}} composed of juvenile individuals of the contemporaneous Hypacrosaurus altispinus. This idea has become accepted, although not formally tested. The Two Medicine Procheneosaurus, meanwhile, was not quite like the other Procheneosaurus specimens studied by Dodson, and for good reason: it was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a species that would not be named until 1994, H. stebingeri.|$|E
