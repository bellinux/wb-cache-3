40|$|For δ Scuti star CoRoT 102749568, 52 {{independent}} frequencies {{were obtained}} by Paparó et al. 2013. We find that there are 4 multiplets and 8 doublets with nearly equal split caused by rotation. Differential rotation is suggested instead of rigid body rotation to explain the equal split phenomenon. Grids of models are computed with MESA to fit observational frequencies of CoRoT 102749568.
