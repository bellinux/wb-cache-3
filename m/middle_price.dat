40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an estimator {{of stock}} price volatility which eliminates, at least asymptotically, the biases that {{are caused by}} the discreteness of observed stock pr ices. Assuming that the observed stock prices are continuously monito red, an estimator is constructed using the notion of how quickly the price changes rather than how much the price changes. It is shown tha t this estimator has desirable asymptotic properties, including consi stency and normality. Also, through a simulation study, the authors s how that it outperforms natural estimators for low and <b>middle</b> <b>priced</b> stocks. Further, the simulation study demonstrates that the proposed estimator is robust to certain misspecifications in measuring the tim e between price changes.

Many receivers from <b>middle</b> <b>price</b> trademarks had such circuits - but often without volume control for the rear channels.More expensive trademarks seldom had Hafler or similar circuits, because they thought such circuits increased the distortion of the sound. Most of Marantz' four channel receivers had a variable matrix called Vari-Matrix (not {{to be confused with}} Sansui's QS Vario Matrix) that could simulate four channel stereo from two channel sources in different ways and the listener could adapt the sound with a control. The Vari-Matrix could also with good result play all matrix records. Technics by National had a similar matrix decoder with two controls.|$|E

40|$|We analyze a rational-expectations {{model of}} {{information}} acquisition and price formation in an intermediate- good market: prices and net supply are non-negative, there are no noise traders, and the intermediate good has multiple potential uses. Several of our results differ from the classic Grossman-Stiglitz approach. For example, the price mechanism is more informative at high and low prices and potentially uninformative at <b>middle</b> <b>prices.</b> Also, an informed trade by a producer of one final good amounts to a noise trade {{from the perspective of}} a producer of another final good, so (a) as the price mechanism becomes more informative for producers of one final good, it becomes less informative for producers of others, who therefore have a stronger incentive to acquire information, so information acquisition has the strategic-complements property between groups, and (b) having more producers (in multiple groups) become informed need not increase the informativeness of the price mechanism. ...|$|R

With steadily upgraded styling and ever-stronger engines every year through 1960, Dodge found a ready market for its products as America discovered the joys of freeway travel. This situation improved when Dodge introduced {{a new line of}} Dodges called the Dart to do battle against Ford, Chevrolet and Plymouth. The result was that Dodge sales in the <b>middle</b> <b>price</b> class collapsed. Special and regional models were sold as well, including the LaFemme (a white and orchid-trimmed hardtop marketed toward women) and the Texan, a gold-accented Dodge sold in the Lone Star State. 1957 saw the introduction of a new automatic transmission, three-speed TorqueFlite.

5000|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} amount of research concerning context effects comes from marketing research. Context effects can influence consumers' choice behavior. [...] There are three main context effects that are researched in marketing. The first, the compromise effect, states that objects that are <b>priced</b> in the <b>middle</b> of choice sets are looked on more favorably. [...] The middle choice seems like a good compromise between choices that may be viewed as too extreme. For example, if there are bikes on sale at the local store ranging from $50 to $75; the average shopper, not looking for a luxury bicycle, would normally opt to choose the $60 bike because it is average and matches their level of expertise. However, when adding a $100 bike to the sale, most average shoppers would opt to select the higher $75 bike. This demonstrates the compromise effect of choosing a bike to match their expectations regarding <b>middle</b> <b>prices.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to Belz (2005) [...] we have {{observed}} {{since the beginning}} of the 21st century that the classical market structure has changed. The consumer goods market is characterized by [...] "polarization", which means that the <b>middle</b> <b>price</b> and quality segment decreased, while the lower price segment and the upper quality segment grow in significance and in market shares. In the past, the middle segment was most of the market share and today, a large low price segment and a growing premium quality segment on top characterize markets such as cars, furniture and food. It will therefore be difficult for the products and brands that are positioned in the middle segment to survive in the market whereas those that are positioned in the upper or lower segment should be likely to succeed. Companies present on the lower segment such as IKEA and H&M compete on costs and aim at price-sensitive consumers, which are socio-ecological passives. Even if they may assume social and ecological responsibility along the whole supply chain and produce sustainable products, their main aim is not so much socio-ecological differentiation, but rather maintaining their brand image and corporate reputation.|$|E
40|$|The hedonic price {{function}} is estimated for housing in Slovenia. The prices of housing in Slovenia vary by regions. Slovenian regions analyzed {{in the article}} are, according to the prices of housing, classified into three groups. The most expensive groups are Ljubljana (the capital), its suburbs and Primorska, the <b>middle</b> <b>price</b> group includes Gorenjska, whereas the least expensive housing {{can be found in}} the North- Eastern part of Slovenia. The equality test, a post-hoc analysis and the analysis of contrasts confirm these findings. The regression hedonic price analysis shows different behaviour among the groups of regional explanatory variables (size, age and floor of housing). In regions with the most expensive housing the size of housing has a significant impact on the price per square meter. The pattern is less obvious in middle and lower price range regions. The age and floor of housing have significant impacts on price in the most and in the least expensive housing regions, whereas the influence is less strong in the <b>middle</b> <b>price</b> region. Some crucial determinants of housing prices at micro level reflecting the inhomogeneous housing characteristic are therefore location, size, age and the floor...|$|E
40|$|Summary. We {{discover}} a remarkable property {{of a foreign}} exchange market: when the spreads, the difference between ask and bid prices, become large, the dealing time intervals become short and the price movements become strong.

Then, we confirm the plausibility of the proposed model by comparing the statistical properties of the real market and the model. Finally, we discuss why there exists the interaction {{on the basis of}} our model, and clarify the mechanism for producing complex behavior with the interaction.

Our model extends the preconditions of previous assumption that all tenderers are characterized by neutral risk-taking in the original tendering model for lowest-price sealed tender. A general tendering model for the lowest-price sealed tender is established to explain the behavior of tenderers during the tendering. The results indicate that construction estimate {{is affected by the}} degree of uncertainties in the construction industry.

In Germany, {{in times}} of extreme low {{interest}} rates there is a boom in housing construction, housing demand and housing prices. In order to relieve the housing market, the Federal Government is planning to expand the funding for social housing considerably. Affordable housing has been decreasing in German metropolitan areas in recent years, the same applies to social housing. Meanwhile, the demand for dwellings in the lower and <b>middle</b> <b>price</b> segment is rising, partly due to an increased migration rate. This is why a strong social housing promotion needs to be combined with an effective direct subsidy, such as a dynamic housing allowance. However, the targeting of social housing is highly inaccurate. Thus, {{it would be better to}} strengthen housing allowances and to help lowincome households to purchase homes in order to reduce living costs. Nowadays, property credits stabilize the banking sector. However, just a small increase in interest rates could result in a new financial crash. Ever since their foundation, housing cooperatives have created affordable private dwellings and a safe living place for their members. They are able to produce not only tenants but owners of the dwellings. Thus public assistance schemes and subsidies should not exclude housing cooperatives...|$|E

The next goal of this work is to find out what is for the consumers the most important shopping motivation, if they prepare and buy their coffee differently over the past years. Then I will write something about what they prefer - which brand, type, size of packaging. The theoretical part is about plantation of coffee, how coffee prepares, consumption of coffee in the Czech Republic and in the world, the culture of coffee, a creation of the market in the Czech Republic and a marketing research. The practical part mainly focuses on the research of the end user, sales research, research of product and prognosis. The practical part partly examines the total market analysis and the advertising research. The final part shows the current trends on the coffee market. It shows that over the past 10 years the habits in preparation of coffee has changed because the present trend aims at coffee express. The preferences concerning the size of the packaging has also changed ? coffee directs toward bigger package. The number of people who drink coffee and buy it in the hypermarket has risen. The biggest shopping incentive is the taste. The most preferred is the <b>middle</b> <b>price</b> level. Consumers most often buy the instant coffee in supermarket and in hypermarket.
