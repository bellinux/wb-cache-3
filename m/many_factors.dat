50|$|Factoring has {{traditionally}} operated under a mandatory notification arrangement.

5|$|With hindsight, too <b>many</b> <b>factors</b> (choice of colour scheme; {{size and}} speed of ships; tactics used) had been varied {{for it to be}} {{possible}} to determine which factors were significant or which schemes worked best. Thayer did carry out an experiment on dazzle camouflage, but it failed to show any reliable advantage over plain paintwork.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So <b>many</b> <b>factors</b> were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E

For example, as the amount of over-provisioning increases, the write amplification decreases (inverse relationship). If the factor is a toggle (enabled or disabled) function then it has either a positive or negative relationship.|$|E

5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on <b>many</b> <b>factors,</b> with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E

In these plates, Goya's focus is {{directed}} away from the generalised scenes of slaughter of anonymous, unaligned people in unnamed regions of Spain; he turns towards a specific horror unfolding in Madrid.

5|$|Traditionally, <b>many</b> <b>factors</b> were {{important}} in arranging royal marriages. One such factor was {{the amount of}} territory that the other royal family governed or controlled. Another, related factor was {{the stability of the}} control exerted over that territory: when there was territorial instability in a royal family, other royalty would be less inclined to marry into that family. Another factor was political alliance: marriage was an important way to bind together royal families and their countries during peace and war and could justify many important political decisions.|$|E
5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of <b>many</b> <b>factors</b> that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on <b>many</b> <b>factors,</b> including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
