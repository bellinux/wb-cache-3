500|$|MeTV {{described}} Clair's {{parenting style}} as [...] "firm, yet loving." [...] Writing for NPR, Eric Deggans observed that Clair uses a [...] "loving-yet-sardonic" [...] approach to parenting, demonstrated by her line [...] "I {{was a beautiful}} woman once, before the children came". Considered to be the stricter of the two parents, Clair is humorous and sarcastic about the frustrations and challenges of parenting, often joking about killing or abandoning her children {{but at the same}} time <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> do not take her exaggerated threats too seriously by demonstrating [...] "obvious loving indulgences". In the pilot, Clair responds to Theo's last minute breakfast request for scrambled eggs after she had already prepared sunny side up eggs for him by using her spatula to [...] "scramble" [...] them. According to The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women author Susan Douglas, Clair sometimes makes the mistake of alternating between stern and overindulgent too abruptly. Equally successful in their respective professions, Clair's relationship with Cliff deliberately mirrors the real-life relationship of Cosby and his wife Camille. Clair occasionally raises her voice but seldom yells or loses her temper, demonstrating calmness and a sense of humor as a [...] "remedy for the trials and tribulations of motherhood." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Clement Fitzpatrick was {{commissioned}} by the George Washington Bicentennial Commission in 1931 to transcribe, edit and publish Washington's writings in what became a 39 volume work entitled The Writings of George Washington. The Commission was created to commemorate the coming 200th anniversary of Washington's birth in 1932, and to promote education in Revolutionary War era history overall. [...] This massive work, taken from Washington's letters, military records, diaries, etc., was edited and compiled {{under the direction of}} John Clement Fitzpatrick, and sponsored and prepared by the Commission, under the authority of U.S. Congress, 1931, taking several years to complete.

2500|$|Much of the game's 18-month {{development}} time {{was focused on}} the game's controls and <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> worked, as Mustard believed that without controls that [...] "feel sweet," [...] the game would have been poorly received. This included the incorporation of weapon aiming through the right thumbstick and other tactical elements such as firing from cover from games such as Gears of War. With the game being published by Microsoft Studios, the development team had access to the Microsoft play testers, who helped to identify other problem areas with their original level design. This also {{led to the development of}} the option to show a blue line on the game's map that would show the player where to go next. Mustard realized there was both a benefit and downside to this feature, as it would help guide players that were stuck, but at the same time, players could become too dependent on the line and follow it exactly, giving them no challenge in exploring the game's world. To counter this, they had the line show the general path that needed to be taken but included parts of their world where the player would be forced to deviate from the suggested path in order to work around an obstacle or collect a required power-up.|$|E
2500|$|Lyle Masaki of AfterElton.com commends the manga for {{illustrating}} [...] "the challenges gay men face in Japanese society", and for {{not following}} the traditional mode of student-teacher romantic relationships in [...] "Boys Love" [...] titles, opting instead for a friendship where both characters discover {{more about what}} it is to be a gay man. Holly Ellingwood at Active Anime commended the first volume its unique artwork, and praised the plot for its [...] "bittersweet" [...] poignancy, and for showing unrequited love rather than being a simplistic story about [...] "winning the guy". She felt the second volume had [...] "unusual pacing" [...] and came off as [...] "abrupt" [...] peeks into the lives of many different couples. Mania.com's Danielle Van Gorder praised the manga for its characterization and ability to reflect reality. Erin Finnegan of Pop Culture Shock criticized the story for Ida and Hachizume adopting each other, essentially getting married, before having sex, which she regarded as unrealistic. Comic World News's David Welsh says that Yoshinaga's characters, even in this early work, have layers, and that it is enjoyable to see how the frank student inspires the adult characters to communicate better. Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux criticizes the manga for its inability to focus on one couple. Robin Brenner described the plot as being [...] "an engaging meditation on how crushes are wonderful, but oh, how they can hurt." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the story as having been [...] "padded out", but enjoyed the theme of [...] "love and loss" [...] in the manga. [...] Johanna Draper Carlson felt it was novel for the treatment of sex in the first volume to consist of a character <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> would be able to satisfy their partner.
