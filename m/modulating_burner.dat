Boilers generally have 2 or 3 pressuretrols: a manual-reset pressuretrol, which functions as a safety by setting the upper limit of steam pressure, the operating pressuretrol, which controls when the boiler fires to maintain pressure, and for boilers equipped with a <b>modulating</b> <b>burner,</b> a modulating pressuretrol which controls the amount of fire.|$|E

50|$|In {{the search}} for {{increased}} efficiency, even very small gas boilers have <b>modulating</b> <b>burners</b> these days. In practice only boilers with fan assisted fuel/air circulation will have the modulating feature. The fan also mixes gas and air more thoroughly, so achieving more efficient combustion. If the boiler is of the high efficiency condensing type, high turndown ratios are feasible and the higher the turndown ratio, the more efficient it will be.|$|R
50|$|Roberts-Gordon LLC is an {{international}} manufacturer of HVAC equipment, controls and associated accessories. The company {{is best known for}} introducing the first commercially produced gas-fired, low-intensity infrared product, CORAYVAC, into the heating industry. Roberts-Gordon LLC was also the first company to patent fully modulating infrared systems with an ULTRAVAC control, a control that allowed building owners to <b>modulate</b> <b>burner</b> input rate with outdoor air temperature in order to match the heating system’s input to the building’s heating requirement. Multiple heating systems throughout the country were then able to be monitored from a single desktop.|$|R

50|$|A gas hybrid {{water heater}} uses a <b>modulating</b> {{infrared}} <b>burner</b> that is triggered by water-flow or thermostat. The multi-pass heat exchanger drives heat down then recycles it through baffled pipes for maximum efficiency. Water fills the reservoir from bottom up and spreads evenly around the heating pipes, producing continuous hot water with consistent pressure and temperature.|$|R
40|$|District heating {{has been}} widely spread in all cold climate and {{historically}} more attentive to the environmental problem countries (North Europe); however, in Italy the technology has also known a remarkable increase in recent years, due to the {{combined heat and power}} boosting laws (CIP 6 / 92). Generally, we consider CHP coupled with district heating more efficient than traditional local heating systems, while we discuss the economic aspect. Considering important developments in these last years regarding both boilers (premixed and <b>modulating</b> <b>burners,</b> condensing boilers, etc.) and district heating plants, it is worth to analyse the whole matter comparing advantages and disadvantages of the different alternatives with their wide differentiation among them. The paper reports on the analysis of major district heating natural gas based technologies (vapor and gas turbines, internal combustion engine, combined cycles); the cost of the heat power produced in these plants is compared to the cost of producing the same quantity of electrical energy by a reference GTCC- Gas Turbine Combined Cycle (actually the most efficient technology for pure electrical production) and the cost of heat production by modern local heating technologies (condensing boilers, electrical and gas heat pumps). Regarding energy efficiency and polluting emissions, modern local heating is shown to be more efficient than district heating for most CHP technologies...|$|R
40|$|Generally, a CHP plant {{coupled with}} {{district}} heating is considered {{more efficient than}} traditional local heating systems from an economic and environmental point of view. This is certainly true for municipal waste CHP plants but for plants fuelled by natural gas the important developments intervened in these last years regarding both boilers (premixed and <b>modulating</b> <b>burners,</b> condensing boilers, etc.), mechanical vapour compression and absorption heat pumps can change the traditional view. At the same time also district heating plants improved. Therefore it is worth to analyse the whole matter comparing {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the different alternatives with their wide differentiation among them. The paper reports on the analysis of major district heating natural gas based technologies (vapour and gas turbines, internal combustion engine, combined cycles); the cost of the heat power produced in these plants is compared to the cost of producing the same quantity of electrical energy by a reference GTCC- Gas Turbine Combined Cycle (actually the most efficient technology for pure electrical production) and the cost of heat production by modern local heating technologies using natural gas as fuel (condensing boilers, electrical, gas engine and absorption heat pumps). Regarding energy efficiency and polluting emissions, modern local heating turns out to be more efficient than district heating for most CHP technologies. However, it is not the same from the economic point of view, because in Italy natural gas used by cogeneration plants is subjected to a taxation much lower than local heating technologies...|$|R
40|$|Solar energy can usefully {{be applied}} in {{conjunction}} with gas to provide residential hot water and residential space heating in a climate like that of South Australia. A solar-gas instantaneous water heating system is described, which has been constructed and tested. In this system, water is preheated by solar energy and stored. When this preheated water is withdrawn by the consumer it is automatically adjusted to the desired temperature by <b>modulating</b> gas <b>burners,</b> or by blending with cold water.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} simulate the combined heat and mass transfer processes that occur in a gas-fired generator of an ammonia water absorption heat pump. The model comprises three interconnected components: the gas furnace, the distillation column and the rectifier. The furnace is modeled like a well-stirred single volume. The distillation column and the rectifier are discretized along their axial dimension. Several heat transfer mechanisms are simultaneously solved: radiative and convective heat transfer between combustion products and generator finned surface, flow boiling and pool boiling in the two-phase ammonia water mixture inside the distillation column. The model is applied to operating conditions of interest in real applications. The generated outputs provide insight on the internal gradients, the quantification of gas furnace efficiency, and effectiveness of solution boiling and internal heat recovery. The model {{can be used for}} the simulation of absorption heat pumps with <b>modulating</b> gas <b>burners.</b> © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is presented}} of experimental methods {{for determining the}} combustion-stability properties of solid propellants. The methods are generally based on either the temporal response to an initial disturbance or on external methods for generating the required oscillations. The size distribution of condensed-phase combustion products are characterized {{by means of the}} experimental approaches. The 'T-burner' approach is shown to assist in the derivation of pressure-coupled driving contributions and particle damping in solid-propellant rocket motors. Other techniques examined include the rotating-valve apparatus, the impedance tube, the <b>modulated</b> throat-acoustic damping <b>burner,</b> and the magnetic flowmeter. The paper shows that experimental methods do not exist for measuring the interactions between acoustic velocity oscillations and burning propellant...|$|R
40|$|Coffee {{roasting}} is {{a highly}} energy intensive process {{with much of the}} energy being lost in intermittent cycles as discharged heat from the stack. In this work, combined heat and power (CHP) systems based on micro gas-turbines (MGT) are investigated for providing heat to the roasting process. Much of the heat released in a coffee roaster is from the afterburner that heats up the flue gases to high temperatures in order to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other pollutants. An interesting solution for utilizing waste heat is assessed through energy and material balances of a rotating drum coffee roasting with partial hot gas recycling. A cost assessment methodology is adopted to compare the profitability of three proposed system configurations integrated into the process. The case study of a major coffee torrefaction plant with 500 kg/h production capacity is assumed to carry out the thermo-economic assessment, under the Italian energy framework. The CHP options under investigation are: (i) regenerative topping MGT coupled to the existing <b>modulating</b> gas <b>burner</b> to generate hot air for the roasting process; (ii) intermittent waste-heat recovery from the hot flue-gases through an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engine coupled to a thermal storage buffer; and (iii) non-regenerative topping MGT with direct recovery of turbine outlet air for the roasting process by means of an afterburner that modulates the heat demand of the roasting process. The results show that the profitability of these investments is highly influenced by the natural gas/electricity cost ratio, by the coffee torrefaction production capacity and by the intermittency level of discharged heat. The MGT appears as a more profitable option than waste-heat recovery via the ORC engine due to the intermittency of the heat source and the relatively high electricity/heat cost ratio...|$|R
