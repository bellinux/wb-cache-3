40|$|In the {{warehouse}} {{of a large}} cosmetics company, a <b>mechanized</b> <b>order</b> picker is restocked from nearby shelving, and the shelving is restocked from bulk storage, forming a three-tier inventory system. We consider such multi-tier inventory systems and determine the storage areas to which to assign items, and the quantities in which to store them, {{in order to minimize}} the total cost of picking items and restocking storage locations. With this research, we increase the number of inventory systems for which simple search algorithms find a provably near-optimal solution. The model and method were tested on data from the Avon Products distribution center outside Atlanta; the solution identified by the model reduced picking and restocking costs there by 20 %. The sales forecasts of items stored in {{the warehouse}} may change, however, and new items will be introduced into the inventory system and others removed. To account for these changes, some warehouses may periodically reassign items to storage areas and recompute their storage quantities. These reassignment activities account for additional costs in the warehouse. The second focus of this research examines these costs over several time periods in a simple multi-tier inventory system. We develop heuristics to determine the storage areas to which to assign items and the quantities in which to store them in each time period, in order to minimize the total cost of picking items, restocking storage locations, and reassigning skus over multiple periods.

40|$|Modernism {{embraces the}} changes in modern life that seem radically {{different}} from traditional life [...] more scientific, faster,more technological, and more <b>mechanized.</b> In modernism, <b>order,</b> sequence and unity in works of art might be considered onlyexpressions of a desire for coherence rather than actual reflections of reality. The large cultural movement of modernism,emerging in Europe and the United States {{in the early years}} of the 20 th century, manifests a sense of modern life through art andliterature which is distinct from the past, as well as from Western civilization's classical traditions. Generalization, high-flownwriting and abstraction might hide rather than convey the real. In this sense, the form of a modernist story, with its beginnings,complications, and resolutions might be artifice imposed upon fragmentation of experience –a construction out of fragments. Inother words, modernist work is notable for what it omits-–the explanations, interpretations, connections, and summaries. Oftenthe intention of writers in the Modern period is to change the way readers see the world and to change our understanding of whatlanguage is and does. Modernism tries to portray the impressions events make on characters, emphasizing the role of individual perception andexploring the nature of individual mind. How and when and where, however, were just what Maisie was not to know is themodernist aspect of the novel implied by James. The novel is a perfect portrayal of the protagonist who sees much more than sheat first understands, because she is portrayed as a child who has many more perceptions than she has terms to express them. Henry James’s What Maisie Knew examines the young protagonist Maisie’s world which is constructed by fragments ofdifferent realities of the adults around her. This paper aims at discussing some discourses in Maisie’s world through the approachof critical linguistics looking at the relationship between the subject (the power of one participant in the action) and the object(the affected participant by the action) —to arrive at a result: Her parents’ (mostly her own mother’s) subjectivity and selfishnesscauses disillusionment in Maisie’s perception of reality. Maisie manages to construct her own version of reality in spite of thevarious fragmented experiences she goes through. This will also shed light to the evaluation of this novel as a modernist text. What Maisie knows is bits and pieces from everything around her. She is the central object around whom everything revolves. She gathers the pieces of this puzzle of happenings in order to make meaning. In this way, she seeks order among the fragmentsof others’ realities. For instance, when she realizes that the Captain is attracted towards her mother in chapter 17, she wants himto be with her mother out of her pity and love towards her mother. In her perception, the Captain is drawn as a “knight inshining armour. ” As a matter of fact, Maisie approaches him as an individual and recognizes the general forms of adult behaviorwithout understanding the appropriate content. Although Maisie can interpret what is happening around her, there are thingsbeyond her knowledge. In her struggle for bringing people together she, actually, is looking for meaning and order in her world full of fragments thatstem from selfishness and unreliable subjectivity. This is a world in which she is not able to sense what she observes as love orhate. However, the truth in Maisie’s world does not seem to have consistency when her mother scorns her about Maisie’sinterpretation of the Captain. She naively states that she thought her mother liked him. This is the only truth Maisie can perceive,which clashes with that of her mother, who reacts angrily to Maisie’s allusion to her relationship with the Captain. Her motherclaims that Maisie has become “… a dreadful dismal deplorable little thing…”). Moreover, Maisie’s mother Ida asserts her subjective reality. Furthermore, she makes Maisie another causer of his action:“You have gone over to him, you have given yourself up to side against me and hate me” (83). Ida has no affection for Maisie anduses her to punish her father. In another sense, attempting to play the loving mother, Ida causes the disillusionment in Maise’sperception of reality. Through constructing her own reality based on self absorption, Ida tries to demonstrate that Maisie’s fatheris the only cause of this hate between them. In her first sentence, Ida relates, Maisie’s father wishes Maisie’s death; however shechanges her statement (her tongue slips) to “his wishing that I’m dead. ” She is, obviously, in a great effort to prove that she is made an object by the subjectivity of her husband, exploiting the emotions of her own daughter. Furthermore, she constructsMaisie as the agent of the trouble between her husband and herself. Like Ida Farange, Mrs. Beale (Maisie’s step-mother) reverses the truth of things when she calls Maisie “little hypocrite” andtalks about the time she has been a slave to gain Maisie’s love. With the word “slave” she constructs herself as an object who isdeprived of love. Maisie’s first impressions on Mrs. Beale as her father’s second wife are that she really struck her as a newacquaintance and a rich strong expressive affection that in short pounced upon her. For instance, Mrs. Overmore’s title changesinto Mrs. Beale; so she declares that she becomes Maisie’s mother. Mrs. Beale’s subjectivity is apparent when she first asserts herpower: “He is my husband; if you please, and I am his little wife. So now we’ll see who your little mother is!” (55). She impliesthat being her mother, she has a right to own Maisie as well as to educate her. The change of title and role from Maisie’sgoverness to Maisie’s mother leads to a riddle of realities in Maisie’s vision—a distorted vision which has no stability: “If she washer father’s wife, she was not her own governess” (109). Rather than conveying actual reflections in her world, she tries to expressa desire for being the new mother of Maisie. Maisie’s both female parents establish their subjectivity that is based on selfishness. Through her observation of love, Maisieis disillusioned because she hears Mrs. Beale calling herself “an abominable little horror. ” This is the difference between theknowledge conveyed by statements and her vision of reality that leads Maisie into confusion. From a modernist sense, Maisie hasmany more perceptions than she has terms to translate them; so actually the adult world is seen but not completely understood orgiven meaning. Thus, these naïve perception of images do not function completely, after Maisie faces different realms offragmented realities. (This is once implied by her father’s saying to her, “You have become a monster”) With her newly acquired knowledge, Maisie knows how to make a distinction between good and bad. From another aspect,we see the expression of the inner vision, the inner emotion, or the inner reality in Maisie’s character. In her judgment, there ismore intuition than reason, apparent in her silence. Just like the verbal attacks of her parents, the unspoken language around herteaches Maisie. In other words, Maisie, asserts her own subjectivity—even implicitly—seeing the true nature of her step-father: aman’s dependence upon women is a weakness that makes Maisie disillusioned. As a result, what Maisie knows is, at the start, different from the knowledge adults possess. Maisie’s look at the world laterbecomes fragmented which is drawn from different experiences and realities: she becomes, in a way, the affected participant ofthe relationships among the adults around her. Thus, the incongruity between language and reality in her world is the outcomeof the fragmented realities. However, she encounters with an experience that shows how she is tempted to consent the divorce oflanguage and reality—-what makes us read the novel from a modernist sense. She, though used by her parents to win power,realizes that language does not speak the truth. She, therefore, seeks order among these fragmented realities and manages toestablish her own perception of reality...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{important}} step in understanding the links between economics and nutrition is to understand major modes of production that societies have used to produce the goods (and services) they have needed throughout human history; these modes are foraging, shifting cultivation, pastoralism, agriculture, and industrialism (Park 2006). Foraging, also known as hunting and gathering, is a subsistence strategy in which {{a group of people}} gathers wild plants and hunts wild animals in order to obtain food. This strategy was the sole mode of existence for human beings {{for the vast majority of}} human history (inclusive of the archeological and fossil record) and continued to be practiced by a few groups at least into the middle part of the 20th century. This mode of production is generally associated with small, nomadic groups of no more than fifty, also known as bands. The vast majority of foraging societies do not acknowledge exclusive ownership of land or other major resources, though they do acknowledge primary use rights for groups and people may individually possess small objects or tools such as a bow or cutting tools. Because foraging usually involves frequent movement and taking food naturally available rather than altering landscapes for production, many scholars state the foraging has a minimal negative environmental impact compared to other modes of production. Though foragers are generally limited in absolute amount of food available in a given area, foraging groups such as the !Kung in the Kalahari Desert have often been cited as having a more diverse diet and spending less time per week procuring food than societies that practice other modes of production such as intensive agriculture. [...] Shifting cultivation is a mode of production involving the low intensity production of plant-based foods; this mode is also known as horticulture or ‘slash and burn agriculture’ in some texts. Horticultural societies are generally situated in semi-sedentary villages of a few hundred that clear a field and burn the cleared vegetation in order to use the ashes to nourish the soil (hence the phrase slash and burn). Next, the group plants a crop or crops in this clearing and uses it for cultivation for several years. At the end of this period, the entire village relocates and starts the process anew, leaving the old clearing fallow for a period of decades in order to allow regeneration through the regrowth of wild vegetation. These food items can be supplemented through the raising of livestock, hunting wild game, and in many cases with the gathering of wild plants (Miller 2005; Park 2006). Though periodic movement precludes absolute permanent ownership of land, some horticultural societies fiercely defend current territories and practice violence against neighboring groups. For instance, Napoleon Chagnon (1997) depicts the Yanamamo of Venezuela and Brazil as the “Fierce People”, though others have been highly critical of Chagnon’s account of this society. Horticulture can also produce a broad diet, and in some cases more food per unit of land area than foraging. Though populations of horticulturalists tend to have greater density than those of foragers, they are generally less dense than those which practice other modes of production. If practiced on a small scale, over a large area, with long fallow periods, horticulture has less negative environmental impact than agriculture or industrialism, but more than foraging (Miller 2005). Generally, horticulture coincides with a subsistence type of economy in terms of production, distribution. Pastoralism, defined as reliance on products from livestock coupled with a seasonal nomadic herding tradition, is similar to horticulture in that it is extensive in its use of land area. Social groups in pastoral societies tend to have similar numbers and population density to horticultural societies. Pastoral societies often trade animal products with agricultural societies for plant based foods to augment their diet. Frequent movement often means that pastoralism has a similar environmental impact to horticulture, though instances of overgrazing, and consequent land degradation (see later subsection under Globalization and Nutrition), have been sited in some cases. Pastoralism generally entails a greater reliance on meat or other animal products, such as milk or blood, than other modes of production. This mode of production has a similar use rights profile to shifting cultivation. Traditionally, pastoralism has coincided with a subsistence based economy, but in the last several decades, some pastoralist societies, such as Mongolia, have herded animals and practiced nomadic living patterns but have produced livestock primarily for market exchange. Agriculture, sometimes referred to as intensive agriculture, involves clearing and using the same plot of land for an extended period, sometimes several generations; it also involves the use of plows and draft animals in the preparation of land for planting and the cultivation of crops. Agriculture often supports much higher population densities than other modes of production (except industrialism) and agricultural societies can range in population from a few thousand into the millions. Though agriculture produces more food per unit of land area than the previously mentioned modes, the tendency of agricultural societies to focus on relatively few crops has often meant that these societies have much less diverse diets than foraging and horticultural societies. There is some archaeological and fossil evidence that populations in transition from foraging to agriculture have tended to suffer reduced stature, reduced musculature, and to exhibit other markers of malnutrition. Research has suggested that agriculture paradoxically allows a higher, but less healthy population for a given area. The advent of agriculture has marked that advent of social stratification in many parts of the world, with marked differentials in access to resources between segments of the same society. This mode of production also is more likely to entail permanent individual or family ownership of particular tracts of land than previously mentioned modes of production. Agriculture has co-occurred with both subsistence and market economies, often with a single society exhibiting some degree of both types of economies and has a more negative impact on the environment than the aforementioned modes of production. Industrialism combines agriculture with mechanized industrial production of goods through the use of fossil fuels. Additionally, industrial societies use <b>mechanized</b> equipment in <b>order</b> to prepare land for planting, harvest crops, and distribute food to locations distant from where the original crops were planted. Industrialism shows similar trends to agriculture in terms of population density, and environmental impact, except to a much greater degree. Dietary diversity can be highly variable under an industrial mode of production and can depend on access to foods produced for local subsistence on the one hand, or to income level and purchasing power visa vie foods available in food markets (Leatherman and Goodman 2005). Dietary diversity and nutritional health often correlate with the degree of social stratification within an industrial society and sometimes between societies. With the exception of Soviet model states, industrial societies are heavily based on the concept of private property rights and the accumulation of profit through “free enterprise”. The general trend for many societies over the past several millennia has been toward agriculture, and in the past two centuries, toward industrialism. Though these two modes of production are by no means superior to other modes in every respect, the fact that societies that practice them tend to have larger populations, higher population densities, and a more complex social structure has correlated with the geographic expansion of agricultural and industrial societies at the expense of societies emphasizing other modes of production. Concurrent with this trend toward intensified agricultural and industrial production has been the rise of the social and economic paradigm of capitalism, which entails the production and sale of goods and services in the market place in order to produce a profit. These trends have had profound implications for nutritional status for human beings on a global scale. In order to discern how broader economic and environmental trends affect a community’s food systems, food security, and nutritional status, it is important to summarize one of the most significant economic and ecological phenomena today, globalization. The next section will treat the linkages between economic and ideological trends over the last several centuries and environmental and political economic factors affecting access to food and nutritional status.|$|R
