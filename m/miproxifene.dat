50|$|<b>Miproxifene</b> (INN) (former {{developmental}} {{code name}} DP-TAT-59) is a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of the triphenylethylene {{group that was}} never marketed. It is a derivative of afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen) in which an additional 4-isopropyl group {{is present in the}} Î²-phenyl ring. The drug {{has been found to be}} 3- to 10-fold more potent than tamoxifen in inhibiting breast cancer cell growth in in vitro models. <b>Miproxifene</b> is the active metabolite of <b>miproxifene</b> phosphate (TAT-59), a phosphate ester and prodrug of <b>miproxifene</b> that was developed to improve its water solubility. <b>Miproxifene</b> phosphate was under development for the treatment of breast cancer and reached phase III clinical trials for this indication but development was discontinued.|$|E

50|$|TPE is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a group}} of nonsteroidal estrogen receptor ligands. It includes the estrogens chlorotrianisene, estrobin (DBE), triphenylbromoethylene, triphenylchloroethylene, triphenyliodoethylene, triphenylmethylethylene; the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) afimoxifene, brilanestrant, broparestrol, clomifene, clomifenoxide, droloxifene, endoxifen, etacstil, fispemifene, idoxifene, <b>miproxifene,</b> <b>miproxifene</b> phosphate, nafoxidine, ospemifene, panomifene, and toremifene. The antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) is also closely related, but is technically not a derivative of TPE and is instead a triphenylethanol derivative. The tamoxifen metabolite and aromatase inhibitor norendoxifen is also a TPE derivative. In addition to their estrogenic activity, various TPE derivatives like tamoxifen and clomifene have been found to act as protein kinase C inhibitors.|$|E
