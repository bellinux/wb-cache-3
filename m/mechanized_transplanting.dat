40|$|A {{research}} about cost effectiveness on different planting method namely direct seeding broadcasting and <b>mechanized</b> <b>transplanting</b> had {{been conducted in}} one area in Selangor. The research had been conducted at Kg. Parit 8, Kg. Tali Air 7, Kg. Tali Air 8 at Sungai Leman, Sabak Bernam, Selangor for both planting operation. Cost effectiveness was measured in term of total cost planting operation of paddy and yield of harvested per season. For cost of planting, it included land preparation cost, land cost, machinery cost, fertilizer cost, pesticide cost and labor cost. All the data of paddy production cost had been collected by distributing a questionnaire to the selected smallholders and interviewed them while secondary data also had been collected from Department of Agriculture in Sabak Bernam district for this research. After analysis this result, the conclusion is direct seeded broadcasting operation {{can be considered as}} more cost effective due to high profit gained compared to the <b>mechanized</b> <b>transplanting</b> operation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Rice Research Station, Moncompu during kharif 2012 to study the effect of different stand establishment techniques on yield and economics of rice cultivation in Kuttanad. The {{experiment was}} laid out in RBD replicated four times with five treatments in plots of 60 m 2. <b>Mechanized</b> <b>transplanting</b> at 22 x 14 cm with early post emergence application of pyrazosulfuron ethyl 10 % WP @ 20 g ai ha- 1 on seven DAT (days after transplanting) followed by hand weeding at 40 DAT significantly influenced the growth and yield attributes and recorded higher grain yield (5350 kg ha- 1), straw yield (9140 kg ha- 1), gross returns (100090 Rs ha- 1), net returns (73303 Rs ha- 1) and B: C ratio (3. 74). Among the direct seeding techniques, drum seeding with early post emergence application of pyrazosulfuron ethyl 10 % WP @ 20 g ai ha- 1 on seven DAS (days after sowing) followed by hand weeding at 40 DAS recorded higher gross returns, net returns and B: C ratio. The lowest grain yield (4566 kg ha- 1), gross returns (86127 Rs ha- 1), net returns (56777 Rs ha- 1) were recorded in broad casting of pregerminated weeds with early post emergence application of pyrazosulfuron ethyl 10 % WP @ 20 g ai ha- 1 on seven DAS followed by hand weeding at 40 DAS. The dry weight of weeds {{were found to be}} less in treatments with post emergence application of pyrazosulfuron ethyl 10 % WP @ 20 g ai ha- 1 followed by hand weeding at 40 DAS/DAT than conoweeding at 15, 30 and 40 DAT. Conoweeding alone failed to control weeds effectively, but it influences the crop growth and yield by stimulating aeration and root growth.

30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{automation}} and reliability of the <b>mechanized</b> <b>transplanting,</b> a vegetable seedling automatic conveying system was designed. The functional execution component of the system consists of a tank-wheel storage seedling mechanism, a seedling tray conveyor, and a hanging cup circulating conveying mechanism. Combined with the communication technology between host computer and programmable logic controller (PLC), the user interface software of automatic conveying system for potted vegetable was developed by using Visual Studio to control and monitor the transmission progress. The PVDF pressure sensor was used to detect the pressure change of the seedling storage disk to obtain the information of the loading seedling tray. The limit switch and stroke switch were combined to obtain the information of the push rod and feed plate. The timing of each component {{is controlled by the}} PLC controller combined with the feedback information of each sensor. The test results show the effect of taking an individual seedling is excellent, the error rate of the pushing mechanism is about 2.08 %, and the success rate was 97.91 %.|$|E
50|$|Rice transplanters {{were first}} {{developed}} in Japan in the 1960s, whereas the earliest attempt to <b>mechanize</b> rice <b>transplanting</b> {{dates back to}} late 19th century. In Japan, development and spread of rice transplanters progressed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
40|$|Manual {{transplanting}} is {{tedious and}} time consuming which often {{the causes of}} delayed planting resulting yield loss of rice in Bangladesh. <b>Mechanized</b> rice <b>transplanting</b> {{is seen as a}} solution of labor problems. Likewise, using <b>mechanized</b> rice <b>transplanting</b> ensures uniform plant spacing as well as fast and efficient planting that contributes to high productivity (Manjunatha et al., 2009). Transplanters have been developed for rice seedling planting into puddled soils to alleviate labour shortages and reduce costs of rice establishment (Adhikari et al., 2006). Although, tillage for rice establishment has significantly mechanized in Bangladesh, 16 - 18 % of total production cost are involved in tillage and land leveling (BRRI, 2013). Development of a rice transplanter suitable for unpuddled transplanting under minimum tillage conditions could further minimize the land preparation cost, which will be of interest to the farmers. No significant work to date has been conducted in Bangladesh to develop a rice transplanter for minimum tillage unpuddled soil conditions. Therefore, the following development and validation study was conducted during 2013 - 15 with modifying and evaluating a riding-type, 6 -row mechanical rice transplanter for unpuddled soil conditions...|$|R
50|$|A {{tree spade}} is a {{specialized}} machine that <b>mechanizes</b> the <b>transplanting</b> of large plants whose hand-powered transplanting (using traditional spades, wagons, and other equipment) would be prohibitively laborious. These include large bushes and small or medium trees. By bringing mechanized power {{to what was}} formerly only a manual process, tree spades do for transplanting what tractors and combine harvesters do for agriculture, and what excavators and other heavy equipment do for construction. Today, tree spades are widely used in the tree nursery industry to increase production rates, and in the landscaping industry for tree removal and transplanting.|$|R
40|$|Land {{degradation}} {{as well as}} agriculture production under scarce {{water conditions}} are vital concerns for many countries located in arid regions. The aim was to introduce, test and optimize a new <b>mechanized</b> <b>transplanting</b> technique suitable for large-scale establishment of fodder shrubs under Water Harvesting (WH) micro-catchment systems. A traditional transplanter was modified to plant 1 to 2 -month old Atriplex seedlings inside the WH structures. The optimum time of planting (T 1, T 2 and T 3), the optimum harvested water regime (4, 8 and 12 m) and the placement of transplants (V 1 and V 2) were investigated. Survival percentage throughout the two dry years and plant volume {{at the end of}} each year were assessed. In the first year, T 2 resulted in the highest (80 % with lSD = 30 at p 3 showed the least (75 cm 3 with lSD = 403 at p 1, resulting in the best plant volume (652 cm 3 with lSD = 282 at p 2 was double (603 cm 3 with lSD = 174 at p 1, justifying its adoption. No significant effect of the length of the runoff area was noted in the two years due mostly to low quantity and intensity of rainfall events. Survival of Atriplex under WH systems is critical only in the first year of establishment and earlier planting guarantees better production. The new technique proved to substitute the costly and time-consuming traditional manual one. Further improvements are still viable...|$|E
40|$|The Province of British Columbia forest tenure {{licensing}} practices {{require the}} replanting of tree seedlings {{in the place}} of logged forest. Reforestation is presently done manually by individual tree planters. Currently {{there is a shortage of}} skilled tree planting labour in Western Canada. This shortage will be exacerbated as the millions of hectares of dead lodgepole pine forests in British Columbia's Central Interior continue to be harvested in the wake of the mountain pine beetle epidemic. Mechanized planting provides a possible solution to this problem. This method has been applied successfully in the agriculture sector and attempted in forestry. Presently in Western Canada no commercially viable automated reforestation is taking place. Research into <b>mechanized</b> conifer <b>transplanting</b> techniques introduced thus far show low productivity and high operating expenses. This paper investigates current manual and automated planting methods for seedling planting quality, growth rates and transplanting costs. In order to contribute to design criteria and assess the commercial prospects of mechanized reforestation equipment in British Columbia's Central Interior, estimates of a machine's minimum planting rate, crew size and equipment configuration will be made. From these specification an initial capital investment in equipment is forecast and projections of operating costs determined. [...] P. ii.
