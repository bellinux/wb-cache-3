5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make up as <b>much</b> as 40% of their body mass, and <b>much</b> of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the crusade, the {{countryside}} of Mecklenburg and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with <b>much</b> bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion. This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost <b>much</b> of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.|$|E
5|$|Crest badges, <b>much</b> like clan tartans, do {{not have}} a long history, and owe <b>much</b> to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the 19th century. The {{original}} badges used by clans are said to have been specific plants worn in bonnets or hung from a pole or spear.|$|E
5|$|Delegates, as {{they waited}} for the {{committees}} to complete their work, spent <b>much</b> of the first two days listening to various orators. Of these, only Senator Blackburn, a silver supporter, sparked <b>much</b> reaction, and that only momentary. Delegates called for better-known speakers, such as Altgeld or Bryan, but were granted neither then; the Illinois governor declined, and the Nebraskan, once seated, spent <b>much</b> of his time away from the convention floor at the platform committee meeting at the Palmer House.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial predictions, Edouard's {{effects were}} <b>much</b> less than expected. Strong waves struck <b>much</b> of the East Coast of the United States, killing 2 and {{injuring}} numerous others. In 2011 the National Hurricane Center reported that Edouard had caused {{a total of}} US$20million with the greatest damage occurring on Cape Cod, where moderate wind gusts resulted in $4.6million (2007USD).|$|E
5|$|East Sussex is, from a {{geological}} viewpoint, {{the southern}} anticline of the Weald. The South Downs contain numerous chalk hills, which continue along <b>much</b> {{of the southern}} area of the county. East Sussex is home to <b>much</b> marshland area, with large amounts {{to the east of}} Beachy Head.|$|E

5|$|Growth was <b>much</b> slower in the east, and {{the modest}} {{extensions}} {{on this side}} were separated from the <b>much</b> larger extensions in the west by the marshy open area of Moorfields adjacent to the wall {{on the north side}} which discouraged development in that direction.|$|E
5|$|Helium is commercially {{available}} in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, {{it can be}} supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as <b>much</b> as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as <b>much</b> as 8m3 (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities of as <b>much</b> as 4,860m3 (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).|$|E
5|$|Honoré III was {{succeeded by}} his son Honoré IV (1758–1819) whose {{marriage}} to Louise d'Aumont Mazarin had done so <b>much</b> to restore the Grimaldi fortunes. <b>Much</b> of this fortune had been depleted by the hardships of the revolution. On 17 June 1814 under the Treaty of Paris, the Principality of Monaco was restored to Honoré IV.|$|E

5|$|If it {{advances}} <b>much</b> faster, {{then the}} tool becomes choked; conversely, if it advances <b>much</b> slower, then an interrupted or zig-zag cut occurs. In practice {{the rate of}} cut is slightly less than the ideal rate so that the load is released on the non-cutting edge of the tool.|$|E
5|$|Ikata {{is a small}} town, with a {{population}} of 10,637 as of March 31, 2014. The total land area of the town is 94.37km2, making the population density 113 persons per km2. However, <b>much</b> of the land on the peninsula is quite mountainous and not suited for development; the population density of the individual settlements, which are squeezed into the small bay areas {{in the foothills of the}} mountains, is <b>much</b> higher. Extrapolating from data based on the most recent land survey, only 3.21% of the town's land is inhabited; this puts the population density at a <b>much</b> higher 3,510 persons/kilometer-squared.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner <b>much</b> like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay <b>much</b> farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a <b>much</b> greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E
5|$|In a 2017 paper, Gwee {{and colleagues}} found that boobook populations on larger mountainous islands were more {{distinct}} from Australian stock, while those on flatter smaller islands were <b>much</b> more similar, suggesting that these locations were colonised <b>much</b> more recently after previous populations had become extinct.|$|E
5|$|In {{fish and}} other wildlife, {{selenium}} is necessary for life, but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight. <b>Much</b> below that level, young salmon die from deficiency; <b>much</b> above, they die from toxic excess.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} renewed {{interest}} in Nepenthes worldwide. <b>Much</b> of the plants' current popularity can probably be attributed to Shigeo Kurata, whose book Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu (1976), which featured the best colour photography of Nepenthes to date, did <b>much</b> to bring attention to these unusual plants.|$|E
5|$|In the 1968 ITV {{historical}} drama The Caesars, Tiberius (by André Morell) is {{the central}} character for <b>much</b> of the series and is portrayed in a <b>much</b> more balanced way than in I, Claudius.|$|E
5|$|In the {{elections}} of 2001 and 2005, Labour maintained <b>much</b> of the middle-class support that it had won in 1997. In 2005, Labour's support was <b>much</b> lower {{than in the previous}} two elections, which David Rubinstein has attributed to anger at the war in Iraq and towards Blair himself.|$|E
5|$|In {{the large}} sheep {{producing}} nations of South America, Australia and New Zealand sheep are usually bred on {{large tracts of}} land with <b>much</b> less intervention from the graziers or breeders. Merinos, and <b>much</b> {{of the land in}} these countries does not lend itself to the mob intervention that is found in smaller flock breeding countries.|$|E

5|$|<b>Much</b> like Within the Woods, The Evil Dead {{needed to}} be blown up to 35mm, then the {{industry}} standard, to be played at movie theaters. The relatively large budget made this a <b>much</b> simpler process with The Evil Dead {{than it had been}} with the short film.|$|E
5|$|<b>Much</b> of Lewis' {{subsequent}} research {{concerned the}} computational complexity {{of problems in}} mathematical logic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Much</b> of {{the debate}} in the 2008 {{legislative}} session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008–2010 biennium, a period when the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so <b>much</b> of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become <b>much</b> more independent of the governor than it was when he was a legislator two decades earlier. He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E
5|$|<b>Much</b> of the {{displacement}} of a dreadnought was {{taken up by the}} steel plating of the armour.
