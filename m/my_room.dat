5|$|In the Adventure Mode, the {{characters}} {{compete in a}} race for the Super Big Power Crystal. This race {{is made up of}} six stages, each containing smaller sub-maps. The host of the race, the Viscount, sets a task for each stage. This task must be completed before the player can continue to another map. The player with the most points is the winner of the stage. The overall winner of all the stages is the winner of the Viscount's race. In the Festival Mode, the gameplay is fundamentally the same as in the Adventure Mode, {{with the exception of the}} ability to select stages to play freely. In the <b>My</b> <b>Room</b> mode, the player's character has his or her own private room in which he or she can either play minigames that have been collected in Adventure Mode, view a collection of items obtained in Adventure Mode, or create a Motion Panel, a unique in-game communication tool can allow customized messages to be sent mid-game to help friends or distract other players' gameplay. The decorations in <b>My</b> <b>Room</b> is different for each character.|$|E

500|$|Jackson's biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{has stated}} that the video is based on Jackson's real life. He used to walk alone at night looking for new friends, even {{at the peak of}} his musical popularity. The 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in <b>my</b> <b>room</b> {{sometimes}} and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home." ...|$|E

I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping {{to find someone to}} talk to. But I just end up coming home."

500|$|McEwan {{has been}} open about the autobiographical {{elements}} in the book, and has called it [...] "a muted and distorted autobiography" [...] and [...] "a muted, or transmuted, memoir {{of myself as a}} young writer." [...] There are, however, significant differences between author and character. Haley is both an academic and a writer of fiction, while McEwan has been a professional author for his entire career. The intelligence agency plot is also completely fictional; there was never a scheme such as the one described in the book run by MI5. As McEwan says himself, [...] "unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and offered me a stipend." ...|$|E

Joseph {{said he wanted to}} teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom. By the early 1980s, he was deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely.

500|$|The believability of the song's lyrics, which conveys love testaments {{as well as}} its {{timeless}} endurance, sung on sensual vocal arrangements by Beyoncé, who additionally {{adopts a}} sneering attitude, demonstrates her alter ego Sasha Fierce. Lyrically, [...] "Radio" [...] explores the relationship between Beyoncé as the female protagonist and the songs played on the radio, shown in the lyrics: [...] "You're the only one that Papa allowed in <b>my</b> <b>room</b> with the door closed / We'd be alone / And Mama never freaked out when she heard it go boom / 'Cause she knew we were in the zone".

500|$|Drake was {{featured}} in full-page interviews in the pop press. In July, Melody Maker referred to the album as [...] "poetic" [...] and [...] "interesting", though NME wrote in October that there was [...] "not nearly enough variety to make it entertaining". It received radio plays from the BBC's more progressive disc-jockeys such as John Peel and Bob Harris. Drake was unhappy with the inlay sleeve, which printed songs in the wrong running order and reproduced verses omitted from the recorded versions. In an interview his sister Gabrielle said: [...] "He was very secretive. I knew he was making an album but I didn't know what stage of completion it was at until he walked into <b>my</b> <b>room</b> and said, 'There you are.' He threw it onto the bed and walked out!" ...|$|E
500|$|Capitol {{immediately}} reissued piouhgd and paired {{the band}} {{with their first}} big-name producer, John Paul Jones, {{best known as the}} bassist for Led Zeppelin. The fruit of their partnership, 1993's Independent Worm Saloon, featured a more straightforward rock approach at Jones's insistence.

It reached number 24 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks singles chart, while the album peaked at number 124 on the Billboard 200.

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "it's {{a melancholy}} record {{discussing}} the torturous pain {{that comes with}} thinking about someone all the time, even if they may not reciprocate the sentiment." [...] The track, being originally written for a woman, {{can be viewed as}} unisex composition. Following Ocean's revelation that he has been attracted to people of the same sex, some critics noted that lines such as [...] "my eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when I'm thinkin bout you" [...] had another additional message, expressing his own thoughts on love. The song has been called a forbidden love track, expressing Ocean's turmoil about his own hidden sexuality. The refrain [...] "boy" [...] was originally viewed synonym for “wow”, though [...] "new urgency" [...] was pumped into the track, adding extra pathos. Ocean reminisces about his [...] "first time", with an ex-lover who is addressed as [...] "boy" [...] during the song. The track is an apology to an unnamed lover. Lines like [...] "a tornado flew around <b>my</b> <b>room</b> before you came," [...] serves as a confession, and [...] "excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in Southern California" [...] outlines Ocean's own grief about the situation, admitting the situation got out of control.|$|E
