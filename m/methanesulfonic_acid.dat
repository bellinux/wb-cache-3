The crystalline compounds were examined using various methods such as: X-ray diffraction, thermo-analysis and other chemical methods. The synthesis of methanesulfonatehydrates occurs through the reaction of metalcarbonates and <b>methanesulfonic</b> <b>acids</b> in an aqueous soultion in a stoichiometric-ratio. The methanesulf pounds of some alkaline-, alkalinearth- and transitionmetals were synthesised and their water of hyd rmined using TG and DTA.

40|$|Ammonia and amines {{are common}} trace {{gases in the}} {{atmosphere}} and {{have a variety of}} both biogenic and anthropogenic sources, with a major contribution coming from agricultural sites. In addition to their malodorous nature, both ammonia and amines have been shown to enhance particle formation from acids such as nitric, sulfuric and <b>methanesulfonic</b> <b>acids,</b> which has implications for visibility, human health and climate. A key component of quantifying the effects of these species on particle formation is accurate gas-phase measurements in both laboratory and field studies. However, these species are notoriously difficult to measure as they are readily taken up on surfaces, including onto glass surfaces from aqueous solution as established in the present studies. We describe here a novel technique for measuring gas-phase ammonia and amines that involves uptake onto a weak cation exchange resin followed by extraction and analysis using ion chromatography. Two variants – one for parts per billion concentrations in air and the second with lower (parts per trillion) detection limits – are described. The latter involves the use of a custom-designed high-pressure cartridge to hold the resin for in-line extraction. These methods avoid the use of sampling lines, which can lead to significant inlet losses of these compounds. They also have the advantages of being relatively simple and inexpensive. The applicability of this technique to ambient air is demonstrated in measurements made near a cattle farm in Chino, CA...|$|R

Intensive measurements of gaseous dimethylsulfide (DMS), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), sulfuric (H 2 SO 4) and <b>methanesulfonic</b> <b>acids</b> (MSA) and particulate sulfate (SO 4 2 −) and methanesulfonate (MS −) have been performed during the campaign. Dimethylsulfide (DMS) levels ranged from 2. 9 to 136 pmol · mol - 1 (mean value of 21. 7 pmol · mol − 1) and showed a clear diurnal variation with daytime maximum. During nighttime DMS levels fall close or below the detection limit of 2 pmol ·mol − 1. Concurrent measurements of OH and NO 3 radicals during the campaign indicate that NO 3 levels can explain most of the observed diurnal variation of DMS. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) ranged between 0. 02 and 10. 1 pmol · mol − 1 (mean value of 1. 7 pmol · mol − 1) and presents a diurnal variation similar to that of DMS.

Of particular interest are the measurements of gaseous MSA and H 2 SO 4. MSA ranged from below the detection limit (3 × 10 4) to 3. 7 × 10 7 molecules cm − 3, whereas H 2 SO 4 ranged between 1 × 10 5 and 9. 0 × 10 7 molecules cm − 3.

Accurate measurements of the OSC precursors are thus essential to reduce uncertainties in their sources and contributions to particle formation in air. Two different approaches, proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) and canister sampling coupled to gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID), are compared for both laboratory standards (dimethyl sulfide, DMS; dimethyl disulfide, DMDS; dimethyl trisulfide, DMTS; and methanethiol, MTO) and for a complex sample. Results show that both techniques produce accurate quantification of DMS. While PTR-ToF-MS provides real-time measurements of all four OSCs individually, significant fragmentation of DMDS and DMTS occurs, which can complicate their identification in complex mixtures. Canister sampling coupled with GC-FID provides excellent sensitivity for DMS, DMDS, and DMTS.

40|$|Eight {{organic acids}} were {{measured}} in 111 rain events occurring between September 1996 and May 1998 in Wilmington, North Carolina. Formic and acetic acids {{were the most}} abundant comprising approximately 75 % of the total molar quantity of organic acids. The annual volume-weighted concentrations of organic acids in order of decreasing abundance in rainwater was formic (9. 9 μM), acetic (7. 3 μM), oxalic (1. 8 μM), lactic (1. 3 μM), succinic (1. 0 μM), malonic (0. 7 μM), pyruvic (0. 3 μM), and maleic (0. 1 μM), with <b>methanesulfonic</b> and glyoxylic <b>acids</b> usually below their detection limit. Growing season back-trajectory data provided strong evidence that terrestrial organic acid sources dominated over marine sources. Air mass back-trajectory analysis indicated that {{during the growing season}} air mass origin had a consistent impact on concentrations of rainwater organic acids. Rain with continental back-trajectories coming from the west had the highest concentrations of organic acids while two predominately marine back-trajectories had the lowest concentrations. Concentrations of organic acids in non-growing season rain did not display a consistent pattern indicating variability in sources. Seasonality of individual organic acids for specific back-trajectories was most pronounced in terrestrial back-trajectories and least in the marine back-trajectories indicating that seasonality in rainwater organic acid concentrations is driven by variations in terrestrial sources. Formic to acetic acid ratios (F:A), previously an indicator of terrestrial versus marine sources of these organic acids, were similar for all back-trajectories reflecting anthropogenic impacts on F:A locally and regionally. The ratios of malonic to succinic acids (M:S), also an indicator of sources for these acids, indicated direct anthropogenic sources for terrestrial back-trajectories and secondary processes for marine back-trajectories. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
