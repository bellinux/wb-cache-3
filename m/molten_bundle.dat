The Leu 16 Pro mutation in PMP 22 results in misassembly of the protein, which causes the Trembler-J (TrJ) disease phenotype. Here we elucidate the structural defects present in a partially folded state of TrJ PMP 22 that are decisive in promoting CMTD-causing misfolding. In this state, transmembrane helices 2 – 4 (TM 2 – 4) form a <b>molten</b> globular <b>bundle,</b> while transmembrane helix 1 (TM 1) is dissociated from this bundle. The TrJ mutation was seen to profoundly disrupt the TM 1 helix, resulting in increased backbone dynamics {{and changes in the}} tertiary interactions of TM 1 with the PMP 22 TM 2 – 4 core in the folded state. Consequently, TM 1 undergoes enhanced dissociation from the other transmembrane segments in TrJ PMP 22, becoming available for recognition and sequestration by protein-folding quality control, which leads to loss of function and toxic accumulation of aggregates that result in CMTD...|$|R
