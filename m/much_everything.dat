5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything.</b> Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E

25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E
25|$|Three centuries were {{recorded}} at Old Trafford, as Gloucestershire Gladiators snatched {{a victory over}} the hosting Lancashire Lightning after being regarded with no chance earlier on. The Gladiators won the toss and got immediate success, as Jon Lewis dismissed Mal Loye with the second ball of the day, but pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> went against Gloucestershire from then on, as Stuart Law, Mark Chilton and Andrew Symonds flayed the bowling to all corners. Symonds took 88 balls for his century, {{and went on to}} make 129 before being bowled by James Averis - who finished with four for 40. Law and Chilton also made fifties, but Averis' late spell and a slow 39-ball 11 from Marcus North ensured that the total ended on 267 for 7. Then, James Anderson had three men caught off his bowling, as Gloucestershire crashed to 47 for 4. However, Anderson finished his spell, and Ramnaresh Sarwan crafted a century - which was shortly followed by Mark Hardinges reaching his first one-day century of his career, and in the process lifting his List A career batting average from 14.23 to 17.50, still below par for a specialist batsman like Hardinges. However, the pair added 221 runs in 116 minutes for the fifth wicket, hitting six sixes along the way, as they guided Gloucestershire out of the relegation zone in the National League.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV News {{reviewed}} the video for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] positively. Montgomery commented on how simple the song's video was but noted that wasn't a negative, he commented, [...] "like pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> 3OH!3 do, there's an undeniable charm {{to both the}} song and the video. Perhaps it's the power-tool chorus, or the [...] "ooh-ooh-ooh" [...] vocal harmonies. Maybe it's Kesha's sexy ass. Or maybe I just like watching {{a whole bunch of}} people lock lips. The whole thing is a lot of fun. It gets in your head. And hey, it's the summer — school's out, and gleefully stupid is in." ...|$|E

500|$|Eric Walters of Paste awarded The Flash episode a 9.0 out of 10, stating, [...] ""Flash vs. Arrow" [...] was {{everything}} a fan could have wanted from a crossover event," [...] noting it was [...] "tight, well-paced, superbly written and, most importantly, fun...". Caroline Preece of Den of Geek also praised the episode, {{saying that it}} [...] "was pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> fans wanted and more". She noted this episode demonstrated how comic book ideas [...] "can translate to the small screen if done with this much care, joy and enthusiasm". Given the [...] "hype" [...] she admired, and was [...] "surprised" [...] {{by the fact that}} even [...] "with a little added Oliver, Felicity and Diggle thrown in," [...] the crossover was not the focus of the whole episode.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective reviews {{were also}} positive, with the film's animation, {{characters}} and music receiving much praise throughout the years. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film has}} an approval rating of 86%. In 1990, when the film had its last theatrical re-release, Entertainment Weekly considered that The Jungle Book [...] "isn't a classic Walt Disney film on the order of, say, Cinderella or Pinocchio, but it's one of Disney's liveliest and funniest", while the Los Angeles Times thought the film's crew was [...] "near the height of their talents" [...] and the resulting film [...] "remains a high-spirited romp that will delight children--and parents weary of action films with body counts that exceed their box-office grosses." [...] In 2010, Empire' ' described the film as one that [...] "gets pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> right", regarding that the vibrant animation and catchy songs overcame the plot deficiencies.|$|E
500|$|The abuse {{he faced}} {{at the hands}} of opponents early in his NHL career {{prompted}} Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach Brian Sutter's arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. [...] "You've got a power forward who does it all," [...] said Craig Conroy. [...] "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done." [...] His opponents also respect his play. Rob Blake said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, [...] "he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> you'd want a guy to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Hollywood A.D." [...] {{was mostly}} positive. The Montreal Gazette named the episode the sixth best stand-alone X-Files episode, writing that [...] "Despite taxing our stomach for self-reflexive comedy, this David Duchovny scripted and directed episode manages to deliver {{some of the}} greatest laughs of the series." [...] Rob Bricken from Topless Robot named [...] "Hollywood A.D." [...] the seventh funniest X-Files episode. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B, slightly criticizing the dancing zombies {{at the end of the}} episode. Sarah Kendzior from 11th Hour Magazine wrote that, [...] "My favorite [...] this year may well be 'Hollywood A.D.', an ambitious, often ingenious and occasionally flawed sophomore effort concerning the entertainment industry, religion, and pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> in between." [...] Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] " [...] scene from the 'movie' where Shandling/Mulder faces off against The Cigarette Smoking Pontiff, and his army of sniper zombies, is classic stuff, and earns 'Hollywood A.D.' high marks." [...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com, while criticizing the episode for reveling in parody, noted that the episode was entertaining, writing, [...] "'Hollywood A.D.' is a parody and, as such, will be unsatisfying to the many X-Files viewers, including this long-suffering reviewer, who'd like to see the series culminate in a dramatic, multi-episode denouement of its 'mythology arc'. Nonetheless, this episode has merit as a witty and imaginative parody." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Wales of IGN {{rated the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.9 out of 10, stating {{that despite the}} episode's premise, it came [...] "perilously close to greatness," [...] and praised Raynor's [...] "crackling script which graciously walked the tightrope between balls-out farce and affectionate sci-fi pastiche". Wales noted that Tennant and Tate [...] "relished" [...] the {{perpetual}} swings from [...] "square-jawed serious" [...] to [...] "faintly sadistic subversion", to mess with audience expectations. Ryan's performance as Staal was again praised, but Wales felt Agyeman still displayed [...] "the charisma and range of a dead fish, despite Martha's transformation from lovesick sap to Ripley-esque super soldier." [...] Wales summed up that the episode [...] "did pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> a two-part opener should – swiftly shifting the pieces into place for next week's inevitably bombastic showdown." [...] Alan Stanley Bear of Airlock Alpha called [...] "The Sontaran Strategem" [...] an [...] "exciting and nostalgic adventure", {{and said that the}} episode lives up to the show's reputation for transforming a normal object, in this case the car, to a [...] "global killer". Bear praised the episode for Donna and Martha's introduction being opposite to Rose Tyler and Sarah Jane Smith's in [...] "School Reunion", for providing a human element in the subplot where Donna visits her grandfather, and for the episode's cliffhanger. However, Bear wrote that it took too long to [...] "get to the point", and criticized the [...] "bland Sontaran dialogue and the cliched simplicity of mind control", which he felt [...] "reduced {{what could have been a}} fantastically intricate story piece into Saturday morning cartoon material." ...|$|E
500|$|The Court further {{stated that}} {{although}} congress allowed the resale and gifting {{of a gun}} by an individual, without requiring form or background checks, that is not proof that congress did not care about straw buyers. [...] "Yes, Congress decided to regulate dealers’ sales, while leaving the secondary market for guns largely untouched.... And yes, that choice (like pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> Congress does) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw arrangements are {{not a part of}} the secondary market, separate and apart from the dealer’s sale." [...] The Court also rejected Abramski's claim that since Alvarez was able to buy the gun legally on his own the misrepresentation is not material, stating: [...] "Abramski’s false statement was material because had he revealed that he was purchasing the gun on Alvarez’s behalf, the sale could not have proceeded under the law—even though Alvarez turned out to be an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter, would not have complied with §922(c)’s restrictions on absentee purchases." [...] The court held that Abramski's case is analogous to a situation where a person that can buy a gun legally buys a gun under an alias. Such misrepresentation is material regardless of the fact that the buyer may purchase a gun legally, and the theory of [...] "no harm, no foul" [...] should not apply. Finally, the Court rejected Abramski's claim that the misrepresentation is not in violation of §924, because it is not part of what the dealer is statutorily required to maintain on his record. The Court held that §924 requires the dealer to maintain information [...] "required by this chapter", and that ATF Form 4473 is required by this chapter.|$|E

500|$|City of Death {{was voted}} into seventh {{place in a}} 1998 poll of the readers of Doctor Who Magazine {{to find the best}} Doctor Who story; the {{magazine}} commented that it [...] "represented the height of Doctor Who as popular light entertainment for all the family". In 2009, Doctor Who Magazine readers voted it in eighth place. In a more recent 2014 poll, the magazine's readers voted it fifth best Doctor Who story of all time. A 2008 article in The Daily Telegraph named City of Death one of the ten greatest episodes of Doctor Who. John Condor, writing in the fanzine DWB in 1991, hailed the story as [...] "the best blend of kitsch, surrealism, fantasy and comedy-drama seen in our favourite Time Lord's annals". Vanessa Bishop, reviewing the serial's DVD release, described it as [...] "imaginatively written, well-performed and beautifully made, City of Death is a story where pretty <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> works". Reacting to the serial, as part of Doctor Who Magazines ongoing [...] "Time Team" [...] feature, Jacqueline Rayner said [...] "you're suddenly, almost violently, made aware this is happening in our world... with people just getting on with their business and two Time Lords walking through it. I don't think I've ever experienced that with Doctor Who up till now... it's the tiny touches of mundanity amid the fantastical that lift the story even higher". Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it on their list of [...] "10 TV Episodes that Changed Television", citing [...] "the sharp dialogue and clever use of time travel [...] prefigure everything Steven Moffat has done with the series in recent years." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn described City of Death as the [...] "gem" [...] of the seventeenth season, finding Adams' subtle comedy script [...] "easily the funniest and most quotable the series ever achieved". While he praised Scarlioni's costume and the mask, he felt that more could have been done with using Paris as a filming location.|$|E
