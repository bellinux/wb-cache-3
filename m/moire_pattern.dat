5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a <b>moire</b> <b>pattern</b> as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E

40|$|We have {{observed}} with STM <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> {{corresponding to the}} rotation of one graphene layer on HOPG surface. The <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> were characterized by rotation angle and extension in the plane. Additionally, by identifying border domains and defects we can discriminate between <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> due to rotation on the surface or subsurface layer. For {{a better understanding of}} <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> formation we have studied by first principles an array of three graphene layers where the top or the middle layer appears rotated around the stacking axis.

25|$|Quantitative tomographic {{reconstruction}} of the dark-field signal has also been demonstrated for the phase-stepping technique and very recently for the <b>Moiré</b> <b>pattern</b> approach as well.|$|E
25|$|Using this approach, {{the spatial}} {{resolution}} {{is lower than}} one achieved by the phase-stepping technique, but the total exposure time can be much shorter, because a differential phase image can be retrieved with only one <b>Moiré</b> <b>pattern.</b> Single-shot Fourier analysis technique was used in early grid-based scattering imaging similar to the shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor in optics, which allowed first live animal studies.|$|E
25|$|Du Pont and Boudin did {{disagree}} {{over the}} wall covering. Du Pont proposed a green-on-green stripe, while Boudin desired a more subdued, moss-colored silk with a <b>moiré</b> <b>pattern.</b> Jacqueline Kennedy chose Boudin's fabric in spring 1962. After the Scalamandré fabric company proved unable to reproduce the moiré silk with the quality desired by Kennedy, the French firm of Tassinari et Châtel was chosen to manufacture the fabric.|$|E
50|$|More complex line <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> {{are created}} if {{the lines are}} curved or not exactly parallel. <b>Moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> {{revealing}} complex shapes, or sequences of symbols embedded {{in one of the}} layers (in form of periodically repeated compressed shapes) are created with shape moiré, otherwise called band <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns.</b> One of the most important properties of shape moiré is its ability to magnify tiny shapes along either one or both axes, that is, stretching. A common 2D example of moiré magnification occurs when viewing a chain-link fence through a second chain-link fence of identical design. The fine structure of the design is visible even at great distances.|$|R
50|$|Superimposition of {{two-dimensional}} images containing correlated periodic grid structures {{may produce}} <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns.</b> Superimposition of two correlated layers comprising parallel lines or curves may give rise line <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns.</b> The movement {{of one of}} the layers results in a faster movement of the line moiré superimposition image. Such optical acceleration is known as moiré speedup (check for the formulas of optical speedup for curved patterns). When superimposing two identical layers comprising randomly spaced parallel lines, at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random line <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns,</b> namely line Glass patterns (after Leon Glass, 1969) appear. Similarly, when superimposing two identical layers of randomly scattered dots at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random dot Glass patterns, namely random dot moiré, appears. When one of the layers embeds complex shapes, such as sequences of symbols forming a text, and another layer contains parallel lines or curves, the superimposition image may give rise to magnified shapes, called shape <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> on Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite {{surfaces}} due to dislocated graphene layers were studied. We {{observed that}} the apparent corrugations of the <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> in scanning tunnelling microscopy images change {{as a function of}} tunnel junction bias. A simple geometric investigation of the atomic structure of the graphene layers generating <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> revealed that different atomic arrangements due to different twist angles can result in similar geometric moiré periods such that, {{only a small fraction of}} the observed moiré periodicities may coincide with the real atomic periodicity generating the moiré system. Ab initio calculations showed that the band structure of <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> exhibit the fingerprints of those of bilayer graphene system preserving the Dirac cone. Moreover, our calculations in view of the correct atomistic modelling of the <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns</b> showed that van Hove singularities in twisted bilayer graphene system with varying angles have different origins in their respective band structures. Consequently, our results shed light on the graphene like behaviour of the top most dislocated graphene layer on HOPG surfaces by showing that the layer does not act alone but the final graphene bilayer has electronic properties partially resembling graphene.

25|$|For the <b>Moiré</b> <b>pattern</b> {{configuration}} the {{constraint on}} the radiation energy {{is a bit}} stricter, because a finite bandwidth of energy instead of monochromatic radiation causes {{a decrease in the}} visibility of the Moiré fringes and thus the image quality, but a moderate polychromaticity is still allowed. A great advantage of the usage of polychromatic radiation is the shortening of the exposure times and this has recently been exploited by using white synchrotron radiation to realize the first dynamic (time-resolved) Phase contrast tomography.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} shown to the right in the brick patterns. The top image shows the effects when the {{sampling}} theorem's condition is not satisfied. When software rescales an image (the same process that creates the thumbnail shown in the lower image) it, in effect, runs the image through a low-pass filter first and then downsamples the image {{to result in a}} smaller image that does not exhibit the <b>moiré</b> <b>pattern.</b> The top image is what happens when the image is downsampled without low-pass filtering: aliasing results.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} spatial {{aliasing}} is the <b>moiré</b> <b>pattern</b> {{observed in a}} poorly pixelized image of a brick wall. Spatial anti-aliasing techniques avoid such poor pixelizations. Aliasing can be caused either by the sampling stage or the reconstruction stage; these may be distinguished by calling sampling aliasing [...] prealiasing and reconstruction aliasing [...] postaliasing.|$|E
50|$|Photographs of a TV screen {{taken with}} a digital camera often exhibit <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns.</b> Since both the TV screen and the digital camera use a {{scanning}} technique to produce or to capture pictures with horizontal scan lines, the conflicting sets of lines cause the <b>moiré</b> <b>patterns.</b> To avoid the effect, the digital camera can be aimed at an angle of 30 degrees to the TV screen.|$|R
50|$|Strobing {{can also}} refer to cross colour and <b>Moiré</b> <b>patterning.</b> Cross colour refers to when any high {{frequency}} luminance {{content of the}} picture, close to the TV systems colour sub-carrier frequency, is interpreted by the analogue receiver's decoder as colour information. <b>Moiré</b> <b>patterning</b> is where an interference pattern is produced by fine scene detail beating with the line (or even pixel) structure of the device used to analyse or display the scene.|$|R

2500|$|Similar to {{one-dimensional}} discrete-time signals, {{images can}} also suffer from aliasing if the sampling resolution, or pixel density, is inadequate. For example, a digital {{photograph of a}} striped shirt with high frequencies (in other words, {{the distance between the}} stripes is small), can cause aliasing of the shirt when it is sampled by the camera's image sensor. The aliasing appears as a <b>moiré</b> <b>pattern.</b> The [...] "solution" [...] to higher sampling in the spatial domain for this case would be to move closer to the shirt, use a higher resolution sensor, or to optically blur the image before acquiring it with the sensor.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is the}} retrieval of the differential phase by using Moiré fringes. These are created as a superposition of the self-image of G1 and the pattern of G2 by using gratings with the same periodicity and inclining G2 against G1 regarding to the optical axis with a very small angle(<<1). This moiré fringes act as carrier fringes {{because they have a}} much larger spacing/period (smaller spatial frequency) than the Talbot fringes and thus the phase gradient introduced by the sample can be detected as the displacement of the Moiré fringes. [...] With a Fourier analysis of the <b>Moiré</b> <b>pattern</b> the absorption and dark-field signal can also be extracted.|$|E
2500|$|The Green Room was {{refurbished}} {{during the}} summer of 2007 by First Lady Laura Bush with advisement from the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, Bush family interior designer Ken Blasingame, and White House curator William Allman. The refurbishment retained most of the Nixon-era Conger and Jones design. Walls were again hung in silk, but this time in a more vertical and largely scaled <b>moiré</b> <b>pattern</b> and a darker shade. The coral color in the upholstered chairs and in the striped drapery fabric was intensified to a more vibrant shade bordering on vermilion. The drapery recreates Edward Vason Jones' 1971 design but with the more intense vermilion in the silk and the painted cornice. The drapery design was simplified by removing four large tassels but retained the large bobble-fringe of the Nixon-era design. The green Turkish Kilim carpet installed in the Nixon administration was replaced by a new rug woven in the Savonnerie style of France. It is somewhat similar in design to an antique Savonnerie acquired for the Red Room by Stéphane Boudin. As a part of the refurbishment the painting The Builders by Jacob Lawrence was acquired by the White House Acquisition Trust.
