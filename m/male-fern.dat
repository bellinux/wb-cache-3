The ground on the {{opposite}} slope (slopes are, you must remember, here as steep as house-roofs, the last spurs of true mountains) {{is covered with a}} grass like tall rye-grass, but growing in tufts. That is the famous Guinea-grass {78e} which, introduced from Africa, has spread over the whole West Indies. Dark lithe coolie prisoners, one a gentle young fellow, with soft beseeching eyes, and 'Felon' printed {{on the back of his}} shirt, are cutting it for the horses, under the guard of a mulatto turnkey, a tall, steadfast, dignified man; and between us and them are growing along the edge of the gutter, veritable pine- apples in the open air, and a low green tree just like an apple, which is a Guava; and a tall stick, thirty feet high, with a flat top of gigantic curly horse-chestnut leaves, which is a Trumpet- tree. {79a} There are hundreds of them in the mountains round: but most of them dead, from the intense drought and fires of last year. [...] Beyond it, again, is a round-headed tree, looking like a huge Portugal laurel, covered with racemes of purple buds. That is an 'Angelim'; {79b} when full-grown, one of the finest timbers in the world. And what are those at the top of the brow, rising out of the rich green scrub? Verily, again, we are in the Tropics. They are palms, doubtless, some thirty feet high each, with here and there a young one springing up like a gigantic crown of <b>male-fern.</b> The old ones have straight gray stems, often prickly enough, and thickened in the middle; gray last year's leaves hanging down; and feathering round the top, a circular plume of pale green leaves, like those of a coconut. But these are not cocos. The last year's leaves of the coco are rich yellow, and its stem is curved. These are groo-groos; {79c} they stand as fresh proofs that we are indeed in the Tropics, and as 'a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.' ...|$|E
50|$|On {{the slopes}} dog's-mercury (Mercurialis perennis) and {{woodruff}} (Galium odoratum) are abundant, while more local species include nettle-leaved bellflower (Campanula trachelium), white (Cephalanthera damasonium), broad-leaved (Epipactis helleborine) and narrow-lipped (E. leptochila)helleborines, yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys) and scaly <b>male-fern</b> (Dryopteris affinis).|$|E
50|$|This is an {{area for}} ferns and many grow in the rock crevices. They include maidenhair spleenwort, lady-fern, scaly <b>male-fern,</b> western polypody and hard fern. Other species {{recorded}} are tutsan, bilberry, wood sage and foxglove. Mosses thrive on the boulders.|$|E
50|$|The {{conditions}} are damp and acidic {{and the ground}} flora includes foxglove, woodruff, tutsan, slender St John's-wort, wild madder, great woodrush, wood sage, bilberry, wood sorrel. The many ferns include hard shield fern, hard fern, scaly <b>male-fern</b> and maidenhair spleenwort. The general woodland flowers include bluebell, wood anemone, primrose, dog-violet and yellow archangel. There are many mosses and liverworts present.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the best}} and oldest known {{tapeworm}} anthelmintics, a preparation from Dryopteris filix mas, commonly called the <b>Male-fern,</b> was known and used by the Greek physicians of ancient times (1). Their knowledge was lost in the Middle Ages except for a few people who kept it a closely guarded secret. In the eighteenth century Frederic the Great of Prussia managed to buy the information concerning the rhizome of the <b>Male-fern</b> and published it. The most effective preparation was the oil obtained by extracting the dried rhizome with ether. The anthelmintic action of the rhizome of Dryopteris filix mas on living animals and tapeworms was studied scientifically for the first time by Carlblom (2), in Tartu, Estonia, in 1866...|$|E
