These results were compared with one obtained for conventional grinding. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental investigations of deep-seated surface grinding of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy using CBN grinding wheel with metal bond were the ground for this elaboration. The effectiveness of AEDG process was assessed based on specific tangential grinding force and energy of spark electric discharge and machining results were estimated on geometrical structure parameters. Findings: The effectiveness of <b>machining</b> <b>allowance</b> removal depended on conditions of AEDG process. Significant differences in SGT formed by AEDG process and conventional grinding were revealed. Practical implications: Abrasive electrodischarge grinding is useful to be particularly suitable for efficient and effective grinding of very hard structural materials such as high-alloy steel, sintered carbides, metal-based composite materials etc. Originality/value: AEDG experiments were carried out using the typical surface finishing grinder and especially adapted generator of spark discharge pulses.

The graphical approach and rooted tree diagram were adopted for tolerance charting (Whybrew et al. 1990).

The manufacturing process sequence {{was determined by}} using a profile representation method which incorporates a two-dimensional matrix containing a number coding system to represent the part profile (Ngoi and Ong 1993). A mathematical rooted tree model incorporating the linkage between the capability of manufacturing process and tolerance chart balancing was developed (Wei and Lee 1995). Geometrical control requirements were expressed as equivalent linear dimensions and then applied to a tolerance chart (Ngoi and Tan 1995). A backward derivation approach was traced for determining the machining tolerances starting from the last operation and computing <b>machining</b> <b>allowances</b> backwardly till the first machining operation (Ji 1996). A graphical method for presenting the process link and for obtaining the necessary working dimensions and tolerances was introduced (Ngoi and Tan 1997).|$|R
40|$|AbstractHot forged parts {{characterized}} by thin sections may suffer geometric distortions during the cooling phase that force the process designers {{to work with}} significant <b>machining</b> <b>allowances.</b> The correct identification of the such defects during the process design might allow the proper set of the process parameters for their compensation and, therefore, {{the reduction of the}} <b>allowances</b> and the <b>machining</b> steps. The early computation of such distortions can be fulfilled by using thermal-mechanical-metallurgical models of both the forging and cooling phases, which must be calibrated through extensive experimental campaigns, involving both laboratory experiments and on-field measurements during industrial production. The paper presents a coupled experimental and numerical approach to predict the geometrical distortions of turbine blades in martensitic stainless steel. The presented approach comprises both the development of the numerical models of the forging and cooling phases and their calibration using accurate material data. In order to validate the numerical models, the numerically predicted geometries are compared to those measured during cooling by using a newly developed laser scanning system devoted to high temperature measurements of complex-shaped parts just after the forging step and during all the cooling phases...|$|R

30|$|For {{thin-walled}} parts, uniform <b>allowance</b> to each <b>machining</b> {{surface is}} allocated {{by the traditional}} machining method. Considering the sequence of the adjacent machining features, it may cause poor stiffness for some side walls due to a minor wall thickness, which may cause the deformation of the final formed parts to be large, or deduce machining efficiency for some machining features due to too thick remains. In order to address this issue, a non-uniform allowance allocation method based on interim state stiffness of machining features for the finishing of thin-walled structural parts is proposed in this paper. In this method, the interim state model of machining features is constructed according to the machining sequence of the parts, and the stiffness of the side wall is taken as the evaluation index to allocate reasonable allowance value to the corresponding machining surface to ensure the stiffness requirement of the parts in the machining process.

Research of power consumption was conducted for turning the cylindrical surface of 144 mm length and  1, 5 33 0, 5   diameter on forgings of the work-pieces "screw of steering control" made from steel 60 PP. A radial dimension allowance at said cylindrical surface at six points of the five sections was sized to assess the allowance value dispersion. The size of the sample measurements at the control points was n = 600. Statistic processing has shown normal law of distribution and sample homogeneity. To analyze the results of experiments was calculated a range of allowances for this workpiece. Calculated minimum and maximum allowance per one side for rough lathing were, respectively, 0. 905 mm and 1. 905 mm. It was found that 77 % points under control lie in calculated range of allowance values. And there are no points out of the range on lesser side that proves a lack of rejects; but there are points out of the range on the bigger side, that will require additional costs for machining the specified surface, including the cost of electricity.
