30|$|Framing {{the design}} process by means of <b>material</b> <b>explorations</b> allows a {{designer}} to continuously try out new ideas, and thus expand the design space, or broad context of use (e.g., relaxation, protection, cocktail dress). However, it doesn’t support decision-making or depth. There is always a new context, a new application, a new idea that can alter the design. Moreover, the concepts remain in an early stage, a first answer to a challenge (e.g., what if it could…). In this approach, reasoning is driven by how ideas fit with materials at hand, making it imagined but not lived. This process is not uncommon in DIY communities where statements like wouldn’t it be cool to… exemplify a continuous search for the ‘next cool thing’. <b>Material</b> <b>explorations</b> {{for the sake of}} <b>material</b> <b>explorations</b> may thus avoid engaging in deep ways with personal meaning and societal value.|$|R

30|$|The {{design process}} for Open Up {{relied heavily on}} <b>material</b> <b>explorations</b> of {{mechanisms}} that can trigger movement: wind-catching nets, rods, and their attachment to the body through a garment. The principle design action throughout was <b>material</b> <b>explorations,</b> undertaken on a table, then transferred to the body. As each new idea emerged, the context of application {{and the role of}} the body shifted. Open Up began as a relaxation aid that allows the wearer to feel at one with the environment. When the context changed to walking in a city, the wearable’s use transformed into visualizing the distance between the wearer and others. Finally, visualizing distance was used to create a dramatic entrance effect in parties when approaching the crowd.|$|R

30|$|Following, we describe, {{analyze and}} reflect on material, body and context {{relations}} in soft wearable design through three projects developed during the Close to the Body project, a 2013 collaboration between ESDI, 1 IAAC 2 and TU/e. 3 In Close to the Body, four multidisciplinary groups of design students spanning architecture, fashion and interaction design worked together to develop three iterations of designs using identical brief, process, facilities and skills. Ideation, <b>material</b> <b>exploration,</b> and prototyping was different in each case. We highlight three designs: Open Up, Sound Embracers and Trailblazer. To facilitate reflection on how collocated interactions might further enrich situated and performative meaning-making with soft wearables, {{we focus on the}} role of <b>material</b> <b>explorations,</b> the body and context in each design process. Using three iterations of each wearable to represent 3 moments in unfolding time, we reflect on the changes that occur in the relations between material, body and context as different foci are foregrounded.|$|R
