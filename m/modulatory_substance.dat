40|$|Terpenoids {{are major}} {{subcomponents}} in aroma substances which harbor sedative physiological potential. We {{have demonstrated that}} various monoterpenoids such as the acyclic linalool enhance GABAergic currents in an allosteric manner in vitro upon overexpression of inhibitory α 1 β 2 GABAA receptors in various expression systems. However, in plants or humans, i. e., following intake via inhalation or ingestion, linalool undergoes metabolic modifications including oxygenation and acetylation, which may affect the modulatory efficacy of the generated linalool derivatives. Here, we analyzed the modulatory potential of linalool derivatives at α 1 β 2 γ 2 GABAA receptors upon transient overexpression. Following receptor expression control, electrophysiological recordings in a whole cell configuration {{were used to determine}} the chloride influx upon co-application of GABA EC 10 − 30 together with the <b>modulatory</b> <b>substance.</b> Our results show that only oxygenated linalool metabolites at carbon 8 positively affect GABAergic currents whereas derivatives hydroxylated or carboxylated at carbon 8 were rather ineffective. Acetylated linalool derivatives resulted in non-significant changes of GABAergic currents. We can conclude that metabolism of linalool reduces its positive allosteric potential at GABAA receptors compared to the significant potentiation effects of the parent molecule linalool itself...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{octopamine}} (OA) in {{the feeding}} {{system of the}} pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, was studied by applying behavioural tests on intact animals, and a combination of electrophysiological analysis and morphological labelling in the isolated central nervous system. OA antagonists phentolamine, demethylchlordimeform (DCDM) and 2 -chloro- 4 -methyl- 2 -(phenylimino) -imidazolidine (NC- 7) were injected into intact snails and the sucrose-induced feeding response of animals was monitored. Snails that received 25 to 50 mg kg- 1 phentolamine did not start feeding in sucrose, and the same dose of NC- 7 {{reduced the number of}} feeding animals by 80 to 90 % 1 to 3 hours after injection. DCDM treatment reduced feeding by 20 to 60 %. In addition, both phentolamine and NC- 7 significantly decreased the feeding rate of those animals that still accepted food after 1 to 6 hours of injection. In the central nervous system a pair of buccal neurons was identified by electrophysiological and morphological criteria. After double labelling (intracellular staining with Lucifer yellow followed by OA-immunocytochemistry) these neurons were shown to be OA immunoreactive, and electrophysiological experiments confirmed that they are members of the buccal feeding system. Therefore the newly identified buccal neurons were called OC neurons (putative octopamine containing neurons or octopaminergic cells). Synchronous intracellular recordings demonstrated that the OC neurons share a common rhythm with feeding neurons either appearing spontaneously or evoked by intracellularly stimulated feeding interneurons. OC neurons also have synaptic connections with identified members of the feeding network: electrical coupling was demonstrated between OC neurons and members of the B 4 cluster motoneurons, furthermore, chemically transmitted synaptic responses were recorded both on feeding motoneurons (B 1, B 2 cells) and the SO modulatory interneuron after the stimulation of OC neurons. However, elementary synaptic potentials could not be recorded on the follower cells of OC neurons. Prolonged (20 to 30 s) intracellular stimulation of OC cells activated the buccal feeding neurons leading to rhythmic activity pattern (fictive feeding) in a way similar to OA applied by perfusion onto isolated central nervous system (CNS) preparations. Our results suggest that OA acts as a <b>modulatory</b> <b>substance</b> in the feeding system of Lymnaea stagnalis and the newly identified pair of OC neurons belongs to the buccal feeding network...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} for all living cells to sense {{and interact with}} their environment is a necessity for life. In highly evolved, eukaryotic species, like humans, signalling mechanisms are necessary to regulate the function and survival of all cells in the organism. Synchronizing systemic signalling systems at the cellular, organ and whole-organism level is a formidable task, and for most species requires {{a large number of}} signalling molecules and their receptors. One of the major types of signalling molecules used throughout the animal kingdom are <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances</b> (e. x. hormones and peptides). Modulators can act as chemical transmitters, facilitating communication at chemical synapses. There are hundreds of circulating modulators within the mammalian system, but the reason for so many remains a mystery. Recent work with the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster demonstrated the {{capacity for}} peptides to modulate synaptic transmission in a neuron-specific manner, suggesting that peptides are not simply redundant, but rather may have highly specific roles. Thus, the diversity of peptides may reflect cell-specific functions. The main objective of my doctoral thesis was to examine the extent to which neuromodulator substances and their receptors modulate synaptic transmission at a cell-specific level using D. melanogaster. Using three different <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances,</b> i) octopamine - a biogenic amine released from motor neuron terminals, ii) DPKQDFMRFa - a neuropeptide secreted into circulation, and iii) Proctolin - a pentapeptide released both from motor neuron terminals and into circulation, I was able to investigate not only the capacity of these various substances to work in a cell-selective manner, but also examine the different mechanisms of action and how <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances</b> work in concert to execute systemic functionality. The results support the idea that <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances</b> act in a circuit-selective manner in the central nervous system and in the periphery in order to coordinate and synchronize physiologically and behaviourally relevant outputs. The findings contribute as to why the nervous system encodes so many <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{diseases}} of the brain, the distribution and properties of ion channels display deviations from healthy control subjects. We studied two cases of ion channel alterations related to epileptogenesis. The first case of ion channel alteration represents an enhanced sodium current, the second case addresses the run down of conductance of the transient potassium current, K A. In previous studies we have shown that K A reduce highly synchronized synaptic input while minimally affect semi-synchronized input (1). The K A channel may therefore function as a protective mechanism against synchronous input involved in seizures. In this study we investigate if <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances</b> which targets the KA can functionally corrected the two pathological models...|$|R
40|$|Two of {{the many}} agendas of neuroethology are {{illustrated}} with examples. (1) What cells or assemblies of cells and what patterns of activity are sufficient to accomplish recognition of ethologically important stimulus configurations and initiation of behavioral action? The theme is the opportunities available in relatively neglected approaches to these objectives. As an example, the approach is developed of gentle microstimulation of loci in the brain where cells have been found responsive to complex, natural stimuli, under conditions conducive {{to the performance of}} tell-tale behavior. Other approaches include (a) microinjection of <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances</b> into regions with such complex recognition cells and (b) recording in efficient and informative ways, by using multiple electrode arrays, recording wideband activity, in behaving animals. (2) What brain and behavior differences has evolution produced between major taxa at distinct grades of complexity? Emphasized are our relative ignorance of basic aspects of connectivity, physiology and cognitive capacities in the major grades and the probability of surprises from new studies that employ comparison...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{malignant}} cells {{to escape the}} constraint that normally regulate cell growth and differentiation has been a primary focus of attention for investigators of cancer cell biology. An outcome of this attention has been the discovery that the protein products of oncogenes {{play a role in}} the activation of growth signal pathways. A second outcome, possibly related to abnormal oncogene expression, has been the discovery that malignant cells frequently show an ability to regulate their own growth by the release of autocrine growth <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances.</b> Most important, the growth of certain malignant cell types has been shown to depend on autocrine growth circuits. A malignant tumor whose continued growth depends on the release of an autocrine growth factor may be vulnerable to treatment with specific receptor antagonists or immunoneutralizing antibodies designed to break the autocrine circuit. Information is rapidly emerging concerning autocrine growth factors in selected human solid tissue malignancy...|$|R
40|$|Breathing is {{a rhythmic}} {{behavior}} that requires organized contractions of respiratory effector muscles. This behavior must adapt to constantly changing conditions {{in order to}} ensure homeostasis, proper body oxygenation, and CO 2 /pH regulation. Respiratory rhythmogenesis is controlled by neural networks located in the brainstem. One area considered to be essential for generating the inspiratory phase of the respiratory rhythm is the preBötzinger complex (preBötC). Rhythmogenesis emerges from this network through the interplay between the activation of intrinsic cellular properties (pacemaker properties) and intercellular synaptic connections. Respiratory activity continuously changes under the impact of numerous <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances</b> depending on organismal needs and environmental conditions. The preBötC network has been shown to become active during the last third of gestation. But only little is known regarding the modulation of inspiratory rhythmicity at embryonic stages and even less on a possible role of pacemaker neurons in this functional flexibility during the prenatal period. By combining electrophysiology and calcium imaging performed on embryonic brainstem slice preparations, we provide evidence showing that embryonic inspiratory pacemaker neurons are already intrinsically sensitive to neuromodulation and external conditions (i. e., temperature) affecting respiratory network activity, suggesting a potential role of pacemaker neurons in mediating rhythm adaptation to modulatory stimuli in the embryo...|$|R
40|$|Rhythmic motor {{patterns}} in invertebrates are often driven by specialized “central pattern generators” (CPGs), containing {{small numbers of}} neurons, which {{are likely to be}} “identifiable” in one individual compared with another. The dynamics of any particular CPG lies under the control of <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances,</b> amines, or peptides, entering the CPG from outside it, or released by internal constituent neurons; consequently, a particular CPG can generate a given rhythm at different frequencies and amplitudes, and perhaps even generate a repertoire of distinctive patterns. The mechanisms exploited by neuromodulators in this respect are manifold: Intrinsic conductances (e. g., calcium, potassium channels), conductance state of postsynaptic receptors, degree of plasticity, and magnitude and kinetics of transmitter release can all be affected. The CPG concept has been generalized to vertebrate motor pattern generating circuits (e. g., for locomotion), which may contain large numbers of neurons – a construct that is sensible, if there is enough redundancy: that is, the large number of neurons consists of {{only a small number of}} classes, and the cells within any one class act stereotypically. Here we suggest that CPG and modulator ideas may also help to understand cortical oscillations, normal ones, and particularly transition to epileptiform pathology. Furthermore, in the case illustrated, the mechanism of the transition appears to be an exaggerated form of a normal modulatory action used to influence sensory processing...|$|R
40|$|Chronic pain {{is common}} in western {{countries}} and entails considerable consequences for the afflicted individuals {{as well as for}} the society. Furthermore, chronic pain is complex including an advanced interplay between biological-, psychological- and social aspects. Treatment of chronic pain attempts to decrease pain intensity and increase physical-, psychological- and social functioning. However, the treatment of chronic pain is still not optimized. Different types of physical activity and exercise (PA&E) are commonly applied as non-pharmacological treatment strategies for chronic pain, but the most efficient type and dose of PA&E are unclear. In addition, adherence to prescribed PA&E is often troublesome, which further complicates the application of PA&E as treatment for chronic pain. The aim of this thesis is to increase the knowledge about PA&E as treatment for chronic pain regarding pain intensity, biochemical substances, adherence and attitudes. The findings of this thesis were that a long-term, home-based PA&E intervention comprising strength exercises as well as stretch exercises decreased pain intensity and increased function in women with chronic neck- and shoulder pain. Using microdialysis technique, differences in pain <b>modulatory</b> biochemical <b>substances</b> were found, before the intervention, in painful trapezius muscle compared to pain-free trapezius muscle. In addition, alterations in pain <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances</b> in painful trapezius muscle after the intervention were found, which possibly could imply peripheral physiological effects of PA&E. Furthermore, psychological factors could be associated to the effects of and adherence to the PA&E intervention. An intention to be physically active were expressed by patients with chronic pain, but a discordance between the intention and PA&E-behaviour were evident, even though the PA&E were experienced as valuable. In conclusion, this thesis strengthens the importance of PA&E as treatment for chronic pain. Especially, this thesis increases the knowledge about; possible peripheral pain inhibitory effects after long-term exercise; how psychological factors might affect the results of PA&E; and also about important behavioural aspects that might affect adherence to prescribed PA&E. This thesis highlights the need of more research on physiological pain inhibitory effects of long-term PA&E in chronic pain. Furthermore, improved methods for ensured adherence to prescribed PA&E are necessary in order to optimize the effect of PA&E as treatment for chronic pain...|$|R
40|$|Neuroscience is {{progressing}} vigorously, {{and knowledge}} at different lev-els of description is rapidly accumulating. To establish relationships be-tween results found at these different levels {{is one of}} the central chal-lenges. In this simulation study, we demonstrate how microscopic cellu-lar properties, taking the example of the action of <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances</b> onto the membrane leakage current, can provide the basis for the percep-tual functions reected in the macroscopic behavior of a cortical network. In the rst part, the action of the modulatory system on cortical dynamics is investigated. First, it is demonstrated that the inclusion of these bio-physical properties in a model of the primary visual cortex leads to the dynamic formation of synchronously active neuronal assemblies reect-ing a context-dependent binding and segmentation of image components. Second, it is shown that the differential regulation of the leakage current can be used to bias the interactions of multiple cortical modules. This allows the exible use of different feature domains for scene segmenta-tion. Third, we demonstrate how, within the proposed architecture, the mapping of a moving stimulus onto the spatial dimension of the network results in an increased speed of synchronization. In the second part, we demonstrate how the differential regulation of neuromodulatory activity can be achieved in a self-consistent system. Three different mechanisms are described and investigated. This study thus demonstrates how a mod-ulatory system, affecting the biophysical properties of single cells, can be used to achieve context-dependent processing at the system level. ...|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{release of}} <b>modulatory</b> <b>substances</b> {{provides}} motor pattern generating circuits {{with a high}} degree of flexibility. In vitro studies have characterized the actions of modulatory projection neurons in great detail in the stomatogastric nervous system, a model system for neuromodulatory influences on central pattern generators. Less is known about the activities and actions of modulatory neurons in fully functional and richly modulated network settings, i. e., in intact animals. It is also unknown whether their activities contribute to the motor patterns in different behavioral conditions. Here, we show for the first time the activity and effects of the well-characterized modulatory projection neuron 1 (MCN 1) in vivo and compare them to in vitro conditions. MCN 1 was always spontaneously active, typically in a rhythmic fashion with its firing being interrupted by ascending inhibitions from the pyloric motor circuit. Its activity contributed to pyloric motor activity, because 1) the cycle period of the motor pattern correlated with MCN 1 firing frequency and 2) stimulating MCN 1 shortened the cycle period while 3) lesioning of the MCN 1 axon reduced motor activity. In addition, gastric mill motor activity was elicited for the duration of the stimulation. Chemosensory stimulation of the antennae moved MCN 1 away from baseline activity by increasing its firing frequency. Following this increase, a gastric mill rhythm was elicited and the pyloric cycle period decreased. Lesioning the MCN 1 axon prevented these effects. Thus modulatory projection neurons such as MCN 1 can control the motor output in vivo, and they participate in the processing of exteroceptive sensory information in behaviorally relevant conditions...|$|R
40|$|Patch clamp {{recording}} (whole cell configuration) {{was employed}} to investigate the <b>modulatory</b> action of <b>substance</b> P on inward currents elicited by adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP, focally applied via a pressure pipette) from phaechromocytoma (PC 12) cells usually held at − 70 [*]mV. Bath-applied substance P (0. 2 – 20 [*]μM) {{had no effect on}} baseline membrane current but reversibly reduced ATP peak currents in a concentration-dependent fashion. The depressant effect was not associated with a change in the ATP current reversal potential. Equiamplitude peak responses induced by 50 [*]μM or 5 [*]mM ATP were differentially affected by substance P which preferentially reduced currents evoked by 5 [*]mM ATP. In the presence of substance P a conditioning pulse of ATP evoked a stronger depression to subsequent test pulses of the same agonist. Combined patch clamping and confocal laser imaging of intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) of single PC 12 cells showed that substance P (applied by a pressure pipette) per se had no effect on [Ca 2 +]i or current baseline, although it reduced the inward current and associated [Ca 2 +]i rise elicited by ATP. These results are interpreted as due to facilitation by substance P of desensitization of ATP-gated P 2 X 2 receptors of PC 12 cells. It is proposed that the novel modulation by this peptide of ATP responses may {{serve as a model for}} further studies aimed at elucidating the action of substance P on purinergic neurotransmission...|$|R
40|$|Methamphetamine {{is gaining}} {{mainstream}} popularity across the United States {{at the same}} time that lead exposure remains at elevated levels. Perinatal (gestation/lactation) lead exposure has been found to modify the reward efficacy of various drugs of abuse (e. g., cocaine, opiates) across the phases of initial selection, use, and abuse. Lead-induced changes in sensitivity to methamphetamine have not been examined in animals perinatally exposed to lead. Accordingly, four studies were conducted to examine the effects of perinatal lead exposure on adult self-administration of intravenous (i. v.) methamphetamine across all relevant transition points of drug addiction. Adult female rats were administered a 16 -mg lead or a control solution for 30 days prior to breeding with non-exposed males. Exposure continued through pregnancy and lactation and was discontinued at weaning (postnatal day [PND] 21). Animals born to control or lead-exposed dams received indwelling jugular catheters as adults (PND 60 and PND 90) and subsequently were randomly assigned to one of the four studies mentioned above, using only one male rat per litter for each study. In Experiment 1, an acquisition study revealed that perinatal exposure to environmentally relevant levels of lead resulted in a smaller percentage of rats reaching the criterion for intravenous (i. v.) methamphetamine (. 02 mg/kg) acquisition, relative to non-exposed controls. In Experiment 2, a dose-effect curve yielded a biphasic pattern of attenuation of the self-administration of methamphetamine (. 04 mg/kg) in lead-exposed animals. In Experiment 3, lead-exposed animals reached lower breaking points for methamphetamine (. 04 mg/kg) in a progressive ratio task, in comparison to control animals. Finally in Experiment 4, a reinstatement study revealed that perinatally leadexposed animals showed a decreased propensity to relapse to methamphetamine (. 04 mg/kg) self-administration after a period of forced abstinence. The general attenuation to the rewarding efficacy of methamphetamine observed in animals perinatally exposed to lead may functionally translate into a form of tolerance or counteradaptation. The data collected from these four studies further strengthen the possibility that pollutants in the environment may play a <b>modulatory</b> role in <b>substance</b> abuse...|$|R
