Häkkinen {{said that he was}} [...] "pleased" [...] to win the race and admitted that he waited until the pit stop phase to have any chance of overtaking Michael Schumacher. He said that his team had <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> on his car and was looking forward to the next race. Coulthard believed he made the right decision to compete in the Grand Prix despite his injuries and that the result was [...] "the best thing that could have happened for the team and myself." [...] He also said he was looking forward to resting over the coming days to allow his injuries to heal. Barrichello admitted that the race had not been good for him until his overtake on Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher and said the absence of Stepney caused his second pit stop to be slower than usual.|$|E

We face a challenging new security environment, including hybrid warfare, cyber attacks, the threat of terrorism. NATO has responded with determination to the new security situation.

2500|$|On 9 December 2010, Huhne {{represented}} the United Kingdom at the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The gathering, at which over 190 countries were represented, announced {{a deal to}} curb climate change which Prime Minister David Cameron described as a [...] "very significant step forward." [...] The agreement struck in Mexico included a recognition that deeper cuts in carbon emissions were needed and that a fund should be set up to help developing countries reduce their carbon emissions. Huhne described the deal as a [...] "serious package" [...] of measures but acknowledged that there was still <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> prior to the next climate change meeting in Durban, South Africa, the following year. Following the conference, David Cameron said that his government would be the [...] "greenest ever" [...] and that Britain would meet its international obligations regarding climate change.|$|E

2500|$|Performance and {{continuity}} calls: The existing contract stated that stagehands could only perform work {{related to the}} performance during a performance call. If the producer wishes the stagehand to perform other duties, the producer must issue a one-hour [...] "continuity call," [...] even if the stagehand has no <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> If the one-hour continuity call is not long enough, producers are required {{to pay for a}} four-hour shift. Producers call the rule wasteful, but the union claimed the rule discouraged theaters from forcing employees to work past midnight. The union also noted that many stagehands supplement their income with daytime jobs, and late nights significantly interfere with these arrangements. Producers proposed widening the tasks stagehands may perform during performance calls and reducing the required four hours of pay. The union had agreed to discuss reducing the required four hours of pay in exchange for improving other benefits.|$|E
2500|$|Lawton {{struggled}} early {{during the}} 1998 season, but started playing better through the mid-season. On May 9, Lawton hit {{a grand slam}} against the New York Yankees, which led the Twins to an 8–1 victory. Late into the season, Twins manager Tom Kelly commented that Lawton had improved well over the season, but still had <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before he would become a [...] "winning player". On September 1, Lawton hit a game-winning triple against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays {{in the bottom of}} the tenth inning. At season's end, Lawton compiled a [...]278 batting average with 91 runs scored, 155 hits, 36 doubles, six triples, 21 home runs, 77 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases in 152 games played. On defense, he played 100 games in right field, 47 in center field, and 12 in left field. He committed four errors; and made 12 assists, and 389 putouts as an outfielder. Amongst American League (AL) hitters that year, Lawton was tied for fourth in hit by pitches (15); ninth in walks (86), tenth in on-base percentage (.387), and tied for tenth in triples.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 September, Bishop Jo Seoka of the South African Council of Churches, who was {{mediating}} {{a resolution}} to the conflict, announced that the striking miners had accepted a 22% pay raise, a one-off payment of R2,000, and would return to work 20 September. However, the National Union of Mineworkers, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union and the Solidarity union did not make any statements {{in response to this}} offer. While miners' representative Zolisa Bodlani said of the deal that [...] "it's a huge achievement. No union has achieved a 22% increase before," [...] Lonmin's Sue Vey said it would offer no comment as the agreement had not yet been signed. However, Chris Molebatsi, who {{was a part of the}} organising committee for the strike, said: [...] "The campaign will go on. This campaign is aimed at helping workers. People died here at Marikana. Something needs to be done. This is a campaign to ensure justice for the people of Marikana. We want the culprits to be brought to book, and it is crucial that justice is seen to be done here. It is our duty and the duty of this country to ensure justice is served, so that we can make sure this country is a democracy and to stop South Africa from going down the drain." [...] He also added that the Marikana Solidarity Campaign has <b>more</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in terms of supporting victims' families, offering PTSD counselling and to oversight the state-appointed judicial commission that would ensure justice after the violence; he also noted that: ...|$|E

60|$|What {{follows is}} worth consideration.

There the connecting-rod jammed. Meantime, the after-engine, being as yet unembarrassed, went on with its work, and in so doing brought round at its next revolution the crank of the forward engine, which smote the already jammed connecting-rod, bending it and therewith the piston-rod cross-head- the big cross-piece that slides up and down so smoothly.|$|E
