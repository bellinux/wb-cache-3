A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the BBC, confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members. The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which <b>made</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> the sledge weights and the chill more severely.|$|E
25|$|Until {{their first}} act of sexual intercourse, {{adolescents}} generally see virginity {{in one of}} the following ways: as a gift, a stigma, or a normal step in development. Girls typically think of virginity as a gift, while boys think of virginity as a stigma. In interviews, girls said that they viewed giving someone their virginity as like giving them a very special gift. Because of this, they often expected something in return such as increased emotional intimacy with their partners or the virginity of their partner. However, they often felt disempowered because of this; they often did not feel like they actually received what they expected in return and this <b>made</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> like they had less power in their relationship. They felt that they had given something up and did not feel like this action was recognized.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to these results, an uncontrolled clinical trial was carried out at the Petrov Research Institute of Oncology in St. Petersburg {{over a period of}} 17 years, and a controlled trial was carried out at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in California over period of 10 years, respectively. The Russian trial reported complete tumor regression in about 1% of cases, a partial response in about 3% of cases and some subjective improvement of symptoms in about half of the patients. The National Cancer Institute analysis of this trial notes that interpretation of these data is difficult, due to the absence of controls, the lack of information on prior treatment and the study's reliance on subjective assessments of symptoms (i.e. asking patients if the drug had <b>made</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> any better). Overall, the trials in California saw no statistically significant effect on survival from hydrazine sulfate treatment, but noted increased calorie intake in treated patients versus controls. The authors also performed a post-hoc analysis on one or more subgroups of these patients, which they reported as suggesting a beneficial effect from treatment. The design and interpretation of this trial, and in particular the validity of this subgroup analysis, was criticized in detail in an editorial in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.|$|E

Gothel's [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] line [...] "Getting kind of chubby" [...] was in fact borrowed from one of these interviews.

AllMusic journalist Eduardo Rivadavia described the album's sound: [...] "The record's songs—already shorter and more focused than those of its epic-filled predecessor—were absolutely buried under disfiguring cobwebs of fuzzy amp distortion that effectively <b>made</b> <b>them</b> sound and <b>feel</b> like third-generation cassette copies".|$|R
50|$|Fundamental to this {{exponential}} expansion was {{the general}} attitude of the main politicians to drop support for minor politicians who got caught; this <b>made</b> many of <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> betrayed, and they often implicated many other politicians, who in turn would implicate even more. On 2 September 1992, the Socialist politician Sergio Moroni, charged with corruption, committed suicide. He left a letter pleading guilty, declaring that crimes were not for his personal gain but for the party's benefit, and accused the financing system of all parties.|$|R

The implication that his visit might remain as a secret between <b>them</b> <b>made</b> <b>them</b> both <b>feel</b> it differently.

[...] Not all reviews were positive. Some critics considered the photography style of jump cuts and hand-held camera movement too jarring; some said it <b>made</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> seasick. James Endrst, television columnist for The Hartford Courant, felt the episode was over-hyped and said [...] "seen it, done it, been there before" [...] of the filming techniques otherwise being praised as cutting edge. Endrst, however, praised the performances of Braugher, Belzer, Polito and Secor in particular. Time reviewer Richard Zoglin said the episode had a strong cast and that he appreciated the lack of two-dimensional violence, but said, [...] "the characters are too pat, their conflicts too predictable", particularly the rookie character Bayliss.|$|E

Lennon recalled, [...] "The waiters always had these pills , so when they saw the musicians falling over with tiredness or drink, they'd give you the pill. You could work almost endlessly until the pill wore off, and then you'd have another." [...] McCartney said that he would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five.|$|E

Later, they kiss in a church, and a court trial follows, during which the school district promises to update their policies. Jace testifies he will never play college football because of muscle damage sustained in the knife fight, and that he's ready to move on with his life and go to a state college.

Well, then, coming home by Drinker's Alley {{to get a new}} shirt which a French Vicomte's lady was washing to take the stiff out of (I'm always choice in my body-linen) a lame Frenchman pushes a paper of buttons at us. He hadn't long landed in the United States, and please would we buy. He sure-ly was a pitiful scrattel--his coat half torn off, his face cut, but his hands steady; so I knew it wasn't drink. He said his name was Peringuey, and he'd been knocked about in the crowd round the Stadt--Independence Hall. One thing leading to another we took him up to Toby's rooms, same as Red Jacket had taken me the year before. The {{compliments}} he paid to Toby's Madeira wine fairly conquered the old man, for he opened a second bottle and he told this Monsieur Peringuey all about our great stove dispute in the church. I remember Pastor Meder and Brother Adam Goos dropped 'in, and although they and Toby were direct opposite sides regarding stoves, yet this Monsieur Peringuey he <b>made</b> <b>'em</b> <b>feel</b> as if he thought each one was in the right of it. He said he had been a clergyman before he had to leave France. He admired at Toby's fiddling, and he asked if Red Jacket, sitting by the spinet, was a simple Huron. Senecas aren't Hurons, they're Iroquois, of course, and Toby told him so. Well, then, in due time he arose and left in a style which made us feel he'd been favouring us, instead of us feeding him. I've never seen that so strong before--in a man. We all talked him over but couldn't make head or tail of him, and Red Jacket come out to walk with me to the French quarter where I was due to fiddle at a party. Passing Drinker's Alley again we saw a naked window with a light in it, and there sat our button-selling Monsieur Peringuey throwing dice all alone, right hand against left.|$|R

500|$|The {{overwhelming}} sentiment {{expressed by}} multiple reviewers {{was that the}} remade game executed admirably on traditional MMORPG features and succeeded at addressing {{the failures of the}} original version. For Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot, this steadfast implementation of genre fundamentals was his greatest criticism—that [...] "it does not leap over the shoulders of the games that have come before". However, he was quick to praise the quality of the game's writing, a feature highlighted by a number of other critics. USgamer's Pete Davison was particularly enamored by the story and commended the responsiveness of non-player characters to the player's actions as an effective method of worldbuilding. Many reviewers enjoyed the ability to play as multiple classes on a single character, a feature retained from the original release. Davison remarked that the differing mechanics of each class <b>made</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> unique in their gameplay styles. Daniel Tack of Forbes magazine singled out the crafting minigame as [...] "one of the most interesting and compelling" [...] aspects of the game.|$|E
500|$|Queen Elizabeth {{had been}} widowed for {{only three years}} when Gilliat entered her service at her London {{residence}} of Clarence House, his obituary in The Independent credited him with helping her carve out a new role for herself and described his attitude: Like her, he took a genuine interest in the lives and doings of all with whom he came into contact and <b>made</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> that they were important to him. He made no distinction between old and young, rich and poor, high and low, white and coloured. He thought the best of everyone [...] someone said of him, 'All Martin's geese are swans' [...] and treated them all alike. Gilliat was an expert at 'breaking the ice' between nervous guests and the Queen at her parties.

500|$|When {{the episode}} was {{originally}} broadcast, {{there was a}} strong negative reaction from some viewers. As Deep Space Nine was shown in syndication, one channel in the Southern United States took the step of editing out the kiss from the initial broadcast.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this essay {{was to provide a}} better {{understanding}} of the importance of discretion for social workers in direct social services. To answer the purpose three questions were formulated: (1) How do social workers define and describe their discretion and their ability to independently accomplish their work? (2) How do social workers experience that workplace organization, policies and economic conditions interact with their discretion and (3) How do social workers experience that the interaction with the client can affect how they use their discretion in the individual case? The method used was qualitative interviews. The theoretical framework was Michael Lipskys (1980) Street-level bureaucracy and the four themes organization, professional role, skills and interaction. The results showed that the respondents, although they did not consider themselves to be affected by the economy still adapted to budget restrictions when they said that they were cost conscious in their work. This adjustment to budget framework could possibly be what <b>made</b> <b>them</b> not <b>feel</b> limited in their work. The organization around the direct social work varied, in spite of this showed the result a broad consensus in the experiences of discretion in direct social work...|$|R

40|$|Background: Every year, in Sweden, 250 {{children}} and adolescents below 15 years of age are diagnosed with cancer. Over 75 % of those diagnosed are cured. Cancer affects not only the child but the whole family. Siblings of the affected child can easily suffer {{from a lack of}} attention. Aim: This study aimed to illuminate siblings' experiences of living in a family with a child affected by cancer. Method: A literature-based study based on nine qualitative studies. Results: The result showed that it was important for siblings to have someone close and not be alone, they needed to feel a community. Not to know and not to understand what has happened <b>made</b> <b>them</b> to <b>feel</b> grief, fear, stress and jealousy. Many siblings felt an insecurity because of a feeling of being forgotten, neglected and a feeling of loneliness due to the changes in everyday life. Conclusion: Parents to a child with cancer have often prioritized the sick child and the needs of the siblings, are left aside. Because the siblings often get sidelined they feel an insecurity when their everyday living get different. If the siblings get a positive experience from this period of illness, this may lead to a positive experience in life which make it easier to process what was happened...|$|R

The Beatles had taken Preludin before, but it was possible at that time to get Preludin only with a doctor's prescription note, so Kirchherr's mother got them from a local chemist, who supplied them without asking questions. After meeting Kirchherr, Lennon filled his letters to Cynthia Powell (his girlfriend at the time) with [...] "Astrid said this, Astrid did that", which made Powell jealous, until she read that Sutcliffe was in a relationship with Kirchherr. When Powell visited Hamburg with Dot Rhone (McCartney's girlfriend at the time) in April 1961, they stayed at Kirchherr's house. In August 1963, Kirchherr met Lennon and Cynthia in Paris while they were both there for a belated honeymoon, as Kirchherr was there with a girlfriend for a few days' holiday. The four of them went from wine bar to wine bar and finally ended up back at Kirchherr's lodgings, where all four fell asleep on Kirchherr's single bed.|$|E
500|$|The {{experience}} with King, despite only {{resulting in the}} completion of one track, [...] "Bad Boyfriend", gave the band perspective and direction. Manson said that because the band members still had problems speaking to each other, King could not get much work out of the band, so they realized {{that they needed to}} work out their differences and was the catalyst for the band getting back together and working harmoniously. Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become [...] "burned out on each other", and that reuniting <b>made</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> able to play [...] "...fast and furiousas if our lives depended on it". Manson overcame her writer's block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics, matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions; both [...] "Metal Heart" [...] and [...] "Boys Wanna Fight" [...] referenced the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite a plan to record some material with producer Tony Hoffer, the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves. Erikson later said, [...] "It was kind of seductive to think that maybe someone else [...] solve all of our problems, but in the end you gotta do it yourself".|$|E

He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published, including a headline in The Sun describing Jefferies– a former schoolmaster at Clifton College– as weird, posh, lewd and creepy; a story from the Daily Express quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as [...] "... a sort of Nutty Professor" [...] who <b>made</b> <b>them</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "creeped out" [...] by his [...] "strange" [...] behaviour; and an article from the Daily Telegraph, which reported Jefferies [...] "has been described by pupils at Clifton College ... as a fan of dark and violent avant-garde films". Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 April– The Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Daily Star, the Daily Express, the Daily Mail and the Daily Record– seeking damages for libel. It was held that the media were quick to jump to conclusions regarding Jefferies' arrest. Being a retired English teacher who lived alone, whose physical appearance and [...] "eccentrically unkempt white hair," [...] made him stand out, led people to believe that he looked the type.

Sudden stabs of the unmitigated truth assailed him now and then, for he was not inclined by nature to take a rosy view of his conduct, but what with the beat of his foot upon the pavement, and the glimpse which half-drawn curtains offered him of kitchens, dining-rooms, and drawing-rooms, illustrating with mute power different scenes from different lives, his own experience lost its sharpness.|$|R
