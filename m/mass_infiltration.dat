40|$|International audienceThe present article {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} and numerical investigation {{of heat and}} <b>mass</b> <b>infiltration</b> rates during {{the opening of a}} refrigerated truck body. Experiments were carried out for different temperatures and different aperture ratios. The infiltration dynamics was found to involve two distinct phenomena: a buoyancy driven flow and a boundary layer flow. The first is a density-driven flow which gives birth to an important heat load peak. The second phenomenon is due to quasi steady-state natural convection over the inner wall of the truck. In the present work, the infiltration phenomenon was first analysed by means of a computational fluid dynamics model. The infiltration flow rate is well predicted except at the transition between both flow regimes. An analytical model using the ideal flow theory was also developed to model the buoyancy driven flow. The natural convection boundary layer flow is then well predicted using a classical method...|$|E
30|$|An urgent {{examination}} under anaesthesia (EUA) {{showed that}} the growth had completely replaced the cervix without any identifiable cervical canal. Hysteroscopy was attempted, but was unsuccessful as no cervical opening was found. The growth was very friable and foul-smelling. Bimanually, a normal-sized, freely mobile uterus was felt without any evidence of adenexal <b>mass,</b> <b>infiltration</b> or fistula. A rectal examination was normal. The patient bled profusely during the examination. A biopsy was taken and the vagina was packed to stop bleeding. An ultrasound scan showed a fairly well-defined solid heterogenous mass, possibly uterine, arising out of the pelvis (7.8 × 9.7 × 6.7  cm). There were a few small cystic areas within the mass. Neither ovary was seen. There was no free fluid or para-aortic lymph node enlargement. The gall bladder, kidneys and spleen were unremarkable and the liver looked rather bright, but no focal lesions were noted. Histological examination of biopsy showed evidence of a malignant mixed mullerian tumour (carcino-sarcoma) of uterine origin. Systemic antibiotics were given. An attempt to correct her anaemia with repeated blood transfusion was ineffective as she continued to bleed heavily.|$|E

40|$|Myeloid sarcoma (MS) of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) is a rare {{presentation}} of leukemic <b>mass</b> <b>infiltration</b> outside of the bone marrow. It may involve the subperiosteum and dura mater and, on rare occasions, can also invade the brain parenchyma. The disease is most commonly seen in children or young adults; however, it has been described in multiple age groups. MS can be seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia and other myeloproliferative disorders. This entity {{has the potential to be}} underdiagnosed if the MS appearance precedes the first diagnosis of leukemia. The main reason is that their appearance on CT and MRI has a broad differential diagnosis, and proper diagnosis of MS can only be made if the imaging findings are correlated with the clinical history and laboratory findings. Herein, we describe the intracranial CNS manifestations of MS in patients with AML on CT and MRI involving the brain and/or meninges. This study is based on a systematic review of the literature. In addition, three case reports from the author’s institution with AML and intracranial involvement of MS are included.

40|$|In atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD), topical anti-inflammatory therapy with skin barrier restoration to prevent repeated inflammatory episodes leads to long-term therapeutic success. Tacrolimus, although effective against AD, is a challenging molecule due to low solubility, low-penetration, poor-bioavailability, and toxicity. Part I of this paper, reported novel modified nanolipid carrier system for topical delivery of tacrolimus (T-MNLC), offering {{great opportunity to}} load low-solubility drug with improved entrapment efficiency, enhanced stability and improved skin deposition. Present investigation focused on restoration of skin barrier, site-specific delivery, therapeutic effectiveness, and safety of novel T-MNLC. T-MNLC greatly enhanced occlusive properties, skin hydration potential and reduced transepidermal water loss. This might help {{to reduce the number}} of flares and better control the disease. Cutaneous uptake and drug deposition in albino rats by HPLC and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed prominently elevated drug levels in all skin strata with T-MNLC as compared to reference. T-MNLC demonstrated efficient suppression of inflammatory responses in BALB/c mice model of AD. Safety assessment by acute and repeated-dose dermal toxicity demonstrated mild keratosis and collagenous <b>mass</b> <b>infiltration</b> at the treatment area with repeated application of reference. Interestingly, T-MNLC showed no evident toxicity exhibiting safe drug delivery. Thus, novel T-MNLC would be a safe, effective, and esthetically appealing alternative to conventional vehicles for treatment for AD...|$|E
40|$|Primary renal lymphomas {{are very}} rare. However, the kidney {{may be a}} site of metastasis, usually from a disseminated {{aggressive}} lymphoma. A 58 -year-old woman {{was brought to the}} medical facility due to acute mental confusion, severe hypotension, septic shock, and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Laboratory tests showed severe leukopenia, renal failure, altered liver function, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Protein electrophoresis revealed hypergammaglobulinemia with a monoclonal peak of IgG lambda. The clinical outcome was fulminant and the patient died less than 24 hours after admission. Autopsy revealed an indolent B-cell lymphoma with extensive plasmacytic differentiation infiltrating the right renal sinus and involving the submandibular and sublingual glands, cervical and peri-aortic lymph nodes, multiple microscopic foci in pituitary and adrenal glands, lung, breast, liver, thyroid, and bone marrow. Numerous IgG 4 -positive plasma cells were detected by immunohistochemistry although other histological features of IgG 4 -related disease were missing. There was also extensive hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenal glands and purulent cystitis, which was probably responsible for the septic shock. The authors concluded that the kidney was most likely the primary site of the indolent lymphoma, as that was the site with the largest tumor <b>mass.</b> <b>Infiltration</b> of other organs was considered as dissemination of the disease.

40|$|Neste trabalho são apresentados os valores da velocidade de infiltração, obtidos com os dados de perdas por erosão dos talhões de comprimento de rampa, da Estação Experimental de Conservação do Solo, em Clarinda, Iowa, nos Estados Unidos. Usando os dados de intensidades de chuva e enxurrada, a velocidade de infiltração foi determinada pelo método gráfico de Sharp e Holtan para as 10 maiores chuvas, com apreciável enxurrada, que ocorreram durante um período de cinco anos. As 10 chuvas foram selecionadas com base na sua duração, intensidade e época do ano. Os problemas do cálculo da velocidade de infiltração com os dados de talhões de perdas por erosão e algumas das limitações dos valores determinados são apresentados. The Soil Conservation Experiment Station {{located near}} Clarinda, Iowa, was {{established}} in 1931 to study erosion problems on Marshall silt loam. One of the original experiment started in 1932 contained plots comparing slope lengths of 36. 3, 72. 6 and 145. 2 feet. These plots were 6 feet wide with an average land slope of 9 percent. The plots were planted to continuous corn. Originally provision was made only for measurement of total runoff and erosion. However, during the years 1938 to 1942, devices were installed for measurement of rates of runoff. Using rainfall intensity rates and runoff rate measurements, infiltration rates were determined by the graphical method of Sharp and Holtan for 10 of the largest storms selected from a total of 82 storms, with appreciable runoff, {{that occurred during the}} 5 -year period. The ten storms were {{selected on the basis of}} long duration, high intensity and different times of the year. On the basis of this study the following conclusions were drawn. a) In general, <b>mass</b> <b>infiltration</b> increased with increased slope length; b) The average initial infiltration rate for all storms and all slope lengths was 0. 79 inch per hour and the final infiltration rate was 0. 21 inch per hour. The final infiltration rate varied with storms and slope lengths from 0. 60 to 0. 10 inch per hour. c) The average infiltration rate curve calculated from the mean of all curves for all storms and all slope lengths was expressed by the equation f = 0. 211 + 1. 019 e- 0. 065 t This equation is in the same form as that of Horton. d) The infiltration rate was influenced slightly by increasing the slope length. The mean final infiltration rate was slightly greater from the 145 - 2 feet length slope than from 36. 3 feet, slope length. e) Although the data are not conclusive, an interesting relationship appears to exist between the final infiltration rate and the season of the year. Final infiltration rate appears to increase up to June and July and then decrease rather sharply during August and September. The results are in agreement with those found by Borst et al. f) An attempt was made to relate Antecedent Precipitation Index to infiltration rates. Antecedent Precipitation Indices are used as expression of the wetness of the soil. The relation between API and <b>mass</b> <b>infiltration</b> as percent of the total rainfall appeared to be the best of several tested. Curves have been. prepared presenting the relationship between API and infiltration rate at various times after rainfall started. Infiltration rate is greater with decreasing API's at the Btart of a storm. After 60 minutes of excess rainfall, however, the infiltration rate curves for all API's converge...|$|E
40|$|Background Chronic {{hyperglycemia}} {{leads to}} microvascular and macrovascular complications such as diabetic nephropathy. Medicinal plants are good sources for finding new therapeutic chemicals to improve diabetes and relieve its symptoms. Objectives The {{purpose of the}} present study was to evaluate the effect of the hydroalcoholic extract (300 mg/kg) of Calendula officinalis (marigold) on blood biochemical profiles and histopathological changes in kidney of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Materials and Methods Twenty male Wistar rats were divided to four groups: Normal control (NC), diabetic control (DC), normal C. officinalis (N+CO) 300 mg/kg, and diabetic C. officinalis (D+CO) 300 mg/kg. The rats were treated for a period of 13 weeks. Diabetes was induced by Streptozocin injection, intraperitoneally. Level of glucose, urea, creatinine and also total anti-oxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, total oxidant status in serum and histological alterations in the kidney were analyzed. Results Level of serum glucose, urea, creatinine, malondialdehyde and total oxidant status were increased in diabetic rats, whereas, total anti-oxidant capacity was decreased compared to the control animals. Also, histological findings confirmed the absence of integrity in glomerulus and <b>mass</b> <b>infiltration</b> in kidney tissue in diabetic rats compared to the normal controls. Calendula officinalis extract had no effect on blood glucose, but it decreased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, total oxidant status and malondialdehyde while it increased total anti-oxidant capacity in the diabetic extract-treated group when compared to diabetic rats. Calendula officinalis could not prevent nephropathy changes in the diabetic rats. Conclusions Therefore, our results suggest that although administration of 300 mg/kg of Calendula officinalis extract showed salutary effects on anti-oxidant profile, yet its protective effects on anti-diabetic and regenerative properties on nephropathy were ambiguous and require more investigations...|$|E

40|$|Distributed {{models to}} {{forecast}} the {{spatial and temporal}} occurrence of rainfall-induced shallow landslides are based on deterministic laws. These models extend spatially the static stability models adopted in geotechnical engineering, and adopt an infinite-slope geometry to balance the resisting and the driving forces acting on the sliding <b>mass.</b> An <b>infiltration</b> model is used to determine how rainfall changes pore-water conditions, modulating the local stability/instability conditions. A problem with {{the operation of the}} existing models lays in the difficulty in obtaining accurate values for the several variables that describe the material properties of the slopes. The problem is particularly severe when the models are applied over large areas, for which sufficient information on the geotechnical and hydrological conditions of the slopes is not generally available. To help solve the problem, we propose a probabilistic Monte Carlo approach to the distributed modeling of rainfall-induced shallow landslides. For the purpose, we have modified the Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability Analysis (TRIGRS) code. The new code (TRIGRS-P) adopts a probabilistic approach to compute, on a cell-by-cell basis, transient pore-pressure changes and related changes in the factor of safety due to rainfall infiltration. Infiltration is modeled using analytical solutions of partial differential equations describing one-dimensional vertical flow in isotropic, homogeneous materials. Both saturated and unsaturated soil conditions can be considered. TRIGRS-P copes with the natural variability inherent to the mechanical and hydrological properties of the slope materials by allowing values of the TRIGRS model input parameters to be sampled randomly from a given probability distribution.

40|$|AIM To {{report a}} rare {{case of a}} spinal WHO grade I meningioma {{extending}} through intervertebral foramina C 7 to D 4 with an extensive mediastinal <b>mass</b> and <b>infiltration</b> of the vertebrae, and to discuss the malignant behavior of a tumor classified as benign. METHODS (Clinical Presentation, Histology, and Imaging) : A 54 -year-old man suffered from increasing lower back pain with gait difficulties, weakness and numbness of the lower extremities, as well as urge incontinence. CT scan of the thorax and MRI scan of the spine revealed a large prevertebral tumor, which extended to the spinal canal and caused compression of the spinal cord at the levels of C 7 to D 4 leading to myelopathy with hyperintense signal alteration on T 2 -weighted MRI images. The signal constellation (T 1 with and without contrast, T 2, TIR) was highly suspicious for infiltration of vertebrae C 7 to D 5. Somatostatin receptor SPECT/CT with (111) In-DTPA-D: -Phe- 1 -octreotide detected a somatostatin receptor-positive mediastinal tumor with infiltration of multiple vertebrae, dura, and intervertebral foramina C 7 -D 4, partially with Krenning score > 2. Percutaneous biopsies of the mediastinal mass led to histopathological findings of WHO grade I meningioma of meningothelial subtype. RESULTS (Therapy) : C 7 to D 4 laminoplasty was performed, and the intraspinal, extradural part of the tumor was microsurgically removed. Postoperative stereotactic radiation therapy was done using the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique (RapidArc). No PRRNT with (90) Y-DOTA-TOC was done. CONCLUSIONS Due to the rare incidence and complex presentation of this disease not amenable to complete surgical resection, an individualized treatment approach should be worked out interdisciplinarily. The treatment approach should be based not only on histology but also on clinical and imaging findings. Close clinical and radiological follow-up may be mandatory even for benign tumors...|$|R
30|$|Lymphatic malformations (LMs) usually {{appear as}} soft {{compressive}} masses at birth and {{are found in}} all age groups and {{in various parts of}} the body. LMs develop in various spectrums from localized <b>masses</b> to diffuse <b>infiltration.</b> Morphological types of LMs are categorized according to size and location, i.e., macrocystic, microcystic, mixed macrocystic and microcystic, and diffuse types [1, 2]. Although LMs are benign malformation, sometimes, its treatment can be challenging, depending on the tumor size and location. Current multimodal treatments include observation, sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, laser therapy, and surgery [2]. Recently, oral medications such as sildenafil, propranolol, and sirolimus are shown to be effective for treating LMs [3 – 6]. In addition, in Japan, the most common treatment options include sclerotherapy using OK- 432 and/or surgical resection. Recently, several investigators have reported on the effectiveness of Eppikajyutsuto (TJ- 28) in treating LMs [7, 8], which is a Japanese Kampo medicine manufactured by Tsumura & Co. (Tokyo, Japan). We experienced a successfully treated case of large retroperitoneal LMs with the combination treatment of TJ- 28 and surgery. Therefore, we herein reported the clinical course of this case and showed the effectiveness of our treatment.|$|R

Space-time kriging techniques based on {{a limited number of}} ambient monitors may fail to capture the concentration from local sources. Further, because people spend more time indoors, using ambient concentration to represent exposure may cause error. To quantify the associated exposure error, we computed a series of six different hourly-based exposure metrics at 16, 095 Census blocks of three Counties in North Carolina for CO, NOx, PM 2. 5, and elemental carbon (EC) during 2012. These metrics include ambient background concentration from space-time ordinary kriging (STOK), ambient on-road concentration from the Research LINE source dispersion model (R-LINE), a hybrid concentration combining STOK and R-LINE, and their associated indoor concentrations from an indoor <b>infiltration</b> <b>mass</b> balance model. Using a hybrid-based indoor concentration as the standard, the comparison showed that outdoor STOK metrics yielded large error at both population (67 % to 93 %) and individual level (average bias between ´ 10 % to 95 %). For pollutants with significant contribution from on-road emission (EC and NOx), the on-road based indoor metric performs the best at the population level (error less than 52 %). At the individual level, however, the STOK-based indoor concentratio...|$|R
