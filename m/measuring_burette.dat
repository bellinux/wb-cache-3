40|$|Mixtures {{of sodium}} {{bentonite}} and crushed rock are being examined as {{components of the}} engineered barrier system in a geologic repository of high-level nuclear waste. Laboratory experiments were performed to determine the thermal and unsaturated hydraulic properties of bentonite/crushed diorite mixtures. Water-retention curves were conventionally obtained from pressure cell and evaporation experiments. In addition, transient data from heating and gas injection experiments on laboratory columns were analyzed using inverse modeling techniques. Measured pressures, temperatures, and drained-water volumes were jointly inverted to estimate absolute permeability, thermal conductivity, specific heat, and capillary strength parameters. Simultaneous matching of all available data specifically the gas breakthrough {{at the top of}} the column proved difficult, pointing towards aspects of the experimental design and the conceptual model that need to be refined. The analysis of sensitivity coefficients and the correlation structure of the parameters revealed the importance of accurately capturing coupled thermal hydrological processes within the column as well as the details of the experimental apparatus, such as heat losses and storage of water and gas in the <b>measuring</b> <b>burette.</b> The parameters estimated using different experimental and analytical procedures were consistent with one another, providing backfill material properties useful for the simulation of gas- and heat-generating nuclear waste repositories...|$|E
30|$|In dynamic {{displacement}} experiment, breakthrough {{time and}} fluid outflow performance are key parameters to calibrate the real time production profile {{and have to}} be identified carefully. In traditional measurement, breakthrough time is usually determined by pressure-difference data because we cannot see the production of first-oil or first-water in displacement experiment. It becomes a tough work while utilizing a heterogeneous core sample resulted in complex pressure-drop data. In the same way, fluid outflow performance is <b>measured</b> through <b>burette</b> as usual and always causes inaccurate result with low injection rate.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate multiple-cycles of the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) using an innovative volumetric pressure plate extractor (VPPE), which is incorporated with a membrane and time domain reflectometry (TDR). The pressure cell includes the membrane to reduce the experimental time and the TDR probe to automatically estimate the volumetric water content. For the estimation of SWCC using the VPPE system, four specimens with different grain size and void ratio are prepared. The volumetric water contents of the specimens according to the matric suction are <b>measured</b> by the <b>burette</b> system and are estimated in the TDR system during five cycles of SWCC tests. The volumetric water contents estimated by the TDR system are almost identical to those determined by the burette system. The experimental time significantly decreases with the new VPPE. The hysteresis in the SWCC is largest in the first cycle and is nearly identical after 1. 5 cycles. As the initial void ratio decreases, the air entry value increases. This study suggests that the new VPPE may effectively estimate multiple-cycles of the SWCC of unsaturated soils...|$|R
