40|$|Underperformance in {{high-pressure}} situations, {{commonly known}} as choking under pressure, has been well-documented in the literature. For well-learned sensorimotor skills, such as sports, choking is thought to occur because individuals devote explicit attention to {{the steps of the}} skill, which disrupts performance. The current study examines how the type of pressure situation an individual experiences, and individual differences in working memory capacity, influence choking on a sensorimotor skill. Participants (N = 96) performed a Sensorimotor Reaction Time Task (SRTT) either under <b>monitoring</b> <b>pressure,</b> outcome pressure, or no pressure (control). High working-memory individuals performed significantly worse while completing the SRTT under <b>monitoring</b> <b>pressure</b> relative to outcome pressure. Low working-memory individuals performed marginally better than high working-memory individuals under <b>monitoring</b> <b>pressure.</b> These findings demonstrate that high working-memory negatively impacts sensorimotor skill performance in <b>monitoring</b> <b>pressure</b> situations. Furthermore, these results show how <b>monitoring</b> <b>pressure</b> leads to decreases in performance in high working-memory individuals due to enhancing the amount of attention these individuals direct to task execution...|$|R

50|$|When {{comparing}} {{these two}} theories {{in the context}} of academic performance, a majority of work supports distraction theories. One {{reason for this is that}} many of the skills performed in the classroom require heavy demands on working memory. However, there are different kinds of pressure situations. There is <b>monitoring</b> <b>pressure,</b> in which an individual’s performance is impacted due to the presence of an audience, and outcome pressure, in which an individual’s performance is influenced by the consequences of the testing results. In a study, DeCaro et al. found that performance on a rule-based task, that relies heavily on working memory, was impaired by outcome <b>pressure,</b> but not <b>monitoring</b> <b>pressure,</b> whereas performance on an information-integration task, which does not require attentional control, was hurt by <b>monitoring</b> <b>pressure,</b> but not outcome pressure. These findings indicate that performance is compromised in different ways depending on the type of task, and the types of pressure, and that both theories can be correct.|$|R

Overview A blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitor,</b> or sphygmomanometer, uses an inflatable air-bladder cuff and a listening device or pressure sensor to measure blood pressure in an artery. This monitoring can be performed by using either of two methods: a manually inflated cuff with a stethoscope for listening to arterial wall sounds (the auscultatory method), or a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>monitor</b> that contains a pressure sensor for sensing arterial wall vibrations (the oscillometric method).

[...] The low price and convenience of many modern dive computers mean that many recreational divers only use tables such as the RDP for a short time during training before moving on to use a diving computer. Dive computers are also used as they calculate no-decompression limits based on the whole dive whereas the RDP is much more conservative and assumes a square profile dive where the diver spends the entire dive at one depth. Although this is much more conservative, dive computers provide much more dive time and therefore are the more popular option with most divers.|$|E

30|$|Weather radar is {{a useful}} tool for {{monitoring}} volcanic eruptions; however, the observation data contain estimation errors for two main reasons, error due to beam width and refractivity of the atmosphere. Not only weather radars, but also all electronic devices that emit radio waves have antenna patterns; and their beam width is defined by “ 3  dB beam width,” which corresponds to the angle between half-power (3  dB lower) points of the main lobe. Weather radar itself cannot recognize where the target is in its beam width area; therefore, its observation data have errors due to beam width. In addition, refractivity of the atmosphere always fluctuates, {{and it is difficult to}} monitor this fluctuation. In other words, we must continuously <b>monitor</b> <b>pressure,</b> temperature and humidity of the atmosphere to estimate the refractivity.|$|E

40|$|A {{passive and}} {{wireless}} sensor {{was developed for}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>pressure</b> in vivo. Structurally, the pressure sensor, {{referred to as the}} magneto-harmonic pressure sensor, is an airtight chamber sealed with an elastic pressure membrane. A strip of magnetically-soft material is attached {{to the bottom of the}} chamber and a permanent magnet strip is embedded inside the membrane. Under the excitation of an externally applied AC magnetic field, the magnetically-soft strip produces a higher-order magnetic signature that can be remotely detected with an external receiving coil. As ambient pressure varies, the pressure membrane deflects, altering the separation distance between the magnetically-soft strip and the permanent magnet. This shifts the higher-order harmonic signal, allowing for detection of pressure change as a function of harmonic shifting. The wireless, passive nature of this sensor technology allows for continuous long-term <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring,</b> particularly useful for biomedical applications such as <b>monitoring</b> <b>pressure</b> in aneurysm sac and sphincter of Oddi.
