50|$|Many {{failures}} {{result in}} generation of hot electrons. These are observable under an optical microscope, as they generate near-infrared photons detectable by a CCD camera. Latchups {{can be observed}} this way. If visible, the location of failure may present clues {{to the nature of}} the overstress. Liquid crystal coatings can be used for localization of faults: cholesteric liquid crystals are thermochromic and are used for visualisation of locations of heat production on the chips, while nematic liquid crystals respond to voltage and are used for visualising current leaks through oxide defects and of charge states on the chip surface (particularly logical states). Laser <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> plastic-encapsulated <b>packages</b> may damage the chip if glass spheres in the packaging line up and direct the laser to the chip.|$|R

McDonald's (which had an exclusive licensing agreement on all Disney releases) promoted the film with Happy Meal toys, food packaging and in-store decor. The McDonald's advertising campaign involved television, radio, and print advertisements beginning on the film's release date. Frito-Lay offered free admission tickets for the film on specially marked snack packages.|$|R

All you have to do anywhere between the North and East rivers is to stand in the street with an open bag <b>marked,</b> 'Drop <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> money here. No checks or loose bills taken.' You have a cop handy to club pikers who try to chip in post office orders and Canadian money, and that's all there is to New York for a hunter who loves his profession.

We'd get out our spyglasses and watch the woodcocks along the Broadway swamps putting plaster casts on their broken legs, and then we'd sneak away without firing a shot.|$|R
