40|$|Previous {{studies of}} mobile payment (<b>m-payment)</b> {{services}} have primarily {{focused on a}} single group of adopters. This study identifies {{the factors that influence}} an individual’s intention to use <b>m-payment</b> services and compares groups of current users (adopters) with potential users (non-adopters). A research model that reflects the behavioral intention to use <b>m-payment</b> services is developed and empirically tested using structural equation modeling on a data set consisting of 529 potential users and 256 current users of <b>m-payment</b> services in Thailand. The results show that the factors that influence current users’ intentions to use <b>m-payment</b> services are compatibility, subjective norms, perceived trust, and perceived cost. Subjective norms, compatibility, ease of use, and perceived risk influenced potential users’ intentions to use <b>m-payment.</b> Subjective norms and perceived risk had a stronger influence on potential users, while perceived cost had a stronger influence on current users, in terms of their intentions to use <b>m-payment</b> services.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} consumers’ adoption of <b>m-payment</b> using the sensemaking adoption approach. Contrary to the classical and well known adoption models, the sensemaking adoption approach puts individuals at the center of the adoption process. Individuals mentally frame their relationship with the technology to be adopted. In essence, sensemaking adoption approach considers attributes linked to the adopters’ characteristics (identity construction and social perception); the adopters’ shopping environment (enactive of sensible environment and retrospective); and it examines the potential benefits that the new technology might generate (ongoing process and plausible benefits). The consumer adoption of <b>m-payment</b> is assessed in this study in light of some dependent measures including intention to use, trust, perceived risk, and perceived benefits. ANOVA is used to assess the differences among consumers who are willing to adopt <b>m-payment</b> based on the dependent measures. ^ The results indicate some significant differences among the dependent measures when participants consider <b>m-payment</b> adoption in light of sensemaking attributes. In essence, consumers’ intention to use <b>m-payment,</b> their trust in <b>m-payment,</b> and their perception of <b>m-payment</b> benefits are significant when they attempt to make sense of environmental factors and the benefits linked to its usage. In other words, consumers are likely to adopt <b>m-payment</b> when the benefits and environmental factors linked to this method of payment can be mentally assessed. ...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} popularity of smart phones, mobile payment (<b>m-payment)</b> is now a reality which is about to transform consumers’ daily activities such as paying for purchases in retail. For this new technology to become successful in mainstream New Zealand, {{it is important for}} the local industry stakeholders to gain in-depth understanding of retailers’ motives to adopt and validate its suitability as a replacement for cash/EFTPOS. This thesis aims at providing answers to two research questions, what are the factors that motivate retailers for <b>m-payment</b> within the retail industry and what are the challenges they might face when implementing an <b>m-payment</b> system. This study uses a qualitative approach for data collection and analysis. A series of face to face interviews are conducted with retailers from the area of Auckland CBD in which they expressed their opinion towards the subject in accordance to their business environment. Data collected in the interviews are analysed using content analysis techniques. A code schema is developed based on the review of relevant literature and is used to extract meanings from data. The outcome of the research identifies the factors that influence the <b>m-payment</b> adoption in retailer industry and enhances the understanding of the challenges perceived by retailers. The findings indicate that there is a general acceptance of <b>m-payment</b> in the New Zealand retail businesses. Merchants’ adoption of <b>m-payment</b> is motivated by the needs of consumers and by business related factors. The needs of customers for <b>m-payment</b> as an <b>m-payment</b> system or application are related to their demographics, background and attitude towards <b>m-payment.</b> This study also finds that lack of knowledge and competition from existing payment technology are the major challenges facing retailers. Those are important factors that could prevent retailers from adopting for <b>m-payment</b> in their business. <b>M-payment</b> is found to be suitable as a replacement for cash/EFTPOS transactions. However, substantial efforts by service providers are required to promote the product as public awareness is low. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in the area as a very limited number of studies have focused on retail merchants and the empirical investigation of the attitudes of this particular stakeholder group (small retail merchants). It also provides valuable insights into the perception of <b>m-payment</b> by local retail business environment in Auckland, New Zealand...|$|E

Mobile payment (<b>m-payment)</b> refers to one type of electronic payment, performed through mobile devices, such as mobile phones, smartphones, and tablets. To ensure trust and avoid frauds severe security requirements must be imposed. In addition, interoperability and privacy requirements, as well as speed of execution and ease-of-use are mandatory requirements, too. Several technical solutions have been proposed, associated to generally incompatible business models. From the end-users point of view, {{the result of an}} <b>m-payment</b> transaction is just one transfer of money from customer to merchant. However, to get this simple result, m-payments use a plethora of sophisticated technologies, including SMS, NFC, high-frequency sound waves, and software apps.

40|$|The {{pervasive}} use {{of mobile}} technologies has provided {{new opportunities for}} organisations to achieve competitive advantage by using a value network of partners to create value for multiple users. The delivery of a mobile payment (<b>m-payment)</b> system {{is an example of}} a value network as it requires the collaboration of multiple partners from diverse industries, each bringing their own expertise, motivations and expectations. Consequently, managing partnerships has been identified as a core competence required by organisations to form viable partnerships in an <b>m-payment</b> value network and an important factor in determining the sustainability of an <b>m-payment</b> business model. However, there is evidence that organisations lack this competence which has been witnessed in the <b>m-payment</b> domain where it has been attributed as an influencing factor in a number of failed <b>m-payment</b> initiatives since 2000. In response to this organisational deficiency, this research project leverages the use of design thinking and visualisation tools to enhance communication and understanding between managers who are responsible for managing partnerships within the <b>m-payment</b> domain. By adopting a design science research approach, which is a problem solving paradigm, the research builds and evaluates a visualisation tool in the form of a Partnership Management Canvas. In doing so, this study demonstrates that when organisations encourage their managers to adopt design thinking, as a way to balance their analytical thinking and intuitive thinking, communication and understanding between the partners increases. This can lead to a shared understanding and a shared commitment between the partners. In addition, the research identifies a number of key business model design issues that need to be considered by researchers and practitioners when designing an <b>m-payment</b> business model.

40|$|This {{research}} study employed Q-methodology to explore retailer {{perspectives on the}} adoption of Near Field Communication. Near Field Communication <b>m-payment</b> {{has emerged as a}} promising payment alternative for retailers in the Netherlands, offering attractive technological advantages over existing payment methods. However, the multi-stakeholder nature of <b>m-payment</b> ecosystems means that a comprehensive understanding of the adoption factors and incentives for each stakeholder is needed in order to go past the adoption tipping point and reach critical mass. Limited adoption of previous <b>m-payment</b> systems coupled with an existing body of knowledge that has overlooked the adoption factors for retailers have instigated the need for this {{research study}}. This study identified 4 retailer perspective on NFC <b>m-payment</b> adoption. The first perspective represents retailers that rely heavily on customer demand before being enticed to consider adoption. This represents the typical wait-and-see behavior shown by the majority of retailers in the past when it comes to mobile payment adoption, and this is supported {{by the fact that the}} majority of participants loaded on this perspective. The second perspective represents retailers that are concerned with the financial consequences of adoption and rely less on the completeness of the mobile payment ecosystem. The characteristics of this perspective represent a group that may be enticed to adopt by offering extrinsic motivation such as financial support. The third perspective represents retailers that are less concerned with financial consequences, but instead focusses on the technical competence of mobile payment. The fourth and final perspective represents retailers that are satisfied with current payment alternatives and will only adopt if mobile payment can improve the efficiency of payment. The use of Q methodology enabled a deeper insight into adoption factors that other common techniques such as surveys may not have provided. The identification of retailer groups extends on conventional adopter groups such as “early adopters” and “laggards”, thus providing a wider breadth of views and responses towards NFC <b>m-payment</b> adoption. These findings inform NFC <b>m-payment</b> providers as to who are willing and capable of adoption, thus possibly accelerating adoption by creating a strong ecosystem. In addition, it also informs providers on the factors they need to improve on in order to attract those who are not yet ready for adoption. For the retailer this leads to an <b>m-payment</b> system that better fits their needs so that they can take advantage of the technological benefits of NFC <b>m-payment.</b> Information and Communication TechnologyEngineering Systems and ServicesTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|E

The latest of these technologies are mobile devices and electronic commerce respectively. The combination of these two technologies {{has resulted in the}} creation of electronic commerce which also enables mobile payments. Mobile payments (mpayments) are enabled by many technologies with Near Field Communication (NFC) being the most recent one. NFC is a wireless technology that enables mobile devices in close proximity to exchange data. The mobile device has already been enthusiastically accepted by the customers and they carry it with them wherever they go and this makes it a good device for providing a payment method alternative. This research looks at contactless mobile payment as a payment method. Customers in marginalized rural areas lack a payment alternative to cash hence in this research we are investigating and proposing the use of a NFC enabled mobile payment application for Marginalized Rural Areas. This research extensively evaluates and assesses the potential of using NFC enabled <b>m-payments</b> in Marginalized Rural Areas in South Africa by carrying out an investigation of the technology and its acceptance by customers. The investigation of the technology included implementation of a prototype application which was used to introduce the technology to the consumers. The customer acceptance of the NFC enabled mobile payments was evaluated using the Technology Acceptance model (TAM). The model was modified to suit the context of this study by adding more constructs. This research concluded that Near Field Communication enabled <b>m-payments</b> have great potential to be used and accepted by people in the marginalized rural areas...|$|R

The {{percentage of the}} population using mobile phones in Ireland is the largest in Europe, with market revenue of € 2 billion in 2009, and 117. 3 percent penetration. However, the commercial growth potential of smart phones is being hindered by an industry failure to adopt an accepted <b>m-payment</b> model to facilitate the widespread {{adoption of}} m-payments. Furthermore, previous research has shown {{there is a lack of}} a willingness among consumers to make m-payments. However, little is known about consumer’s perceptions of m-payments using a smart phone or what factors impact upon these perceptions.

However, <b>m-payment</b> over open devices and networks poses security challenges {{of a new}} dimension. Although many researchers address security issues in <b>m-payment,</b> {{there are still some}} security problems that are not well resolved, such as platform integrity and user privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a general payment architecture with Trusted Computing (TC) technologies to secure mobile payment. Using only a simple mobile payment infrastructure, a platform integrity protection solution is proposed to secure payment software downloading, application initialization, and secure payment transactions. We further propose two schemes to enhance the performance and flexibility of our solution. The first scheme provides platform attestation using an identity-based signature (IBS) algorithm instead of a traditional credential-based publickey signature algorithm within Trusted Computing Group (TCG) technologies, which fully utilizes the merits of the mobile computing infrastructure and improves the flexibility and performance of the payment solution. The second scheme provides attestation caching without sacrificing security achievements. We have implemented a real prototype system based on an emulated payment environment. Our security analysis and experimental results prove that our scheme can effectively meet the security requirements of a practical <b>m-payment</b> with acceptable performance. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose  – to deeply examine customers’ {{perception}} {{in terms of}} how the determinants of trust and perceived risk affect their intention to adopt mobile commerce. Design/methodology/approach  – literature review, conceptual framework, modelling method, quantitative survey methodology (questionnaire instrument). Findings  – the perception of risk in terms of privacy, <b>m-payments,</b> m-commerce legislation and quality of delivered products has negative effect in the intention to adopt mobile commerce, while the good online vendors’ reputation, enticing promises, good encryption security and transparency, reduce the effect of risk and increase the intention to use m-commerce. The availability of easy to understand and find policies have positive effect in the intention to use m-commerce. When customers feel free of risks and have high level of trust in the intention to use mobile commerce they actually adopt it. Research limitation/implications  –this empirical research contributed to the theory by exploring which factors influence or deter the m-commerce adoption. However, the UTAUT model, simple random sampling method and case studies on how the online vendors perform towards this topic are worth-exploring by future researchers. Practical implications  – the research results show that mobile technology manufacturers and developers should improve both software and wireless network security, online vendors should improve their online reputation, transparency, and mobile website navigation. Lawmakers should improve m-commerce legislation to better protect customers in case of dispute with online vendors. Originality/value  – previous researchers have never focused solely and in-depth on the determinants of perceived risk and trust. Moreover, this object had never been examined in the Greek Population.

40|$|While mobile {{payments}} {{have been}} adopted by {{a huge number of}} businesses, the body of knowledge regarding user trust in mobile payments shows that trust is a major issue in its adoption and development. The {{purpose of this study was}} to better understand the factors that influence consumer trust in mobile payments in one significant country in this region; The United Arab Emirates (UAE) as the research region. The UAE is one of the leading economies in the Middle East Arab region, and mobile technology is well advanced and widely utilised. An analysis of relevant literature provided the basis for the development of a conceptual model. The model, classified into five logical groups (consumer characteristics, environmental influences, provider characteristics, perceived risks and mobile-device characteristics), was further explored, validated, extended and tested through a mixed-method methodology, combining both qualitative (phase one) and quantitative (phase two) approaches, with semi-structured interviewing in exploratory focus groups and an online survey being used respectively. The findings of the qualitative phase were used to clarify the appropriateness of the preliminary Consumer Trust in Mobile Payments (CTMP) model, which was accordingly revised and extended. The second phase (the quantitative approach) was based on a survey of 340 respondents in the UAE. The collected data were analysed by using Structural Equation Modelling with the Partial Least Squares (PLS-SEM) approach. Many of the factors in the qualitative CTMP model were successfully validated and statistically significant. The resulting, quantitatively weighted CTMP model shows that users‟ awareness and provider‟s trustworthiness are the most positive influential factor, followed by perceive security levels and device-design suitability. Customers‟ uncertainty avoidance, on the other hand, is the most negatively influential factor on trust, followed by perceived privacy risks associated with <b>m-payments.</b> The model contributes towards better acceptance and usage of mobile payments. The findings also provide a number of theoretical implications for academic research and useful information for practitioners...|$|R
40|$|The major {{interest}} of businesses is continued usage of services, which is sustainable in the long-term. Surprisingly, post-adoption usage of technology has seldom received attention from researchers, particularly {{within the context}} of mobile payment services although this component is considered the most significant element as it translates into user ’ retention rates, culminating into loyalty towards the service provider. This study addressed the knowledge gap in the area of <b>M-payment</b> post-adoption in general and also in South Africa, specifically. The purpose of this study therefore, was to fill this void by examining the influence of service quality on continuance intentions and the mediating role of <b>M-payment</b> trust and user satisfaction. The study followed a quantitative survey approach in which data were collected from a sample of 269 experienced <b>M-payment</b> users based in South Africa. Five hypotheses were posited and a model was tested using Structural Equation Modelling software LISREL to ascertain the model fit. The study provides strong support for positive and significant relationships between service quality with trust (p<. 01) while the existence of statistically significant relationships ’ were also noted between the latter with user satisfaction (p<. 05). However, the study could not corroborate the significance of the service quality and satisfaction path. In addition, both trust (p<. 10) and satisfaction (p<. 01) demonstrated positive and significant influence on the users’ decision to continue using <b>M-payment</b> services. As such, service providers can improve service quality and trust component...|$|E
