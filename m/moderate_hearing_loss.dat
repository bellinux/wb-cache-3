In this study, both normal-hearing listeners and listeners with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> were tested for their tolerance of processing delay up to 50 [*]ms using a real-time setup for own-voice and external-voice conditions based on linear processing to avoid confounding effects of time-dependent gain. Design: participants rated their perceived subjective annoyance for each condition on a 7 -point Likert scale. Study sample: Twenty normal-hearing participants and twenty participants with a range of mild to <b>moderate</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses.</b> Results: delay tolerance was significantly greater for the participants with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in two out of three voice conditions. The average slopes of annoyance ratings were negatively correlated with the degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> across participants.

A classification algorithm based on a multivariate discriminant analysis of fast Fourier transform data from recordings evoked by click stimuli of 50 +/- 2, 62 +/- 2, 68 +/- 2 and 80 +/- 2 dB SPL was used to discriminate 302 normal subjects from 383 subjects suffering from mild to <b>moderate</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses.</b> The best discriminant model (QDF 80) produced a sensitivity of 93. 8 % and a specificity of 79. 4 %.

The classification of the correctly identified hearing-impaired cases yielded 93. 8 % identification of conductive and 75. 1 % identification of cochlear cases.
