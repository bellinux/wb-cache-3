5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought {{to level the playing}} field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating people only according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was a throwback to the medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors remark that he also sought military glory and personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected his idea of the German people's will.|$|E
25|$|This runestone {{is found}} at Sp√•nga and it sports not only long-branch runes, but also cipher runes made of both short-twig runes and staveless runes. The {{ornamentation}} is a ship where the mast is an artful cross. It {{is the only}} runestone with both text and iconography that refer to a ship. It was raised in memory of a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> part in an expedition to the west where he was buried, and refers to him heroically in alliterative verse or prose. This runestone is attributed to a runemaster named Traen.|$|E
25|$|Peter Robinson, {{a member}} of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a {{prominent}} businessman from York, Upper Canada was the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> on the emigration plan of 1825.

These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{scholars}} of the time, an oath of divorce counted {{as a full}} divorce and they were also of the view that three oaths of divorce taken under one occasion counted as three separate divorces. The significance of this was, {{that a man who}} divorces the same partner three times is no longer allowed to remarry that person until and if that person marries and divorces another man. Only then could the <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> the oath, remarry his previous wife. Ibn Taymiyyah accepted this but rejected the validity of three oaths taken under one sitting, to count as three separate divorces as long as the intention was not to divorce. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyyah was of the view that a single oath of divorce uttered but not intended, also does not count as an actual divorce. He stated that since this is an oath much like an oath taken in the name of God, a person must expiate for an unintentional oath in a similar manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E
500|$|Indigenous {{people in}} North and South America {{conceptualized}} a third gender for men-women and women-men. These roles were recorded of the Coahuiltecan Indians in Texas, Timucuan in Florida, and Cueva in Panama. In Cree, {{the term for}} a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> {{the role of a}} woman was ayekkwew; the Zuni word for a woman who took the role of a man was katsotse (boy-girl), and the Mohave give women the term hwame.

A [...] "two-spirit" [...] woman who has a relationship with a non cross-gender woman is thought to be a [...] "hetero-gender" [...] relationship.|$|E

500|$|When she was 17, Heyer began {{a serial}} story to amuse her brother Boris, who {{suffered}} from a form of haemophilia and was often weak. Her father enjoyed listening to her story {{and asked her to}} prepare it for publication. His agent found a publisher for her book, and The Black Moth, about the adventures of a young <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> responsibility for his brother's card-cheating, was released in 1921. According to her biographer Jane Aiken Hodge, the novel contained many of the elements that would become standard for Heyer's novels, the [...] "saturnine male lead, the marriage in danger, the extravagant wife, and the group of idle, entertaining young men". The following year one of her contemporary short stories, [...] "A Proposal to Cicely", was published in Happy Magazine.|$|E
500|$|After Christine confronts Jones with {{physical}} discrepancies between [...] "Walter" [...] and her son, Jones arranges {{for a medical}} doctor to visit her.

A newspaper prints a story that implies Christine is an unfit mother; Briegleb tells Christine it was planted by police to discredit her. Walter's teacher and dentist each give Christine signed letters confirming [...] "Walter" [...] is an impostor. Christine tells her story to the press; as a result, Jones sends her to Los Angeles County Hospital's [...] "psychopathic ward". She befriends inmate Carol Dexter (Ryan), who tells Christine {{she is one of}} several women who were sent there for challenging police authority. Dr. Steele (O'Hare) diagnoses Christine as delusional and forces her to take mood-regulating pills. Steele says he will release Christine if she admits she was mistaken about [...] "Walter"; she refuses.|$|E
500|$|When a {{majority}} of the nation's newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination, and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail. He would {{be in charge of the}} deed; she of the word. Berkman tried and failed to make a bomb, then set off for Pittsburgh to buy a gun and a suit of decent clothes. Goldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1866), she mused: [...] "She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters...Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?" [...] Once on the street, she caught the eye of a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have [...] "the knack," [...] and told her to quit the business. She was [...] "too astounded for speech". She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} an {{adaptation}} of Timothy Shay Arthur's novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There. The Moving Picture World synopsis states: [...] "Despite {{the fact that he}} is a loving husband and father, Joe Morgan ruins his life by his fondness for drink and finally becomes a seemingly hopeless drunkard. He spends his time and money in the saloon kept by Slade, the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> away Joe's mill and largely caused his financial ruin. Slade's saloon, when he first opened it, was well furnished, the landlord courteous and well groomed, and the customers happy and seemingly unaffected by their surroundings. But as time passed, a change for the worse was noted in everything. Probably this escaped Joe's notice, for a sharp shot, indeed, was needed to reform him. That shock came. Joe's only daughter, Mary, was in the habit of going to the saloon and piteously urging her father to come home. She knew that no matter how intoxicated he might be, he would never harm her. But one evening when she appeared her father and Slade had been quarreling, and the saloonkeeper threw a bottle at Morgan, who dodged. The missile struck the child, entering. The blow resulted fatally, but before Mary died, she extracted a promise from her grief-stricken father that he would never drink again, a promise which he ever-afterward kept. In later years Joe became wealthy and respected, and influenced by the thought of his daughter in heaven he kept in the straight and narrow path. The saloon keeper who killed Mary was never punished by the law - but through the irony of fate his taking off was much like that of Joe Morgan's helpless child." ...|$|E
