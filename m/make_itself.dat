5|$|One of the higher-level predators {{within its}} ecosystem, the Australian swellshark feeds on {{crustaceans}} (particularly crabs and rock lobsters), cephalopods (including squid and octopus), and small fishes. Even large-sized prey {{tends to be}} swallowed whole; the long periods of rest exhibited by some sharks may relate to digestion. Like {{the other members of}} its genus, this shark is capable of rapidly inflating its body by taking water or air into its stomach, as a defense against predators. These include larger fishes, such as the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and marine mammals. By inflating, the shark may be able to wedge itself inside crevices, <b>make</b> <b>itself</b> harder to swallow, or simply intimidate a would-be predator. Marine snails are known to prey upon this shark's eggs. The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of parasite species, but these are poorly documented.|$|E

Through its textuality, the text relinquishes its status as identity and affirms its condition as pure difference. In indifference, the text [...] "dedefines" [...] itself, etches itself in a texture or network of meaning, which {{is not limited to}} the text itself. Barry describes this as a [...] "structuralist approach to literature, there is a constant movement away from the interpretation of the individual literary work and a parallel drive towards understanding the larger, abstract structures which contain them".|$|R

25|$|The conquests {{may have}} {{involved}} {{the relocation of}} Malay merchants active in South Sulawesi to the Gowa-controlled port of Garassiq/Makassar, although this is contested by Stephen C. Druce. In any case, Malay trade in Makassar developed greatly in the mid-16th century. In order to maintain their commerce in Makassar, in 1561 Tunipalangga signed a pact with Datuk Maharaja Bonang, a leader of Malay, Cham, and Minangkabau merchants. Bonang and his people were granted the right to settle in Makassar and freedom from Makassar customary law. This ensured that the Malay presence in Makassar {{would no longer be}} seasonal and temporary, but a permanent community. Tunipalangga's conquest of competing ports and shipbuilding centers in the peninsula such as Bantaeng and his economic reforms such as the standardization of weights and measures, which may have been suggested by the Malay community, also facilitated Gowa-Talloq's strategy to <b>make</b> <b>itself</b> the preeminent entrepot for eastern Indonesian spices and woods.|$|E

[...] Dunlap appeared in only one game for the Giants and announced in July that he would play no more in 1890 and that he would spend the remainder of the summer at Atlantic City, New Jersey, with plans to return in 1891 [...] "and play the game of his life." ...|$|E

500|$|Cleave's {{interview}} with Lennon {{was published in}} the Evening Standard in March 1966 and provoked no public reaction in the UK. Church attendance there was in decline and the Christian churches were making no secret of the need to transform their image into something more relevant to modern times. Music historian Jonathan Gould wrote, [...] "The satire comedians had had a field day with the increasingly desperate attempts of the Church to <b>make</b> <b>itself</b> seem more relevant ('Don't call me vicar, call me Dick...')." [...] In 1963, the Anglican Bishop of Woolwich, John A.T. Robinson, published a controversial but popular book, Honest to God, urging the nation to reject traditional church teachings on morality and the concept of God as an [...] "old man in the sky", and instead embrace a universal ethic of love. Bryan R. Wilson's 1966 text Religion in Secular Society explained that increasing secularisation led to British churches being abandoned. However, in the US, churches remained popular.|$|E
500|$|Planning for the Cycle Center {{was part}} of the larger [...] "Bike 2010 Plan", in which the city aimed to <b>make</b> <b>itself</b> more {{accommodating}} to bicycle commuters. This plan (now replaced by the [...] "Bike 2015 Plan") included provisions for front-mounted two-bike carriers on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses, permitting bikes to be carried on Chicago 'L' trains, installing numerous bike racks and creating bicycle lanes in streets throughout the city. Additionally, the Chicago metropolitan area's other mass transit providers, Metra and Pace, have developed increased bike accessibility. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was an advocate of the plan, noting it is also an environmentally friendly effort to cut down on traffic. McDonald's controversially claimed that, since it is providing a healthier menu and fostering grade school physical education in an effort to help its customers improve their health, sponsoring bicycle and exercise activity in the park augments the company's other initiatives.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule {{criticized the}} Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar issued in 1904–1905: [...] "the lack of spark in these coins, as {{in so many}} designs by Barber or [...] Morgan, {{stems from the fact}} that the faces, hair, and drapery are flat and the lettering is small, crowded, and even." [...] He did not believe that the problems he saw were due to the small size of the dollar, stating that the gold dollar of the Panama-Pacific issue, by Charles Keck, is far more beautiful. Vermeule noted that contemporary accounts saw the 1903 issue as an innovation; a 1904 article in the American Journal of Numismatics stated that they [...] "indicate a popular desire for a new departure from the somewhat monotonous types of Liberty which have characterized our money... If this tendency could <b>make</b> <b>itself</b> felt on the regular coinage, it would give a new zeal to collectors." [...] Beginning in 1909 with the Lincoln cent, the Mint would depict an actual person on the circulating coinage; this would become more common with the 1932 Washington quarter.|$|E
