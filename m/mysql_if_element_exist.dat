40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{inferring}} link loss rates from unicast end-to-end measurements on the basis of network tomography. Because measurement probes will incur additional traffic overheads, most tomography-based approaches perform the inference by collecting the measurements only on selected paths to reduce the overhead. However, all previous approaches select paths offline, which will inevitably miss many potential identifiable links, whose loss rates should be unbiasedly determined. Furthermore, <b>if</b> <b>element</b> failures <b>exist,</b> an appreciable number of the selected paths may become unavailable. In this paper, we creatively propose an adaptive loss inference approach in which the paths are selected sequentially depending on the previous measurement results. In each round, we compute the loss rates of links that can be unbiasedly determined based on the current measurement results and remove them from the system. Meanwhile, we locate the most possible failures based on the current measurement outcomes to avoid selecting unavailable paths in subsequent rounds. In this way, all identifiable and potential identifiable links can be determined unbiasedly using only 20 % of all available end-to-end measurements. Compared with a previous classical approach through extensive simulations, the results strongly confirm the promising performance of our proposed approach...|$|R
50|$|It {{is still}} not clear whether these non-peptidic antigens bind {{directly}} to the Vγ9/Vδ2 TCR or <b>if</b> a presenting <b>element</b> <b>exists.</b> There is evidence for a requirement for a species-specific cell-cell contact.

Strong support for a direct recognition of non-peptide antigens by the Vγ9/Vδ2 TCR comes from studies which demonstrated that a transfected Vγ9/Vδ2 TCR can confer responsiveness onto a hitherto unresponsive cell; furthermore, antibodies to the γδ TCR block recognition. Thus, the presence of a functional Vγ9/Vδ2 TCR appears mandatory for a response to non-peptidic antigens although the basis for the huge differences in bioactivity between closely related molecules like HMB-PP and IPP cannot be explained by conventional epitope presentation/recognition models.|$|R

40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedOBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} how {{to translate}} dental public health surveillance and broader research into policy and practice. METHODS: Via a literature review to identify both the potential uses of surveillance data and key {{elements in the}} policy making process. Then {{through a consideration of}} Australian dental public health examples to identify ways to build links between this research and policy making. RESULTS: The development of dental public health policy can be complex. Different notions of evidence are held by researchers and policy makers. A cultural gap divides these two groups. Translation of research into policy is more likely if an issue is moved up the policy agenda through judicial articulation of the problem with an associated policy proposal and where political factors are positive. <b>If</b> these <b>elements</b> <b>exist,</b> a policy outcome is more possible when a 'policy window' opens. Five ways to build the links between surveillance, research and policy and practice are to communicate across the cultural gap; be prepared for chance opportunities to transfer knowledge; undertake policy relevant research; don't abuse research evidence by making exaggerated claims; and provide timely dissemination of surveillance and research findings. Structural barriers to academics having greater engagement with policy agencies also need to be addressed. CONCLUSION: Translating surveillance and broader research evidence into policy requires active management rather than expecting passive diffusion. Researchers need to understand and act on the external factors that are likely to affect the uptake of their research if they want their research to influence policy and practice.
