We evaluated the effect of light intensity and substratum complexity on microhabitat preference of the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa using a <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design.</b> The snails were offered two levels of light intensity and two types of structural complexity, hence 16 treatments in total were used: 12 in which choice was offered and 4 in which no choice was offered. The snails preferred ambient light over dim light, regardless of substratum complexity, and complex over smooth substrata, regardless of light intensity. The level of one factor did not affect the response to the other. Thus, the results revealed a preference for microhabitats with greater light intensity and that were structurally complex, and a rejection of dimly lit microhabitats with smooth substrates...|$|E

40|$|Protected {{cultivation}} {{systems are}} {{used throughout the}} world as a powerful instrument to produce crops. They protect the crops from unfavorable outdoor climate conditions and pests and offer the opportunity to modify the indoor climate to create an environment that is optimal for crop growth and production, both in terms of quality and quantity. A quick scan of protected cultivation systems presently in use reveals that various types of protected cultivation systems have evolved in time. These cultivation systems differ for instance in terms of construction and cover materials used, the presence and use of different types of climate conditioning equipment, soil or soilless cultivation and nutrition. These differences are determined by the local climate, the availability of water, soil and water quality, the availability of capital, labor and materials and local legislation, to mention a few. With these observations in mind, this paper addresses {{the question of how to}} design a protected cultivation system that best satisfies the local conditions in the region considered. This is a <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design</b> and optimization problem.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of Bayesian statistical approaches, such as flexibility {{and the ability}} to acknowledge uncertainty in all parameters, have made them the prevailing method for analysing the spread of infectious diseases in human or animal populations. We introduce a Bayesian approach to experimental host-pathogen systems that shares these attractive features. Since uncertainty in all parameters is acknowledged, existing information can be accounted for through prior distributions, rather than through fixing some parameter values. The non-linear dynamics, <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design,</b> multiple measurements of responses over time and sampling error that are typical features of experimental host-pathogen systems can also be naturally incorporated. We analyse the dynamics of the free-living protozoan Paramecium caudatum and its specialist bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Our analysis provides strong evidence for a saturable infection function, {{and we were able to}} reproduce the two waves of infection apparent in the data by separating the initial inoculum from the parasites released after the first cycle of infection. In addition, the parameter estimates from the hierarchical model can be combined to infer variations in the parasite’s basic reproductive ratio across experimental groups, enabling us to make predictions about the effect of resources and host genotype on the ability of the parasite to spread. Even though the high level of variability between replicates limited the resolution of the results, this Bayesian framework has strong potential t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Characterization of {{cellular}} growth {{is central to}} understanding living systems. Here, we applied a three-factor design to study the relationship between specific growth rate and genome-wide gene expression in 36 steady-state chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The three factors we considered were specific growth rate, nutrient limitation, and oxygen availability. Results We identified 268 growth rate dependent genes, independent of nutrient limitation and oxygen availability. The transcriptional response was used to identify key areas in metabolism around which mRNA expression changes are significantly associated. Among key metabolic pathways, this analysis revealed de novo synthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides and ATP producing and consuming reactions at fast cellular growth. By scoring the significance of overlap between growth rate dependent genes and known transcription factor target sets, transcription factors that coordinate balanced growth were also identified. Our analysis shows that Fhl 1, Rap 1, and Sfp 1, regulating protein biosynthesis, have significantly enriched target sets for genes up-regulated with increasing growth rate. Cell cycle regulators, such as Ace 2 and Swi 6, and stress response regulators, such as Yap 1, were also shown to have significantly enriched target sets. Conclusion Our work, {{which is the first}} genome-wide gene expression study to investigate specific growth rate and consider the impact of oxygen availability, provides a more conservative estimate of growth rate dependent genes than previously reported. We also provide a global view of how a small set of transcription factors, 13 in total, contribute to control {{of cellular}} growth rate. We anticipate that <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>designs</b> will play an increasing role in elucidating cellular regulation. </p...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} patterns of {{spatial and temporal}} variability of mobile macroinvertebrate assemblages associated to coralligenous habitat.

Moreover, macroalgae and sessile macro-invertebrates were also investigated in order to detect eventual relationship between sessile and mobile assemblages. A total of 236 mobile macro-invertebrate taxa were identified, among them 2 Platyhelminthes, 4 Sipuncula, 6 Nemertea, 27 Mollusca, 86 Annelida, 103 Arthropoda, 8 Echinodermata. Results of the study showed that mobile macro-invertebrate assemblages of coralligenous habitat were little influenced by the inclination of substrate and by the morphology of sessile organisms, as patterns of variation were different between the two assemblages.

40|$|Ectotherms {{have evolved}} {{preferences}} for particular body temperatures, but the nutritional and life-history {{consequences of such}} temperature preferences are not well understood. We measured thermal preferences in Locusta migratoria (migratory locusts) and used a <b>multi-factorial</b> experimental <b>design</b> to investigate relationships between growth/development and macronutrient utilization (conversion of ingesta to body mass) {{as a function of}} temperature. A range of macronutrient intake values for insects at 26, 32 and 38 °C was achieved by offering individuals high-protein diets, high-carbohydrate diets or a choice between both. Locusts placed in a thermal gradient selected temperatures near 38 °C, maximizing rates of weight gain; however, this enhanced growth rate came at the cost of poor protein and carbohydrate utilization. Protein and carbohydrate were equally digested across temperature treatments, but once digested both macronutrients were converted to growth most efficiently at the intermediate temperature (32 °C). Body temperature preference thus yielded maximal growth rates at the expense of efficient nutrient utilization...|$|R
40|$|Background: Climate, land-use and {{disturbance}} {{regimes are}} key drivers of treeline dynamics worldwide, but {{local and regional}} spatio-temporal patterns indicate that additional factors play an important role. Some studies suggest that shrub-tree interactions control tree seedling recruitment patterns across the treeline ecotone, but {{little is known about}} the generality of this interaction. Aims: We established an experiment in a treeline ecotone in the central Pyrenees to investigate the role of such interactions and other environmental factors on tree seedling growth and survival. It was based on a similar experiment we completed recently in the subarctic Scandes. By comparing local phenomena between both experiments we assessed the generality of the findings across regions with different biogeographic histories and species characteristics. Methods: We followed the survival and growth of transplanted Pinus uncinata seedlings during three growing seasons in a <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design</b> (forest vs. treeline, +/- shrub removal, +/- temperature increase and +/- nutrient addition). Results: There was better seedling growth at the treeline compared to the forest, and the presence of shrubs prevented seedling winter damage and herbivory. Both temperature and nutrient increase enhanced seedling performance. Conclusions: Although some particular details were exclusive to the Pyrenees or to the Scandes, the similarities indicated general patterns and help to interpret the underlying mechanisms of treeline dynamics in both regions. This convergence of responses points to the potential of the development of a robust mechanistically founded predictive framework for scaling up shrub impacts on treeline dynamics to other regions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} the {{relationship}} between growth, partitioning of shoot biomass and hydraulic development of Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. grown in glasshouses for six months. Close coordination of stem vascular capacity and shoot architecture is vital for survival of eucalypts, especially as developing trees are increasingly subjected to spasmodic droughts and rising atmospheric CO 2 levels. Trees were exposed to constant soil moisture deficits in 45 L pots (30 – 50 % below field capacity), while atmospheric CO 2 was raised to 700 µL CO 2 L− 1 in matched glasshouses using a hierarchical, <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design.</b> Enrichment with CO 2 stimulated shoot growth rates for 12 – 15 weeks in well-watered trees but after six months of CO 2 enrichment, shoot biomasses were not significantly heavier (30 % stimulation) in ambient conditions. By contrast, constant drought arrested shoot growth after 20 weeks under ambient conditions, whereas elevated CO 2 sustained growth in drought and ultimately doubled the shoot biomass relative to ambient conditions. These growth responses were achieved through an enhancement of lateral branching up to 8 -fold due to CO 2 enrichment. In spite of larger transpiring canopies, CO 2 enrichment also improved the daytime water status of leaves of droughted trees. Stem xylem development was highly regulated, with vessels per unit area and cross sectional area of xylem vessels in stems correlated inversely across all treatments. Furthermore, vessel numbers related to the numbers of leaves on lateral branches, broadly supporting predictions arising from Pipe Model Theory that the area of conducting tissue should correlate wit...|$|E
40|$|An {{economic}} model was {{developed as a}} key component of a model-based method to design greenhouses for a broad range of climatic and economic conditions. This {{economic model}} was linked to an existing greenhouse climate-crop yield model to calculate the annual Net Financial Result (NFR) of a greenhouse. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify – among ten predefined design alternatives – the greenhouse with the highest annual NFR for tomato production under southern Spanish conditions. The basic designs were either the parral greenhouse, or a multi-tunnel, possibly fitted with any combination of heating, fogging and CO 2 enrichment. Results demonstrated that the multi-tunnel, fitted with only a fogging system was most profitable, followed by the multi-tunnel with heating, CO 2 enrichment and fogging. However, the difference in NFR between such a design and a simple parral was small with respect to the difference in investment. A sensitivity analysis of the NFR of the two technology extremes shows that tomato price, the fraction of marketable yield and the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) transmission of the cover had the largest bearing on NFR. With increasing technology level, the NFR depended less on outdoor climate and more on tomato price. This indicates that a low-tech greenhouse diminishes the risk of variations among price paths in different years, whereas a high-tech greenhouse covers better the “weather risk”. The best design was also affected by climate management and the joint impact of climate modification techniques. These results demonstrated that a model-based design approach can cope with <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design</b> aspect...|$|E
40|$|Data {{screening}} is {{an indispensable}} phase in initiating the scientific discovery process. Fractional factorial designs offer quick and economical options for engineering highly-dense structured datasets. Maximum information content is harvested when a selected fractional factorial scheme is driven to saturation while data gathering is suppressed to no replication. A novel multi-factorial profiler is presented that allows screening of saturated-unreplicated designs by decomposing the examined response to its constituent contributions. Partial effects are sliced off systematically from the investigated response to form individual contrasts using simple robust measures. By isolating {{each time the}} disturbance attributed solely to a single controlling factor, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank stochastics are employed to assign significance. We demonstrate that the proposed profiler possesses its own self-checking mechanism for detecting a potential influence due to fluctuations attributed to the remaining unexplainable error.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out on the rocky cliffs of Giannutri Island (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) to test the {{hypothesis}} that coralligenous assemblages are consistent within the bathymetric range considered (25 - 35 m depth) over three different spatial scales (1000 m, 100 m and 10 m). A <b>multi-factorial</b> sampling <b>design</b> was used to assess patterns of vertical distribution in the studied area. Data on the percent cover of algae and invertebrates were collected at three depths (25, 30 and 35 m) using a photographic method, and percentage cover was obtained using a visual method. Analysis of the results using ANOVA indicated that the distribution and abundance of algae and some invertebrates of the sublittoral assemblages are clearly heterogeneous. Algae, sponges and bryozoans showed significant variability in distribution and abundance at different depths, but this variability was not consistent amongst transects. Ascidians did not show any variability, while the abundance of anthozoans differed significantly amongst transects.

Urchin densities were generally low and did not vary between locations, but did vary between habitat types and amongst sites. Site-level variability in urchin size and condition was also pronounced. The southernmost population comprised smaller individuals and greater relative abundance of the H. e. erythrogramma subspecies, which is abundant {{on the east coast}} of Australia.

40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungi, important plant mutualists, provide {{plants with}} nutrients such as phosphorus (P) {{in return for}} carbon. AM fungi also enhance the attractiveness of plants to aphids via effects on emissions of plant volatiles used in aphid host location. We tested whether increased P uptake by plants is the mechanism through which AM fungi alter the volatile profile of plants and aphid behavioural responses by manipulating the availability of P and AM fungi to broad beans (Vicia faba L.) in a <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design.</b> If AM fungi affect plant volatiles only via increased P acquisition, we predicted that the emission of volatiles and the attractiveness of mycorrhizal beans to aphids {{would be similar to}} those of non-mycorrhizal beans supplied with additional P. AM fungi and P addition increased leaf P concentrations by 40 and 24 %, respectively. The production of naphthalene was less in mycorrhizal plants, regardless of P addition. By contrast, production of (S) -linalool, (E) -caryophyllene and (R) -germacrene D was less in plants colonized by AM fungi but only in the absence of P additions. The attractiveness of plants to pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris) was positively affected by AM fungi and correlated with the extent of root colonization; however, attractiveness was neither affected by P treatment nor correlated with leaf P concentration. These findings suggest that increased P uptake is not the main mechanism by which mycorrhiza increase the attractiveness of plants to aphids. Instead, the mechanism is likely to operate via AM fungi-induced plant systemic signalling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of this systematic review is to update a previous systematic review {{on the effectiveness of}} internet-based interventions for weight loss and weight loss maintenance in overweight and obese people with new or additional studies. A literature search from 2008 to March 2010 was conducted. Studies were eligible for inclusion if: participants were adults with a body mass index � 25, at least one study arm involved an internet-based intervention and the primary aims were weight loss or maintenance. Eight additional studies over the eighteen included in the previous review met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted on sample characteristics, attrition, weight loss, duration of treatment and maintenance of weight loss. Effect sizes (Hedges g) and relative 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for all two-way comparisons within each study. No attempt was made to pool the data in a meta-analysis because of the great heterogeneity of designs among studies. An examination of effect sizes show that the higher significant effects pertain studies that found a superiority of behavioral internet-based programs enhanced by features such as tailored feedback on selfmonitoring of weight, eating and activity over education only internet-based interventions. However, control groups are very different among studies and this heterogeneity probably accounts for much of the variance in effect sizes. Hence, questions still remain as to the effectiveness of web-based interventions in achieving weight loss or maintenance. Implications for further research include using a “real ” control group in order to make meta-analysis possible and developing <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design</b> in order to separate components of interventions and identify which of them or patterns of them ar...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Microbiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Sasol plants gasify {{more than}} 30 million {{tons per annum}} of coal via the Fischer- Tropsch process {{resulting}} {{in the production of}} synthesis gas and a condensate stream. After gravimetric separation of the tar products, the solvent extraction of phenolics and the steam stripping of ammonia from the condensate stream, a complex effluent referred to as stripped gas liquor (SGL) is generated. SGL {{has the potential to be}} used as process cooling water. Micro-organisms, scale deposit and corrosion are three major problems associated with the operation of cooling water systems. Parameters that have an influence on the fouling, scaling and corrosion of industrial cooling towers include cycles of concentration (COC), flow velocity (FV) and pH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water. Stripped gas liquor contains hydrocarbons which can interfere with PLFA analysis. There was, therefore, a need to optimise the selective extraction of hydrocarbons so as to eliminate their interference with PLFA analysis. The method used for the extraction of hydrocarbons before silicic acid fractionation succeeded in removing the hydrocarbons and their interference and was, therefore, determined to be appropriate method to use in subsequent analyses. Even though the two lab-scale cooling towers were of identical design their similarity or dissimilarity needed investigation. Physico-chemical analysis results confirmed that the two cooling towers were operated under identical operational conditions. The two cooling towers were found to be similar in terms of the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates as well as microbial community structure. The two cooling towers could be operated in parallel using different operational conditions with any differences in results being a reflection of the effects of operational conditions. The effects of pH, FV and COC on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as microbial community dynamics were evaluated with the aid of a 2 ³ <b>multi-factorial</b> experimental <b>design.</b> Cycles of concentration was found to have the most profound effect on the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates followed by pH. Cycles of concentration and pH were found to have the most profound effect on microbial community dynamics. The use of the 2 ³ <b>multi-factorial</b> experimental <b>design</b> also allowed the determination of optimal conditions for the operation of,the cooling towers using SGE as feed water. These conditions were found to be 5 COC, a pH of 7. 5 and a FV of 0. 6 m/s. In conclusion, the use of a 2 ³ factorial experimental design, physico-chemical, PLFA and DGGE analyses were instrumental in the successful determination of the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in the cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water.

40|$|This fMRI {{study used}} a single, <b>multi-factorial,</b> within-subjects <b>design</b> to dissociate {{multiple}} linguistic and non-linguistic processing {{areas that are}} all involved in repeating back heard words. The study compared: (1) auditory to visual inputs; (2) phonological to non-phonological inputs; (3) semantic to non-semantic inputs; and (4) speech production to finger-press responses. The stimuli included words (semantic and phonological inputs), pseudowords (phonological input), pictures and sounds of animals or objects (semantic input), and colored patterns and hums (non-semantic and non-phonological). The speech production tasks involved auditory repetition, reading, and naming while the finger press tasks involved one-back matching. The results from the main effects and interactions were compared to predictions from a previously reported functional anatomical model of language based on a meta-analysis of many different neuroimaging experiments. Although many findings from the current experiment replicated many of those predicted, our within-subject design also revealed novel results by providing sufficient anatomical precision to dissect several different regions within the anterior insula, pars orbitalis, anterior cingulate, SMA, and cerebellum. For example, we found {{one part of the}} pars orbitalis was involved in phonological processing and another in semantic processing. We also dissociated four different types of phonological effects in the left superior temporal sulcus (STS), left putamen, left ventral premotor cortex, and left pars orbitalis.

40|$|Aggregate {{dredging}} is {{a growing}} source of anthropogenic disturbance in coastal UK waters and {{has the potential to}} impact marine systems through the smothering of benthic fauna with organically loaded screening discards. This study investigates the tolerance of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis to such episodic smothering events using a <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design,</b> including organic matter concentration, temperature, sediment fraction size and duration of burial as important predictor variables. Mussel mortality was significantly higher in organically loaded burials when compared to control sediments after just 2 days. Particularly, M. edulis specimens under burial in fine sediment with high (1 %) concentrations of organic matter experienced a significantly higher mortality rate (p< 0. 01) than those under coarse control aggregates. Additionally, mussels exposed to the summer maximum temperature treatment (20 °C) exhibited significantly increased mortality (p< 0. 01) compared to those in the ambient treatment group (15 °C). Total Oxygen Uptake rates of experimental aggregates were greatest (112. 7 mmol m- 2 day- 1) with 1 % organic loadings in coarse sediment at 20 °C. Elevated oxygen flux rates in porous coarse sediments are likely to be a function of increased vertical migration of anaerobically liberated sulphides to the sediment-water interface. However, survival of M. edulis under bacterial mats of Beggiatoa spp. indicates the species' resilience to sulphides and so we propose that the presence of reactive organic matter within the burial medium may facilitate bacterial growth and increase mortality through pathogenic infection. This may be exacerbated under the stable interstitial conditions in fine sediment and increased bacterial metabolism under high temperatures. Furthermore, increased temperature may impose metabolic demands upon the mussel that cannot be met during burial-induced anaerobiosis. Lack of consideration for the role of organic matter and temperature during sedimentation events may lead to an overestimation of the tolerance of benthic species to smothering from dredged material...|$|E
40|$|The uptake of {{triclosan}} (TCS) and its metabolite methyl-triclosan (MTCS) by {{plants is}} poorly {{discussed in the}} current literature. The aim {{of this research was}} to analyze the extent of absorption of these compounds by the tissues of wheat plants by quantifying their bioconcentration factors (BCFs). Plants were grown for 30 days under controlled greenhouse conditions in two types of Chilean soil (Taqueral, TQ and Cuesta Vieja, CV) obtained from the metropolitan region of Santiago, Chile, that were amended with different amounts of biosolids containing indigenous and spiked TCS (10 mg kg(- 1)). Once the plants were harvested, both the root and the aerial parts of the plants were treated separately in each biomass sample. From the results, the extent of absorption of the compounds by the root was determined by measuring the BCF; the determined BCFs for the lowest and highest biosolid doses were 0. 64 and 0. 34 for TQ soil and 1. 06 and 0. 30 for CV soil, respectively. These decreases were significant (p value < 0. 05). In the case of plants grown in soils treated with biosolids spiked with an extra amount of TCS, a higher amount of TCS was available (labile fraction) and higher BCF values were obtained. The contributions of organic matter from biosolid doses and pH of the matrix as well as the additional loads of TCS from the biosolids were evaluated through a <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design.</b> A mathematical expression was derived using this model, which was applied to predict BCFs using data reported in the literature.

40|$|Several {{articles}} {{deal with}} the effects of inhomogeneous variances in one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A very early investigation of this topic was done by Box (1954). He supposed, that in balanced designs with moderate heterogeneity of variances deviations of the empirical type I error rate (on experiments based realized α) to the nominal one (predefined α for H 0) are small. Similar conclusions are drawn by Wellek (2003). For not so moderate heterogeneity (e. g. σ 1 :σ 2 : [...] . = 3 : 1 : [...] .) Moder (2007) showed, that empirical type I error rate is far beyond the nominal one, even with balanced designs. In unbalanced designs the difficulties get bigger. Several attempts were made to get over this problem. One proposal is to use a more stringent α level (e. g. 2. 5 % instead of 5 %) (Keppel & Wickens, 2004). Another recommended remedy is to transform the original scores by square root, log, and other variance reducing functions (Keppel & Wickens, 2004, Heiberger & Holland, 2004). Some authors suggest the use of rank based alternatives to F-test in analysis of variance (Vargha & Delaney, 1998). Only a few articles deal with two or multifactorial designs. There is some evidence, that in a two or <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design</b> type I error rate is approximately met if the number of factor levels tends to infinity for a certain factor while the number of levels is fixed for the other factors (Akritas & S., 2000, Bathke, 2004).

The {{application}} of MANOVA to analyse Arabidopsis thaliana metabolomic data from factorially designed experiments. Metabolomics, 3, (4), 517 - 530. Sponsorship: BBSRCMetabolomic technologies produce complex multivariate datasets and researchers {{are faced with}} the daunting task of extracting information from these data. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied in the field of metabolomics to reduce data dimensionality and for visualising trends within the complex data. Although PCA is very useful, it cannot handle <b>multi-factorial</b> experimental <b>designs</b> and, often, clear trends of biological interest are not observed when plotting various PC combinations. Even if patterns are observed, PCA provides no measure of their significance. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) applied to these PCs enables the statistical evaluation of main treatments and, more importantly, their interactions within the experimental design. The power and scope of MANOVA is demonstrated through two different factorially designed metabolomic investigations using Arabidopsis ethylene signalling mutants and their wild-type. One investigation has multiple experimental factors including challenge with the economically important pathogen Botrytis cinerea and also replicate experiments, while the second has different sample preparation methods and one level of replication ?nested? within the design. In both investigations there are specific factors of biological interest and there are also factors incorporated within the experimental design, which affect the data. The versatility of MANOVA is displayed by using data from two different metabolomic techniques; profiling using direct injection mass spectroscopy (DIMS) and fingerprinting using fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy. MANOVA found significant main effects and interactions in both experiments, allowing a more complete and comprehensive interpretation of the variation within each investigation, than with PCA alone. Canonical variate analysis (CVA) was applied to investigate these effects and their biological significance. In conclusion, the {{application of}} MANOVA followed by CVA provided extra information than PCA alone and proved to be a valuable statistical addition in the overwhelming task of analysing metabolomic data.

The results showed that the heart rate of P. marmoratus increased linearly with temperature and decreased when the specimens were exposed to air rather than water. Moreover, the heart rate values in summer were lower than those in winter at the corresponding temperature and body size. The summer heart rate-temperature regression line was laterally (to the right) shifted with respect to the winter line, suggesting a seasonal acclimation. Body size affected heart rate only at the acclimation temperature (17. 5 °C), while no significant effect was detected at lower or higher temperatures. During the reproductive season a separate {{experiment was}} carried out to assess the effect of sex and reproductive status on heart rate. No significant difference was found among mean values of males, berried females and females without eggs. The {{results of the present study}} confirm the high physiological plasticity of this species, suggesting that P. marmoratus is a truly amphibious crab, able to deal with both water- and air-breathing during its activity.

40|$|Porous {{materials}} have very attractive properties {{because of their}} lightweight and unique geometry that lead to their shock or sound absorbing properties. Thus, porous materials are frequently used in many fields, such as lightweight sandwich manufacturing, packaging, crash worthiness and medicine. Most porous {{materials have}} a random morphology, however the request for porous structures with highly controlled properties, coming from different application areas within the industrial and scientific market, forced researchers to develop novel additive manufacturing (AM) production techniques like selective laser melting (SLM), selective laser sintering (SLS) or electron beam melting (EBM). A critical aspect in optimising these production techniques and their postproduction treatments is to allow control of the morphological and mechanical properties of manufactured porous structures on both meso- and microscale. Therefore, {{the main focus of}} this study was twofold, namely: i) optimisation of the porous structures towards novel engineering materials with fully customized morphological properties and ii) unravelling of the mechanical behaviour and failure of those porous structures subjected to the mechanical loading. Due to the large variety of porous structures, and their broad range of applications, this PhD study focuses on one specific production technique and material type. The prerequisite was that, within this specific manufacturing approach the porous structures with a well controlled macro-morphology can be produced based on the design input which can be modified according to the desired output. In practice a case study on open porous Ti 6 Al 4 V structures, produced by SLM, was performed. The dissertation consistsmainly of two parts: one on material functionalization (chapters 2 and 4) and one on material characterization (chapter 3, 5 and 6). In chapter 2 a protocol for the surface topology improvement has been developed and applied to Ti 6 Al 4 V porous structures produced by SLM. Topology changes were introduced by several surface treatments consisting of chemical etching followed by electrochemical polishing. In that way the surfaceirregularities, typical for porous structures manufactured by SLM have been eliminated. In chapter 3 a novel tool for roughness measurements has been developed and validated for a quantitative characterization of the surface topology. For the first time, the micro-computed tomography (μCT) has been applied for quantification of the materials surface texture. Validity of this surface roughness analysis has been given by comparison to physical roughness measurementsperformed by conventional systems showing that the novel μCT image based tool for surface roughness analysis can be applied for quantitative surface characterization. The unique properties of porous structures strongly depend on the morphological properties, thus their thorough characterization is required. Therefore, in chapter 4 a relationship between thestructural properties and the μCT based analysis of porous Ti 6 Al 4 V structures has been investigated to define the most optimal characterization conditions. In this study, a basic, but systematic protocol for determination of the best acquisition parameters such as spatial resolution has been developed regarding the μCT based morphological characterization of the complex porous structures. The findings of this studycan assist to increase the quality of 3 D quantitative morphological analysis of any object in relation to its surface complexity as well to reduce the investigation time and costs by evolving towards a customised relationship of μCT settings versus morphological analysis level. In chapter 5, the surface modification protocol presented in chapter 2 has been developed further in order to manufacture Ti 6 Al 4 V porous structures with customized morphological properties. Application of the <b>multi-factorial</b> <b>design</b> of experiments led to a controlled, at both macro and micro level, morphological modification of the porous structures. This allowed to:i) eliminate the surface irregularities,ii) modify the surface roughness in a robust manner but, alsoiii) produce customized structures with desired global morphological propertiesAdditionally, the developed protocol can be applied for production of various porous structures with a final beam thickness that islower than the resolution of the selected manufacturing process. Finally, modification of the beam surface can be used for controlling the biological cell behaviour seeded on 3 D porous structures. In that way, the most optimal surface properties for future designs and production of 3 D structures for orthopaedic application can be looked for and validated experimentally. Finally, a proof of concept case study was performed by using an automated non-rigid image registration to assess strain through analysis of μCT images acquired prior-to and after compressive loading of SLM made Ti 6 Al 4 V open porous structures. Additionally, the evaluation of the potential and limitations of the proposed approach was assessed based on the simulated deformation of the phantom object. It was shown that the µCT based strain mapping, performed by combining the in-situ loading and non-rigid image registration of the µCT images, provides a valuable tool to identify and analyze the critical sections in the porous structure having a higher strain concentration, eventually leading to sudden failure. Additionally, the local strain analysis revealed larger strain concentrations at the beam geometry imperfections. Experiments with the phantom object confirmed potential of the proposed approach for the local strain analysis as the computed straincorresponded with the deformation artificially applied to the tested object. However, obtained strain results showed dependency upon the applied grid spacing of the B-spline transformation. Therefore, further development of the non-rigid image registration approach as a tool for local strain analysis is required, although a qualitative analysis of the localdeformation can already be performed to evaluate the volumetric changesin the porous Ti 6 Al 4 V structures. In conclusion, the work shows that combination of different tools was proven to be a valuable technique for thorough morphological characterization of complex porous structures, as well as their mechanical analysis. This resulted in production ofnovel porous Ti 6 Al 4 V structures with controlled morphological properties which can assist in more controlled evaluation of the combined effect of various functional properties. Furthermore, a novel characterization tool for surface analysis has been developed which can be beneficial forvarious research subjects dealing with surface engineering aspects. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Auditory word {{repetition}} involves many different brain regions, whose functions are {{still far from}} fully understood. Here, we use a single, <b>multi-factorial,</b> within-subjects fMRI <b>design</b> to identify those regions, and to functionally distinguish the multiple linguistic and non-linguistic processing areas that are all involved in repeating back heard words. The study compared: (1) auditory to visual inputs; (2) phonological to non-phonological inputs; (3) semantic to non-semantic inputs; and (4) speech production to finger-press responses. The stimuli included words (semantic and phonological inputs), pseudowords (phonological input), pictures and sounds of animals or objects (semantic input), and coloured patterns and hums (non-semantic and non-phonological). The speech production tasks involved auditory repetition, reading and naming while the finger press tasks involved one-back matching. The results from the main effects and interactions were compared to predictions from a previously reported functional anatomical model of language based on a meta-analysis of many different neuroimaging experiments. Although many findings from the current experiment replicated those predicted, our within-subject design also revealed novel results by providing sufficient anatomical precision to distinguish several different regions within: (1) the anterior insula (a dorsal region involved in both covert and overt speech production, and a more ventral region involved in overt speech only); (2) the pars orbitalis (with distinct sub-regions responding to phonological and semantic processing); (3) the anterior cingulate and SMA (whose subregions show differential sensitivity to speech and finger press responses); and (4) the cerebellum (with distinct regions for semantic processing, speech production and domain general processing).

Among all isolates, the isolate coded AZ 1 was selected due to its high potency to produce lipase at elevated temperature up to 65 °C. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 SrDNA sequence revealed its close relationship to Geobacillus thermodenitrificans. The effect of ten culture variable on lipase production was evaluated by implementing Plackett–Burman statistical design. d-sucrose, peptone and soy bean flour were the most significant variables affecting lipase production. A pre-optimized medium based on this experiment yielded an enzyme activity of 260 Umin− 1 ml− 1. For further optimization, a fourteen trials’ <b>multi-factorial</b> Box–Behnken experimental <b>design</b> was applied to find out the optimum level of each of the significant variables. The tested variables, namely: d-sucrose (X 1); peptone (X 2) and soy bean flour (X 3) were examined, each at three different levels coded − 1, 0, + 1. The optimal levels of the three components were founded to be (g/L) : d-sucrose, 6. 56; peptone, 6. 35; and soy bean flour, 6. 92, with a predicted activity of approximately 610 Umin− 1 ml− 1.

The objectives of the study were {{to determine the effects of}} soil substrate and nitrogen fertilizers on the growth rate and biomass allocation below-ground and above-ground of A. senegal and A. sieberiana seedlings. A <b>multi-factorial</b> experiment <b>design</b> was set up for collecting the data to address the two objectives of this study. There was a significant effect (P≤ 0. 05) of soil substrate and the species- soil interaction on growth rate between two acacia species. The mean relative leaf length of A. sieberiana (0. 013 mm mm- 1 d- 1) in unfertilized (N 0) soil A was higher compared to those in the soils treated with N fertilizer. Analysis of variance shows that while there was no significant effect (P≤ 0. 05) of species, soil substrate and species- soil interaction on the relative stem and leaf biomass growth, relative root biomass growth, and the root biomass allocation and stem and leaf biomass allocation at final harvest, there was a significant species effect (P≤ 0. 05) on leaf N concentration A. senegal seedlings had a higher stem and leaf biomass allocation (83 %) in soil substrate A with N 0 compared to the N treatments. A. sieberiana and A. senegal planted in the unfertilized soil B produced higher relative stem and leaf biomass growth (0. 034 g g- 1 d- 1) compared to those treated with N fertilizer. A. senegal had a higher leaf N concentration (7. 1 %, 6. 6 %, and 6. 3 %) in soil B treated with N 50, N 100 and N 150 mg / plant, respectively, compared to the N 0 treatments. Analysis of Pearson correlation showed that there was no statistically significant effect (P≤ 0. 05) of the leaf N concentration on the growth traits of the two acacia species in all treatments. It can be concluded that unfertilised soil substrates (N 0) supported higher growth rate of both A. senegal and A. sieberiana seedlings than fertilization with a pure ammonium nitrate solution lacking other nutrients important for growth. It is recommended that further investigations using a complete and a balanced nutrient solution with small quantities of N fertilizers less than the rates used in this study be carried out. Application of the N treatment produced less stems and leaves biomass allocation compared to N 0 treatments. Therefore, N fertilizers may not be used to enhance biomass production of two acacia species at the age 2 months. Further research can be conducted {{on the effects of}} N fertilizer on two acacia species for a long period of experiment. The two soil substrates affected the growth traits of the two acacia species differently while that on biomass allocation in the same way.

40|$|The {{dewatering}} of wastewater sludge (slurry) is {{a routine}} operation at wastewater treatment plants, {{and the results}} of dewaterability tests underpin the selection of dewatering processes. The two most commonly applied dewaterability tests for this purpose are the capillary suction time (CST) test and the specific resistance to filtration (SRF) test. The aim of this research was to develop improved methods of estimating sludge dewaterability by modifying the components and procedures used in the standard CST test, and by exploring the causes of the high variability that confounds the interpretation of the CST test results. The applications of this research were to recommend alternative methodologies that would help to improve the accuracy and precision of the standard CST test device and procedures, and ideally reduce operational and consumable costs. <b>Multi-factorial</b> experiments were <b>designed</b> to test the capillary suction times and the specific resistances to filtration of natural sludges and also of a synthetic medium which was formulated to simulate the properties of natural sludges. The applicability of altering the funnel geometry of the CST device, and the use of several alternative types of filter paper was evaluated. The applicability of incorporating stirring activity to eliminate or a least reduce sedimentation, and of adding a sealant {{at the bottom of the}} funnel, to eliminate or at least minimize unwanted filtrate leakage between the edge of the funnel and the filter paper, were studied. Experiments were performed to analyze the effects of temperature on the properties of sludges {{and the results of}} CST tests. Improved methods of estimating sludge dewaterability were developed by modifying the components and procedures used in the standard CST test, and by exploring the causes of variability in the test results. Stable synthetic sludges were successfully formulated to simulate the properties of natural sludges for experimental purposes. A rectangular funnel significantly reduced the variability and the time taken to conduct the CST test, relative to a circular funnel, particularly when testing heavy sludges. Whatman 17 chr (the most commonly used anisotropic filter paper) did not produce the most consistent CST test results in the shortest time. It is recommended that isotropic filter papers could be used, to lower the cost, reduce the test time, and improve the test precision. The addition of a sealant to the CST test apparatus also reduced the variability in the test results. No significant effects were found when a stirrer was added to the apparatus. The best line of fit to estimate filterability was defined by loge Y = β 0 + β 1 √x where Y = the mean CST value (s); β 0 = the intercept (the predicted mean CST (s) when the distance 4 between electrodes of the CST device is zero); β 1 = the filterability (s/m 2); X = the distance 4 (m) between the electrodes of the CST device. Non-linear relationships were found between the CST test times and the temperature, associated with a complexity of effects of the temperature on sludge viscosity, filterability, settleability, desorptivity, and flocculation behaviour. It is recommended that the temperature should be recorded and controlled during the conduction of CST tests. SRF test results were predicted from the results of CST tests by the empirical model loge SRF = 46. 128 – 1. 346 T + 0. 035 T 2 + 13. 760 F/TSS where SRF is the specific resistance to filtration (m/kg); T is the temperature (ºC); F is the filterability (loge s/m 2) and TSS is the total suspended solids concentration (g/l) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} old people is growing and will {{increase}} future demands on healthcare services for old people. Hip fracture {{is one of}} the diagnoses that increases with age and it has become a major problem, both for those suffering a fracture and for society due to the large numbers involved, the morbidity with complications such as falls, functional decline, and the high mortality rate among those affected. The main purposes of this thesis were, to study the impact of previous hip fractures on their life among the very old, to study in-patient falls, fall-related injuries and fall-risk factors, and to evaluate a multidisciplinary, <b>multi-factorial</b> intervention program <b>designed</b> to reduce in-patient falls and to enhance functional performance among old people who have sustained a femoral neck fracture. The impact of a hip fracture was examined in a cross-sectional population-based study, among the very old (Umeå 85 +). After adjustment for potential covariates, participants with a history of hip fracture were found to be more dependent in the performance of Personal/Primary Activities of Daily Living (P-ADL) (p= 0. 024), walked less independently (p= 0. 040) and used a wheelchair more frequently (p= 0. 017). Most of the participants with earlier hip fractures who had moved to institutional care or begun using mobility aids, as compared to before the fracture, had started to do so permanently in connection with the fracture incident. In-patient falls, fall-related injuries and fall-risk factors were studied in 97 participants, aged 70 or more, treated for a femoral neck fracture. There were 60 postoperative falls occurring among 26 / 97 participants (27 %). Thirty-two percent of the falls resulted in injuries, 25 % were minor, and 7 % were serious. Delirium after day seven, (Hazard Rate Ratio (HRR) with a 95 % Confidence Interval (CI)), 4. 62 (1. 30 - 16. 37), male sex 3. 92 (1. 58 - 9. 73), and sleeping disturbances 3. 49 (1. 24 - 9. 86), were associated with in-patient falls. Forty-five percent of the participants were delirious on the day they fell. The effects of a multidisciplinary, multi-factorial intervention program on in-hospital falls and injuries as well as the short- and long-term effects on living conditions, walking ability and performance of activities of daily living were evaluated in a randomised controlled trial among 199 participants with femoral neck fracture, aged ≥ 70 years. Participants were randomised to care in a geriatric ward (intervention, n= 102) or to conventional postoperative routines (control, n= 97). The intervention consisted of staff education, individualized care planning and rehabilitation, systematic assessment and treatment of fall-risk factors, active prevention, and detection and treatment of postoperative complications and an intervention follow up at four-months. The staff worked in teams to apply comprehensive geriatric assessment, management and rehabilitation. Twelve participants fell a total 18 times in the intervention group compared to 26 participants suffering a total 60 falls in the control group. Only one participant with dementia fell in the intervention group compared to 11 participants with dementia in the control group. The fall incidence rate was 6. 29 / 1000 days vs. 16. 28 / 1000 for the intervention and control groups respectively. The Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) was 0. 38 (95 % CI: 0. 20 - 0. 76, p= 0. 006) for the total sample and 0. 07 (95 % CI: 0. 01 - 0. 57, p= 0. 013) among participants with dementia. No new fractures were incurred in the intervention group but there were four in the control group. In addition, despite shorter hospitalization, significantly more people from the intervention group had regained independence in P-ADL performance at the four- and twelve-month follow ups, Odds Ratios (OR), with 95 % CI, were 2. 51 (1. 00 - 6. 30) and 3. 49 (1. 31 - 9. 23) respectively. More participants in the intervention group had also regained the ability to walk independently without walking aids indoors, {{at the end of the}} study period, 3. 01 (1. 18 - 7. 61). In conclusion, hip fracture among the very old seems to be associated with poorer P-ADL performance and poorer mobility. Falls and injuries are common during in-patient rehabilitation after a femoral neck fracture, delirium and sleep disturbances and male gender are factors associated with in-patient falls. Having a team apply comprehensive geriatric assessments and rehabilitation, including the prevention, detection and treatment of fall-risk factors, can successfully prevent in-patient falls and fall-related injuries, even among participants with dementia, and can also enhance the performance of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and mobility after a hip fracture, in both short- and long-term perspectives...|$|R
