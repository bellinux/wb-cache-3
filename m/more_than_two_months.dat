40|$|This study investigates tongue {{protrusion}} {{and how it}} co-develops with gazing {{and reaching}} in two-, four-, and six-month-old infants.

In addition, in the still-face condition, infants at four months preferred tongue protrusion over reaching. But this preference did not occur at six months. The results suggest that infants' tongue protrusions and reaching serve an exploratory function in ambiguous social contexts...|$|R

5|$|During the 1950s, {{agitation}} grew in Alaska for {{the territory}} {{to become a}} state. Alaskans could not vote in presidential elections and had a territorial legislature with limited powers. Efforts to lobby federal legislators for an Alaska statehood bill met with limited success, so prominent territorial officials decided to draft a state constitution to prove Alaska's readiness to become a state. On November 8, 1955, 55 elected delegates gathered at the University of Alaska to begin drafting a state constitution. The resulting debates lasted <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> and caused a sensation in Fairbanks. Debates of the constitutional convention were broadcast on Fairbanks radio, and the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner dedicated daily reports to {{the progress of the}} convention. On February 5, 1956, the delegates signed the constitution in front of 1,000 people who crowded into the University of Alaska gymnasium. The building where deliberations took place was subsequently named Constitution Hall.|$|E
5|$|A {{short period}} of home leave followed, before the battalion's {{personnel}} concentrated at Royal Park for a march through Melbourne. A draft of reinforcements arrived around this time also, incorporating men from New South Wales and several others states. In mid-September, the battalion moved to Greta, New South Wales, travelling by rail through Shepparton, Tocumwal and Newcastle. A brief period of training was undertaken there, during which the battalion's khaki uniforms were dyed green. During this time, the battalion was re-organised and converted to the jungle establishment; {{as part of this}} process its authorised strength was reduced to around 800 personnel of all ranks. The situation in the Pacific had deteriorated dramatically, and the Australian forces holding out against the Japanese in New Guinea were hard-pressed and desperately in need of reinforcement. Thus in early October 1942, not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> after returning to Australia, the 2/5th moved to Brisbane, Queensland, where it deployed to Milne Bay, which had only recently been held {{in the face of a}} Japanese landing, aboard the Dutch transport Maetsuyker.|$|E
5|$|Bell was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} opening match of the 1904–05 season, a 1–4 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion. Bell kept his place in the side for the following match against Chesterfield, but was dropped for the trip to Bolton Wanderers in favour of youngster William Hutchinson, a summer signing from non-League club Alston. He was recalled for the visit of Liverpool on 22 October 1904, deputising for the unavailable Doug MacFarlane, but then spent <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> out of the team. Bell made two further appearances for Burnley that season, playing in consecutive defeats to Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool in January 1905. He found himself more involved in the first-team during the 1905–06 campaign, making 19 league appearances. On 13 January 1906, he played in the first FA Cup game of his career as Burnley were eliminated by Southern League side Tottenham Hotspur in the first round. Bell scored his first goal of the season on 10 February 1906, netting the opening goal in the 2–2 draw against Burslem Port Vale. During March 1906, he scored in the home wins over Leeds City and Chelsea.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not quite}} clear where Gaveston spent his time abroad; the {{conditions}} of his exile banned him from staying {{in any of the}} lands of the English king. This precluded both Aquitaine and Ireland, where he had spent his previous exiles. There is some evidence that he might have gone to France initially, but considering the French king's hostile attitude towards him, he is not likely to have stayed there long. Flanders is a much more likely candidate for Gaveston's third and final exile. This time his absence was even shorter than the second time, lasting no <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> Returning around Christmas 1311, he was reunited with the King early in 1312, probably at Knaresborough on 13 January. The reason for his quick return might have been the birth of his child, a daughter named Joan, around this time. On 18 January, Edward declared the judgement against Gaveston unlawful, and restored all lands to him.|$|E
5|$|The club were {{eventually}} {{relegated to the}} Conference, and suffered more managerial turmoil during the summer when Simon Davey and successor Ryan Kidd both left within 11 days, to leave Mark Cooper in charge.

Following a succession of poor performances {{at the start of}} the 2011–12 season, Cooper and his assistant Richard Dryden were sacked by the club in October. A little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> later, Singh placed the club into administration for the third time in less than a decade. A number of players were released and allowed to join other clubs for nominal fees in January before interim manager Craig Liddle and the remaining playing staff had their contracts terminated by Darlington's administrator. Two days later, the club was spared from liquidation after a last-minute injection of funding by supporters' groups. Enough funds were raised for Darlington to complete the season, but relegation was confirmed with three matches remaining.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Helen passed through, cleanup efforts began as power crews had to remove downed trees before fixing power lines. The main power {{lines in the}} city were {{restored}} within 24hours and rural areas were stated to have their power back {{within a day or}} two. Two days after the storm, 500 homes remained without electricity and frustrated residents were further angered after discovering that the Power and Water agency was in control of tree removal and not emergency services. With the power company in charge of clearing downed trees, they stated that their crews would only be dealing with cases involved power lines. Residents with trees in their yards or even on their homes were told to contact private contractors to remove them. By 9January, more than 100 homes were still without power in northern Darwin, resulting in angry outcries from those still left in the dark. Cleanup efforts dragged on for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> as debris was still present in Darwin in March. Removal of tree stumps took through at least mid-April as the cost to remove downed trees exceeded A$1million (US$882,000). Due to the damage wrought by Helen, its name was retired following its usage. However, it was not replaced by any particular name as a new naming scheme was implemented the following season.|$|E
