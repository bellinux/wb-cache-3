40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new token-based {{distributed}} algorithm for total order atomic broadcast. We {{have shown that}} the proposed algorithm requires lesser number of <b>messages</b> compared <b>to</b> the algorithm where broadcast servers use unicasting <b>to</b> send <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> other broadcast servers. The traditional method of broadcasting requires 3 (N − 1) <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> broadcast an application message, where N is the number of broadcast servers present in the system. In this algorithm, the maximum number of token <b>messages</b> required <b>to</b> broadcast an application message is 2 N. For a heavily loaded system, the average number of token <b>messages</b> required <b>to</b> broadcast an application <b>message</b> reduces <b>to</b> 2, which is a substantial improvement over the traditional broadcasting approach. ...|$|R
5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host <b>message</b> <b>to</b> all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Republican politicians, such as Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou, tested the waters {{for a run}} but chose to stay out. New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes ran, but when he made a major policy speech, Roosevelt the same day sent a special <b>message</b> <b>to</b> Congress warning in strong terms against {{corporate}} corruption. The resulting coverage of the presidential message relegated Hughes to the back pages. Roosevelt reluctantly deterred repeated attempts to draft him for another term.|$|E
5|$|A third {{story is}} set in San Diego, where an {{undercover}} DEA investigation led by Montel Gordon (Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Guzmán) leads {{to the arrest of}} Eduardo Ruiz (Ferrer), a high-stakes dealer posing as a fisherman. Ruiz decides to take the dangerous road to immunity by giving up his boss: drug lord Carl Ayala (Bauer), the biggest distributor for the Obregón brothers in the United States. Ayala is indicted by a tough prosecutor, hand-selected by Robert Wakefield to send a <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the Mexican drug organizations.|$|E

50|$|A {{ring network}} is a connected-graph {{topology}} {{in which each}} node is exactly connected to two other nodes, i.e., for a graph with n nodes, there are exactly n edges connecting the nodes. A ring can be unidirectional, which means processors only communicate in one direction (a node could only send <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> the left or only send <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> the right), or bidirectional, meaning processors may transmit and receive messages in both directions (a node could send <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> the left and right).|$|R

5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|After its rediscovery, {{observers}} often {{assumed that}} the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder. Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent <b>message</b> <b>to</b> remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.|$|E
