Aim of this paper is to investigate the metrological properties of a dynamometric wheelset in order to determine the associated measurement uncertainty and to verify its readiness in the range of frequencies where the force analysis have to be performed. With reference to a specific instrumented wheelset, the calibration procedure was performed using a dedicated test-rig developed in the laboratories of the Department of Mechanical Engineering - Politecnico di Milano. The test-rig allows a static calibration of the system.

40|$|Since their {{original}} inception as ultrasound contrast agents, potential applications of microbubbles {{have evolved to}} encompass molecular imaging and targeted drug delivery. As these areas develop, so does the {{need to understand the}} mechanisms behind the interaction of microbubbles both with biological tissue and with other microbubbles. There is therefore a <b>metrological</b> <b>requirement</b> to develop a controlled environment in which to study these processes. Presented here is the design and characterisation of such a system, which consists of a microfluidic chip, specifically developed for manipulating microbubbles using both optical and acoustic trapping. A laser vibrometer is used to observe the coupling of acoustic energy into the chip from a piezoelectric transducer bonded to the surface. Measurement of the velocity of surface waves on the chip is investigated as a potential method for inferring the nature of the acoustic fields excited within the liquid medium of the device. Comparison of measured surface wavelengths with wave types suggests the observation of anti-symmetric Lamb or Love-Kirchhoff waves. Further visual confirmation of the acoustic fields through bubble aggregation highlights differences between the model and experimental results in predicting the position of acoustic pressure nodes in relation to excitation frequency...|$|R

40|$|International audienceVertical land motions are a {{key element}} in {{understanding}} how sea levels have changed over the past century and how future sea levels may impact coastal areas. Ideally, to be useful in long-term sea level studies, vertical land motion should be determined with standard errors that are 1 order of magnitude lower than the contemporary climate signals of 1 to 3 mm/yr observed on average in sea level records, either using tide gauges or satellites. This <b>metrological</b> <b>requirement</b> constitutes a challenge in geodesy. Here we review the most successful instrumental methods that have been used to determine vertical displacements at the Earth’s surface, so that the objectives of understanding and anticipating sea levels can be addressed adequately in terms of accuracy.

40|$|In this work, high {{temperature}} superconductor (HTS) Josephson junctions {{have been investigated}} concerning their possible use in metrological arrays, because of their nonhysteretic behaviour and the possible operation at elevated temperatures. However, the requirements on parameter spreads are very tight and difficult to achieve with HTS technology at time. Therefore, a special type of HTS junctions, shunted YBCO bicrystal junctions, has been focused on. It is demonstrated, that shunting the junctions with an in-situ metal cap layer is {{an effective way to}} suppress the spread in normal resistance and to meet the <b>metrological</b> <b>requirement.</b> Measurements and simulations of the shunted bicrystal junctions prove their conformity to the RSJ-model and their capacity to generate large Shapiro step amplitudes of more than 1 mA at temperatures above T= 77 K, which provides the metrological steepness of the steps in spite of thermal noise. Based on these results, the synchronisation in series arrays of several hundred bicrystal junctions has been investigated. Arrays with three different types of microwave power coupling have been designed, fabricated and characterized. Within the first type, power is irradiated from a waveguide onto the array. The second type is a more complex design with the junctions being included in a coplanar waveguide. The third type represents a new integrated concept with inductive power coupling. Synchronization of more than hundred junctions has been obtained, providing output voltages of several mV. The measurements show, that inhomogeneous power distribution along the arrays limits the amount of synchronized junctions. (orig.) 90 refs.

40|$|Abstract − Orthopaedic {{implants}} {{should be}} designed and manufactured {{in such a way}} to protect the patient and user against imperfections and damages. These medical devices require specific tests to evaluate their performance like: tensile strength, resistance to wear and fatigue, among others. These tests represent a way to ensure that the implants are both reasonably safe and effective for their intended use. Due to design requirements dictated by the anatomy, and physiology of the skeletal structure of the human body, these devices present complex geometric forms and so fatigue tests often involve applying complex load profiles under multi-axial conditions using specialized test fixtures. In this context, the uncertainty evaluation of the fatigue test assumes a relevant role to ensuring that the mechanical qualification of the orthopedic implant is been performed in agreement with the <b>metrological</b> <b>requirements.</b> This study presents an inter-institutional working plan to evaluate the testing machine performance and the uncertainty associated with fatigue tests of orthopaedic implants, including the identification and quantification of uncertainty sources and the first steps leading {{to the development of a}} methodology for dynamic force calibration...|$|E
