2500|$|Mizzou is {{currently}} home {{to at least}} six secret honor societies that still participate in annual public Tap Day ceremonies {{at the end of}} each spring semester. [...] QEBH, Mystical Seven, LSV, Alpha Xi Chapter of Omicron Delta Kappa, Friars Chapter of <b>Mortar</b> <b>Board,</b> and Rollins Society each use the Tap Day ceremony at the conclusion of the year to reveal the members who were initiated over the past year. [...] Missouri is one of few remaining institutions in which the local Omicron Delta Kappa and <b>Mortar</b> <b>Board</b> chapters carry out much of their work in secrecy. The Jefferson Society, which attempted to take part in Tap Day and was denied, claims to have been around since 1862. In addition to Tap Day activities, several of the societies maintain a public presence during some athletic events.

50|$|In the 1890s <b>mortar</b> <b>boards</b> were {{introduced}} but this innovation was soon abandoned. Eton collars were worn until the 1920s {{together with a}} blue cap surmounted by the arms of St Edmund or a bowler hat. For daily use, boys wore a morning suit. In the summer, the uniform consisted of an Oxford grey suit and a boater. Uniform gradually became more casual and, after 1945, a variety of grey suits was recognised uniform, with blazers worn in the summer. In the early years, members of the Douai cricket XI would wear full ties around the waist and half ties from their collars.|$|R
50|$|GCU {{holds its}} annual {{graduation}} ceremonies during the Summer and Autumn and its academic attire {{is made by}} robe-maker Ede & Ravenscroft. Under the University's academic dress code, the wearing of the customary <b>mortar</b> <b>boards</b> is disallowed, as it {{is not part of}} the official academic attire that consists of gowns and hoods only, individual to each award conferred. Graduants traditionally receive their degrees at graduation ceremonies by being 'capped' on the head with the Chancellor's hat, in a gesture that signifies the Chancellor's authority and status within the University. The postnominals for university graduates are prescribed with the abbreviation GlasCal.|$|R
5|$|On 9 July 1943, a {{contingent}} of 2,075 British troops, along with seven jeeps, six anti-tank guns and ten <b>mortars,</b> <b>boarded</b> their gliders in Tunisia and took off at 18:00, bound for Sicily. In the hours that preceded the landing, twelve Boeing B-17 and six Vickers Wellington equipped with radar jamming devices flew back and forth along the coast in the Siracusa-Licata sector; between 21:00 and 21:30, 55 Wellingtons of 205th Group carried out a diversionary bombing of the port and airport of Syracuse, causing a number of civilian and military casualties, including {{the commander of the}} Italian naval base, Commander Giuseppe Giannotti. 280 puppets dressed in paratrooper uniforms were launched north of the landing area, in order to deceive the Italian defense.|$|R
2500|$|She {{attended}} the University of Wisconsin–Madison where she joined Kappa Alpha Theta sorority {{and received a}} degree in English in 1918.

Kinnan briefly worked for the YWCA editorial board in New York City, and married Charles in 1919.

2500|$|At UPenn, secret {{societies}} {{are smaller than}} their Greek counterparts, and tend to vary in degree of secrecy. There are three senior honorary societies. The Sphinx Senior Society and the Friars Senior Society were both founded {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, while The <b>Mortar</b> <b>Board</b> Senior Society was founded in 1922. None of these societies was intended to be secret, in that their undergraduate and alumni membership were and continue to be publicly known, they share many of the characteristics of undergraduate secret societies of the time; they tap a diverse group of campus leaders to become members during their senior year, organize social and service activities throughout the year, and maintain an extensive network of successful and notable alumni. Alumni of Friars, for example, include Harold Ford Jr. and Ed Rendell; the Sphinx alumni roster boasts Richard A. Clarke and John Legend. In addition, there are several other groups called [...] "secret societies". These groups generally denote a social club that is independent of any official organization. For this reason, the society is not regulated by the university and is not accountable to a national organization.|$|E
2500|$|The cassock {{is almost}} {{invariably}} black for priests and deacons. A traditional Anglican cassock is double-breasted, being buttoned {{on the shoulder}} rather than up the front (there may be a single button sewn {{to the center of}} the chest used to fasten the academic hood if worn). Many Anglican clergy, especially (though not exclusively) those within the catholic tradition of Anglicanism, prefer to wear the Latin single-breasted cassock. The cassock is worn with a cincture, which may take the form of a cloth sash resembling a fascia, or a simple rope girdle or leather belt. Over this is worn the surplice, which is longer and fuller than that worn by Roman Catholic clergy, sometimes reaching well below the knees. Traditionally, an academic hood is worn around the shoulders and down the back, along with a black tippet or scarf worn around the nape and hanging straight down in front. The hood and tippet were once a single garment called an almuce. (The tippet is not to be confused with the stole, which is also worn in a similar manner, but is not part of choir dress, being worn at the Eucharist and other sacramental services.) Some clergy also wear Geneva bands (or [...] "preaching tabs") from their collars. [...] Though not worn at service-time, the Canterbury cap is the traditional headgear of Church of England clergy; some prefer the biretta (see below) or <b>mortar</b> <b>board.</b> [...] Neither is widely worn, although the cap, with cassock, gown and tippet, was specified in English canon law as part of the [...] "outdoor habit" [...] or [...] "house dress" [...] of the clergy until the promulgation of new canons in the 1960s. [...] At some periods of history a black gown, either academic or 'Genevan', was worn for Morning and Evening Prayer instead of the surplice which was reserved for use at the Holy Communion - the cassock, bands, gown, academic hood and tippet still being the normal liturgical costume for ordained minister of the Church of Scotland and other Reformed and Presbyterian churches.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditions of}} the older boys, uprooted from St Helen's House, {{influenced}} the new boys. The running of the school was still steeped in history, with praepostors and monitors, and with the houses still competing for the Cock House trophy. Latin remained an important subject. Masters (teachers) still dressed in suits, with gowns and <b>mortar</b> <b>boards,</b> and used corporal punishment, sometimes publicly after lessons. There was a strict dress code, and sixth formers could wear boaters on summer days. Lockers did not need locks. Older boys expected respect and obedience from younger boys, although not fagging. Praeposters and monitors could administer punishment. They also had their own rooms, and later {{the use of the}} Pavilion, off limits to masters and the lower forms. The new school had purpose-built Fives courts, where gloved fights between boys with grudges were tolerated as a gentlemanly way of settling disputes.|$|R
6000|$|It {{is clear}} {{she handed him}} over to his aunt and uncle at New Romney with {{explicit}} directions and a certain endowment.

He was {{not to go to}} a [...] "common" [...] school, she provided, but to a certain seminary in Hastings that was not only a [...] "middle-class academy," [...] with <b>mortar</b> <b>boards</b> and every evidence of a higher social tone, but also remarkably cheap. She seems to have been animated by the desire to do her best for Kipps, even at a certain sacrifice of herself, as though Kipps were in some way a superior sort of person. She sent pocket-money to him from time to time {{for a year or more}} after Hastings had begun for him, but her face he never saw in the days of his lucid memory.|$|R

60|$|An Avery scholarship! Anne {{felt her}} heart beat more quickly, and the horizons of her {{ambition}} shifted and broadened as if by magic.

But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning the Avery scholarship, taking an Arts course at Redmond College, and graduating in a gown and <b>mortar</b> <b>board,</b> before the echo of Josie's words had died away.
