40|$|Se evaluaron cuatro sistemas de compostaje durante 140 días para el tratamiento aeróbico del alperujo: T 1 con pilas 100 % alperujo y volteo manual, T 2 con pilas 100 % alperujo y aireación forzada, T 3 con pilas 75 % alperujo y 25 % chips de poda y volteo manual, y T 4 con pilas 75 % alperujo y 25 % chips de poda con aireación forzada combinada con volteo manual. Los tratamientos con el agente estructurante (T 3 y T 4) alcanzaron la etapa termofílica al séptimo día; en cambio, T 1 y T 2 a los veintiún días de compostaje. Sin embargo, esta fase termofílica duró 130 días aproximadamente en T 1, T 3 y T 4 : mientras que en T 2 duró 30 días, con {{posterior}} descenso de las temperaturas en las pilas de compostaje. Esto marca diferencias entre los tratamientos, demostrando que el alperujo no {{puede ser}} tratado sólo con aireación forzada, pues este sistema facilita la compactación del residuo. Four composting systems for aerobic treatment of olive residues were evaluated during 140 days: T 1 <b>with</b> <b>windrows</b> 100 % olive residues and manual turning, T 2 <b>with</b> <b>windrows</b> 100 % olive residues and forced aeration, T 3 <b>with</b> <b>windrows</b> 75 % olive residues and 25 % chips pruning and manual turning, and T 4 <b>with</b> <b>windrows</b> 75 % olive residues and 25 % pruning chips with forced aeration combined with manual turning. Treatments with bulking agent (T 3 and T 4) reached thermophilic phase at the seventh day, whereas T 1 and T 2 at the twenty-first day of composting. Thermophilic phase lasted approximately 130 days in T 1, T 3 and T 4, while in T 2 lasted 30 days. A subsequent {{drop in the}} temperature of compost windrows was observed. Noticeable differences among treatments were found demonstrating that olive residues can not be treated exclusively with forced aeration since this system facilitates the compaction of the wastes...|$|R

Both commercial duty and homeowner models exist, with varying engine power options, size of cutting decks, fuel type (gasoline or diesel), and prices. A z-turn mower typically drives faster and costs more than a similarly sized conventional riding mower that has steerable front wheels.|$|R

50|$|Numerous Feldgeister {{are known}} in German folklore, some shaped as animals, some in human form.

Either it is killed by cutting the grain heads, threshing the corn or it is brought to the village in a ceremonial manner, shaped as a corn doll. Direct contact to the Feldgeist causes illness.|$|R
