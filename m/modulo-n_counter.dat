40|$|Various delay-insensitive {{circuits}} for modulo-N counters are formally derived and analyzed. Modulo-N counters {{are used}} in many circuit designs and have a simple specification, but allow for a surprising variety of decompositions into networks of basic components. We present three decompositions in detail. Along the way we explai our correctness criteria and show to analyze the area complexity and response time of each decomposition. Our final decomposition for the <b>modulo-N</b> <b>counter</b> has optimal area complexity of (logN) and optimal response time of (1) ...|$|E
40|$|In this {{tutorial}} {{paper we}} survey {{some of the}} existing techniques for modelling, analysis and synthesis of asynchronous control circuits. All these methods {{are based on the}} use of Petri nets as a tool for describing the behaviour of such circuits. The descriptive power of Petri nets allows them to model a wide range of asynchronous circuit components, whether they are built in the two-phase (micropipeline) or in the four-phase (logic gate based) design styles. We present three different approaches to verification of net-based models, and show their relative strengths and weaknesses. We advocate their complementary application for different classes of Petri nets and the properties verified. Two major synthesis approaches are demonstrated using the example of a <b>modulo-N</b> Up/Down <b>counter.</b> The first one is a combination of Petri net level decompositions and syntax-directed translation of nets into circuits. The second one is based on logic synthesis from Signal Transition Graph specification [...] ...|$|R
40|$|With a view {{to display}} a Digital Clock through digital {{circuits}} using <b>modulo-n</b> (mod-n) <b>counters,</b> a circuit diagram was designed and implemented it through multi simulation software. In the similar manner the time digits were displayed on seven segment displays at 8255 programmable peripheral interface (PPI) ports through 8051 microcontroller, the time digits (hours, minutes and seconds) were connected to the first 8255 PPI and the date digits (Years, months and days) were connected to second 8255 PPI. The detailed circuit diagram was given to understand the construction details of the circuit. The loop in a loop technique of assembly language program was used to display date and time. After displaying a year, month and day on the date displays through main program, it calls 1 day subroutine to display time in 24 hours clock. The 1 day subroutine calls 1 second delay subroutine to change the digits in seconds display. After completion of 24 hours time, the digit will be changed in the days display to indicate the next date. After completion of 31 days in the first month, the main program calls month subroutine to change the digit in the months display. Precautions were taken to change the digits in months display for January 31 days, February 28 days, March 31 days, April 30 days, May 31 days, June 30 days, July 31 days, August 31 days, September 30 days, October 31 days, November 30 days and December 31 days. After completion of a month, {{there will be a}} change in years digit and this process will be repeated continuousl...|$|R
