5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, Nasser nationalized all {{remaining}} British and French {{assets in}} Egypt, including the tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and phosphate industries. When efforts to offer tax incentives and attract outside investments yielded no tangible results, he nationalized more companies and made them {{a part of his}} economic development organization. He stopped short of total government control: two-thirds of the economy was still in private hands. This effort achieved a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>success,</b> with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization. Nasser initiated the Helwan steelworks, which subsequently became Egypt's largest enterprise, providing the country with product {{and tens of thousands of}} jobs. Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.|$|E
5|$|During the Polish–Russian War of 1792 in Defense of the Constitution, the Polish forces {{supporting}} the Constitution, {{fought against the}} army of the Russian Empire, invited by the pro-Russian alliance of Polish magnates, known as the treasonous Targowica Confederation. The conservative nobility (see also, szlachta) believed that the Russians would help them restore their Golden Liberty. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, the badly outnumbered Polish pro-Constitution forces fought under Prince Józef Poniatowski a defensive war with some <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>success,</b> but were ordered to abandon their efforts by their supreme commander, King Stanisław August Poniatowski. The King decided to join the Targowica Confederation, as demanded by the Russians.|$|E
5|$|Operation Donnerkeil {{had been}} an {{outstanding}} success for the Luftwaffe. The <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> lay not in the ratio of losses, which amounted to 2:1 in the German favour, but {{the failure of the}} RAF, FAA and Royal Navy to intercept or at least inflict severe damage to the German warships. The meagre forces committed by the Navy had been repulsed easily by the German warships and their escorts. Heavy AAA fire had offered a helpful defence against air attack, but the German air defence had succeeded, along with poor weather, in breaking up RAF assaults on the ships. Galland, responsible for the plan, called it the high point of his career.|$|E

5|$|The athletes or teams who place first, second, {{or third}} in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now {{gold-plated}} silver. Every gold medal however must contain {{at least six}} grams of pure gold. The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a single-elimination tournament (most notably boxing), third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the 1896 Olympics only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics. From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths. The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won, but National Olympic Committees and the media record medal statistics as a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Zulu {{military}} {{system was}} to transform large swathes of the continent, from south east Africa, into parts of East and Central Africa through the disruptive warfare that broke {{out during the}} reign of Zulu king Shaka. The disruption, known as the Mfecane had several causes, but it was to create several powerful nations in its wake, such as the Swazi, the Nebebele, the Shangaan and others. Many of these new powers copied Zulu methods, weapons and tactics, and saw a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> against both indigenous and foreign opponents.

During the late reign of Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), he married the sister of Constantine Barbaros, the Emperor's powerful parakoimomenos, and rose to the post of Domestic of the Schools.

At the same time, the land around Caesarea was again overrun by the Turks, forcing Romanos to spend precious time and energy in expelling the Turks from Cappadocia. Romanos managed to pacify the province, and marched towards the Euphrates via Melitene, crossing at Romanopolis, {{in the hope of}} retaking Akhlat on Lake Van to protect the Armenian frontier. The Turks were hemmed in within the mountains of Cilicia, but they managed to escape to Aleppo after abandoning their plunder.

40|$|The Nature Conservancy (TNC) {{works to}} protect the {{viability}} of ecological resources in conservation areas with high biological diversity. The Etowah River basin in north Georgia was chosen by TNC as a priority site based on the high aquatic biological diversity in the watershed. Sprawling suburban development from metro Atlanta is rapidly encroaching the watershed and results in major stresses to the aquatic life in the basin. Significant sources of stress in the Etowah include residential and commercial development, water supply development, and road and utility development. TNC develops a conservation area plan for each site where it works. The plan identifies targets that represent the biodiversity of the ecosystem, the stresses that negatively impact the targets, strategies {{to protect the}} targets, and <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> to monitor {{the status of the}} targets and effectiveness of the threat abatement strategies. <b>Measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> are relatively new to the planning process, and the Etowah was chosen by TNC to be a case study to develop <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> for head-water rivers of the Southeastern United States. <b>Measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> are being developed to determine status of resources and protection strategies in the Etowah River basin. The “resource” measures include physical/hydrological measures, biological measures, and landscape measures.
