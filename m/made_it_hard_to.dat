5|$|Local {{opinion was}} heavily against Thornton. Pamphlets were sold {{purporting}} to show Thornton's guilt, and poems were composed {{with the same}} theme. The defendant's solicitor complained of these, alleging it <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find an unbiased jury. On 8 August 1817, people filled {{the street in front}} of County Hall in Warwick, where the trial was to take place. When the judge, Sir George Sowley Holroyd (a justice of the Court of King's Bench) began proceedings at 8a.m., people rushed to fill the available seating, and the public benches remained full throughout the one-day trial. Because of the nature of the evidence, women were not permitted to witness the trial.|$|E
5|$|Nowhere was demobilization more of {{a problem}} than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much {{remained}} to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty {{about the future of the}} laboratory <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years. Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.|$|E
5|$|Team 3D's {{feud with}} the X Division {{continued}} into Final Resolution. The two teams fought {{again on the}} December 6, 2007 episode of Impact! in a Six Man Tag Team Ladder match, which Johnny Devine and Team 3D won. On the December 20, 2007 episode of Impact!, Jay Lethal and MCMG defeated Devine and Team 3D in a Double North Pole match to determine the stipulation to their match at Final Resolution; choosing an Ultimate X match over a Plate glass Tables match. On the January 3, 2008 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked and injured MCMG in the storyline by beating their hands with kendo sticks, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> compete in an Ultimate X match in storyline. At Final Resolution, Devine and Team 3D won the bout. The feud {{came to an end}} at Against All Odds, where Lethal and MCMG defeated Devine and Team 3D in a Street Fight to save the X Division from disbandment.|$|E

50|$|In {{the study}} of aging, Patrick Rabbitt {{proposed}} an effortfulness hypothesis in the 1960s: that as their hearing became less acute with age, people would require additional effort to make out what was said and that this effort <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> remember <b>it.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Clan Class {{was based}} upon the Britannia Class design, {{incorporating}} a smaller boiler and various weight-saving measures to increase the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive for its intended area of operations, the west of Scotland. The Clan Class received a mixed reception from crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving favourable reports as regards performance. However, trials {{in other areas of}} the British Railways network returned negative feedback, a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming the locomotive <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> adhere to timetables. Reports exist that suggest a degree of the disappointment with these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to Class 7 work where they were only a Class 6 in reality; a problem put down to their very similar appearance to the BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It {{took a long}} time to set up, so it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{radioactivity}} of thorium and uranium <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> determine {{what was happening}} when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called hesperium and ausonium. The chemist Ida Noddack criticised this work, suggesting {{that some of the}} experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium, and its claim to have discovered masurium (technetium) was disputed. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.|$|E
5000|$|The JTRS {{program was}} beset by delays and cost overruns, {{particularly}} Ground Mobile Radios (GMR), run by Boeing. [...] Problems included a decentralized management structure, changing requirements, and unexpected technical difficulties that increased {{size and weight}} goals that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> add the required waveforms.|$|R
50|$|This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> {{interface}} other processors. Upgrading to a {{more powerful}} processor would subtly change the timings, and timing restraints were not always tightly specified. Nor were electrical parameters and physical dimensions. They usually used edge-connectors for the bus, which were vulnerable to dirt and vibration.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{discourage}} photocopying of the newsletter, {{a portion of}} the DTACK Grounded newsletter was printed on dark red paper. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> photocopy those pages. This section of the newsletter was called [...] "the Redlands". It typically contained the assembly source code for high performance math subroutines.|$|R
5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E
5|$|Before 1854, {{the area}} based around Bridgeton {{was a strong}} {{business}} and legal section in Cape May County. The local residents there, however, {{wanted to have a}} strong banking industry, but a local named Richard Holmes along with several other locals turned to the strong type of enterprise, a turnpike company. Holmes and the locals began a local turnpike syndicate with other businessmen and began the Cape May Turnpike Company upon incorporation in 1854. The turnpike company, upon incorporation, was to build a toll road along roughly the U.S. Route 9 corridor. Progress in constructing the toll road was slow at first, with subscribers from Cape May County being hesitant to buy stock from the turnpike company. A friend of Richard Holmes, Wilmon Whilldin, owned a steamboat company in Cape May and apologized for not buying stock in the company. Citing the Panic of 1857 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> convert securities to cash, Whilldin suggested that a steamboat would be more profitable than the turnpike. The money from the steamboat would go ahead and helped the financially depressed businesses in local communities.|$|E

25|$|During the 2013–14 season, Lidström had {{his number}} 5 jersey retired by the Red Wings.

The Red Wings officially retired his number on 6 March 2014, in a pre-game ceremony at Joe Louis Arena.|$|E
25|$|After {{nationalisation}} in 1948, {{the pace}} of rundown quickened. It {{was regarded as a}} duplicate line, and control over the through London-Glasgow route was split over several regions which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> plan popular through services. Mining subsidence affected speeds through the East Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1962, the Thames–Clyde Express travelling via the S took almost nine hours from London to Glasgow – over the West Coast Main Line the journey length was 7 hours 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Eurocom ported a {{compressed}} and scaled down {{version for}} the Game Boy. It was hindered {{by the lack}} of color, lack of graphical detail due to both processor and small screen size, choppy animations, and a lack of buttons, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> control. This version was also ported to the Game Gear, which included color graphics, but still suffered from all of the other problems of the Game Boy version. A direct port of the Game Gear version was also brought to the Sega Master System, but only in Brazil. However, it only has 4 levels, and the boss in What The Heck? is missing.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, glacial {{recession}} has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> ascend the Umbwe Route {{followed by the}} Heim Glacier. Just left of the glacier, the Breach Wall was considered the hardest route on Kilimanjaro (featuring a 100 m high vertical icicle). Further left again, the Western Breach (Arrow Glacier) Route provides an easy scrambling route to the crater.|$|R
5000|$|Bert Hagels speculates Ries {{made this}} {{decision}} because he regarded {{the work as}} an occasional piece; certainly its need for two highly skilled horn players would have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> market compared with his solo concertos.

50|$|In the 1950s, a Zaghawa schoolteacher named Adam Tajir {{created an}} {{alphabet}} for the Zaghawa language {{that was based}} on the clan identification marks (brands). Sometimes known as the camel alphabet, he based the phoneme choice on the Arabic language rather than on Zaghawa. Also, some of the marks were longer than others, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> use <b>it</b> as a computer font.|$|R
25|$|During his {{original}} trial, Reynolds had challenged two jurors, {{both of whom}} stated that they had formed an opinion on the guilt or innocence of Reynolds before the trial. The court held that universal education and press reports <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find jurors who had not formed some opinion. It found that Reynolds had {{failed to meet the}} requirement that he, as challenger of a juror's objectivity, demonstrate that a juror had developed a real and strong opinion. The prosecution had discharged two potential jurors who refused to say {{whether or not they were}} living in polygamy. The Court held that it would not overturn a case based on the legality of challenges to dismissed jurors.|$|E
25|$|A joint {{commission}} of residents of both Sussex and Wantage had {{recommended that the}} two communities should be consolidated to form what would be called the Township of Sussex-Wantage, which would operate within the Faulkner Act under the Council-Manager form of government, with a mayor and a six-member township council, and that voters in both municipalities should approve a referendum to be held on November 3, 2009. The committee noted that the two municipalities share common issues, schools, library and community services and that the artificial nature of the octagonal Sussex border often <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between the two. The efforts at consolidation with surrounding Wantage Township ended in November 2009 after Wantage voters rejected the merger despite support from Sussex borough residents.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Elijah Muhammad's death in 1975, there were 75 NOI centers across America. The Nation's {{leadership}} chose Wallace Muhammad, also known as Warith Deen Mohammad, the fifth of Elijah's sons—not Farrakhan—as the new Supreme Minister. At the time, Nation of Islam was founded upon the principles of self-reliance and black supremacy, a belief that mainstream Muslims consider heretical. He shunned his father's theology and black pride views, forging closer ties with mainstream Muslim communities {{in an attempt to}} transition the Nation of Islam into orthodoxy more similar to Sunni Islam. Under W. D. Mohammed's leadership, the Nation of Islam decentralized into many bodies of followers led by many different leaders. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> track the exact number of NOI members, but it is estimated to have been in the tens of thousands.|$|E
60|$|The Marches {{tried to}} make out their son's face; they {{believed}} that they did; but they decided {{that they had not}} seen him, and his mother said that she was glad; it would only have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> bear, though she was glad he had come over to say good-by it had seemed so unnatural that he should not, when everybody else was saying good-by.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} normal {{practice}} for local government electoral wards {{to be used}} as building blocks for constituencies, although there is no legislative requirement to do so. In Scotland, the introduction of multi-member wards in 2007 has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> do so, since these wards each have a large electorate, and therefore a collection of complete wards may not give an electorate that is close to the required average.|$|R
5000|$|Cromwells {{were used}} as the main tank in the {{armoured}} brigades of the 7th Armoured Division, while {{being used in the}} armoured reconnaissance regiments of the other British armoured divisions (Guards Armoured Division and 11th Armoured Division) in North-west Europe. It excelled at this task because of its speed and low profile. [...] The tank was praised for its speed and reliability, while its low profile <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> spot.|$|R
25|$|The Me 262 was {{difficult}} to counter because its high speed and rate of climb <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> intercept. However, as with other turbojet engines at the time, the Me 262's engines did not provide sufficient thrust at low air speeds and throttle response was slow, meaning in certain circumstances such as takeoff and landing, the aircraft became a vulnerable target. Another disadvantage that pioneering jet aircraft of the World War II era shared, was the high risk of compressor stall and if throttle movements were too rapid, the engine(s) could suffer a flame out. The coarse opening of the throttle would cause fuel surging and lead to excessive jet pipe temperatures. Pilots were instructed to operate the throttle gently and avoid quick changes. German engineers introduced an automatic throttle regulator later in the war but it only partly alleviated the problem.|$|E
25|$|Towards 1:00 pm, in {{the thick}} mix of gun smoke and fog {{covering}} the field, the king was separated from his fellow riders and suffered multiple shots. A bullet crushed his left arm below the elbow. Almost simultaneously his horse suffered a shot to the neck that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> control. In the mix of fog and smoke from the burning town of Lützen the king rode astray behind enemy lines. There he sustained yet another shot in the back, was stabbed and fell from his horse. Lying on the ground, he received a final, fatal shot to the temple. His fate remained unknown for some time. However, when the gunnery paused and the smoke cleared, his horse was spotted between the two lines, Gustavus himself not on it and nowhere to be seen. His disappearance stopped the initiative of the hitherto successful Swedish right wing, while a search was conducted. His partly stripped body was found {{an hour or two}} later, and was secretly evacuated from the field in a Swedish artillery wagon.|$|E
500|$|In 2007 Ionescu-Caion's {{name was}} {{returned}} to circulation, amidst allegations of plagiarism brought up against philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu. Writer Andrei Pleșu defended Liiceanu against his accusers at Ziua daily, and argued that Romania was still [...] "Caion's land". Noting that Caion had entered press history with a mârlănie ("yokel's deed"), Pleșu described Ziua journalism as partisanship and [...] "hysteria", assessing that Romania was going through [...] "an epileptic fit". [...] Liiceanu critic Gheorghe Grigurcu also took distance from the Ziua accusers, noting that their [...] "libel", [...] "puerile" [...] in content, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> sustain a serious debate about Liiceanu's faults.|$|E
5|$|Clinton said Republican {{amendments}} would {{strip the}} U.S. Treasury {{of its ability}} to dip into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis. Republican amendments would have limited appeals by death-row inmates, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> issue health, safety and environmental regulations, and would have committed the president to a seven-year balanced budget. Clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires.|$|R
50|$|The No 3 {{had several}} problems; it was {{difficult}} to manufacture, as it required precision and was made up of many parts. Another problem occurred with the detonators; like the No 1 Grenade, the No 3 needed a special detonator that was difficult to manufacture. This detonator was also used in the No 2 grenade and was very similar to the one in the No 1 Grenade, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> mass-produce.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1992-1993 school year, as part of {{a continual}} process to cut back on {{services}} due to a {{decrease in the number of}} priests and brothers, the Salesians announced that the school would be closing, a revelation that caused an uproar in the community. The decline <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> keep up facilities, and an increase in costs in areas such as healthcare needed to take care of an aging priest population.|$|R
