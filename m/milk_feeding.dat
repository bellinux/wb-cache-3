40|$|Background. There is {{a growing}} {{literature}} that links greater duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding to beneficial effects on adult health outcomes. Muscle growth in the neonatal period may be very sensitive to variations in early nutrition, but {{little is known about}} long-term effects of infant feeding on muscle strength. Methods. In 2, 983 community-dwelling older men and women born 1931 - 1939, we examined the relationship between their type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> in infancy and their muscle strength in adult life. Information about <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> for each participant was abstracted from their infant record; grip strength was measured using a Jamar dynamometer. Results. Sixty percent (1, 783) of the participants were breastfed only, 31 % (926) were breast-and bottle-fed, and 9 % (274) were bottle-fed only. There were no differences in type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> between men and women or according to social class at birth. Among the men studied, grip strength was related to the type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding,</b> such that greater exposure to breast milk in infancy was associated with greater grip strength in adult life (p =. 023). This association remained after adjustment for the effects of a range of confounding influences (birthweight, infant growth, height, age at measurement, adult diet, and level of physical activity). In contrast, the type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> in infancy was not related to grip strength among the women studied (p =. 807). Conclusions. These data suggest that in men, differences in nutritional exposure in the early postnatal period may have lifelong implications for muscle strength. © 2012 The Author...|$|E

30|$|Coinciding {{with this}} {{decrease}} in support {{was an increase}} in <b>milk</b> and <b>feed</b> price volatility. One measure of the variation of <b>milk</b> and <b>feed</b> prices at the farm level is income over feed cost, a commonly used proxy for dairy farm profitability. The margin between <b>milk</b> price and <b>feed</b> cost is the amount available to pay for all other expenses, including labor and returns to management, capital, and unpaid labor. Measuring income over feed cost as the US all milk price less a weighted cost for corn and soybeans from 1990 through 2012, this monthly income over feed cost measure averaged $ 11 per hundredweight. From 1990 through 1999 the monthly coefficient of variation—the standard deviation divided by the mean as a measure of percent variation—of this margin was 13.6 %. From 2000 through 2012 the coefficient of variation increased to 20.4 %. This variation in profit margin occurred because variation increased in both the <b>milk</b> and <b>feed</b> prices. Increased volatility in <b>milk</b> and <b>feed</b> prices in recent years has financially stressed many dairy farms and led to calls for government programs to assist them.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} {{association}} between duration of breast <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> and cognitive ability at 7 - 8 years in a birth cohort of very low birthweight infants.  DESIGN— 280 survivors from a national birth cohort of 413 New Zealand very low birthweight infants born in 1986 were assessed at age 7 - 8 years on measures of verbal and performance intelligence quotient (IQ) using the WISC-R. At the same time mothers were questioned {{as to whether they}} had elected to provide expressed breast milk at birth and the total duration of breast <b>milk</b> <b>feeding.</b>  RESULTS—Some 73 % of mothers provided expressed breast milk and 37 % breast fed for four months or longer. Increasing duration of breast <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> was associated with increases in both verbal IQ (p < 0. 001) and performance IQ (p < 0. 05) : children breast fed for eight months or longer had mean (SD) verbal IQ scores that were 10. 2 (0. 56) points higher and performance IQ scores that were 6. 2 (0. 35) points higher than children who did not receive breast milk. These differences were substantially reduced after control for selection factors associated with receipt of breast milk. Nevertheless, even after control for confounding, there remained a significant (p < 0. 05) association between duration of breast <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> and verbal IQ: children breast fed for eight months or longer had adjusted mean (SD) verbal IQ scores that were 6 (0. 36) points higher than the scores of those who did not receive breast milk.  CONCLUSIONS—These findings add to a growing body of evidence to suggest that breast <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> may have small long term benefits for child cognitive development. ...|$|E
40|$|Breast milk is {{the optimal}} {{nutrition}} for most infants who are cared {{for in the}} high-risk location of a neonatal intensive care unit. As many of these infants cannot be fed by mouth and must be fed by a gavage feeding tube due to prematurity or other medical conditions, their mothers must express breast milk, which allows {{for the possibility that}} the wrong breast milk could be given to an infant. The NICU at the University of Virginia recently had an incident of breast milk being given to the wrong infant. A multidisciplinary project team was developed and a root cause analysis was performed.

40|$|Background The timeous {{achievement}} of full enteral nutrition in a preterm infant {{is a critical}} prerequisite for optimal growth, neurodevelopment and long-term wellbeing. However, the optimal enteral feeding regimen for preterm infants has not been established, and wide variations occur in practice.

Infants fed with human milk passed a greater number and softer stools than those who received cows' milk formula. In the absence of <b>milk</b> <b>feeds</b> an intrinsic pattern of large bowel motor activity, present as early as 25 weeks' gestation, ensures a defecation rate of one stool each day.

In a historical cohort, adult health behaviours were examined in relation to type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> in infancy. From 1931 to 1939, records were kept on all infants born in Hertfordshire, UK. Their type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> was summarised as breastfed only, breast and bottle-fed, or bottle-fed only. Information about adult health behaviours was collected from 3217 of these men and women when they were aged 59 – 73 years. Diet was assessed using an administered FFQ; the key dietary pattern was a ‘prudent’ pattern that described compliance with ‘healthy’ eating recommendations. Of the study population, 60 % {{of the men and women}} were breastfed, 31 % were breast and bottle-fed, and 9 % were bottle-fed. Type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> did not differ according to social class at birth, and was not related to social class attained in adult life. There were no differences in smoking status, alcohol intake or reported physical activity according to type of <b>milk</b> <b>feeding,</b> but there were differences in the participants' dietary patterns. In a multivariate model that included sex and infant weight gain, there were independent associations between type of feeding and prudent diet scores in adult life (P= 0 · 009), such that higher scores were associated with having been breastfed.

This thesis investigated the effects of various <b>milk</b> <b>feeding</b> and weaning methods on the calves ’ behaviour, intake and weight gain. In paper I calves were fed from an automatic milk feeder. It was found that gradual weaning over 14 days reduced the occurrence of cross-sucking immediately after weaning and it stimulated the calves to eat more concentrate during weaning compared to abrupt weaning. A high milk allowance (9. 2 vs. 4. 8 litres) reduced the number and duration of unrewarded visits and thus reduced individual calves ’ occupancy of the feeder. In paper II calves were fed milk from teat-bars with either a common milk compartment for all teats or a separate milk compartments for every teat. The teat-bar design {{did not affect the}} variation in milk intake within the groups, but a teat-bar with separate compartments increased the teat switching while there was still milk left in {{one or more of the}} compartments.
