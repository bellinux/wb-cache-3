5|$|Rhodocene {{exists as}} , a {{paramagnetic}} 19-valence electron radical <b>monomer</b> only {{at or below}} −196°C (liquid nitrogen temperatures) or above 150°C in the gas phase. It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered metallocene sandwich structure. At room temperature (25°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms 2, a diamagnetic 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure. Electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point {{to the presence of}} an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the <b>monomer</b> possesses a high order axis of symmetry (Cn, n>2) with a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the <b>monomer</b> does possess the typical sandwich structure of a metallocene although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the <b>monomer</b> has also been studied by mass spectrometry. The dimerisation is a redox process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the <b>monomer</b> has a rhodium(II) centre. Rhodium typically occupies oxidation states +I or +III in its stable compounds.|$|E

40|$|We {{isolated}} hydroxyproline-rich extensin precursors from suspension-cultured tomato, cucumber, and sycamore-maple by salt-elution of intact {{cells and}} cell wall preparations. Cation exchange chromatography and HPLC gel filtration resolved these precursors into monomeric and oligomeric fractions, confirmed by amino acid analysis, immunological cross-reactivity, and TEM visualization. After rotary shadowing <b>monomers</b> appeared as flexuous rods with a contour length of 70 to 100 nanometers and a `persistence length' (maximum linear displacement) of 44 to 51 nanometers. Oligomers were larger branched assemblies with occasional pores. Native extensin <b>monomers</b> gave uniform gel filtration retention times (Rts), but the Rts of HF-deglycosylated <b>monomers</b> varied depending on concentration, implying ionic {{interaction between the}} highly basic deglycosylated <b>monomers</b> and a weakly cationic gel matrix. Succinylation of the deglycosylated <b>monomers</b> reversed the net charge, and restored the retention time to that of glycosylated <b>monomers,</b> confirming the ionic interaction. Succinylation enhanced visualization of the deglycosylated <b>monomers,</b> which previously were barely discernible flexuous rods. The persistence length:contour length ratios of succinylated deglycosylated <b>monomers</b> (tomato sdP 2) and glycosylated <b>monomers</b> (sP 2) were the same, implying a similar molecular flexibility for both glycosylated and deglycosylated <b>monomers</b> at room temperature. These molecular properties are consistent with suggestions that extensin <b>monomers</b> reptate into the wall as a transmural protein `weft' which becomes progressively cross-linked forming a network penetrated by the cellulose `warp. ...|$|R

5|$|Fischer and {{co-workers}} also studied {{the chemistry of}} iridocene, the third transition series analogue of rhodocene and cobaltocene, finding the chemistry of rhodocene and iridocene are generally similar. The synthesis of numerous iridocenium salts including the tribromide and hexafluorophosphate have been described. Just as with rhodocene, iridocene dimerises at room temperature but a <b>monomer</b> form can be detected at low temperatures and in gas phase and IR, NMR, and ESR measurements indicate a chemical equilibrium is present and confirm the sandwich structure of the iridocene <b>monomer.</b> The complex , the analogue of rhodocene derivative reported by Fischer, has also been studied and demonstrates properties consistent with {{a greater degree of}} π-backbonding in iridium(I) systems than is found in the analogous cobalt(I) or rhodium(I) cases.|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet {{light is}} known {{to be one of the}} most {{efficient}} methods to initiatc polymeric reactions in the presence of a photonitiator. Photopolymerizations are advantageous because the chemistry of the materials can be tailored to design liquid <b>monomers</b> for ultrarapid polymerization into a solid polymer material. One way to achieve rapid photopolymerizations is to utilize multifunctional (meth) acrylate <b>monomers.</b> which form highly crosslinked polymers; however, these <b>monomers</b> typically do not achieve complete functional group conversion. Recently, Decker et al. developed novel monovinyl acrylate <b>monomers</b> that display polyriicrization kinetics that rival those of multifunctional acrylate <b>monomers.</b> These novel acrylate <b>monomers</b> incorporate secondary functionalities and end groups such as carbonates, carbamates, cyclic carbonates and oxazolidone which promote the increased polymerization kinetics of these <b>monomers.</b> In addition to thc polynierization kinetics, these novel monovinyl <b>monomers</b> form crosslinked polymers, which are characterized by having high strength and high flexibility. Unfortunately, the exact mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the polymerization kinetics and crosslinking are not well understood...|$|R

The synthesized <b>monomers</b> and the polymers have been characterized with NMR spectroscopy. The latter is utilized to study the polymer composition and verify the distribution of the <b>monomers</b> in the copolymer chain. The reactivity ratios have been estimated and concluded moderately random distribution of the <b>monomers</b> in the copolymer chain...|$|R
5|$|The {{primary use}} of acetic acid is the {{production}} of vinyl acetate <b>monomer</b> (VAM). In 2008, this application was estimated to consume {{a third of the}} world's production of acetic acid.

The mature SP-A1 <b>monomer</b> is a 35kDa protein that differs from SP-A2 in four amino acids at the coding region. The structure of SP-A1 monomers {{consists of four}} domains: an N-terminal, a collagen-like domain, a neck region, and a carbohydrate recognition domain. The C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) allows binding to various types of microorganisms and molecules.|$|E
5|$|SP-A1 <b>monomers</b> {{group with}} other SP-A1 or SP-A2 <b>monomers</b> in trimeric {{structural}} subunits of 105kDa. Six of these structures group in 630 kDa structures that resemble flower bouquets. These oligomers contain {{a total of}} eighteen SP-A1 and/or SP-A2 <b>monomers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Heterocyclic <b>monomers</b> {{that are}} cationically {{polymerized}} are lactones, lactams, and cyclic amines. Upon addition of an initiator, cyclic <b>monomers</b> {{go on to}} form linear polymers. The reactivity of heterocyclic <b>monomers</b> depends on their ring strain. <b>Monomers</b> with large ring strain, such as oxirane, are more reactive than 1,3-dioxepane which has considerably less ring strain. Rings that are six-membered and larger {{are less likely to}} polymerize due to lower ring strain.|$|R
5|$|The biopolymers that {{comprise}} DNA, RNA and (poly)peptides are linear polymers (i.e.: each <b>monomer</b> {{is connected to}} at most two other monomers). The sequence of their monomers effectively encodes information. The transfers of information described by the central dogma ideally are faithful, deterministic transfers, wherein one biopolymer's sequence {{is used as a}} template for the construction of another biopolymer with a sequence that is entirely dependent on the original biopolymer's sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{paratope}} {{is shaped}} at the amino terminal {{end of the}} antibody <b>monomer</b> by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The variable domain is {{also referred to as}} the FV region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. To be specific, variable loops of β-strands, there each on the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs).|$|E
5|$|Each <b>monomer</b> of the serpin {{aggregate}} {{exists in}} the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other proteopathies (e.g. prion diseases) via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in cell death and tissue damage. In the case of antitrypsin deficiency, antitrypsin polymers cause the death of liver cells, sometimes resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis. Within the cell, serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, {{the details of how}} serpin polymers cause cell death remains to be fully understood.|$|E
40|$|Acanthamoeba actophorin is {{a member}} of ADF/cofilin family that binds both actin <b>monomers</b> and filaments. We used {{fluorescence}} anisotropy to study the interaction of actin <b>monomers</b> with recombinant actophorin labeled with rhodamine on a cysteine substituted for Serine- 88. Labeled actophorin retains its affinity for actin and ability to reduce the low shear viscosity of actin filaments. At physiological ionic strength, actophorin binds Mg-ADP-actin <b>monomers</b> (K d � 0. 1 �M) 40 times stronger than Mg-ATP-actin <b>monomers.</b> When bound to actin <b>monomers,</b> actophorin has no effect on elongation at either end of actin filaments by Mg-ATP-actin and slightly increases the rate of elongation at both ends by Mg-ADP-actin. Thus actophorin does not sequester actin <b>monomers.</b> Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation shows that actophorin and profilin compete for binding actin <b>monomers.</b> Actophorin and profilin have opposite effects on the rate of exchange of nucleotide bound to actin <b>monomers.</b> Despite the high affinity of actophorin for ADP-actin, physiological concentrations of profilin overcome the inhibition of ADP exchange by actophorin. Profilin rapidly recycles ADP-actin back to the profilin-ATP-actin pool ready for elongation of actin filaments...|$|R

Sizes range from just 62 amino acid {{residues}}, for the <b>monomer</b> of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase. Only {{a small portion of}} their structure (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis: the catalytic site. This catalytic site is located next to one or more binding sites where residues orient the substrates. The catalytic site and binding site together comprise the enzyme's active site. The remaining majority of the enzyme structure serves to maintain the precise orientation and dynamics of the active site.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin <b>monomer</b> contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E

40|$|We have {{chemically}} modified {{a fraction of}} the <b>monomers</b> in actin filaments, and then measured the effects on the functional interaction of myosin with unmodified <b>monomers</b> within the same filament. Two modifications were used: (a) covalent attachment of various amounts of myosin subfragment- 1 (S 1) with the bifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate and (b) copolymerization of unmodified actin <b>monomers</b> with <b>monomers</b> cross-linked internally with 1 -ethyl- 3 -(dimethylaminopropyl) -carbodiimide. Each of these modifications abolished the interaction of the modified <b>monomers</b> with myosin, so the remaining interactions were exclusively with unmodified <b>monomers.</b> The two modifications had similar effects on the interaction of actin with myosin in solution: decreased affinity of myosin heads for unmodified actin <b>monomers,</b> without a change in the Vmax of actin-activated myosin ATPase activity. However, modification (b) produced much greater inhibition of actin sliding on a myosin-coated surface, as measured by an in vitro motility assay.

5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated <b>monomer</b> during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E

A statistical copolymer in which the probability of finding {{a particular type of}} <b>monomer</b> residue at a particular point in the chain is independent of the types of surrounding <b>monomer</b> residue may be referred to as a truly random copolymer (structure 3).

Additionally, the polymer films are found to be electrochromic, changing from yellow in the neutral form, to a light green intermediate state at low levels of oxidation, and finally to a dark gray-blue upon oxidation. A photochromic response associated with the light induced tautomerization of the anil functionality is observed in powder form for two of the <b>monomers,</b> although no photochromic response is observed for the polymers in thin film form.

For the block copolymenzation, the <b>monomers</b> should be added in the order of methacrylate, acrylate and acrylonitrile.
