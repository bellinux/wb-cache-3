40|$|Abstract Background Small {{intestinal}} {{bacterial overgrowth}} (SIBO) {{is characterized by}} excessive proliferation of colonic bacterial species in the small bowel. Potential causes of SIBO include fistulae, strictures or motility disturbances. Hence, patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) are especially predisposed to develop SIBO. As result, CD patients may experience malabsorption and report symptoms such as weight loss, watery diarrhea, <b>meteorism,</b> flatulence and abdominal pain, mimicking acute flare in these patients. Methods One-hundred-fifty patients with CD reporting increased stool frequency, <b>meteorism</b> and/or abdominal pain were prospectively evaluated for SIBO with the Hydrogen Glucose Breath Test (HGBT). Results Thirty-eight patients (25. 3 %) were diagnosed with SIBO based on positive findings at HGBT. SIBO patients reported {{a higher rate of}} abdominal complaints and exhibited increased stool frequency (5. 9 vs. 3. 7 bowel movements/day, p = 0. 003) and lower body weight (63. 6 vs 70. 4 kg, p = 0. 014). There was no correlation with the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. SIBO was significantly more frequent in patients with partial resection of the colon or multiple intestinal surgeries; there was also a clear trend in patients with ileocecal resection that did not reach statistical significance. SIBO rate was also higher in patients with affection of both the colon and small bowel, while inflammation of the (neo) terminal ileum again showed only tendential association with the development of SIBO. Conclusion SIBO represents a frequently ignored yet clinically relevant complication in CD, often mimicking acute flare. Because symptoms of SIBO are often difficult to differentiate from those caused by the underlying disease, targeted work-up is recommended in patients with corresponding clinical signs and predisposing factors. </p...|$|E

Methods: In this controlled, randomized, blind clinical trial, a total of 360 patients with varying subtypes of IBS were randomly treated with 500 mg of mesalazine qid or by standard therapy without mesalazine for a period of 28 days. Pre- and post-treatment pain intensity, pain duration, <b>meteorism,</b> stool abnormalities and endoscopic parameters were monitored, and biopsies or brush biopsies were examined histologically. Results: Treatment of IBS patients with mesalazine significantly reduced intensity and duration of pain in all subtypes of IBS, except for duration of pain in the subtype &ldquo;undifferentiated&rdquo;, where the difference was not significant. In addition, in patients with diarrhea type and undifferentiated type of IBS, mesalazine also significantly reduced the abnormal stool pattern. In comparison to the control group, administration of mesalazine reduced the incidence of endoscopic and cytomorphologic changes of the bowel mucosa, including changes in colon mucus, mucus production, cytologic or histologic parameters, epithelial cell degeneration, appearance of leukocytes and macrophages and cell infiltrations. Conclusion: Mesalazine was effective in reducing several symptoms characteristic of IBS.

40|$|The major aims {{of medical}} therapy in {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) are: a) to ameliorate symptoms (pain, bowel movement abnormalities, bloating) and b) to improve psychological problems of the patients. The first step of IBS therapy is the diet. In fact some forms of IBS can be ascribed to food intolerance. When abdominal pain, <b>meteorism</b> and constipation are the main symptoms, treatment with high-fiber diet, antispastic and antimuscarinic drugs is indicated. Sometimes amitriptyline, an antidepressant which also shows anticholinergic and analgesic properties, can be helpful. When diarrhoea is prevalent, the most effective drug is represented by loperamide. If diarrhoea is related to meal ingestion, antispastic or antimuscarinic drugs can be successfully used. In the case of diarrhoea related to documented cholorrhoea, cholestyramine can be of benefit.

40|$|Introduction: Radiological imaging of the {{gallbladder}} is {{a fundamental}} aspect of assessing severity of acute cholecystitis in addition to guiding the optimal timing of surgical intervention. We present a case of acute severe cholecystitis with massive gallbladder mucocele initially presenting with equivocal and inconclusive clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound findings. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography allowed accurate evaluation of cholelithiasis and demonstrated a massive gallbladder mucocele. Case presentation: A 39 -year-old Caucasian female presented with mild right upper quadrant pain coupled with intermittent epigastric discomfort after meals. Diagnostic abdominal ultrasound could not reliably detect cystic or common bile duct stones due to patient obesity and <b>meteorism.</b> Computed tomography was contraindicated due to severe contrast allergy. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography allowed timely, accurate evaluation of cholelithiasis. This subsequently demonstrated a massive gallbladder mucocele requiring urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Conclusion: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography {{should be considered as}} a complementary imaging modality to assess patients presenting with atypical biliary symptoms, particularly when ultrasound is equivocal or inconclusive, clinical and laboratory findings are non-specific, and computer tomography is contraindicated.

40|$|Postoperative pseudo-obstruction {{is a rare}} {{state of}} {{protracted}} gastrointestinal paresis that may progress to paralysis without the presence of obstructive lesions. Pseudo -obstruction is usually, but not exclusively, associated with an abdominal operative procedure (laparotomy), however, it may occasionally occur following extra-abdominal operations. As differentiated from the usual, 2 ̆ 7 physiologic 2 ̆ 7 postoperative paresis, pseudo-obstruction persists for more than 7 days. The pathogenesis of postoperative pseudo-obstruction is complex and as yet partially unknown. Whereas the 2 ̆ 7 physiologic 2 ̆ 7 postoperative gastrointestinal paresis includes short-term functional cholinergic depression of the visceral organs, in pseudo-obstruction focal lesions {{in the region of}} Auerbach 2 ̆ 7 s plexus, manifesting as visceral neuromyopathy, are involved. That is why the 2 ̆ 7 physiologic 2 ̆ 7 postoperative paresis never transforms into paralytic ileus, while in pseudo-obstruction such a risk is potentially involved. The treatment for pseudo-obstruction is as a rule conservative. Surgical treatment (cecostomy) is rarely required.

Case presentation A 58 -year-old Caucasian man presented to our hospital in August 2006 with continuous and diffuse abdominal pain, <b>meteorism,</b> fever and bloody diarrhea. He had a two-year history of ulcerative colitis. Our patient was treated with intravenous medical therapy. As his condition worsened, he underwent surgery. An explorative laparotomy revealed that the entire colon was distended and pus was found around an appendiceal-sigmoid fistula. Conclusions Therapy for ulcerative colitis is a rapidly evolving field, with many new biological agents under investigation that are likely to change therapeutic strategies radically in the next decade. Indications for surgery are intractability (49 %), stricture, dysplasia, toxic colitis, hemorrhage and perforation.

Endoscopy has gained an important role in chronic radiation proctitis with several therapeutic options for management of intestinal strictures. The treatment of rectal strictures has been limited to surgery with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a less invasive therapeutic approach for benign rectal strictures, endoscopic balloon dilation with or without intralesional steroid injection, has become a common treatment modality.

Minipigs fitted with an ileocaecal fistula with (n= 3) or without (n= 3) pancreatic duct ligation (PL) were used to estimate the rate of praecaecal disappearance (pcD) of starch. Different botanical sources of starch (rice, amaranth, potato, and pea) were fed either raw or cooked. In the controls (C), there was an almost complete pcD (> 92 %) except for potato starch (61. 5 %) which was significantly lower. In PL pcD of raw starch was significantly lower for all sources of starch except for amaranth (87. 9 %). Thermal processing increased pcD in PL, reaching values of C for starch from rice, potato, and pea. This study clearly underlines the need for precise specification of starch used for patients with specific dietetic needs like PEI.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} {{diseases}} range from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The "two hits" hypothesis is widely accepted for its pathogenesis: the first hit is an increased fat flux to the liver, which predisposes our patient {{to a second}} hit where increasing free fatty acid oxidation into the mitochondria leads to oxidative stress, lipoperoxidation and a chain reaction with increased ROS. Clinical indications include abdominal cramps, <b>meteorism</b> and fatigue. Most patients, however, are asymptomatic, and diagnosis is based on aminotransferase elevation and ultrasonography (or "brilliant liver"). Spirulina maxima has been experimentally proven to possess in vivo and in vitro hepatoprotective properties by maintaining the liver lipid profile. This case report evaluates the hepatoprotective effects of orally supplied Spirulina maxima. Case presentation Three Hispanic Mexican patients (a 43 -year-old man, a 77 -year-old man and a 44 -year-old woman) underwent ultrasonography and were treated with 4. 5 g/day of Spirulina maxima for three months. Their blood samples {{before and after the}} treatment determined triacylglycerols, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The results were assessed using ultrasound. Conclusion Treatment had therapeutic effects as evidenced by ultrasonography and the aminotransferase data. Hypolipidemic effects were also shown. We conclude that Spirulina maxima may be considered an alternative treatment for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases and dyslipidemic disorder. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim : {{to study}} {{clinical}} {{features of the}} clinical course of an acute respiratory viral infection in conjunction with pathology of pharyngeal tonsil in children of preschool age. Methods : generally clinical; Laboratory and instrumental; Statistical. Separation of viral infection was done using the methods of lumicroscopy and polymerase chain reaction from nasopharynx lavage. Statistical processing of received results was carried out {{with the help of}} standard statistical computer system «MicrosoftExcel» (2007) adapted for medical and biological studies. Result : In the clinical presentation of respiratory viral infection prevailed rhinorrhea, short cough, subfibrilitet with usual duration near 3 days. On the contrary in children with acute respiratory viral infections with pathology of the pharyngeal tonsil prevailed stuffiness in nose, productive cough, snore and decrease of hearing, ear ache, polyadenopathy. Fever had fibril and hectic character with duration more than 3 days.. Dyspeptic syndrome was demonstrated more intensively in children with acute respiratory viral infections with pathology of the pharyngeal tonsil and characterized with thickening on tongue, periodic ache in stomach, <b>meteorism,</b> constipation, stool instability. Conclusions : The main syndromes in the clinical presentation of an acute respiratory viral infection were: intoxicational, catarrhal and dyspeptic. In children with pathology of the pharyngeal tonsil the clinical course of ARVI was more evident with long course and increase of the frequency of complications of ARVI </p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND Chronic {{pancreatitis}} is {{an inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} pancreas with a physiopathology that {{is yet to be}} fully understood, with a multifactorial etiology, of which alcohol abuse causes the majority of cases. PATIENTS AND METHOD We included 80 patients diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, admitted in the Gastroenterology Clinic of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Craiova. In each patient, demographic parameters, family and personal history were recorded. All patients were initially evaluated by transabdominal ultrasound. In selected cases other imagistic methods were used: computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. RESULTS The mean age in the studied group ranged between 26 and 76 years {{with a mean age of}} 52. 9 years. The male to female ratio was 3. 6 : 1. The most frequent presenting symptom was abdominal pain (93. 75 %), followed by fatigue (70 %), anorexia (50 %); fewer patients presented with emesis, loss of weight, diarrhea, <b>meteorism</b> and flatulence. The most frequent etiologic factor of chronic pancreatitis in the studied group was alcohol abuse. Using imaging methods the following complications of chronic pancreatitis were diagnosed in the studied group: complicated or uncomplicated pseudocysts (31. 57 %), pancreatic cancer (18. 75 %), obstructive jaundice (10 %), segmental portal hypertension (2. 5 %), and pseudoaneurysm (1. 25 %). CONCLUSSIONS Transabdominal ultrasound is quite accurate in diagnosing chronic pancreatitis and its morbidities and its non-invasiveness makes it the method of choice in the initial assessment of the disease.

40|$|Aim. Involvement of many {{organs and}} {{apparatus}} such as heart, central and peripheral nervous {{systems have been}} reported in celiac disease. Autonomic neuropathy has frequently been reported both in untreated and in gluten free diet (GFD) adult patients and, to our knowledge, has never been investigated in celiac children. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate autonomic function in children with celiac disease. Methods. Fifteen children with untreated celiac disease were enrolled. Fifteen healthy children served as controls. None of the patients was diabetic Central or peripheral neurological diseases, were absent. In all participants, at recruitment and after 24 months of GFD, serum anti-tTG and AEA levels, inflammatory markers, IgG, IgM and IgA anti-ganglioside antibodies, were performed. Heart rate variability indexes were employed to evaluate autonomic system balance. Results. Our results indicate that also children with celiac disease may exhibit an imbalance of the neurovegetative system with a prevailing sympathetic tone, persisting on a GFD. All presented symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, vomiting, <b>meteorism,</b> regurgitation in whom autonomic dysfunction could be involved, but these symptoms disappeared on gluten free diet. This tend to exclude the prevailing sympathetic tone as a main factor underlying symptoms of celiac disease. Conclusion. Children affected by celiac disease exhibit an enhanced sympathetic tone, persisting after 24 months of GFD whereas gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms disappear. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon still remains unclear...|$|E
