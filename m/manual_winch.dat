5000|$|... #Caption: This 6 ft crystal electrolier (chandelier) {{hangs from}} {{the dome of the}} Minnesota State Capitol rotunda. A <b>manual</b> <b>winch</b> {{originally}} lowered it about 120 ft to the floor for maintenance, as seen in the ca. 1910 photograph.|$|E
50|$|All bungee Trampolines {{operate under}} the same principle. The {{participant}} puts on a bungee trampoline harness according to their waist size, and depending on the person's weight they hooked to the relative number of bungee ropes. Those ropes connect to a climbing rope which goes through a pulley system connected to the highest point on the jump structure and after connecting to an electric winch or <b>manual</b> <b>winch.</b> As the participant gains momentum, the operator puts more tension on the bungee ropes by using the hand controller to re-coil the winch and retract the rope, allowing the participant to reach heights {{as high as the}} structure or higher and do flips and other maneuvers that would otherwise be impossible on a regular trampoline for untrained people. There are hydraulic models along with winch models depending on the age and manufacturer of the unit.|$|E
5000|$|The Faraday {{flashlight}} is a LED flashlight {{which operates}} on a capacitor. Recharging {{can be done}} by <b>manual</b> <b>winching</b> or by shaking, hereby avoiding the need of any supplementary electrical system.|$|R
5000|$|A grinder is a {{crew member}} on a yacht whose duties include {{operating}} <b>manual</b> <b>winches</b> (called [...] "coffee grinders") that raise and trim the sails and move the boom. It is a physically demanding role with {{a significant impact on}} a racing yacht's overall performance.|$|R
50|$|On 12 August 2017, {{the tower}} stopped {{due to a}} {{mechanical}} fault, leaving 39 people stranded more that 4 hours. They were rescued after the Sky Tower's engineers were assisted with the <b>manual</b> <b>winching</b> to lower the gondola. The cause of the fault is under investigation, and Tiger Sky Tower is closed until further notice.|$|R
50|$|A rapid {{deployment}} self-mounting pole is {{a mobile}} supporting structure {{corresponds to a}} special two-axle trailer with telescopic stabilizers approved for road traffic.The antenna supporting pole, with standard height of up to 20 m, is made of aluminium and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy and fast, and is carried out with <b>manual</b> <b>winches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another RDU is {{a mobile}} cell site with self-mounting pole; {{that can be}} towed by heavy goods {{vehicles}} for loads of up to 7500 kg. The antenna supporting pole, with a standard height of up to 20 m, is made of aluminium and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy, fast and is carried out by means of <b>manual</b> <b>winches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Brown Point {{with its}} boat {{winching}} system is unique, {{and is a}} proven tourist attraction. Photographs of these [...] "Davits" [...] are exhibited nationally in tourist and travel agencies and also on souvenirs and post cards. The <b>manual</b> <b>winching</b> method for raising and lowering boats from cliff to water {{with the aid of}} stable uprights, cables and supports, was introduced by George Parsons and Fred Schwarz in the 1920s and it {{has proved to be a}} very assured and convenient way of safe guarding a craft in bad weather over the years. Today the fibreglass boat has replaced the clinker or wooden boat on account of easy maintenance etc. and trailers have replaced the winching system.|$|R
50|$|A cell on {{truck is}} a {{particular}} kind of mobile cell site that is composed of mobile trucks with container and with self-mounting telescopic mast. They are portable structures that guarantee full operation in three hours and in restricted spaces.The steel interface frame is made of galvanized steel beams and is provided with four retracting stabilizers that can be retracted under the container for transport. The equipment and power container, which has a reinforced special 20' box container with two access doors, divided by an intermediate partition to create two separate rooms (E and A). Room A is used for housing the electrical and radio equipment. Room E is used as a power room for housing the generating set; and also, during transport, to contain the radiant systems and accessory components.The antenna supporting pole, with standard height of up to 20 m, is made of aluminium and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy, fast and is carried out with <b>manual</b> <b>winches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Upgrade of the M32 {{to provide}} the same {{capability}} with regards to heavier post-war tanks, converted from M4A3 HVSS tanks. In appearance the M74 {{is very similar to}} the M32, fitted with an A-Frame crane, a main towing winch, an auxiliary <b>winch,</b> and a <b>manual</b> utility <b>winch.</b> The M74 also has a front-mounted spade that {{can be used as a}} support or as a dozer blade.|$|R
50|$|M74 Tank Recovery Vehicle - Upgrade of the M32 {{to provide}} the same {{capability}} with regards to heavier post-war tanks, converted from M4A3 HVSS tanks. In appearance, the M74 {{is very similar to}} the M32, fitted with an A-Frame crane, a main towing winch, an auxiliary <b>winch,</b> and a <b>manual</b> utility <b>winch.</b> The M74 also has a front-mounted spade that {{can be used as a}} support or as a dozer blade.|$|R
50|$|Substantial guard rails are {{constructed}} from 316 marine grade stainless steel and are through-bolted for security. Stainless steel self stowing stemhead fitting, housing a 16 kg Delta anchor with 30m of 8mm calibrated chain. <b>Manual</b> anchor <b>winch.</b> 6 substantial cleats. Stainless steel grab rails {{on the side}} of the flybridge. Stainless steel/teak bathing platform access ladder. A full set of IMCO navigation lights. Twin electric horns. Fuel and water filters. Hatch for gas bottle stowage (2 bottles). Hatch access to chain locker with stowage space. Hatch to forecabin. Stainless steel guard wires to access openings in side deck guard rails. Bathing ladder.|$|R
50|$|Mobile {{station on}} trailer is a mobile {{stations}} with telescopic mast are portable structures, towed by heavy goods vehicles for loads {{of up to}} 12000 kg. The antenna supporting pole, with a standard height of up to 30 m, is made of steel and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy, fast and is carried out with <b>manual</b> or electric <b>winches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Winch-a geared {{mechanical}} device used on yachts for trimming (adjusting)sail sheets, for hoisting large sails with halyards, for hauling in an anchor or {{on a boat}} trailer for hauling a boat out of the water. The normal turret winch is set on the aft side deck for trimming headsails and or a spinnaker. <b>Manual</b> trimming <b>winches</b> are operated by grinding the handle in a circle initially, then pulling back and forwards on a short lever while a second person tails (pulls to keep tension on the sheet)to obtain optimum force. Some winches are self-tailing or the sheet can be cleated to prevent slippage. On larger yachts winches can be operated by electric motors. Typically on America's cup yachts large pedestal winches are used which can be operated by two people at the same time. Because of the force needed, especially in tacking duels, winch grinders are usually very large and strong men.|$|R
