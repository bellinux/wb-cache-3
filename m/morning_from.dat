5|$|On 27 September 1946 Geoffrey de Havilland Jr {{was killed}} test-flying the DH.108 Swallow over the Thames estuary. Cunningham {{had taken off}} {{at the same time}} to deliver the first Vampire in Switzerland.

Cunningham knew the family well and contacted his father, whose other son John had been killed in a collision while flying a Mosquito in 1943. With the agreement of de Havilland senior, Cunningham took the dead pilot's post which earned him £2,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|Several {{clusters}} of thunderstorms {{developed during the}} <b>morning</b> <b>from</b> eastern Nebraska across Iowa into Illinois, taking place along a warm front. The front remained over the same areas during the day, as daytime heating and southwesterly surface winds brought warm and unstable air northward, resulting in severe weather development. The presence of strong winds aloft aided in development of multiple clusters and lines of thunderstorms that produced damaging wind, hail and tornadoes across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.|$|E

5|$|At 21:21 the North Vietnamese {{resumed their}} {{artillery}} attack on Phou Pha Thi, followed by several infantry assaults by the VPA 766th Regiment, which prompted Sullivan {{to order the}} evacuation of six technicians by 08:15 the next <b>morning,</b> <b>from</b> a contingent of 19 U.S. personnel. Starting at 01:00 on 11March, the North Vietnamese moved into their assigned positions in order to launch their attack. About 02:00, a U.S. adviser at the airstrip reported to Secord and CIA officers at Udorn that he heard gunfire on top of Phou Pha Thi, and communication with U.S. technicians at Lima Site 85 was completely cut off. Afterwards, Secord briefed U.S. A-1 Skyraider pilots in Thailand on the situation at Lima Site 85, to familiarize them with friendly positions around the facility, so they could cover the evacuation of U.S. personnel and support the Hmong counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Rich {{families}} from Rome usually {{had two or}} more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) {{and at least one}} luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished with a private bath (balneum), {{but it was not a}} place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every <b>morning,</b> <b>from</b> wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity. It was also a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{remained on}} guard duty {{in and around}} Alexandria until July 15, 1861, when orders were received attaching the regiment to Orlando B. Willcox's brigade, of Samuel P. Heintzelman's division, in Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell's Army of Northeast Virginia. They were to march out the next <b>morning.</b> <b>From</b> July 16 to 21, the regiment advanced to intercept Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard's Confederate Army of the Potomac. Three of McDowell's five divisions advanced towards Bull Run, outside the railroad junction at Manassas, Virginia. The 11th New York expected to first engage Confederates at Fairfax Court House on July 17, {{only to find that}} they had pulled back towards Centreville, leaving Quaker Guns in their place. These movements were to precipitate the first large-scale battle of the Civil War.|$|E
