25|$|Over {{three hundred}} {{people in this}} village of about two {{thousand}} make these pots. Most artisans make low to <b>medium</b> <b>quality</b> wares, {{with only a few}} making fine pots that are thin and light. Highly regarded artists include the Quezada family, the Ortiz family, Taurina Baca, and Hector and Graciella Gallegos. Nicolas Ortiz is known for sculptural pieces. The pottery has been a great boon to the community economically. Before, men did seasonal labor and the women had no opportunity to earn money. The income from pottery has allowed families to build and improve homes and buy cars.|$|E
25|$|The <b>medium</b> <b>quality</b> photo {{uses only}} 4.3% of the storage space {{required}} for the uncompressed image, but has little noticeable loss of detail or visible artifacts. However, once a certain threshold of compression is passed, compressed images show increasingly visible defects. See the article on rate–distortion theory for a mathematical explanation of this threshold effect. A particular limitation of JPEG {{in this regard is}} its non-overlapped 8×8 block transform structure. More modern designs such as JPEG 2000 and JPEG XR exhibit a more graceful degradation of quality as the bit usage decreases– by using transforms with a larger spatial extent for the lower frequency coefficients and by using overlapping transform basis functions.|$|E

5000|$|However {{photography}} {{did have}} the ability to [...] unpredictable and spontaneous. This was achieved by making photographs related to the inherent capabilities of the camera itself. And this, Wall argues, was a direct result of photojournalism, and the mass media and pop culture industries. [...] "By divesting itself of the encumbrances and advantages inherited from older art forms, reportage, or the spontaneous fleeting aspect of the photographic image pushes toward a discovery of qualities apparently intrinsic to the <b>medium,</b> <b>qualities</b> that must necessarily distinguish the medium from others and through the self-examination of which it can emerge as a modernist art on a plane with others."

25|$|Unfortunately, many {{manufacturers}} have added additional coloring to disguise their unstable cyanine CD-Rs in the past, so {{the formulation of}} a disc cannot be determined based purely on its color. Similarly, a gold reflective layer does not guarantee use of phthalocyanine dye. The quality of the disc is also not only dependent on the dye used, it is also influenced by sealing, the top layer, the reflective layer, and the polycarbonate. Simply choosing a disc based on its dye type may be problematic. Furthermore, correct power calibration of the laser in the writer, as well as correct timing of the laser pulses, stable disc speed, and so on, is critical to not only the immediate readability but the longevity of the recorded disc, so for archiving {{it is important to}} have not only a high quality disc but a high quality writer. In fact, a high quality writer may produce adequate results with <b>medium</b> <b>quality</b> media, but high quality media cannot compensate for a mediocre writer, and discs written by such a writer cannot achieve their maximum potential archival lifetime.|$|E
25|$|For information, the {{uncompressed}} 24-bit RGB {{bitmap image}} below (73,242 pixels) would require 219,726 bytes (excluding all other information headers). The filesizes indicated below include the internal JPEG information headers and some metadata. For highest quality images (Q=100), about 8.25 bits per color pixel is required. On grayscale images, {{a minimum of}} 6.5 bits per pixel is enough (a comparable Q=100 quality color information requires about 25% more encoded bits). The highest quality image below (Q=100) is encoded at nine bits per color pixel, the <b>medium</b> <b>quality</b> image (Q=25) uses one bit per color pixel. For most applications, the quality factor should not go below 0.75 bit per pixel (Q=12.5), {{as demonstrated by the}} low quality image. The image at lowest quality uses only 0.13 bit per pixel, and displays very poor color. This is useful when the image will be displayed in a significantly scaled-down size. A method for creating better quantization matrices for a given image quality using PSNR instead of the Q factor is described in Minguillón & Pujol (2001).|$|E

Schweitzer praised the [...] "Main Theme of Final Fantasy V" [...] ("Ahead on Our Way") as [...] "a truly stirring piece of music" [...] and [...] "triumphant, hopeful, and yet almost longing at the same time," [...] but stated that [...] "Uematsu's compositional style hits a sort of early plateau here."

40|$|Abstract—The huge {{development}} of new technologies and the apparition of open communication system more and more sophisticated create a new challenge to protect digital content from piracy. Digital watermarking is a recent research axis and a new technique suggested {{as a solution to}} these problems. This technique consists in inserting identification information (watermark) into digital data (audio, video, image, databases…) in an invisible and indelible manner and in such a way not to degrade original <b>medium’s</b> <b>quality.</b> Moreover, we must be able to correctly extract the watermark despite the deterioration of the watermarked medium (i. e attacks). In this paper we propose a system for watermarking satellite images. We chose to embed the watermark into frequency domain, precisely the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). We applied our algorithm on satellite images of Tunisian center. The experiments show satisfying results. In addition, our algorithm showed an important resistance facing different attacks, notably the compression (JEPG, JPEG 2000), the filtering, the histogram’s manipulation and geometric distortions such as rotation, cropping, scaling.
