5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their cavity {{magnetron}} at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC was told {{of their work}} {{and asked if they}} could improve the design. They introduced new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10kW of power at 10cm, an order of magnitude better than any existing <b>microwave</b> <b>device.</b> At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not pointing the antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E
25|$|GEC {{was working}} on {{producing}} a fully sealed version of the magnetron, as opposed to one that used an external vacuum pump. After inventing a new sealing method using gold wire and adapting the chamber of a Colt revolver as a drilling template, they produced the E1188 in early July 1940. This produced {{the same amount of}} power as the original Randall-Boot model, about 1kW at around 10cm. Within a few weeks they had made two improvements, moving from six to eight resonators, and replacing the cathode with an oxide-coated version. The resulting E1189 was capable of generating 10kW of power at 9.1cm, an order of magnitude better than any existing <b>microwave</b> <b>device.</b> The second E1189 was sent to the AMRE lab, which received it on 19 July.|$|E

A similar device can be built with the configuration in which electrons generated from the avalanche multiplication drift through the intrinsic region.|$|E

40|$|High-frequency {{microwave}} applications, such as filters, delay lines, and resonators, {{are quite}} important for superconducting electronic devices. In order {{to design the}} superconducting <b>microwave</b> <b>devices,</b> circuit parameters should be precisely extracted from the physical structure of the devices. A 3 -dimentional electromagnetic-field simulators is very useful for designing <b>microwave</b> <b>devices.</b> However, designing of superconducting <b>microwave</b> <b>devices</b> using a conventional 3 D electromagnetic-field simulator is difficult because most of commercially available 3 D electromagnetic-field simulators can’t exactly characterize electromagnetic phenomena of superconductors. In this study, a novel calculation method of superconducting <b>microwave</b> <b>devices,</b> which can be applicable to a conventional 3 D electromagnetic-field simulator, has been proposed. Calculation results of characteristic impedance of superconducting microstrip lines show very good agreements with the theoretically calculated vales. The frequency response of a superconducting Nb microwave filter designed by the proposed calculation method agrees well with the experimental results. This calculation method enables us to precisely estimate microwave characteristics of superconducting devices...|$|R

50|$|Randall and Boot, {{given no}} other {{projects}} to work on, began considering solutions {{to this problem}} in November 1939. The only other <b>microwave</b> <b>device</b> known {{at that time was}} the split-anode magnetron, a device capable of generating small amounts of power, but with low efficiency and generally lower output than the klystron. However, they noted that it had one enormous advantage over the klystron; the klystron's signal is encoded in a stream of electrons provided by an electron gun, and it was the current capability of the gun that defined how much power the device could ultimately handle. In contrast, the magnetron used a conventional hot filament cathode, a system that was widely used in radio systems producing hundreds of kilowatts. This seemed to offer a much more likely path to higher power.|$|E

5000|$|Scanning Scatterometer (SCAT) - SCAT is {{an active}} <b>microwave</b> <b>device</b> {{designed}} and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It {{will be used to}} determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer {{is an active}} microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90° and the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60° on the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.|$|E
