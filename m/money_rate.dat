We use monthly data for the time span of April 1992 to March 2011. This provides sufficient data set for the empirical analysis. Result from Granger causality test evidences bidirectional relationship between call <b>money</b> <b>rates</b> and exchange rates. It is also identified that call <b>money</b> <b>rates</b> and exchange rates Granger cause stock returns and did not find reverse causality from stock returns to call <b>money</b> and exchange <b>rates.</b> To explore, lead-lag interaction among the variables studied we employed VAR models. Results suggest that there is substantial lead-lag relationship from call <b>money</b> <b>rates</b> to exchange rates and stock returns. Similar relationship also found from exchange <b>rates</b> to call <b>money</b> <b>rates</b> and stock returns. However, {{there is no evidence of}} lead-lag causation from stock returns to call <b>money</b> and exchange <b>rates.</b> Findings of this study are useful for the investors and policy makers. In investors' standpoint, they can utilize this historical information of call <b>money</b> <b>rates</b> and exchange rates for predicting the movements of stock returns. Similarly, policy makers can stabilize the stock market fluctuations by adopting appropriate policies towards interest rates and exchange rates for time to time.

The evidence {{analyzed in}} this paper supports the view that monetary policy in Croatia is not an effective tool for aggregate demand management. One of the main conclusions is that financial conditions in the economy are only weakly correlated with the monetary policy stance. Monetary policy can exercise some control over money-market interest rates, but its influence on lending rates is uncertain and comes with long lags. The paper also examines determinants of lending rates and domestic spreads in Croatia.

50|$|Sometimes {{the dealer}} has {{the option of}} marking up the {{interest}} rate of the contract and retaining a portion of that markup. For example, a bank may give a wholesale <b>money</b> <b>rate</b> of 6.75% and the dealer may give the consumer an interest rate of 7.75%. The bank would then pay the dealer the difference or a portion thereof. This is a regular practice because the dealership is selling the contract to a bank just like it sold a car to the customer. Most banks or states strictly limit the amount a contract rate may be marked up (by giving a range of rates at which they will buy the contract). In many cases this amounts to little difference in the customer's payment as the amount borrowed is small by comparison to a mortgage and the term shorter.|$|E
5000|$|Wicksell's {{theory of}} the [...] "cumulative process" [...] of {{inflation}} remains the first decisive swing {{at the idea of}} money as a [...] "veil". Wicksell's process has its roots in that of Henry Thornton. Recall that the start of the Quantity Theory's mechanism is a helicopter drop of cash: an exogenous increase in the supply of money. Wicksell's theory claims, indeed, that increases in the supply of money leads to rises in price levels, but the original increase is endogenous, created by the relative conditions of the financial and real sectors. With the existence of credit money, Wicksell argued, two interest rates prevail: the [...] "natural" [...] rate and the [...] "money" [...] rate. The natural rate is the return on capital - or the real profit rate. It can be roughly considered to be equivalent to the marginal product of new capital. The <b>money</b> <b>rate,</b> in turn, is the loan rate, an entirely financial construction. Credit, then, is perceived quite appropriately as [...] "money".

It is the most sensitive section of the money market and the changes in the demand for and supply of call loans are promptly reflected in call rates. There are now two call rates in India: the Inter bank call rate and the lending rate of DFHI. The ceilings on the call rate and inter-bank term <b>money</b> <b>rate</b> were dropped, with effect from May 1, 1989.

If the null hypothesis is false it is difficult to suggest persuasive instruments that would identify the causal effect of the <b>money</b> <b>rate</b> on the natural rate of interest. Our identification strategy is therefore built around quasi-experimentation and event analysis.

It is found that German independence holds, but other central banks can also be important players in the system in that they can conduct independent monetary policies. Monetary policies in the EMS are best characterized as interactive. Therefore, the strict German dominance hypothesis is rejected. It follows that the EMS has not increased significantly the link between money demand functions in the EMS countries in the â€œhierarchicalâ€ structure as claimed by the dominance argument.

40|$|Abstract: Inflation {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{macroeconomic}} problems of Pakistan. This study was conducted with the purpose to devise some policy measures to reduce inflation in Pakistan. The study investigated the causal relationship among Consumer Price Index (CPI), money supply (M 2), Real Gross Domestic Product (RGDP), call <b>money</b> <b>rate</b> (interest rate) and exchange rate using time series data for the period 1972 - 2010. Augmented-Dickey Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests were used to examine data for stationary. Other econometric techniques used in the study are Johansen Co-integration Test and Error correction model. Econometric results show that money supply affects inflation positively both in short-run and long-run. Real gross domestic product is negatively related with inflation. Moreover, interest rate has positive effect on inflation. Exchange rate has positive impact on inflation in the long-run. This study recommends that State Bank of Pakistan should follow a tight monetary policy to control inflation in Pakistan.
