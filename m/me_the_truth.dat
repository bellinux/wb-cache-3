500|$|Public {{recognition}} of Auden's work sharply increased after his [...] "Funeral Blues" [...] ("Stop all the clocks") was read aloud {{in the film}} Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994); subsequently, a pamphlet edition of ten of his poems, Tell <b>Me</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truth</b> About Love, sold more than 275,000 copies. After 11 September 2001 his 1939 poem [...] "September 1, 1939" [...] was widely circulated and frequently broadcast. Public readings and broadcast tributes in the UK and US in 2007 marked his centenary year.|$|E
500|$|Auden's shorter poems now {{engaged with}} the {{fragility}} and transience of personal love ("Danse Macabre", [...] "The Dream", [...] "Lay your sleeping head"), a subject he treated with ironic wit in his [...] "Four Cabaret Songs for Miss Hedli Anderson" [...] (which included [...] "Tell <b>Me</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truth</b> About Love" [...] and the {{revised version of}} [...] "Funeral Blues"), and also the corrupting effect of public and official culture on individual lives ("Casino", [...] "School Children", [...] "Dover"). In 1938 he wrote a series of dark, ironic ballads about individual failure ("Miss Gee", [...] "James Honeyman", [...] "Victor"). All these appeared in Another Time (1940), together with poems including [...] "Dover", [...] "As He Is", and [...] "Musée des Beaux Arts" [...] (all of which were written before he moved to America in 1939), and [...] "In Memory of W. B. Yeats", [...] "The Unknown Citizen", [...] "Law Like Love", [...] "September 1, 1939", and [...] "In Memory of Sigmund Freud" [...] (all written in America).|$|E
500|$|Christman {{contacted}} the Scientology critics based in Clearwater, and arranged flight transportation to Florida. She {{arrived at the}} airport in California to find that her flight was cancelled. Her former supervisor, Janet Weiland, was waiting for her close to the ticket counter, and tried to convince her to remain in the organization. Christman eventually got on a flight to Tampa, Florida, but was met at the gate when she arrived by agents of Scientology. Tampa police were notified, and escorted Christman safely away from the Scientologists. While a member of Scientology, Christman had given over $1 million to the organization; she used her inheritance money to pay for coursework. She commented to the St. Petersburg Times of Florida about the thought process she underwent after leaving the organization, [...] "When you get out and you get the whole thing, you're like, 'What was I thinking?'. I know the people inside are brainwashed and they're laughing at me. But to <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> is, I'm free. I can do what I want. I can say what I want." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{track is}} {{followed}} by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, [...] "Mind the gap...". [...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" [...] follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's [...] "Take Five" [...] and Fred Wesley's [...] "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: [...] "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes when he told <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> about the basket of lies". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: [...] "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".|$|E
