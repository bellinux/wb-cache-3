40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} power modulation techniques for multiterminal HVDC transmission networks, {{for the purpose of}} damping low frequency oscillations. A linear analysis of integrated AC/DC systems is made, feedback gains are obtained by linear quadratic design techniques, and comparisons are made between decentralized and centralized modulation schemes. An algorithm is proposed to implement control laws in a central supervisory control. This algorithm removes the coupling introduced by the required current balancing algorithm. A comparison of centralized modulation with a modified central supervisor and a previously developed central supervisor 6 shows a more damped system response with the modified central supervisor. <b>Modulating</b> <b>currents</b> are subjected to the converters 2 ̆ 7 maximum and minimum current limits before balancing and this eliminates the sudden jumps in <b>modulating</b> <b>currents</b> which were observed in earlier studies. Simulation studies are also made for different converter locations and different DC network configurations. It is analytically shown that a mesh DC network would cause less mode shifting during modulation. The effects of AC system line reactance and converter capacitor size are also evaluated. ^ The <b>modulating</b> <b>currents</b> used for decentralized modulation are limited because of the loss of current margin. A proposed dynamic current margin technique allows higher <b>modulating</b> <b>currents</b> and improves the system response. A centralized modulation scheme with less communication requirments is also evaluated. In this scheme, mode shifting is recognized by a comparison of the converter reference current and the actual converter current, and a corrective action is taken to reduce the mode shifting. A coordinated modulating of the DC power and the AC reactive power is also studied and the effect of reactive power modulation is evaluated by a linear anaysis of the AC/DC system and through the simulation studies. This scheme results in further improvement in damping the interarea oscillations. The problem of loss of communication for centralized modulation is also discussed, and it is shown that proposed corrective actions allow the modulation of the unaffected terminals to continue. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{identifying}} and differentiating DNA duplexes containing the mismatched base pairs CC and CA at single molecule resolution with the protein pore α-hemolysin (αHL) is presented. Unique <b>modulating</b> <b>current</b> signatures are observed for duplexes containing the CC and CA mismatches when the mismatch {{site in the}} duplex is situated in proximity to the latch constriction of αHL during DNA residence inside the pore. The frequency and current amplitude of the modulation states are dependent on the mismatch type (CC or CA) permitting easy discrimination of these mismatches from one another, and from a fully complementary duplex that exhibits no modulation. We attribute the <b>modulating</b> <b>current</b> signatures to base flipping and subsequent interaction with positively charged lysine residues at the latch constriction of αHL.

50|$|Every {{field bus}} segment needs exactly two terminators to operate properly. The terminators are {{designed}} to be the equivalent of a 1 µF capacitor and a 100 Ω resistor in series. The terminators serve several purposes including shunting the Fieldbus current(device communication) and protecting against electrical reflections.The primary function of terminators is to act as a current shunt for the control network. Fieldbus communication works by the field device <b>modulating</b> its <b>current</b> draw. When the devices need to transmit data, the FF devices will act as a current sink. The devices will draw less current to represent a high signal (1, one) and draw more current to represent a low signal (0, zero). As the <b>modulating</b> <b>current</b> of the FF devices is between 15 mA and 20 mA peak to peak, while the modulating voltage in the bus caused by this <b>modulating</b> <b>current</b> is between 0.75 V and 1 V peak to peak. This 0.75 and 1 V is simply a result of the 15 mA x 50 Ω which equal to 0.75 V and 20 mA x 50 Ω which is equal to 1 V. The 50 Ω resistor is an equivalent of two parallel resistors from the FF terminator. Because of all devices use the same cable, only one device can transmit a message at any given time. Without the proper number of terminators, the signal level will be out of specification and can disrupt the network.
