30|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for the recovery of silica such as acid or alkali leaching, followed by separation and purification using different techniques. US Patent No. 4539187 (1985) describes a method where CFA is reacted with fluorosilicic acid and hydrogen fluoride at a high temperature to form fluorides of Fe, Al and Si. The fluoride mixture is distilled, separating the aqueous and gaseous silicon fluoride from the mixtures, hydrolyzing the silicon fluorides vapor, and recovering silicon dioxide in high purity form. Recently, US Patent No. 0287827 A 1 (2010) released a method where a mixture of coal and CFA is reacted with hydrogen fluoride in water to produce a liquid stream containing silicon fluoride and metal fluorides, and a solid stream containing unreacted coal and S compounds. Sulfur compounds are reacted with <b>metallic</b> <b>nitrates</b> dissolved in the water, which separated the aqueous solution of <b>nitrate,</b> S and <b>metallic</b> ions from the solid coal, and the solid coal is then washed with water. Subsequently, silicon fluoride and metal fluorides are contacted with <b>metallic</b> <b>nitrates</b> in an aqueous mixture to form solid silicon dioxide, and solid silicon dioxide is separated from the aqueous mixture. This process has recovered high purity silica from CFA. However, acid leaching is not always appropriate because it needs better acid resistant and air-tight processing equipment and it causes environmental pollution. This problem can be solved by using alkaline leaching methods. US Patent Nos. 0119426 A 1 (2010) and 7871583 B 2 (2011) released an alkaline leaching method for the recovery of silica from CFA, where Si is leached using NaOH in the form of Na 2 SiO 3 solution. The solution is vaporized to obtain Na 2 SiO 3, and pure silica (> 98.5  %) is produced by carbonation.|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} of La 0. 9 Sr 0. 1 Ga 0. 8 Mg 0. 2 O 2. 85 perovskite powders by a method combining freeze-drying and self-ignition of an aqueous solution of <b>metallic</b> <b>nitrates</b> containing hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. The precursor powder obtained after self-ignition was submitted to various thermal treatments and the resulting powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis, mercury porosimetry and laser granulometry. It turns out that this synthesis method yields single-phase powders with good homogeneity and sinterability properties. The precursor powder treated at 1200 degrees C presents a coral-like structure which collapses under application of low uniaxial pressure, resulting in a narrow grain size distribution suitable for sintering (98. 8 % relative density for a pellet sintered at 1400 degrees C during 1 h). The fact that no milling step is necessary is an additional advantage of this method, which shows promising prospects for {{the synthesis of}} other multicationic oxides. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are several difficulties involved in the processing of these materials. The objective of this work is to investigate and to characterize the relationships between microstructural development process and the electro-thermal-mechanical behavior of earth-alkaline metals doped lanthanum chromites-based ceramics. Calcium and strontium doped lanthanum chromites-based ceramic powders were produced by solution-based method from respective <b>metallic</b> <b>nitrates.</b> Samples were prepared by pressing and sintering procedures.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{synthesis of}} dimethylhexane- 1, 6 -dicarbamate (HDC) from 1, 6 -hexanediamine (HDA) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) over {{a series of}} homogeneous catalysts (e. g., <b>metallic</b> <b>nitrates</b> and acetates) were investigated. Mn(OAc) (2) {{was found to be}} the most effective catalyst for this reaction. Under the optimum reaction conditions (reaction temperature of 363 K, DMC-to-HDA molar ratio of 4 : 1, catalyst concentration of 7 wt% (based on HDA), and reaction time of 5 h), HDC yield can reach as high as 98. 0 % with HDA totally converted. Online in-situ Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were used together to investigate the interactions between Mn(OAc) (2) and substrates. The results indicated that both of HDA and DMC had interactions with Mn(OAc) (2), but the energy barriers of the transition states (TS) of DMC (DMC-TS) was higher than that of HDA (HDA-TS), which meant that HDA was easier to interact with Mn(OAc) (2) to form new complex than DMC. The whole process can be proposed that, the new species II, which was formed by the interaction of HDA and Mn(OAc) (2), attacked carbonyl carbon of DMC to generate intermediate HMC and finally to HDC. The experimental data and calculation results are in good agreement with each other. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Well dispersed nanoparticles were prepared at 1000 ◦C. This temperature is lower than that required for synthesizing YAG:Eu 3 + via the solid-state reaction route. The particle size and morphology of the synthesized powders are found to have critical dependence on the oxidizer (<b>metallic</b> <b>nitrates)</b> to fuel ratio. The importance of using an organic polymeric dispersion matrix to obtain well dispersed YAG:Eu 3 + nanoparticles has been demonstrated. The photoluminescene properties of the prepared YAG:Eu 3 + phosphors are profoundly dependent on the preparation conditions. The emission intensity of well dispersed YAG:Eu 3 + nanoparticles {{is found to be}} much stronger than that of the bulk sample. The excitation spectrum of well dispersed nanoparticles shows an extension of the excitation peak in the high-energy region. These unique properties of YAG:Eu 3 + nanoparticles can be rationalized by considering numerous surface states due to the large surface area to volume ratio of the nanoparticles. In addition, using the hypersensitive 5 D 0 → 7 F 2 transition of Eu 3 + as a local probe, the role of surface states that modify the optical properties of YAG:Eu 3 + nanophosphors has also been illustrated...|$|R

Composite electrodes {{were prepared}} using a mixture of LiCoO 2, carbon black and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in the 85 : 10 : 5 % w/w ratio. The electrochemical behavior of these composites was evaluated in ethylene carbonate/dimethylcarbonate solution, using lithium perchlorate as supporting electrolyte. Cyclic voltammograms showed one reversible redox process at 4. 0 / 3. 85 V and one irreversible redox process at 3. 3 V for the LiCoO 2 obtained after a post-heat treatment at 400 and 500 jC.

The effects of chloride salts of potassium (KCl) and zinc (ZnCl 2) on sintering and densification of Ca-HAP were studied using surface area reduction and shrinkage measurements. The addition of KCl (2 % w/w) activated the sintering process by bringing a swift reduction in surface area and lowering the densification temperature. However, a low final densification was achieved. Increasing the amount of this additive to 10 % w/w further lowered the final densification and lowered the densification temperature of hydroxyapatite by 150 degrees C. On the other hand, the addition of 2 wt % of ZnCl 2 deactivated the sintering process by slowing down the densification process and raising the densification temperature. However, the reduction of surface area was comparable to that of Ca-HAP.

In contrast, 100  mg/L Ag inhibited the nitrification process by 100  % after the addition of silver nitrate and 20 – 30  % after addition of colloidal polymer-coated nanosilver. A complete mass balance of the pilot-plant, a steady-state system with known fluxes, demonstrates significant enrichment of silver in the sewage sludge (96  %) after the addition of silver chloride to the plant and small losses of silver into the secondary effluent (4  %). The mass fluxes are similar to metallic colloidal nanosilver investigated under the same conditions. The mass balance has been consistently confirmed by the full-scale study in a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The silver fluxes correspond to the fluxes of the suspended solids in sludge and effluent. Overall, {{it is estimated that}} from public wastewater treatment plants about 4 – 40  mg/a Ag per inhabitant equivalent are discharged annually to the receiving water. The analysis by SEM-EDX demonstrates adsorption and incorporation of nanosilver on biological flocs.

Electrochemical oxidation may constitute an alternative {{route to the}} existing methods.

In recent {{years there has been}} increasing interest in multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as heterogeneous catalyst supports [1] owing to their high surface area and high electrical conductivity. These peculiar characteristics qualify CNTs as adequate electrocatalysts or as catalyst support materials for the oxidative degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater [2].

40|$|In this paper, the {{fluidized}} bed dry impregnation of coarse alumina porous particles by a <b>metallic</b> salt, manganese <b>nitrate,</b> is investigated. In this technique the penetration of each drop of metallic solution in the porous solid particle and solvent evaporation {{takes place at}} the same time, then liquid diffusion phenomenon is negligible. So, the metal loading {{is directly related to the}} operating time and liquid flow rate and concentration. It is found that the competition between two phenomena, drying and capillary flow, controls the deposit location. In order to determine the importance of the solvent evaporation process compared to the solution penetration by capillarity, an impregnation module, IM, was defined as the ratio between the drying characteristic time and a capillary penetration time. The adequate choice of the operating conditions (bed temperature, liquid and fluidization gas flow rate) allows a uniform deposition of the metallic precursor inside the porous matrix or on the support surface. The impregnation under slow drying conditions (IM ≥ 10 and solvent content in the bed atmosphere τs ≥ 0. 2) leads to a homogeneous deposition inside the pores. Under fast drying conditions (IM < 5 and τs < 0. 2), the deposit is located at the particle external surface. In the case of slow drying, the impregnation kinetics can be represented by a “shrinking core” model. The critical impregnation rate is controlled by the competition between dissolution and recrystallization at the elementary grain scale. The size of the metal crystallites depends on the pore mean size and size distribution and on the drying rate...|$|R
