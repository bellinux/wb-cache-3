25|$|<b>Metabotropic</b> <b>receptors,</b> {{are slow}} {{response}} receptors in postsynaptic cells. Typically these slow responses {{are characterized by}} more elaborate intracellular changes in biochemistry. Responses of neurotransmitter uptake by <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> can result in the activation of intracellualar enzymes and cascades involving second messengers, {{as is the case}} with G protein-linked <b>receptors.</b> Various <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> can include certain glutamate receptors, muscarinic ACh receptors, GABAB receptors, and receptor tyrosine kinases.|$|R
25|$|Various {{types of}} receptors {{can be used}} for cell {{signaling}} and communication and can include ionotropic <b>receptors</b> and <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors.</b> These cell surface receptor types are differentiated by the mechanism and duration of action with ionotropic receptors being associated with fast signal transmission and <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> being associated with slow signal transmission. <b>Metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> happen to cover a wide variety of cell-surface receptors with notably different signaling cascades.|$|R

50|$|Both {{receptor}} {{types are}} activated by specific neurotransmitters. When an ionotropic receptor is activated, it opens a channel that allows ions such as Na+, K+, or Clâˆ’ to flow. In contrast, when a <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> is activated, {{a series of}} intracellular events are triggered that can also result in ion channels opening but must involve a range of second messenger chemicals.|$|E
50|$|Every rod or cone {{photoreceptor}} {{releases the}} same neurotransmitter, glutamate. However, {{the effect of}} glutamate differs in the bipolar cells, depending upon the type of receptor imbedded in that cell's membrane. When glutamate binds to an ionotropic receptor, the bipolar cell will depolarize (and therefore will hyperpolarize with light as less glutamate is released). On the other hand, binding of glutamate to a <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> results in a hyperpolarization, so this bipolar cell will depolarize to light as less glutamate is released.|$|E
50|$|LTD {{occurs at}} synapses in {{cerebellar}} Purkinje neurons, which receive {{two forms of}} excitatory input, one from a single climbing fiber and one from {{hundreds of thousands of}} parallel fibers. LTD decreases the efficacy of parallel fiber synapse transmission, though, according to recent findings, it also impairs climbing fiber synapse transmission. Both parallel fibers and climbing fibers must be simultaneously activated for LTD to occur. With respect to calcium release however, it is best if the parallel fibers are activated a few hundred milliseconds before the climbing fibres. In one pathway, parallel fiber terminals release glutamate to activate AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic Purkinje cell. When glutamate binds to the AMPA receptor, the membrane depolarizes. Glutamate binding to the <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> activates phospholipase C (PLC) and produces diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) second messengers. In the pathway initiated by activation of climbing fibers, calcium enters the postsynaptic cell through voltage-gated ion channels, raising intracellular calcium levels. Together, DAG and IP3 augment the calcium concentration rise by targeting IP3-sensitive receptors triggering release of calcium from intracellular stores as well as protein kinase C (PKC) activation (which is accomplished jointly by calcium and DAG). PKC phosphorylates AMPA receptors, which promotes their dissociation from scaffold proteins in the post-synaptic membrane and subsequent internalization. With the loss of AMPA receptors, the postsynaptic Purkinje cell response to glutamate release from parallel fibers is depressed. Calcium triggering in the cerebellum is a critical mechanism involved in long-term depression. Parallel fibre terminals and climbing fibres work together in a positive feedback loop for invoking high calcium release.|$|E
40|$|Two {{classes of}} receptors transduce {{neurotransmitter}} signals: ionotropic <b>receptors</b> and heptahelical <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors.</b> Whereas the ionotropic receptors are structurally {{associated with a}} membrane channel, a mediating mechanism is necessary to functionally link <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> with their respective effectors. According to the accepted paradigm, {{the first step in}} the metabotropic transduction process requires the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins. An increasing number of observations, however, point to a novel mechanism through which neurotransmitters can initiate biochemical signals and modulate neuronal excitability. According to this mechanism <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> induce responses by activating transduction systems that do not involve G-proteins...|$|R
50|$|Based {{on their}} {{structural}} and functional characteristics, the neurotransmitter receptor {{can be classified}} into two broad categories: <b>metabotropic</b> and ionotropic <b>receptors.</b> Ionotropic receptors form an ion channel pore. In contrast, <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> are indirectly linked with ion channels on the plasma membrane of the cell through signal transduction mechanisms, often G proteins. Hence, G protein-coupled <b>receptors</b> are inherently <b>metabotropic.</b> Other examples of <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> include tyrosine kinases and guanylyl cyclase receptors.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> have neurotransmitters as ligands, which, when {{bound to}} the receptors, {{initiate}} cascades {{that can lead to}} channel-opening or other cellular effects. When a ligand (the neurotransmitter) binds to the receptor (the transducer) the latter activates a primary effector via the G-protein, which can go on to activate secondary messengers or have other effects. Since opening channels by <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> involves activating a number of molecules in turn, channels associated with these receptors take longer to open than ionotropic receptors do, and they are thus not involved in mechanisms that require quick responses. However, <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> also remain open from seconds to minutes. Thus they have a much longer-lasting effect than ionotropic receptors, which open quickly but only remain open for a few milliseconds. [...] While ionotropic channels have an effect only in the immediate region of the receptor, the effects of <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> can be more widespread through the cell.|$|R

40|$|<b>Metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> {{activation}} {{is important}} for learning, memory and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and other brain regions. Synaptic stimulation of metabotropic receptors in basolateral amygdala (BLA) projection neurons evokes a focal rise in free Ca 2 + in the dendrites that propagate as waves into the soma and nucleus. These Ca 2 + waves initiate in the proximal dendrites and show limited propagation centrifugally away from the soma. In other cell types, Ca 2 + waves {{have been shown to}} be mediated by either metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) or muscarinic receptor (mAChR) activation. Here we show that mGluRs and mAChRs act cooperatively to release Ca 2 + from inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) -sensitive intracellular Ca 2 + stores. Whereas action potentials (APs) alone were relatively ineffective in raising nuclear Ca 2 +, their pairing with <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> activation evoked an IP 3 -receptor-mediated Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release, raising nuclear Ca 2 + into the micromolar range. Metabotropic-receptor-mediated Ca 2 +-store release was highly compartmentalized. When coupled with <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> stimulation, large robust Ca 2 + rises and AP-induced amplification were observed in the soma, nucleus and sparsely spiny dendritic segments with metabotropic stimulation. In contrast, no significant amplification of the Ca 2 + transient was detected in spine-dense high-order dendritic segments. Ca 2 + rises evoked by photolytic uncaging of IP 3 showed the same distribution, suggesting that IP 3 -sensitive Ca 2 + stores are preferentially located in the soma and proximal dendrites. This distribution of metabotropic-mediated store release suggests that the neuromodulatory role of <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> stimulation in BLA-dependent learning may result from enhanced nuclear signalling...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSynapses between hippocampal interneurons are an {{important}} potential target for modulatory influences that could affect overall network behavior. We report that the selective group III <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist L(+) - 2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP 4) depresses GABAergic transmission to interneurons more than to pyramidal neurons. The L-AP 4 -induced depression is accompanied by changes in trial-to-trial variability and paired-pulse depression that imply a presynaptic site of action. Brief trains of stimuli in Schaffer collaterals also depress GABAergic transmission to interneurons. This depression persists when GABAB receptors are blocked, is enhanced by blocking glutamate uptake, and is abolished by the group III <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonist Î±-methylserine-O-phosphate (MSOP). The results imply that GABAergic transmission among interneurons is modulated by glutamate spillover from excitatory afferent terminals...|$|E

40|$|Summary-The {{selective}} glutamate <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist (lS, 3 R) -l-aminocyclopentane- 1, 3 -dicarboxylic acid (lS, 3 R-ACPD) {{was applied}} iontophoretically to {{cells in the}} rat primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in vivo. In contrast to other in uivo studies, distinct excitatory and depressant effects were observed. The excitatory responses could not be blocked by ionotropic antagonists, as evidence that they were mediated by a <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor.</b> The depressant effects were most pronounced on natural synaptic transmission, suggesting that a presynaptic receptor may be involved, although responses to iontophoretically applied agonists were also affected. Comparison with the presumed presynaptic glutamate receptor agonist L- 2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyrate (L-AP 4) suggest that the depressant effects of lS, 3 R-ACPD could be partially mediated by a presynaptic autoreceptor.

50|$|The {{two main}} types of {{glutamate}} receptors are ionotropic <b>receptors</b> and <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors.</b> Ionotropic receptors (iGluRs) are fast-acting ligand-gated ion channels and include AMPA, Kainate and NMDA. <b>Metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> are G-protein coupled receptors that mediate slower, longer-lasting effects through second messenger systems and {{are responsible for}} other neuronal functions that are not typically controlled by iGluRs. mGluRs are split into 3 separate groups (Group I, Group II, Group III) based on pharmacological profile, sequence homology, and preferred signal transduction pathway. mGlur7 {{is a member of}} Group III, the least studied of the groups. The discovery of AMN082 will serve as a useful pharmacological tool to expand research on Group III mGluRs.|$|R

40|$|Two main {{forms of}} {{neurotransmitter}} release are known: action potential-evoked and spontaneous release. Action potential-evoked release depends on Ca 2 + entry through voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels, whereas spontaneous release {{is thought to}} be Ca 2 + -independent. Generally, spontaneous and action potential-evoked release are believed to use the same release machinery to release neurotransmitter. This study shows, using the whole cell patch-clamp technique in rat cerebellar slices, that at the interneuron- Purkinje cell synapse activation of presynaptic group II <b>metabotropic</b> glutamate <b>receptors</b> suppresses spontaneous GABA release through a mechanism independent of voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels, store-operated Ca 2 + channels, and Ca 2 + release from intracellular Ca 2 + stores, suggesting that the <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors</b> target the release machinery directly. Voltage gated Ca 2 + channel-independent release following increased presynaptic cAMP production is similarly inhibited by these <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptors.</b> In contrast, both voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel-dependent and presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent GABA release were unaffected by activation of group II <b>metabotropic</b> glutamate <b>receptors.</b> Hence, the mechanisms underlying spontaneous and Ca 2 + -dependent GABA release are distinct in that only the former is blocked by group II <b>metabotropic</b> glutamate <b>receptors.</b> Thus the same neurotransmitter, glutamate, can activate or inhibit neurotransmitter release by selecting different receptors that target different release machineries...|$|R

40|$|Excitatory {{amino acids}} (EAAs) {{are known to}} stimulate {{neurohormone}} release through the activation of ion-channel-linked receptors (ionotropic receptors). Here we report that a receptor for EAAs linked to polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis (<b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor)</b> is also present at the hypothalamus where its expression is developmentally regulated. Stimulation of [3 H]inositolmonophosphate ([3 H]InsP) formation by quisqualate (EC 50 = 1. 5 microM), ibotenate (EC 50 = 100 microM) and trans- 1 -amino- 1, 3 -cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD; EC 50 = 30 microM) is extremely high (up to 50 -fold) in the first 10 days of postnatal life, progressively declines during maturation and is virtually absent in the adult. Stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by quisqualate, ibotenate and t-ACPD is more pronounced than that induced by classical neurotransmitters that stimulate inositol phosphate formation such as norepinephrine and carbamylcholine. Agonists of the ionotropic glutamate receptor such as kainate, NMDA and alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 5 -isoxazolpropionate (AMPA), do not modify inositol phosphate accumulation in hypothalamic slices.

Although the VPM thalamocortical projection has been studied in depth, several details of the POm projection to S 1 are unknown. We studied the synaptic properties and anatomical features in the mouse of the projection from POm to all layers of S 1 and to layer 4 of secondary {{somatosensory cortex}} (S 2). Neurons in S 1 responded to stimulation of POm with what has been termed Class 2 properties (paired-pulse facilitation, small initial excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), a graded activation profile, and a <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> component; thought to be modulatory), whereas neurons in layer 4 of S 2 responded with Class 1 A properties (paired-pulse depression, large initial EPSPs, an all-or-none activation profile, and no <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> component, thought to be a main information input). Also, labeling from POm produced small boutons in S 1, whereas both small and large boutons were found in S 2.

40|$|Although the neuromodulator {{adenosine}} {{plays an}} important role in many central nervous system physiological and pathological processes, the properties and mechanisms of extracellular adenosine production are still unclear. In previous work, we determined that two forms of adenosine release can be evoked in the molecular layer of the cerebellum: one independent of ionotropic glutamate receptor activation (evoked by a train of stimuli) and one mainly dependent on the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors (evoked by a single stimulus in 4 -aminopyridine). Here we have investigated how these different forms of adenosine release are modulated by metabotropic receptors (A 1, GABAB and mGlu 4). Although both types of adenosine release are inhibited by the activation of metabotropic receptors, single stimulus-evoked release was much more potently inhibited suggesting differential coupling between receptors and adenosine release mechanisms. <b>Metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> antagonists revealed that endogenous A 1 receptor activation plays the major role in controlling adenosine release and determine the relationship between stimulus strength and adenosine release. The major mechanism of modulation is through control of ionotropic glutamate receptor activation with block of metabotropic receptors inducing glutamate receptor-dependent adenosine release. In contrast to <b>metabotropic</b> <b>receptor</b> agonists, which inhibit adenylyl cyclase, activation of adenylyl cyclase (with forskolin) increased both glutamate receptor-dependent and independent adenosine release.
