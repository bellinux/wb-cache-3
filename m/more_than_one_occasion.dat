40|$|SummaryBackgroundPertussis {{is mainly}} {{considered}} as a disease of childhood. However, {{an increasing number of}} adults with infection due to Bordetella pertussis is reported in the literature. MethodsA retrospective cohort study of patients with a new origin-cough of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 3 weeks duration who were evaluated by an internal medicine–infectious diseases group practice in Athens, Greece during the period 10 / 2005 – 12 / 2007 was performed; patients underwent serological testing for B. pertussis infection. ResultsFive hundred and fifty-four adult patients underwent B. pertussis serological testing from whom 441 had a single IgM/IgG measurement. The percentage of seropositivity in the IgM/IgG B. pertussis serological testing was 71. 5 % in the population studied (397 / 554 patients; for patients who had IgM/IgG B. pertussis serological testing in <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>occasions,</b> only the result of the first IgM/IgG measurement was taken into account for this analysis). For the subset of patients with a single IgM/IgG measurement, the percentage of seropositivity against B. pertussis was 70. 7 % (312 / 441 patients). ConclusionsB. pertussis infection should be {{considered as a}} significant pathogenic infection in a significant proportion of adult patients presenting a new origin-cough of <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 3 weeks duration. In order to reduce the burden of pertussis disease in adults as well as transmission of pertussis in children, booster vaccination is recommended for adolescents and adults...|$|R

60|$|Yet these dawnings {{of sense}} and {{humanity}} were {{obscured by the}} clouds of the ancient superstition on <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> distinguished <b>occasion.</b> In 1676, Sir George Maxwell, of Pollock, apparently a man of melancholic and valetudinary habits, believed himself bewitched to death by six witches, one man and five women, who were leagued {{for the purpose of}} tormenting a clay image in his likeness. The chief evidence on the subject was a vagabond girl, pretending to be deaf and dumb. But as her imposture was afterwards discovered and herself punished, it is reasonably to be concluded that she had herself formed the picture or image of Sir George, and had hid it where it was afterwards found in consequence of her own information. In the meantime, five of the accused were executed, and the sixth only escaped on account of extreme youth.|$|R

40|$|Plants are {{organisms that}} offer unique {{reproductive}} systems to study sex determination, in other words, {{the expression of}} masculinity or femininity. Within the plant kingdom, the separation of sex has emerged over the evolutionary history in <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> hundred <b>occasions.</b> With each new phylogenetically-independent event {{there is a new}} reproductive system which may be similar or completely different from the previous system, so in plants there is not an only one mechanism to explain the dioecism. Cycads are a group of primitive dioecious plants that offers an extraordinary opportunity to study the emergence of dioecism in plant species. Several studies have shown that sex in cycads may be determined by homomorphic or heteromorphic sexual chromosomes; although the possibility of epigenetic factors influencing sex determination in these plants cannot be ruled out. The possibility to anticipate the sex of the cycads would allow us to establish management plans focused to the production of quality seeds in sufficient quantity to meet the demand for these ornamental plants...|$|R

Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E

Sir, in answer to that taunt, I must take leave to ask what expression of mine, either in this house or out of it, justifies any such remark? When or where can it be said that I have ever permitted myself to know any distinction between an Orangeman and a Catholic; when, in the whole course of my parliamentary career, have I ever given a vote or uttered a sentiment hostile or unfriendly to the Roman Catholics, either of England or Ireland?' This speech, though delivered generally in favour of the Irish bill, attracted very much the attention, and, as it appeared afterwards, the approbation of those Irish members, who, although sitting on the Liberal benches, did not acknowledge the infallible authority of Mr. O'Connell, and was the origin of a political connection between them and Lord George Bentinck, which, on <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> subsequent <b>occasion,</b> promised to bring important results.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{counts of}} unmarked {{migrating}} animals to monitor long term population trends assumes independence of daily counts and a constant rate of detection. However, migra-tory stopovers often last days or weeks, violating {{the assumption of}} count independence. Further, a systematic change in stopover duration {{will result in a}} change in the probability of detecting individuals once, but also in the probability of detecting individuals on <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> sampling <b>occasion.</b> We tested how variation in stopover duration influenced accuracy and precision of population trends by simulating migration count data with known constant rate of population change and by allowing daily probability of survival (an index of stopover duration) to remain constant, or to vary randomly, cyclically, or increase linearly over time by various levels. Using simulated datasets with a systematic increase in stopover duration, we also tested whether any resulting bias in population trend could be reduced by modeling the underlying source of variation in detection, or by subsampling data to every three or five days to reduce the incidence of recounting. Mean bias in population trend did not differ sig-nificantly from zero when stopover duration remained constant or varied randomly ove...|$|R
40|$|Web 2. 0 has {{significantly}} transformed {{the way how}} modern society works now-a-days. In today‘s Web, information not only flows top down from the web sites to the readers; but also flows bottom up contributed by mass user. Hugely popular Web 2. 0 applications like Wikis, social applications (e. g. Facebook, MySpace), media sharing applications (e. g. YouTube, Flickr), blogging and numerous others generate lots of user generated contents and make heavy use of the underlying storage. Data storage system {{is the heart of}} these applications as all user activities are translated to read and write requests and directed to the database for further action. Hence focus is on the storage that serves data to support the applications and its reliable and efficient design is instrumental for applications to perform in line with expectations. Large scale storage systems are being used by popular social networking services like Facebook, MySpace where millions of users‘ data have been stored and fully accessed by these companies. However from users‘ point of view there has been justified concern about user data ownership and lack of control over personal data. For example, on <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>occasions</b> Facebook have exercised its control over users‘ data without respecting users‘ rights to ownership of their own content and manipulated data for its own business interest without users‘ knowledge or consent. The thesis proposes, designs and implements a large scale, robust and fault-tolerant key-value data storage prototype that is peer-to-peer based and intends to back away from the client-server paradigm with a view to relieving the companies from data storage and management responsibilities and letting users control their own personal data. Several read and write APIs (similar to Yahoo!‘s P NUTS but different in terms of underlying design and the environment they are targeted for) with various data consistency guarantees are provided from which a wide range of web applications would be able to choose the APIs according to their data consistency, performance and availability requirements. An analytical comparison is also made against the PNUTS system that targets a more stable environment. For evaluation, simulation has been carried out to test the system availability, scalability and fault-tolerance in a dynamic environment. The results are then analyzed and conclusion is drawn that the system is scalable, available and shows acceptable performance...|$|R
