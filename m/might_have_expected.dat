In a July 11 letter, he complained that the British did not appear to trust him, and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made. On July 12, he wrote again, making explicit the offer to surrender West Point, although his price rose to £20,000 (in addition to indemnification for his losses), with a £1,000 down payment to be delivered with the response. These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis, another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British, rather than by Stansbury.|$|E
5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E

25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so it sounds more like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot when I got in the band , and then things not turning out as I <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected.</b> The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E

A Lich steps on a stick and is turned to stone. Edmund and some of his army, however, have spotted some of the Witch's army in the distance, and are not as {{unprepared}} for the charge as the Witch <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected.</b> The Witch and her army finally charge forward just as Aslan is preparing to lead the restored statues and freed prisoners from her castle.|$|E
25|$|Armin was one {{of three}} {{children}} born to John Armyn II of King's Lynn, a successful tailor and friend to John Lonyson, a goldsmith also of King's Lynn. His brother, John Armyn III, was a merchant tailor in London. Armin did not take up his father's craft; instead, his father apprenticed him to Lonyson in the Goldsmiths' Company in 1581. Lonyson was the Master of Works at the Royal Mint in the Tower of London, a position of great responsibility. The arrangement moved Armin to a life and a social circle quite different from what he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> as a Norfolk tailor. Lonyson died in 1582, and the apprenticeship was transferred to another master. According to a tale preserved in Tarlton's Jests, Armin {{came to the attention of}} the Queen's famous jester Richard Tarlton. In the course of his duties, the story contends, Armin was sent to collect money from a lodger at Tarlton's inn. Frustrated by the man's refusal to pay, Armin wrote verses in chalk on the wall; Tarlton noticed and, approving their wit, wrote an answer in which he expressed a desire to take Armin as his apprentice. Though not corroborated, this anecdote is far from the least plausible in Tarlton's Jests. Influenced by Tarlton or not, Armin already had a literary reputation before he finished his apprenticeship in 1592. In 1590, his name is affixed to the preface of a religious tract, A Brief Resolution of the Right Religion. Two years later, both Thomas Nashe (in Strange News) and Gabriel Harvey (in Pierce's Supererogation) mention him as a writer of ballads; none of his work in this vein, however, is known to have survived.|$|E

In the production, {{he plays a}} teacher who is ready {{to settle down and}} marry, but decides to visit four ex-girlfriends first. For his performance, Schwimmer {{received}} critical reviews. The Independent wrote that Schwimmer [...] "is not called upon to extend his range nearly as far as one <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> in Some Girl(s). [...] Schwimmer remains bland, competent, and boyish—though not fatally boyish in the manner that appears to have turned these women on". However, Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph praised Schwimmer, reporting he [...] "proves inspired casting. He takes to the stage with... his endearing gaucheness seems designed to ensure our continued sympathy. Schwimmer mercilessly lays bare his character's opportunism, casual cruelties, and chronic self-deception".|$|E

To be fair to Yorkshire, the teams for the subsequent first and second XI matches had already been chosen before he took his 8–68. But he quickly swallowed his disappointment and his 8–53 at Trent Bridge was summarised by one of his biographers Don Mosey as [...] "the start of the Trueman era".|$|E
2500|$|At the Science Media Centre in London in July 2013, journalists met Met Office {{scientists}} and {{were given a}} briefing document with three papers on [...] "the recent pause in global warming" [...] in surface temperatures. These said other indicators continued to show warming, {{at least part of}} the pause related to heat being exchanged into deep oceans, and it did not alter the risks of future warming or invalidate the physics behind the models: it meant only a 10% reduction in the most probable projection, so [...] "the warming that we <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> by 2050 would be delayed by only a few years".|$|E

Unions lost members during this time because laborers {{could not afford to}} pay their dues and furthermore, numerous strikes against wage cuts left the unions impoverished: [...] "one <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> a reincarnation of organizations seeking to overthrow the capitalistic system that was now performing so poorly. Some workers did indeed turn to such radical movements as the Communist Party, but, in general, the nation seemed to have been shocked into inaction".|$|E

2500|$|The Great Dome, {{which sits}} atop Building 10, is modeled on McKim, Mead, and White's Low Memorial Library at Columbia University, {{which is in}} turn an {{imitation}} of the Pantheon in Rome. The Dome was originally planned to be a cavernous assembly hall, but budget limitations threatened to prevent construction of the Dome altogether. A smaller library (now the Barker Engineering Library) and lecture hall (10–250) instead filled the space. Architectural historian Mark Jarzombek later described the library space as a [...] "capacious oculus [...] light into its center, and its perimeter surrounded by a row of Corinthian columns. Four curved topped aedicules [...] a counter-punctual element. More baroque in flavor that what one normally <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> from Bosworth, the building seems in fact to be an inside-out quotation from Christopher Wren's St. Paul's Cathedral." ...|$|E

An editor of the Indian music magazine The Record wrote a mixed review of Barrio Fino, stating that anyone who is not intimidated by the Spanish language barrier [...] "will find this to be a good album," [...] praising his [...] "strong rhyming skills". The reviewer criticizes the record because it [...] "is not nearly as catchy or accessible as you <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> it to be" [...] but says that Daddy Yankee almost [...] "lives up to the promise of the hype surrounding him".

2500|$|Kenneth Dark's {{argument}} for continuing British {{military and political}} power in the east rests on the very uneven distribution of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries and the proposition that large gaps in that distribution necessarily represent strong British polities which excluded Anglo-Saxon settlers by force. Cremation cemeteries in eastern Britain north of the Thames begin during {{the second quarter of}} the fifth century, backed up by new archaeological phases before 450 (see Archaeological evidence above). The chronology of this [...] "adventus" [...] of cremations is supported by the Gallic Chronicle of 452, which states that wide parts of Britain fell under Saxon rule in 441. However, this did not result in many Brittonic words entering Old English. It seems therefore that no large-scale interaction occurred between incoming [...] "Germanic" [...] communities and numerous indigenous Brittonic speakers of equivalent social rank. If such interaction had been widespread, then we <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> far greater language borrowing both in terms of structure and vocabulary (see linguistic evidence above).|$|E

2500|$|Pope Urban II {{planned the}} {{departure}} of the crusade for 15 August 1096; a number of unexpected bands of peasants and low-ranking knights organized and set off for Jerusalem on their own. The peasant population had been afflicted by drought, famine, and disease for many years before 1096, and some of them seem to have envisioned the crusade as an escape from these hardships. Spurring them on had been a number of meteorological occurrences beginning in 1095 that seemed to be a divine blessing for the movement: a meteor shower, aurorae, a lunar eclipse, and a comet, among other events. An outbreak of ergotism had also occurred just before the Council of Clermont. Millenarianism, the belief {{that the end of the}} world was imminent, popular in the early 11th century, experienced a resurgence in popularity. The response was beyond expectations: while Urban <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> a few thousand knights, he ended up with a migration numbering up to 100,000 Crusaders of mostly unskilled fighters, including women and children.|$|E
2500|$|Their new-found sound {{took them}} to the DM i Rock semifinals in 1992, where they were beaten by Passion Orange. With their third attempt on 30 April 1993, the trio won because of [...] "their obvious talent and charisma." [...] Part of the grand prize was a {{recording}} session for a 4-track demo at Sweet Silence Studios, which spawned the songs [...] "Waterline" [...] and [...] "Silverflame" [...] that became huge hits on DR P3 and DR P4. The grand prize also contained a spot in the travelling Rock Show '93 and performances at the L'Europe d'Art d'Art festival in Niort, France, the Nordic Rock '93 competition that they also won, and all the major Danish summer festivals. A reviewer from that time remarked, [...] "They are not quite as extroverted as one <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected,</b> but in return they play much better than one might dare hope for. Dense and energetic, making one wonder why there are only three men on stage. One is tempted to look into the back room to see where the rest of the band is hiding." [...] They would also entertain with ironic covers of among others [...] "Stayin' Alive" [...] by the Bee Gees.|$|E
2500|$|With Roadmaster being a {{completely}} new model, and with Buick having totally restyled its entire line for 1936, one <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> only modest changes for 1937. But {{that was not the}} case. Buick was the only GM car, along with the Chevrolet Standard, to retain its basic 1934 styling for 1935, so the 1936 re-style merely caught Buick up {{with the rest of the}} GM marques. [...] For 1937, Buick moved to newly re-styled bodies along with all other GM cars. The Roadmaster gained a divided grille with horizontal bars. The center section of the grille was painted to match the body of the car. Fenders became squared off and the headlight shells were gracefully streamlined. Overall height fell by [...] without sacrificing interior room. A new carburetor and revised camshaft raised engine horsepower to 130. The engine also received a new intake manifold, oil pump, cooling system and a quieter overhead valve mechanism. A formal sedan, featuring a roll-down glass partition between the front and rear compartments, was added to the Roadmaster line for $1,641, of which 452 were sold. The price of the sedan was raised to $1,518, and that of the phaeton to $1,856, or by 21 percent and 19 percent respectively. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales increased to 16,129.|$|E
