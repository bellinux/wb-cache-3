40|$|The {{content of}} this report has emerged from {{numerous}} discussions with colleagues and deliberations of an exceptionally dedicated steering committee. This committee included Polly Arango, Julie Beckett, Shelly Gehshan, Ian Hill, and Mary Tierney. Their knowledge, experience, and careful scrutiny of early drafts were instrumental in shaping the report’s final conclusions and recommendations, but they are absolved of all technical errors and misjudgments on our part. The report benefitted from comments provided by members of an expert panel, convened to review an early draft of the report, who urged us to clarify the criteria for evaluating <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>definitions.</b> The expert panel (see Appendix A) included legislators, legislative staff, physicians, family advocates, managed care administrators, lawyers, policy analysts, and other professionals concerned with this population. We imposed upon {{a large number of}} friends and colleagues by asking them to read an early draft. Many responded with uncommon thoughtfulness (see Appendix A). Ms. Colleen Sonosky, Mr. Richard Hegner, and members of Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs (AMCHP) deserve special mention for the many perceptive comments they gave to us. To all of our friends and colleagues we owe many thanks for helping to make this a useful document...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> {{has been the}} {{operative}} tool through which healthcare coverage determinations in the United States have been rendered and justified.

40|$|JNCCN-Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Background: Next-generation tumor {{sequencing}} (NGTS) panels, {{which include}} multiple established and novel targets across cancers, are emerging in oncology practice, but lack formal positive coverage by US payers. Lack of coverage may impact access and adoption. This study identified challenges of NGTS coverage by private payers. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 NGTS experts on potential NGTS benefits, and with 10 major payers, representing more than 125, 000, 000 enrollees, on NGTS coverage considerations. We used the framework approach of qualitative research for study design and thematic analyses and simple frequencies to further describe findings. Results: All interviewed payers see potential NGTS benefits, but all noted challenges to formal coverage: 80 % state that inherent features of NGTS {{do not fit}} the <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>definition</b> required for coverage, 70 % view NGTS as a bundle of targets versus comprehensive tumor characterization and may evaluate each target individually, and 70 % express skepticism regarding new evidence methods proposed for NGTS. Fifty percent of payers expressed sufficient concerns about NGTS adoption and implementation that will preclude their ability to issue positive coverage policies. Conclusions: Payers perceive that NGTS holds significant promise but, in its current form, poses disruptive challenges to coverage policy frameworks. Proactive multidisciplinary efforts to define the direction for NGTS development, evidence generation, and incorporation into coverage policy are necessary to realize its promise and provide patient access. This study contributes to current literature, as possibly the first study to directly interview US payers on NGTS coverage and reimbursement...|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> {{has long been}} the {{operative}} tool through which healthcare coverage determinations in the United States have been rendered and justified. Now, for most people, decisions about coverage translate into decisions about healthcare since few people can afford to pay for their own healthcare. The notion of <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> constitutes a necessary component of any healthcare system that is committed to providing high-quality healthcare at a sustainable cost. In practice, however, reliance on <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> to determine healthcare coverage is only as productive as the larger health care system within which <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations occur. <b>Definitions</b> of both “medical” and “necessity” are flexible and interpretations are varied. As a result, the value of <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations depends on the character of a nation’s healthcare delivery and payment structure and on the identity of those rendering <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations. The article examines shifts in the notion of <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> through four periods – beginning with a pre- and early-twentieth century world in which medicine was essentially a cottage industry, and continuing through the promulgation and implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The article analyzes relevant legal changes during each period (including the promulgation of Medicare, HIPAA, and the Affordable Care Act) and delineates the social, economic, and political shifts each brought to U. S. healthcare and correlatively, to uses of the notion of <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> for determining healthcare coverage. The Article concludes with two sets of suggestions for redesigning the system through which <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations occur. The first set assumes the viability of the Affordable Care Act. The second assumes the possibility of more far-reaching healthcare reform...|$|R
40|$|The {{policy debate}} in Oregon has {{primarily}} {{focused on the}} Prioritized List of Services. However, little information is available on how defined coverage benefits and managed care affect the role of <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> in determining care for Medicaid patients. This issue is important because <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations are currently used by many states to limit extraneous health care costs but require resource-intensive oversight, are open to wide variance, and frequently prompt litigation challenging interpretations of what is necessary and what is not. The qualitative study described here addressed whether <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> remains a salient and useful concept in the Oregon Health Plan. Our results indicate that defined coverage benefits, as described by the funded portion of the Prioritized List of Services, supplant <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations for coverage, while managed care incentives limit the need for <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> determinations at the provider level. Clinical choices are, for the most part, guided by providers' judgment within the financial constraints of capitation and by targeted use management techniques. The combination of capitated care and Oregon's defined coverage benefits package has marginalized the use of <b>medical</b> <b>necessity,</b> albeit with consequences for state oversight of Medicaid services...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} emergence, {{evolution}} and dominance of four predominant mean-ings {{of the concept}} of <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> that have been used in past and current health policy debates about the appropriate level of service coverage under Canada’s health insurance pro-gram. Data for this study derived from a historical analysis of reports and policy or position papers prepared by provincial governments and national health care associations in response to federal legislative and policy reviews of Canada’s evolving health insurance program from 1957 to 1984. More current reports focussing explicitly on <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> were also reviewed. Our analysis revealed four predominant meanings of <b>medical</b> <b>necessity.</b> These are: “what doctors and hospitals do”, “the maximum we can afford”, “what is scientifically justified”, and “what is consistently funded across all provinces”. The paper explores how each of these meanings has evolved and been used by different stakeholder associations and governments to achieve different policy objectives at different points in time. Limitations of using the concept of <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> as a policy tool to determine health service coverage under public programs are also discussed. ...|$|R

5000|$|However, the Supreme Court {{expressly}} {{declined to}} rule {{on the issue of}} substantive due process in the aforementioned case, ruling against the medical marijuana dispensary in question on grounds of statutory construction, as the Court found that there was no standalone <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> defense in the Controlled Substances Act. Justice Clarence Thomas' majority opinion clearly explains that the Court did not consider any Constitutional arguments in coming to the conclusion that it reached. As Justice Thomas expressly states in his majority opinion: [...] "Finally, the Cooperative contends that we should construe the Controlled Substances Act to include a <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> defense in order to avoid what it considers to be difficult constitutional questions. In particular, the Cooperative asserts that, shorn of a <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> defense, the statute exceeds Congress’ Commerce Clause powers, violates the substantive due process rights of patients, and offends the fundamental liberties of the people under the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments. As the Cooperative acknowledges, however, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no application in the absence of statutory ambiguity. Because we have no doubt that the Controlled Substances Act cannot bear a <b>medical</b> <b>necessity</b> defense to distributions of marijuana, we do not find guidance in this avoidance principle. Nor do we consider the underlying constitutional issues today. Because the Court of Appeals did not address these claims, we decline {{to do so in the}} first instance." [...] As such, the question of the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act under the doctrine of substantive due process remains an open one, undecided by the Supreme Court, and debated by the citizens of the United States. Even some opponents of the substantive due process argument who support the War on Drugs have noted that the doctrine could potentially lead to the invalidation of anti-drug laws.|$|R
