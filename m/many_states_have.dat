5|$|NEPA {{has been}} emulated, {{in one form}} or another, by more than one hundred other countries, and <b>many</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> also {{established}} “mini NEPAs.” When national government agencies first started to prepare EISs, there were no professional associations dedicated to the planning and problem solving that NEPA demanded. Subsequently, Caldwell's efforts in formulating NEPA, and later promoting it, led to formation of the National Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP), a national professional association of persons who prepare EISs.|$|E

Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, <b>many</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Since then, {{some states}} have used other anesthetics, such as pentobarbital, etomidate, or {{fast-acting}} benzodiazepines like midazolam. <b>Many</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> since bought lethal injection drugs from foreign furnishers, and most states have made it a criminal offense to reveal the identities of furnishers or execution team members. In November 2015, California adopted regulations allowing the state to use its own public compounding pharmacies to make the chemicals.|$|E
25|$|More recently, <b>many</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> {{authorized}} {{financial requirements}} {{that will make}} it more difficult for working-poor adults to access coverage. In Wisconsin, nearly a quarter of Medicaid patients were dropped after the state government imposed premiums of 3% of household income.

25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> {{policies}} which protect {{the young and}} inexperienced by insulating them from liability {{even though they may}} have voluntarily committed themselves to unwise contracts. The age at which children achieve full contractual capacity varies from state to state but the principle is always the same. Infants are not bound by many otherwise valid contracts, and their intention is irrelevant because of the legal incapacity imposed on them by the state of the domicile (the lex domicilii) or nationality (the lex patriae). This recognises a set of social values that requires exculpation even though there is relevant action and consent freely given.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, {{nationalist}} movements arose across West Africa, {{most notably}} in Ghana under Kwame Nkrumah. In 1957, Ghana became the first sub-Saharan colony to achieve its independence, followed the next year by France's colonies; by 1974, West Africa's nations were entirely autonomous. Since independence, many West African nations have been plagued by corruption and instability, with notable civil wars in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast, and a succession of military coups in Ghana and Burkina Faso. <b>Many</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> failed to develop their economies despite enviable natural resources, and political instability is often accompanied by undemocratic government.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, the {{governors}} of <b>many</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> made public apologies for their past programs beginning with Virginia and followed by Oregon and California. Few have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, Poe v. Lynchburg Training School & Hospital (1981), was filed in the courts {{on the grounds that}} the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation because the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.|$|E

25|$|Since 1938, <b>many</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> adopted rules {{similar to}} the FRCP. However, some states, like California, have civil {{procedure}} systems, which deviate significantly from the federal rules; the California Codes provide for four separate types of class actions. As a result, there are two separate treatises devoted solely to the complex topic of California class actions. Some states, such as Virginia, do not provide for any class actions, while others, such as New York, limit the types of claims that may be brought as class actions. In 2013, several class action lawsuits have been filed under both the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar Michigan state laws against some of Michigan's largest medical providers and collection agencies which may have a dramatic impact on the collection of unpaid medical bills and the collection industry as a whole.|$|E
500|$|In {{cases where}} the ACHP determines federal action will have an [...] "adverse effect" [...] on {{historic}} properties, mitigation is sought. Typically, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) is created by which the involved parties agree to a particular plan. <b>Many</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> laws similar to Section 106. In contrast to conditions relating to a federally designated historic district, municipal ordinances governing local historic districts often restrict certain kinds of changes to properties. Thus, they may protect the property more than a National Register listing does.|$|E
500|$|Little brown bats {{are now at}} {{a higher}} threat due to white-nose {{syndrome}} (WNS) in eastern North America. White-nose syndrome {{is caused by the}} fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which affects bats during hibernation. [...] " [...] WNS is estimated to have killed more than 5.5 million bats in the Northeast and Canada. In some sites, 90 to 100 percent of bats have died (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, 2015)." [...] <b>Many</b> <b>states</b> <b>have</b> made special considerations with respect to the disease, including listing them as a sensitive or protected species. [...] Canada has listed them as an endangered species. [...] It is estimated that 94% of the population in the eastern half of the country has died {{over the last few years}} from WNS, and the disease is moving westward at a rate that may see them extirpated within as little as 12 years. [...] It is expected that the tri-colored bat will also be listed in a few years due to WNS, and the northern long-eared bat was recently federally listed as threatened due to WNS.|$|E
