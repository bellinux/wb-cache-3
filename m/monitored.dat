5|$|During {{the season}}, {{tropical}} cyclones were officially <b>monitored</b> by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers (TCWC) in Nadi, Fiji, Wellington, New Zealand and Brisbane, Australia. Throughout the season the United States Navy also <b>monitored</b> the basin and issued unofficial warnings, through its Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC). Tropical cyclones that were located between the Equator and 25S were <b>monitored</b> by TCWC Nadi while any that were located {{to the south}} of 25S were <b>monitored</b> by TCWC Wellington. During the season the JTWC issued warnings on any tropical cyclone that was located between 160°E and 180° while the NPMOC issued warnings for tropical cyclones forming between 180° and the American coast. TCWC Nadi, Wellington and Brisbane all used the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measured windspeeds over a 10-minute period, while the JTWC and the NPMOC measured sustained windspeeds over a 1-minute period.|$|E

5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} depth and ascent rate of the diver must be <b>monitored</b> and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth and rate of ascent, but unless the decompression is being <b>monitored</b> in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E

5|$|Because of its remote {{location}} and relative inaccessibility, climate records are poor.

Snowfall records from the three snow stations on Adams cover {{a number of years}} but are discontinuous and are limited to the northwest side. The Potato Hill station was <b>monitored</b> monthly from 1950-1976 and was replaced in 1982 with the automated precipitation sensor.

Section ‘Monitoring as a service tools’ surveys a <b>monitoring</b> as a service tools, a recent development which abstracts much of the complexity of <b>monitoring</b> away from the user. Section ‘Taxonomy’ extrapolates a taxonomy from the surveyed tools and categorises them accordingly. We then use this taxonomy to identity how well current tools address the issues of cloud <b>monitoring</b> and analyse the future potential of cloud <b>monitoring</b> tools. Section ‘Monitoring as an engineering practice’ considers <b>monitoring</b> from a practical standpoint, discussing the socio-technical and organisational concerns that underpin the implementation of any <b>monitoring</b> strategy.

5|$|Most of the Icelandic glaciers retreated rapidly {{during the}} warm decades from 1930 to 1960, slowing {{down as the}} climate cooled during the {{following}} decade, and started to advance after 1970. The rate of advance peaked in the 1980s, after which it slowed down until about 1990. As a consequence of rapid warming of the climate {{that has taken place}} since the mid-1980s, most glaciers in Iceland began to retreat after 1990, and by 2000 all <b>monitored</b> non-surge type glaciers in Iceland were retreating.

40|$|State <b>monitoring</b> is a {{fundamental}} building block for Cloud services. The demand for providing state <b>monitoring</b> as services (MaaS) continues to grow and is evidenced by CloudWatch from Amazon EC 2, which allows cloud consumers to pay for <b>monitoring</b> a selection of performance metrics with coarse-grained periodical sampling of runtime states. One of the key challenges for wide deployment of MaaS is to provide better balance among a set of critical quality and performance parameters, such as accuracy, cost, scalability and customizability. This dissertation research is dedicated to innovative {{research and development of}} an elastic framework for providing state <b>monitoring</b> as a service (MaaS). We analyze limitations of existing techniques, systematically identify the need and the challenges at different layers of a Cloud <b>monitoring</b> service platform, and develop a suite of distributed <b>monitoring</b> techniques to support for flexible <b>monitoring</b> infrastructure, cost-effective state <b>monitoring</b> and monitoring-enhanced Cloud management. At the <b>monitoring</b> infrastructure layer, we develop techniques to support multi-tenancy of <b>monitoring</b> services by exploring cost sharing between <b>monitoring</b> tasks and safeguarding <b>monitoring</b> resource usage. To provide elasticity in <b>monitoring,</b> we propose techniques to allow the <b>monitoring</b> infrastructure to self-scale with <b>monitoring</b> demand. At the cost-effective state <b>monitoring</b> layer, we devise several new state <b>monitoring</b> functionalities to meet unique functional requirements in Cloud <b>monitoring.</b> Violation likelihood state <b>monitoring</b> explores the benefits of consolidating <b>monitoring</b> workloads by allowing utility-driven <b>monitoring</b> intensity tuning on individual <b>monitoring</b> tasks and identifying correlations between <b>monitoring</b> tasks. Window based state <b>monitoring</b> leverages distributed windows for the best <b>monitoring</b> accuracy and communication efficiency. Reliable state <b>monitoring</b> is robust to both transient and long-lasting communication issues caused by component failures or cross-VM performance interferences. At the monitoring-enhanced Cloud management layer, we devise a novel technique to learn about the performance characteristics of both Cloud infrastructure and Cloud applications from cumulative performance <b>monitoring</b> data to increase the cloud deployment efficiency.
