25|$|The Schreiber {{team found}} that the NiCl2 and CrCl2 {{promoted}} addition of alkynyl iodide to aldehyde effectively. The reaction provides a 2:1 mixture of desired product and its isomer. However, the undesired isomer can be recycled to the desired epimer in three steps, including Swern oxidation and Corey’s asymmetric reduction. Pd catalyzed partial hydrogenation of the alkyne to establish the Z-configuration at C(8)–C(9). The pivaloyloxy group was then converted to a bromide for the final coupling. A stereoselective enolate alkylation between the allylic bromide with the lithium enolate derived from the second fragment provided a 3:1 <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>isomers</b> and completed the backbone assembly of (-)-discodermolide. During the final conversion, the NaBH4 reduction of ketone provided a separable 2.5:1 <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>isomers.</b> The Schreiber synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 3.2% with a longest linear sequence of 24 steps and 36 total steps. In 1996, the Schreiber group published the total synthesis of natural discodermolide with similar synthetic strategy (4.3% overall yield, 36 steps, 24 steps longest linear sequence.|$|E
25|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} escitalopram compared to its predecessor citalopram. The importance of this issue follows from the greater cost of escitalopram relative to the generic <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>isomers</b> citalopram prior to the expiration of the escitalopram patent in 2012, which led to charges of evergreening. Accordingly, this issue has been examined in at least 10 different systematic reviews and meta analyses. The most recent of these have concluded (with caveats in some cases) that escitalopram is modestly superior to citalopram in efficacy and tolerability.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consideration}} is {{the inclusion of}} phosphorothioate bonds. In a phosphorothioate bond, one of the non-bridging oxygens between nucleotide bases is replaced with a sulfur atom, changing the chemical properties. This modification is necessary in oligo design because it results in decreased susceptibility to exonuclease degradation. At maximum, four of these bonds should be situated near the 5’ end of the oligo. Too many phosphorothioate bonds can be problematic; each modified site creates a chiral center, {{which can lead to}} a racemic <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>isomers</b> with varying characteristics and properties.|$|E

25|$|Mannitol is {{commonly}} produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, {{the transformation of}} starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>isomers</b> sorbitol and mannitol. Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase mannitol yields.|$|E
