Treatment of the AFRs with 5. 4 % (w/w) of 17 M H 2 SO 4 at a methanol/AFR ratio of 13 : 1 (50 % w/w) at 60 degrees C converted more than 95 % of the triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with an acid value (AV) of 1. 3 <b>mg(KOH)</b> /g(biodiesel). Response surface methodology indicated that a lower AV cannot be reached using a one-step acid catalyzed process. Thus a two-step acid catalyzed process was employed using 3. 6 % catalyst and 30 % methanol for 5 h for the first step and 1. 8 % catalyst and 10 % methanol for I h in the second step, resulting in a yield higher than 98 % and an AV of 0. 3 <b>mg(KOH)</b> /g(biodiesel). The product thus conforms to the European norm EN 14214 concerning biodiesel. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Fish is an {{important}} source of protein providing essential amino acids. Imported fish oil are expensive, scarce and sometimes unavailable. However, extraction of oil from indigenous fish species will provide cheap, abundant and readily available product. This study therefore, aimed at the extraction of fish oil from Brycinus nurse. A total of 1368 g of B. nurse was procured from Lake Alau, Borno State. The fish were divided into four samples A, B, C and D respectively. Sample A was oven dried for a period of 60 minutes, at maximum temperature of 70 oC, sample B for 90 minutes at a maximum temperature of 96 oC, sample C for 60 minutes at maximum of 96 oC, and sample D for 90 minutes at a maximum temperature of 70 oC. After oven drying, the samples were immediately transferred to mechanical workshop for oil extraction using hydraulic press. The characterization and the quality of fish oil were measured using the acid value, saponification value and relative density. Results showed that the fish oil from samples A, B, C, and D had acid value of 3. 57 mg/KOH, 3. 59 <b>mgKOH,</b> 2. 9 mg/KOH, and 2. 75 mg/KOH respectively, the saponification value of 82. 8 mg/KOH/g, 94. 42 mg/KOH/g, 82. 8 mg/KOH/g, and 70 mg/KOH/g respectively while the relative density was found to be 0. 04305 for sample A, 0. 04301 for sample B, sample C 0. 0433 and sample D 0. 04307.

A Ãgua, formada junto com o metÃxido de potÃssio, quando em contato com os triglicerÃdeos do Ãleo, reage atravÃs de uma reaÃÃo secundÃria de saponificaÃÃo, produzindo sabÃo e reduzindo o rendimento da reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo. Foram realizados estudos preliminares de adsorÃÃo com o sistema metanol/Ãgua para a determinaÃÃo dos dados de equilÃbrio e cinÃtica de adsorÃÃo com o zeolito 3 A. Realizou-se um planejamento experimental para estudar as variÃveis que interferem na formaÃÃo da Ãgua e do metÃxido de potÃssio como, a concentraÃÃo de KOH e a concentraÃÃo de adsorvente colocada no meio reacional. Para a resposta quantidade de metilato formado, apenas a variÃvel independente concentraÃÃo de KOH mostrou-se estatisticamente significativa para um intervalo de confianÃa de 90 %. Para a resposta quantidade de Ãgua presente no meio reacional, apenas a interaÃÃo entre a concentraÃÃo de KOH e a concentraÃÃo de adsorvente, ambos no modelo linear, foram estatisticamente significativos. Realizou-se tambÃm estudos de adsorÃÃo no catalisador em uma coluna de leito fixo, na qual avaliou-se a influÃncia do tamanho do diÃmetro da partÃcula (3, 1 mm; 3, 68 mm e 4, 38 mm) e da vazÃo de alimentaÃÃo (2 e 6 mL/min). A melhor condiÃÃo dos parÃmetros estudados foi para o menor diÃmetro da partÃcula e para a maior vazÃo e alimentaÃÃo, pois observou-se uma reduÃÃo da resistÃncia a transferÃncia de massa a nÃvel externo a partÃcula adsorvente. Realizou-se reaÃÃes de transesterificaÃÃo em diferentes condiÃÃes para avaliar o efeito da acidez do Ãleo de mamona e da remoÃÃo de Ãgua por adsorÃÃo no catalisador. O Ãleo de mamona tinha uma acidez de 4 mgKOH/g, considerada alta para ser utilizado na reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo. Para reduzir esta acidez, realizou-se uma etapa de neutralizaÃÃo deste Ãleo utilizando o co-produto da reaÃÃo, fase glicerinosa. Obteve-se um bom resultado com a reduÃÃo da acidez para 0, 48 mgKOH/g. Observou-se que a maior conversÃo em Ãsteres metÃlicos foi de 93, 79 % para o biodiesel preparado a partir da reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo do Ãleo de mamona neutralizado e com o catalisador oriundo do processo de adsorÃÃo. Observou-se que a adsorÃÃo no catalisador apresenta uma melhora de 12 % nos resultados de conversÃo e Ãsteres metÃlicos. This dissertation {{aimed to}} optimize the transesterification reaction for biodiesel production using castor oil and a basic homogeneous catalyst. To the reaction was analyzed for catalyst production (sodium hydroxide + methanol methoxide potassium + water) and by reducing the castor oil, acid value. Adsorption was applied to remove the water formed in the process, because water deactivates the catalyst and shifts the equilibrium towards the hydrolysis reaction, forming soap. The thermodynamic and kinetic study of liquid phase adsorption of methanol-water mixtures was carried out using zeolite 3 A as adsorbent. An experimental design was carried out for the reaction for catalyst production. The variables concentration of KOH and adsorbent concentration in the reaction were investigated. The concentration of KOH was the most statistically significant response {{on the amount of}} methoxide formed during the production of the catalyst (within a 90 % level of confidence). To the amount of water present in the reaction, just the interaction between the concentration of KOH and the adsorbent concentration, both in the linear term, were statistically significant. Tests for catalyst production in a porous bed were carried out. The studied factors were average grain size (3, 1 mm; 3, 68 mm and 4, 38 mm) and uptake flow rate (2 and to 6 mL/min). The best condition were the smallest diameter of the particle and the highest uptake flow rate, because there was a reduction of resistance to mass transfer at the particle sorbent. The transesterification reaction were carried out in different conditions to evaluate the effect of the acidity of the castor oil and the effect of the removal of water by adsorption during the production of the catalyst. The castor oil presented an acidity of 4 mgKOH/g which can be considered high {{to be used in the}} transesterification reaction. To reduce the acidity, a neutralization step of oil using the co-product of the reaction (glycerin). The neutralization step with glycerin was able to reduce the acidity to 0, 48 <b>mgKOH</b> / g. It was observed that the conversion into methyl esters was as high as 93, 79 % for biodiesel prepared from the transesterification reaction of the castor oil neutralized with the catalyst produced using the adsorption process.
