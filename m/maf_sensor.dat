5000|$|Airflow: <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor,</b> {{sometimes}} this is inferred with a MAP sensor ...|$|E
50|$|When a <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with an oxygen sensor, the engine's air/fuel ratio can be controlled very accurately. The <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> provides the open-loop controller predicted air flow information (the measured air flow) to the ECU, and the oxygen sensor provides closed-loop feedback in order to make minor corrections to the predicted air mass. Also see MAP sensor.|$|E
50|$|Mass flow sensor, or {{mass airflow}} (<b>MAF)</b> <b>sensor,</b> {{used to tell}} the ECU the mass of air {{entering}} the engine.|$|E
5000|$|Airflow {{measurement}} using Mass {{air flow}} <b>sensors</b> (<b>MAFs)</b> instead of Air flow meters (AFMs) to improve fuel economy.|$|R
50|$|A mass (air) flow <b>sensor</b> (<b>MAF)</b> {{is used to}} {{find out}} the mass flow rate of air {{entering}} a fuel-injected internal combustion engine.|$|R
50|$|Note: Carburetors {{are largely}} {{dependent}} on {{air volume flow}} and vacuum, and neither directly infers mass. Consequently, carburetors are precise, but not accurate fuel metering devices. Carburetors were replaced by more accurate fuel metering methods, such as fuel injection in combination with an air mass flow <b>sensor</b> (<b>MAF).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The power {{differences}} {{stem from}} types of vehicles and routing of necessary pipings, as well types of manifold with different features. Engines that produce [...] have MAF sensors incorporated in them, while the [...] and [...] versions {{do not use}} a <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor.</b> Conversions can be done using the ECU {{from any of the}} higher horsepower units using the <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> along with the MAF, which has to be wired into the loom of the [...] and [...] versions.|$|E
50|$|Motronic 5.2 {{was used}} in the BMW M44B19 engine. Compared to 1.7, Motronic 5.2 has OBD-II {{capability}} and uses a hot-wire <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> in place of the flapper-door AFM.|$|E
50|$|The mesh on the MAF is used {{to smooth}} out airflow to ensure the sensors {{have the best chance}} of a steady reading. It is not used for {{measuring}} the air flow per se. In situations where owners use oiled-gauze air filters, it is possible for excess oil to coat the <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> and skew its readings. Indeed, General Motors has issued a Technical Service Bulletin, indicating problems from rough idle all the way to possible transmission damage resulting from the contaminated sensors. To clean the delicate <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> components, a specific <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> cleaner or electronics cleaner should be used, not carburetor or brake cleaners, which can be too aggressive chemically. Instead, the liquid phase of <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> cleaners and electronics cleaners is typically based on hexanes or heptanes with little to no alcohol content and use either carbon dioxide or HFC-152a as aerosol propellants. The sensors should be gently sprayed from a careful distance to avoid physically damaging them and then allowed to thoroughly dry before reinstalling. Manufacturers claim that a simple but extremely reliable test to ensure correct functionality is to tap the unit with the back of a screwdriver while the car is running, and if this causes any changes in the output frequency then the unit should be discarded and an OEM replacement installed.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} where a mass airflow <b>sensor</b> (<b>MAF)</b> is used and is located {{upstream}} from the blowoff valve, the engine control unit (ECU) will inject excess fuel because the atmospherically vented air is not subtracted from the intake charge measurements. The engine then briefly operates with a fuel-rich mixture after each valve actuation.|$|R
50|$|For 2004, Ford {{altered the}} transmission, revised the torque {{converter}} for better acceleration, and updated {{the layout of}} the optional overhead console. Laminated door glass also became available to deter break-ins and thefts, reduce road and wind noise, improve protection from flying glass in a collision and filter out ultraviolet rays, reducing heat buildup and fading of the interior. 2004 also saw horsepower ratings rise to 250 HP for police (P71) models thanks to a new air intake borrowed from the high-performance Mercury Marauder. This air intake was less restrictive and included an 80 MM <b>MAF</b> (mass-airflow <b>sensor),</b> deeper airbox, and less restrictive intake tubing. Horsepower ratings for the civilian and taxi/fleet models remained the same as they were for 2003, and they would stay this way {{until the end of the}} Crown Victoria's production run in 2011. All 2004 and up models, regardless of trim, no longer had body colored or painted side mirrors.|$|R
50|$|In a dry nitrous system, extra fuel {{required}} is introduced through the fuel injectors, keeping the manifold dry of fuel. This property {{is what gives}} the dry system its name. Fuel flow can be increased either by increasing the pressure in the fuel injection system, or by modifying the vehicle's computer to increase the time the fuel injectors remain open during the engine cycle. This is typically done by spraying nitrous past the mass airflow <b>sensor</b> (<b>MAF),</b> which then sends {{a signal to the}} vehicle's computer telling it that it sees colder denser air, and that more fuel is needed. This is typically not an exact method of adding fuel. Once additional fuel has been introduced, it can burn with the extra oxygen provided by the nitrous, providing additional power.|$|R
50|$|Engines {{that use}} a MAP sensor are {{typically}} fuel injected. The {{manifold absolute pressure}} sensor provides instantaneous manifold pressure information to the engine's electronic control unit (ECU). The data is used to calculate air density and determine the engine's air mass flow rate, which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion (see stoichiometry) and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing. A fuel-injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor (<b>MAF</b> <b>sensor)</b> to detect the intake airflow. A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other, whereas forced induction engines typically use both; a <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> on the intake tract pre-turbo and a MAP sensor on the charge pipe leading to the throttle body.|$|E
5000|$|The 302 engine {{received}} a Mass Air Flow (<b>MAF)</b> <b>sensor</b> system in 1993 (MY 1994). The 351 followed with MAF in 1994 (MY 1995) in California. 351s {{in the rest}} of the country received MAF in 1995 (MY 1996) along with OBD2 on both the 302 and 351.|$|E
50|$|The hot film <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> works {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} hot wire <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor,</b> but instead it usually outputs a frequency signal. This sensor uses a hot film-grid instead of a hot wire. It is commonly found in late 80’s early 90’s fuel-injected vehicles. The output frequency is directly proportional to the air mass entering the engine. So as mass flow increases so does frequency. These sensors tend to cause intermittent problems due to internal electrical failures. The use of an oscilloscope is strongly recommended to check the output frequency of these sensors. Frequency distortion is also common when the sensor starts to fail. Many technicians in the field use a tap test with very conclusive results. Not all HFM systems output a frequency. In some cases, this sensor works by outputting a regular varying voltage signal.|$|E
50|$|The AFR sensor {{operation}} {{can be thought}} of as being similar to the hot wire mass airflow <b>sensor</b> (<b>MAF).</b> But, instead of an MAF hot wire, the ECM tries to keep a perfectly stoichiometric air/fuel ratio inside the monitoring chamber by varying the pump cell circuit current. The sensing part at the tip of the sensor, is always held at a constant voltage (depending on manufacturer). If the mixture goes rich, the ECM will adjust the current flowing through the sensing tip or pump cell circuit until the constant operating voltage level is achieved again. The voltage change happens very fast. The current through the pump circuit also pushes along the oxygen atoms either into, or out of, the diffusion chamber (monitoring chamber) which restores the monitoring chamber’s air/fuel ratio to stoichiometry. Although the ECM varies the current, it tries to maintain the pump circuit at a constant voltage potential.|$|R

5000|$|MAFless tuning is {{a popular}} {{modification}} in Australia for Holden vehicles powered by the General Motors LS1 Gen III 5.7 V8 engine. The genesis for MAFless tuning of the LS1 in Australia was the HSV GTS version of the Holden Commodore, which was factory fitted with a Callaway-developed C4B version of that engine running in MAFless mode. Rated at 300 kW, the C4B was the most powerful factory LS1 sold in Australia and created substantial credibility for MAFless tuning of LS1 V8s. Within days of the HSV GTS's release the CSV Veloce was on the Australian market with a 330 kW LS1 incorporating a MAFless configuration. The MAFless configuration was later dropped by HSV and subsequent cars have all had MAF's. MAFless tuned LS engine equipped vehicles never eventuated in the United States as the C5 Corvette with the same engine was always fitted with a <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor.</b> It featured a larger <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> body than the ones installed in the Australian cars, to avoid any intake restriction issues and still deliver accurate injection at all times.|$|E
50|$|In many late model automobiles, a {{mass airflow}} sensor (<b>MAF</b> <b>sensor)</b> is used to {{accurately}} determine the mass flowrate of intake air used in the internal combustion engine. Many such mass flow sensors use a heated element and a downstream temperature sensor to indicate the air flowrate. Other sensors use a spring-loaded vane. In either case, the vehicle's electronic control unit interprets the sensor signals as a real time indication of an engine's fuel requirement.|$|E
50|$|The {{upgraded}} S54 engine {{used in the}} E46 M3 CSL, officially designated S54 B32HP, has a {{high flow}} carbon fiber air intake, modified valve and camshaft timing, and a retuned DME using a MAP sensor instead of the <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> found in a standard M3. However, the engine is further modified {{in order to reduce}} weight - it features a lightweight exhaust manifold (made standard on late models of the normal M3) and thinner exhaust piping. Additionally, the intake and exhaust manifolds are slightly straightened to improve engine responsiveness.|$|E
50|$|North American tuners (and {{also the}} Australian {{manufacturers}} & tuners Holden & HSV) of the LS1 tend to prefer retaining the <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor,</b> instead more simply overcoming intake tract restrictions by installing a MAF {{with a larger}} diameter body. In this way, precise fuel injection metering is still retained at all engine speeds and loads. Australian tuners in comparison, prefer to use the less precise method of MAFless tuning (see 'Disadvantages' section above), requiring the engine computer to use predetermined fueling tables, resulting in less finely tuned injection systems that cannot adjust for other variables or engine hardware changes accurately.|$|E
50|$|The EJ251SOHC was {{the first}} version of a long line of Single Overhead Cam 2.5L engines by Subaru for the US market. The EJ251 was soon {{replaced}} by the EJ253 in many models due to its improved cooling to aid in head gasket life and improved engine management and sensors. The EJ251 commonly experienced head gasket failures resulting in interior channel breaches or exterior fluid leaks due to the continued use of a single layer coated gasket first introduced on the EJ25D. Intake volume is calculated by the use of a MAP sensor, unlike the EJ253 which uses a <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor.</b> Compression ratio is 10:1.|$|E
50|$|One {{approach}} used {{to mitigate the}} problem has been to reduce the boost pressure, which reduces the required venting volume and yields less charge over-calculation by the ECU. The air can also be recirculated back into the intake, a typical stock setup for cars with an upstream <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor.</b> The situation can also be corrected by switching the fuel metering system over to a manifold absolute pressure sensor, a conversion that usually requires a compatible aftermarket ECU or piggy-back fuel controller. The MAP sensor monitors the absolute pressure in the manifold at all times and will correctly detect the change that occurs when the valve vents, allowing the ECU to reduce fuel metering accordingly.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} method for utilizing both a MAF and a blowoff valve {{is to have}} the MAF located down stream between the intercooler and the throttle plate. This is known as Blow-through rather than the traditional Draw-through set up. Care must be taken as to the position of the MAF to prevent damage to the sensitive element. For example, on a SR20DET engine, the MAF must be at least 12" [...] from the throttle plate, and the blowoff valve must be 6" [...] from the <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor.</b> By using a blow-through method, the MAF won't be affected by the blowoff valve opening as the pressure is vented before the air reaches the MAF.|$|E
50|$|There are {{exceptions}} to this however. Some vehicles, such as the 1992 and 1993 Fox body Mustangs, do use such as a system {{even though they have}} multi-port fuel injection, presumably to help the air-fuel mixture burn at the proper rate in cold weather, as even though the fuel has finely atomized, it has not properly vaporized, and therefore flame propagation will be otherwise slower. These vehicles have a <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor,</b> Air Temperature sensor, and when equipped with the 2.3L 4-cylinder, two spark-plugs per cylinder. This combination ensures the air is just warm enough to vaporise the droplets and does very noticeably improve performance and emissions {{at the same time in}} cold, northern winter weather.|$|E
50|$|With OBD II standards, vehicle {{manufacturers}} {{were required to}} test the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve for functionality during driving. Some manufacturers use the MaP sensor to accomplish this. In these vehicles, they have a <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> for their primary load sensor. The MaP sensor is then used for rationality checks and to test the EGR valve. The way they do this is during a deceleration of the vehicle when there is low absolute pressure in the intake manifold (i.e., a high vacuum present in the intake manifold relative to the outside air) the powertrain control module (PCM) will open the EGR valve and then monitor the MaP sensor's values. If the EGR is functioning properly, the manifold absolute pressure will increase as exhaust gases enter.|$|E
5000|$|The 2004-2011 Police Interceptor {{is rated}} for [...] mostly {{due to the}} {{addition}} of a new better flowing air intake system. This system includes a new airbox that is similar to the Mercury Marauder airbox (raised airbox lid, deeper bottom), with an integrated 80 mm mass airflow (<b>MAF)</b> <b>sensor</b> {{that is part of the}} airbox lid (but can be serviced individually). This allows for much more precise flow calibration and reduces the chances of air leakage. The P71 zip tube (the flexible rubber hose between the throttle body and MAF outlet) is also used to reduce NVH (noise, vibration, and harshness) as well as transfer air from the airbox to the throttle body with minimal flow resistance. From 2005 on, the throttle body is no longer manually operated via cable but an electronic Drive-By-Wire (DBW) set up.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} engine in this family, {{featuring}} a Lotus-developed 16-valve cylinder head and a cast-iron cylinder block which was {{essentially the same as}} in Opel's 8-valve engines. C16XE was available only in Corsa GSi, model years 1993 and 1994. C16XE was not yet badged Ecotec, and for later model Corsas and Opel Tigras it was replaced with X16XE Ecotec engine. The main difference between C16XE and X16XE Ecotec is emission control, C16XE lacks EGR and AIR-system, although the cylinder head is designed to enable these features. Other differences between C16XE and later versions of the engine include intake manifold, C16XE has a plastic upper intake manifold, which was replaced with a cast aluminium manifold, and fuel injection system, C16XE uses Multec fuel injection with <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> and later models used Multec fuel injection with MAP sensor. Also, while C16XE had its own exhaust front section design, for X16XE it was replaced with a front section used also in Opel Astra, probably as a cost-saving measure.|$|E
5000|$|The third-generation {{appeared}} in 1989 {{and was in}} production until 1991. This engine has the silver cam covers with the words only written in red, hence the nickname [...] "red top". Toyota increased the compression ratio from 9.4:1 to 10.3:1. To correct the air-speed problems of the earlier generations, the intake ports in this cylinder head were re-designed to have a smaller cross-section, and hence it has been nicknamed the [...] "smallport" [...] head. This change in the intake ports negated {{the need for the}} earlier twin-runner intake manifold and it was replaced with a single-runner manifold. Additional engine modifications to extend life and reliability included under-piston cooling oil squirters, thicker connecting rods and other components. Also of note, the pistons were changed to accept a 20 mm fully floating gudgeon pin unlike the 18 mm pressed-in pins of the earlier versions. All non-U.S. market 4A-GEs continued to use a MAP sensor, while all of the U.S.-market 4A-GE engines came with a <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor.</b> This revision increased the power to [...] at 7200 rpm with a torque of 149 Nm at 4800 rpm (128 hp and 105 lb-ft for US-market cars).|$|E
50|$|A driver’s side air bag {{was made}} standard. The Firebird {{interior}} again received a re-design, {{this time the}} changes were much less drastic: the lower dash and under-dash panels were altered, and accessory switches were {{moved to a new}} panel above the heater and radio controls. The deluxe contoured interior door panels that were standard in GTAs and available in Trans Ams were no longer available. All models would have to make do with the rather crude, flat, carpeted door panels, although if leather seats were ordered, genuine perforated leather was added above the armrest on the basic door panels. In GTAs the cheap door panels looked very out of place next to the exotic looking articulating seats. The console got a new shift indicator. This time, there was actually a needle to indicate what gear you had selected. Previously, you just had to line up the shifter handle with the markings. Steering wheel mounted radio controls disappeared from the GTA (due to the addition of the airbag), and the L98 engine was no longer offered in the T-top cars due to fuel economy regulations. The LB9 and L98 platforms were updated with new speed density fuel injection, and the elimination of the <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> reduced production costs and supposedly improved performance. All L98-equipped cars now received the N10 dual catalytic converters as standard, which technically was a mid year change for 1989.|$|E
50|$|Throttle-body fuel {{injection}} first appeared for the 302 on the Lincoln Continental in 1980, and was made standard on all applications in 1983 except manual-transmission equipped Mustangs, Mercury Capris (equipped first with two-barrel (1982), then later four-barrel carburetor (1983-85)), and F-series trucks. The block was fitted with revised, taller lifter bosses to accept roller lifters, and a steel camshaft in 1985, and electronic sequential {{fuel injection}} {{was introduced in}} 1986. While sequential injection was used on the Mustang beginning in 1986, many other vehicles, including trucks, continued to use a batch-fire fuel injection system. The speed-density based EFI systems used a large, two-piece, cast-aluminum manifold. It was fitted on all engines through 1988, after which year it was phased out for a mass-air type measuring system in most applications (non-California compliant Panther platform cars retained the speed-density system until the Lincoln Town Car received the Modular V8 for model year 1991, and the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis for 1992). The same manifold was used in MAF applications, {{with the addition of}} the <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> in the air intake tube. The MAF system continued, with minor revisions, until the retirement of the engine in 2001. Ford offered a performance head that was a stock part on 1993-1995 Mustang Cobra models and pre- 1997-1/2 Ford Explorers and Mercury Mountaineers equipped with the 5.0 L engine called the GT-40 head (casting ID F3ZE-AA). In mid-1997, the Explorer and Mountaineer 5.0 L heads were revised and renamed GT40P. The GT40P heads, unlike the GT40 heads, had a very well-developed port shape/design which yielded about 200 cfm on the intake side and 140 cfm on the exhaust side without increasing the size of the ports at all from standard E7TE castings, and without increasing the exhaust valve size. They also had smaller 59-61 cc combustion chambers for added compression, and the combustion chamber shape was revised to put the spark plug tip {{near the center of the}} chamber for a more even burn. These GT40P heads are considered by many enthusiasts to be extremely efficient.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} for {{mass air flow}} (<b>MAF)</b> <b>sensor</b> error {{compensation}} and an online updating error map (or lookup table) due to installation and aging in a diesel engine is developed. Since the <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> error {{is dependent on the}} engine operating point, the error model is represented as a two-dimensional (2 D) map with two inputs, fuel mass injection quantity and engine speed. Meanwhile, the 2 D map representing the <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> error is described as a piecewise bilinear interpolation model, which can be written as a dot product between the regression vector and parameter vector using a membership function. With the combination of the 2 D map regression model and the diesel engine air path system, an LPV adaptive observer with low computational load is designed to estimate states and parameters jointly. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proven under the conditions of persistent excitation and given inequalities. The observer is validated against the simulation data from engine software enDYNA provided by Tesis. The results demonstrate that the operating point-dependent error of the <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> can be approximated acceptably by the 2 D map from the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|Thermal flow {{measuring}} {{technology has}} come a long way since the introduction of thermocouple technology and early hot wire anemometers. Thermal technologies depend on heat transfer and traditionally operate on differential temperature measurements between two temperature sensitive materials to generate a signal directly proportional to the temperature differential and mass flow rate. In this thesis, the development of an open-loop Fuzzy Temperature Compensation Scheme (FTCS) for Hot Wire Mass Air Flow (<b>MAF)</b> <b>Sensor</b> is presented. The FTCS for Hot Wire <b>MAF</b> <b>Sensor</b> is used in automotive application to measure the volume and density of air entering the engine at any given time. The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) uses this information in conjunction with input from other sensors to calculate the correct amount of fuel to deliver to the engine and also used indirectly to help calculate desired ignition timing and transmission operating strategies. This FTCS used to compensate the error occurred for the Hot Wire <b>MAF</b> <b>Sensor</b> measurement caused by the temperature variation in the air. The data collection for Hot Wire <b>MAF</b> <b>Sensor</b> inaccuracy analysis is done using NI PCI 6251 DAQ, NI Elvis Board and LABVIEW software. Based on the collected data, the absolute error and percentage error for the sensor output voltage have been calculated compared to the output voltage for the standard temperature value. Then, based on the offset error, six rules for Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) have been developed. The Sugeno type FIS is used for the FTCS design. In order to verify the performance of the proposed Hot Wire <b>MAF</b> <b>Sensor</b> temperature compensation scheme, first a simulation model is developed using Matlab/Simulink. The effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy compensation scheme is verified at different temperature variations compared with Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) Temperature Compensation Scheme. Then, based on the Matlab/Simulink simulation, the FTCS has been implemented in real-time using Digital Signal Controllers, dsPIC 30 F 4013 with the Programming C Language. In this regard, a performance comparison of the output voltage of the Hot Wire <b>MAF</b> <b>Sensor</b> after compensated using FTCS, RBFNN Temperature Compensation Scheme and without compensates is provided. These comparison results demonstrate the better improvement for the Hot Wire <b>MAF</b> <b>Sensor</b> measurement accuracy with the estimation percentage error after compensation is only within 0. 8451 % of full-scale value...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{available}} flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs {{can operate}} on a blend of gasoline and ethanol in any concentration of up to 85 % ethanol (93 % in Brazil). Accurate estimation of ethanol content is important to cope with potential problems caused by fuel variability. This thesis provides the first-ever comprehensive collection of models, model-based analysis and control design for ethanol estimation in FFVs. The common practice in ethanol content estimation exploits the differences in stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratios (SAFR) between gasoline and ethanol. In this approach, the online identification of SAFR depends on air and fuel metering during the closed-loop regulation of air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) to the stoichiometric value via the feedback of the exhaust gas oxygen sensor (EGO) measurement. In this thesis, first, we develop a simple phenomenological model of the AFR control process and a simple ethanol estimation law which represents the currently practiced system in FFVs. We then show that the SAFR-based ethanol estimation is sensitive to mass air flow (<b>MAF)</b> <b>sensor</b> drifts and/or fuel injector drifts. A physics-based control-oriented model for fuel puddle dynamics in port fuel injection (PFI) FFVs is then proposed. The transient fuel compensation (TFC) derived from this model allows faster ethanol estimation and improved AFR control. Since the conventional SAFR-based ethanol content estimation is sensitive to <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> error, a method to correct <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> error is next proposed. The correction is realized by using additional measurements of the intake manifold pressure to prevent mis-estimation of ethanol content during <b>MAF</b> <b>sensor</b> drifts. Finally, an integrated estimation scheme in direct injection (DI) FFVs is formulated. This process is able to estimate not only ethanol content but also fuel injector drift. Further, it exploits the difference in latent heat of vaporization (LHV) between gasoline and ethanol by using in-cylinder pressure measurements in addition to conventional SAFR-based estimation. The proposed algorithm and the associated parameter tuning method take the data-driven model errors into account. Feasibility of the integrated estimation scheme is validated by simulations and engine dynamometer tests...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently, {{there has}} been a growing demand for flow-temperature sensors for industrial, automotive, {{domestic}} and medical applications. A quick response and low power consumption. Hot Wire Mass Airflow Sensors are used in automotive industry to measure the mass air flow intake into the internal combustion engine according to heat transfer principles. As the heat transfer process is sensitive both to the velocity and temperature of the air, any changes in temperature must be compensated for in order to achieve accurate mass flow measurements. In this paper, the development of a Fuzzy Temperature Compensation Scheme (FTCS) for Hot Wire Mass Airflow (<b>MAF)</b> <b>Sensor</b> is presented.
