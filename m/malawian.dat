5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did not itself achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing <b>Malawian</b> nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by <b>Malawian</b> politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{is among}} the world's least-developed countries. The economy is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population. The <b>Malawian</b> {{government}} depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The <b>Malawian</b> government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, environmental protection, and becoming financially independent amidst widespread overpopulation and unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with {{a rise in the}} economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{maintains}} a small standing military of approximately 25,000 men, the <b>Malawian</b> Defence Force. It consists of army, navy {{and air force}} elements. The Malawi army originated from British colonial units formed before independence, and is now made up of two rifle regiments and one parachute regiment. The Malawi Air Force was established with German help in 1976, and operates {{a small number of}} transport aircraft and multi-purpose helicopters. The <b>Malawian</b> Navy has 3 vessels operating on Lake Malawi, based in Monkey Bay.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, <b>Malawian</b> {{scientists}} had the third-largest output in Southern Africa, {{in terms of}} articles catalogued in international journals. They published 322 articles in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index expanded) that year, almost triple the number in 2005 (116). Only South Africa (9,309) and the United Republic of Tanzania (770) published more in Southern Africa. <b>Malawian</b> scientists publish more in mainstream journals – relative to GDP – {{than any other country}} of a similar population size. This is impressive, even if the country's publication density remains modest, with just 19 publications per million inhabitants catalogued in international journals in 2014. The average for sub-Saharan Africa is 20 publications per million inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Malawi's {{population}} {{is made up}} of the Chewa, Nyanja, Tumbuka, Yao, Lomwe, Sena, Tonga, Ngoni, and Ngonde native ethnic groups, as well as populations of Asians and Europeans. The official language is English. Major languages include Chichewa, a language spoken by over 57% of the population, Chinyanja (12.8%), Chiyao (10.1%), and Chitumbuka (9.5%). Other native languages are <b>Malawian</b> Lomwe, spoken by around 250,000 in the southeast of the country; Kokola, spoken by around 200,000 people also in the southeast; Lambya, spoken by around 45,000 in the northwestern tip; Ndali, spoken by around 70,000; Nyakyusa-Ngonde, spoken by around 300,000 in northern Malawi; <b>Malawian</b> Sena, spoken by around 270,000 in southern Malawi; and Tonga, spoken by around 170,000 in the north.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has a low}} life {{expectancy}} and high infant mortality. There is a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, which is a drain on the labour force and government expenditures. There is a diverse population of native peoples, Asians and Europeans, with several languages spoken {{and an array of}} religious beliefs. Although there was periodic regional conflict fuelled in part by ethnic divisions in the past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a <b>Malawian</b> nationality had re-emerged.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{quantitative and}} qualitative data to investigate changes in perceived risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in rural Malawi. Using longitudinal survey data, we find that <b>Malawians</b> worried less about contracting HIV/AIDS in 2001 than in 1998. According to qualitative interviews and observational journal accounts, HIV/AIDS and strategies to prevent it are a frequent topic of conversation amongst married <b>Malawians.</b> Women report worrying most about their husbands as a possible source of infection, discussing with them the importance of avoiding infection, and, increasingly, using divorce to reduce their risk. Men report worrying most about their extramarital partners and adopting preventive strategies such as fewer partners and more careful partner selection. We show that the decline in perceived risk is significantly associated with declines in the behaviors that <b>Malawians</b> worry most about and perceptions of risk in individuals' social networks. We interpret these findings as evidence that <b>Malawians</b> are changing their behavior in ways that may reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS.

5|$|Malawi {{has been}} seen as a haven for {{refugees}} from other African countries, including Mozambique and Rwanda, since 1985. These influxes of refugees have placed a strain on the <b>Malawian</b> economy but have also drawn significant inflows of aid from other countries. Donors to Malawi include the United States, Canada, Germany, Iceland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, the UK and Flanders (Belgium), as well as international institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, the African Development Bank and UN organisations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Malawian</b> cuisine is diverse, with tea {{and fish}} being popular {{features}} of the country's cuisine. Sugar, coffee, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats are also important components of the cuisine and economy. Lake Malawi {{is a source of}} fish including chambo (similar to bream) usipa (similar to sardine), and mpasa (similar to salmon and kampango). Nsima is a food staple made from ground corn and typically served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. It is commonly eaten for lunch and dinner.|$|E
5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} Malawi, certain factors such as sexual orientation, gender, and age influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 <b>Malawian</b> children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} innate immunity in variable efficacy of Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination in Malawi and the United Kingdom, we examined 24 -h tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), and IL- 10 responses to mycobacterial purified protein derivatives (PPDs). The rank order in stimulatory potency for different PPDs was {{the same for all}} three cytokines. Before vaccination <b>Malawians</b> made higher pro- and anti-inflammatory responses than did United Kingdom subjects. Fewer than 5 % of United Kingdom subjects made IL- 10 in response to any PPD, compared to 19 to 57 % responders among <b>Malawians.</b> Priming for regulatory IL- 10 may contribute to the smaller increase in gamma interferon responses in <b>Malawians</b> compared to United Kingdom subjects following BCG vaccination...|$|R

5|$|As of 2010, Chewa was {{the largest}} {{community}} in the region with 39.7 per cent population and Chewa was the widely spoken language in Eastern province with 34.6 per cent speaking it. The province was claimed {{as a part of}} Malawi in 1968 by the then <b>Malawian</b> President Dr. Hastings Kamazu Banda who was a supporter of the apartheid in South Africa against the wishes of Organization of African Unity (OAU). The then Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda openly asked Malawi to go on war with Zambia to claim the province and also affirmed that Zambia would not have trade relations with Malawi until the claim on territory was withdrawn. The expansionist ambition of Malawi was discontinued and the Eastern Province remained with Zambia.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} of HIV/AIDS in Malawi was {{reported}} at Lilongwe's Kamuzu Central Hospital in 1985. President Hastings Banda, {{who was in}} power at the time, responded with several small-scale prevention initiatives and created the National AIDS Control Programme, {{a division of the}} Ministry of Health, to manage the growing epidemic. Banda believed that issues relating to sex, including HIV transmission, should not be addressed in the public sphere; during this time, it was illegal for <b>Malawian</b> citizens to discuss the epidemic openly. In 1989, Banda introduced a five-year World Bank Medium Term Plan to combat the epidemic, but HIV prevalence had already increased drastically at this point.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislative}} branch {{consists of a}} unicameral National Assembly of 193members who are elected every five years, and although the <b>Malawian</b> constitution provides for a Senate of 80seats, one {{does not exist in}} practice. If created, the Senate would provide representation for traditional leaders and a variety of geographic districts, as well as special interest groups including the disabled, youth and women. There are currently nine political parties, with the Democratic Progressive Party acting as the ruling party and the Malawi Congress Party and the United Democratic Front acting as the main opposition parties in the National Assembly. Suffrage is universal at 18 years of age, and the central government budget for 2009/2010 is $1.7billion.|$|E

5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members of their social networks. Men are also likely to access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 <b>Malawian</b> men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them said they had heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them said they had learned about HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the <b>Malawian</b> government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many <b>Malawian</b> men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E

5|$|In December 2000, the IMF stopped aid {{disbursements}} due {{to corruption}} concerns, and many individual donors followed suit, {{resulting in an}} almost 80% drop in Malawi's development budget. However, in 2005, Malawi was the recipient of over US$575million in aid. The <b>Malawian</b> government faces challenges in developing a market economy, improving environmental protection, dealing with the rapidly growing HIV/AIDS problem, improving the education system, and satisfying its foreign donors that it is working to become financially independent. Improved financial discipline had been seen since 2005 {{under the leadership of}} President Mutharika and Financial Minister Gondwe. This discipline has since evaporated as shown by the purchase in 2009 of a private presidential jet followed almost immediately by a nationwide fuel shortage which was officially blamed on logistical problems, but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the jet purchase. The overall cost to the economy (and healthcare system) is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{participated in}} nine Summer Olympic Games between its début at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England. The only {{occasions}} {{in that period}} which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union, the former because of a boycott relating to the New Zealand national rugby union team touring South Africa, and the latter because the country joined the United States-led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. The highest number of athletes sent by Malawi to a summer Games is 16 to the 1972 Games and the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. No <b>Malawian</b> athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympics. Malawi participated in the London Summer Olympics from 27 July to 12 August 2012.|$|E
5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students {{do not believe that}} the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the <b>Malawian</b> government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E
