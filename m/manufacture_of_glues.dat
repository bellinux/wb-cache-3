40|$|The {{mesquite}} {{is developed}} in arid and semiarid regions of Mexico, including northern Sinaloa {{and it is}} very important because its wood is used for fuel, the construction of fences, fodder and pods as food for man; it produces resin having use in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glues</b> and coatings, while the flowers are important in the production of honey. By the above exposed, the aim of this work was to study and systematize the information found in the scientific literature about the mesquite tree, the methodology used was that one used by Musálem and Sánchez (2003). Mesquite is a biotic resource with a wide geographical and ecological distribution in Mexican arid zones and also a wide distribution and importance in Sudan and Australia. In this specie, a very important ecological role stands out because it is an excellent fixative soil and therefore, controlling erosion; it is nitrogen fixer, which improves soil fertility. On the other hand, under certain conditions are a source of forage for domestic livestock and wildlife. This study concluded that mesquite is a valuable species for communities of northern Sinaloa and Mexico...|$|E

The building of the Chester Canal (now part of the Shropshire Union Canal) provided an economic boost to the village, improving transportation and allowing local produce to be exported. Tattenhall Road railway station opened in 1840 and linked Tattenhall to Chester and Crewe. Tattenhall railway station opened in 1872, [...] linking the village with Whitchurch. The railways led {{to the establishment of}} industries including the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glue,</b> gelatine, fertiliser and bricks.|$|R

25|$|Three of {{the four}} Bs that have shaped Chesham's history relate to its industries. Brush making was {{introduced}} around 1829 {{to make use of}} the off-cuts from woodworking. Boot and shoe making which started as a cottage industry later expanding through small workshops thrived following the opening of tanneries around 1792 which also supplied leather for saddle making and glove. By the mid-19th century both brushmaking and footwear manufacture became major industries in the town with production concentrated in large factories. The industry declined in the early-20th century as the market for heavy boots declined. Beer brewing grew rapidly around the town centre in the 19th century again declining at the start of the 20th century. These traditional industries were succeeded by smaller but more commercial enterprises which took advantage of the available skilled labour. For example, in 1908 the Chiltern Toy Works was opened by Joseph Eisenmann on Bellingdon Road, later moving to the 'new' industrial estate in Waterside, making high quality teddy bears. The works finally closed in 1960. Post Second World War industry has ranged from the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glue</b> (Industrial Adhesives) to aluminium-based packaging (Alcan), Aluminium Castings & Bronze Castings (Draycast Foundries Limited) and balloons (B-Loony).|$|R
5000|$|Distribution {{extends from}} the {{shallows}} of the Gulf of Aden, around India, then Malaysia to the southern South China Sea, and around the Philippines, where it is abundant in the eponymous province of Capiz. They are found in muddy or sandy shores, in bays, coves, and lagoons {{to a depth of}} about 100 m. Populations have been in decline because of destructive methods of fishing and gathering such as trawling, dredging, blast fishing and surface-supplied diving. In the Philippines, fisheries are now regulated through permits, quotas, size limits, and protected habitats. In spite of this resources continue to be depleted.The almost-flat shells of the capiz can grow to over 150 mm in diameter, reaching maturity between 70 to 100 mm; securing the shells is a V-shaped ligament. Males and females are distinguished by the color of the gonads. Fertilization is external and larvae are free-swimming like plankton for 14 days or attached to surfaces via byssal thread during metamorphosis, eventually settling on the bottom. They consume plankton filtered from the water passing through their slightly opened shell; the shell closes if the bivalve is above water during low tide.Shells are used as a raw material in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glue,</b> chalk, varnish, window panes, chandeliers, and lampshades. [...] The primary exporter of products is the Philippines, where it is known as kapis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station and}} the {{surrounding}} commercial-industrial area was redeveloped from the Industri-Plex Superfund site. [...] The site is a former chemical and glue manufacturing facility. Industri-Plex was used for manufacturing chemicals such as lead-arsenic insecticides, acetic acid, and sulfuric acid for local textile, leather, and paper manufacturing industries from 1853 to 1931. Chemicals manufactured by other industries at the site include phenol, benzene, and toluene. Industri-Plex was also used to manufacture glue from raw animal hide and chrome-tanned hide wastes from 1934 to 1969. The by-products and residues from these industries caused the soils within the site to become contaminated with elevated levels of metals, such as arsenic, lead, and chrome. During the 1970s, the site was redeveloped for industrial use. Excavations uncovered and mixed industrial by-products and wastes accumulated over 130 years. During this period, residues from animal hide wastes used in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glue</b> were relocated on-site from buried pits to piles near swampy areas on the property. Many of the animal hide piles and lagoons on-site were leaching toxic metals into the environment. In the 1980s, the site contained streams and ponds, a warehouse and office buildings, remnant manufacturing buildings, and hide waste deposits buried on the site. [...] The site was cleaned up using the capping technique, in which an impermeable layer seals {{the top of the}} hazardous waste site, preventing further pollution.|$|R

40|$|Still the {{metering}} <b>of</b> <b>glue</b> in {{a machine}} <b>of</b> bottom <b>glueing</b> <b>of</b> paper sacks is a technical problem not yet solved satisfactory. The usually applied manual control <b>of</b> <b>glue</b> metering by the operators {{often results in}} an overdosing. This leads {{to a loss of}} mechanical strength and microbial stability of the sacks, caused by high humidity. An automatic control <b>of</b> <b>glue</b> metering can only be achived, when appropriate, i. e. powerful and cost efficient sensors are available. One of the measuring principles which are adaptable to the measurement <b>of</b> <b>glue</b> application is microwave absorption measurement. Industrial microwave sensors already on the market, are far too expensive for the use in machines for the bottom <b>glueing</b> <b>of</b> paper sacks where up to 16 positions are to be equipped with a measurement system.

40|$|Phenol {{compounds}} in waste water of {{pulp and paper}} industry are toxic and harmful to environment. Phenol compounds are also an expensive chemical with wide range uses, such as raw materials for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> phenol formaldehyde <b>glue.</b> This experiment was aimed at looking into appropriate method to cope with the problems of black liquor 2 ̆ 7 s phenol by converting it to the most valuable glue largely and widely used in the plywood industries, i. e. phenol-formaldehyde. The experiment was divided into three stages, i. e. (a) recovery of phenol from black liquor after distillation; (b) selecting phenol compounds from another source as an additive to increase the existing phenol concentration in the distilled black liquor; and (c) working out optimum phenol concentration able to develop maximum bonding strength <b>of</b> the phenol-formaldehyde <b>glue.</b> Phenol {{compounds in}}vestigated as an additive to increase distilled phenol concentration are crystal phenol and tannin. The two additives were added in ratio of 1 : 3, 1 : 5 and 1 : 7 (crystal phenol/tannin to distilled phenol). After that, the mixture is reacted with formalin to form phenol formaldehyde glue following standard procedure. The phenol formaldehyde glue was applied to plywood and then was analyzed for moisture content, density and bonding strength. Results showed that phenol crystal addition is better than tannin due to lower in moisture, but higher in density and bonding strength. At all mixture ratio, tannin addition gave lower plywood bonding strength compare to standard (14 kg/cm 2), but phenol addition gave higher plywood bonding strength (18 - 24 kg/cm 2). Further experiment should be conducted to use crystal phenol as an additive to increase distilled phenol concentration...|$|R
