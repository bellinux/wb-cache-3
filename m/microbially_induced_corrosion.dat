50|$|LPS {{comprises}} a loose {{sleeve of}} polyethylene that completely wraps the pipe, including the bells of any joints. The sleeving inhibits corrosion {{by a number}} of mechanisms. It physically separates the pipe from soil particles, preventing direct galvanic corrosion. By providing an impermeable barrier to ground water, the sleeve also inhibits the diffusion of oxygen to the ductile iron surface and limits the availability of electrolytes that would accelerate corrosion. It provides a homogeneous environment along the pipe surface so that corrosion occurs evenly over the pipe. The sleeve also restricts the availability of nutrients which could support sulfate-reducing bacteria, inhibiting <b>microbially</b> <b>induced</b> <b>corrosion.</b> LPS is not designed to be completely water-tight but rather to greatly restrict the movement of water to and from the pipe surface. Water present beneath the sleeve and in contact with the pipe surface is rapidly deoxygenated and depleted of nutrients and forms a stable environment in which limited further corrosion occurs. An improperly installed sleeve that continues to allow the free flow of ground water is not effective in inhibiting corrosion.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the variation in <b>microbially</b> <b>induced</b> concrete <b>corrosion</b> communities at different circumferential locations of a real sewer pipe {{and the effects of}} a wastewater flooding event on the community. Three distinct microbial community groups were found in different corrosion samples. The physico-chemical properties of the corrosion layers and the microbial communities were distinct for the cross-sectional positions within the pipe, ie ceiling, wall and tidal zones. The microbial communities detected from the same positions in the pipe were consistent over the length of the pipe, as well as being consistent between the replicate pipes. The dominating ceiling communities were members of the bacterial orders Rhodospirillales, Acidithiobacillales, Actinomycetales, Xanthomonadales and Acidobacteriales. The wall communities were composed of members of the Xanthomonadales, Hydrogenophilales, Chromatiales and Sphingobacteriales. The tidal zones were dominated by eight bacterial and one archaeal order, with the common physiological trait of anaerobic metabolism. Sewage flooding within the sewer system did not change the tidal and wall communities, although the corrosion communities in ceiling samples were notably different, becoming more similar to the wall and tidal samples. This suggests that sewage flooding has {{a significant impact on the}} corrosion community in sewers...|$|R
40|$|A material, {{from its}} {{manufacture}} and throughout its service life, may suffer attacks that impact its initial properties. Depending {{on the environment}} in contact with this material {{it could be a}} physical, a chemical, a biological, or a combined aggression. <b>Microbially</b> <b>induced</b> <b>corrosions</b> which affect all materials are frequently encountered in various fields such as oil industry, power electricity production, aerospace industryâ€¦ and may lead to the entire material destruction. Sewer networks are not an exception. Indeed, materials used in these structures are most generally made of cementitious materials that are subjected to corrosion by biogenous sulfuric acid. Under particular conditions, biogenic hydrogen sulfide may be released in the pipe headspace. This latter sulfur species is then biologically converted into sulfuric acid by the action of a succession of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria developing on the aerial part of the material surface. Sulfuric acid will stream {{on the wall of the}} structure and dissolve the cementitious matrix resulting in the collapse of the structure. However, all cementitious materials are not equivalently facing biodeterioration in sewer networks. According to field data, those made of Calcium Aluminate Cement (CAC) are well preserved with a surface pH reaching 3 - 4 while Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) (largely used) are highly deteriorated with a surface pH less or equal to 1. This work aims at exploring the interest of CAC in sewer networks through the comparison of various formulations studied both on site and in laboratory. The presence of alumina in CAC materials confers a triple action against iocorrosion. Firstly, the oxidation of sulfur species on CAC materials is less favourable than on OPC ones. Sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms have fewer nutrients to grow and therefore produce much less sulfuric acid. Secondly, it buffers concrete surface pH at 3 - 4 limiting therefore the colonization of the most deleterious sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms. Finally soluble aluminium content of CAC materials has a bacteriostatic effect on some microorganisms, limiting the development of the biofilm. Due to the better CAC material durability in such conditions, it could be envisaged to use this material in other environments where acidic compounds are biologically generated...|$|R

Recent systematic studies about {{the correlation between the}} corrosion processes and sewer environment factors should be utilized to improve the prediction capability of service life by sewer models. This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) -based approach for modelling the concrete corrosion processes in sewers. The approach included predicting the time for the corrosion to initiate and then predicting the corrosion rate after the initiation period. The ANN model was trained and validated with long-term (4. 5 years) corrosion data obtained in laboratory corrosion chambers, and further verified with field measurements in real sewers across Australia. The trained model estimated the corrosion initiation time and corrosion rates very close to those measured in Australian sewers. The ANN model performed better than a multiple regression model also developed on the same dataset. Additionally, the ANN model can serve as a prediction framework for sewer service life, which can be progressively improved and expanded by including corrosion rates measured in different sewer conditions. Furthermore, the proposed methodology holds promise to facilitate the construction of analytical models associated with corrosion processes of concrete sewers...|$|R

40|$|Improved {{technologies}} are currently required for mitigating <b>microbially</b> <b>induced</b> concrete <b>corrosion</b> {{caused by the}} oxidation of sulfide to sulfuric acid in sewer systems. This study presents a novel strategy for reducing H 2 S oxidation on concrete surfaces that accommodate an active corrosion biofilm. The strategy aims to reduce biological oxidation of sulfide through treating the corrosion biofilm with free nitrous acid (FNA, i. e. HNO 2). Two concrete coupons with active corrosion activity and surface pH of 3. 8 +/- 0. 3 and 2. 7 +/- 0. 2 were sprayed with nitrite. For both coupons, the H 2 S uptake rates were reduced by 84 % - 92 % 15 days after the nitrite spray. No obvious recovery of the H 2 S uptake rate was observed during the entire experimental period (up to 12 months after the spray), indicating the long-term effectiveness of the FNA treatment in controlling {{the activity of the}} corrosion-causing biofilms. Live/Dead staining tests on the microorganisms on the concrete coupon surfaces demonstrated that viable bacterial cells decreased by > 80 % 39 h after the nitrite spray, suggesting that biofilm cells were killed by the treatment. Examination of a corrosion layer within a suspended solution, containing the corrosion-causing biofilms, indicated that biological activity (ATP level and ratio of viable bacterial cells) was severely decreased by the treatment, confirming the bactericidal effect of FNA on the microorganisms in the biofilms. While field trials are still required to verify its effectiveness, it has been demonstrated here that the FNA spray is potentially a very cheap and effective strategy to reduce sewer corrosion.

40|$|<b>Microbially</b> <b>induced</b> {{concrete}} <b>corrosion</b> (MICC) in sewer {{systems has}} been a serious problem for a long time. A {{better understanding of the}} succession of microbial community members responsible for the production of sulfuric acid is essential for the efficient control of MICC. In this study, the succession of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) in the bacterial community on corroding concrete in a sewer system in situ was investigated over 1 year by culture-independent 16 S rRNA gene-based molecular techniques. Results revealed that at least six phylotypes of SOB species were involved in the MICC process, and the predominant SOB species shifted in the following order: Thiothrix sp., Thiobacillus plumbophilus, Thiomonas intermedia, Halothiobacillus neapolitanus, Acidiphilium acidophilum, and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans. A. thiooxidans, a hyperacidophilic SOB, was the most dominant (accounting for 70 % of EUB 338 -mixed probe-hybridized cells) in the heavily corroded concrete after 1 year. This succession of SOB species could be dependent on the pH of the concrete surface as well as on trophic properties (e. g., autotrophic or mixotrophic) and on the ability of the SOB to utilize different sulfur compounds (e. g., H 2 S, S 0, and S 2 O 32 âˆ’). In addition, diverse heterotrophic bacterial species (e. g., halo-tolerant, neutrophilic, and acidophilic bacteria) were associated with these SOB. The microbial succession of these microorganisms was involved in the colonization of the concrete and the production of sulfuric acid. Furthermore, the vertical distribution of microbial community members revealed that A. thiooxidans was the most dominant throughout the heavily corroded concrete (gypsum) layer and that A. thiooxidans was most abundant at the highest surface (1. 5 -mm) layer and decreased logarithmically with depth because of oxygen and H 2 S transport limitations. This suggested that the production of sulfuric acid by A. thiooxidans occurred mainly on the concrete surface and the sulfuric acid produced penetrated through the corroded concrete layer and reacted with the sound concrete below...|$|R

In this study, the microbial community structures and the in situ hydrogen sulfide production and consumption rates within biofilms and corroded materials developed on mortar specimens placed in a corroded manhole was investigated by culture-independent 16 S rRNA gene-based molecular techniques and microsensors for hydrogen sulfide, oxygen, pH and the oxidation-reduction potential. The dark-gray gel-like biofilm was developed in the bottom (from the bottom to 4 cm) and the middle (4 to 20 cm {{from the bottom of the}} manhole) parts of the mortar specimens. White filamentous biofilms covered the gel-like biofilm in the middle part. The mortar specimens placed in the upper part (30 cm above the bottom of the manhole) were corroded. The 16 S rRNA gene-cloning analysis revealed that one clone retrieved from the bottom biofilm sample was related to an SRB, 12 clones and 6 clones retrieved from the middle biofilm and the corroded material samples, respectively, were related to SOB. In situ hybridization results showed that the SRB were detected throughout the bottom biofilm and filamentous SOB cells were mainly detected in the upper oxic layer of the middle biofilm. Microsensor measurements demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide was produced in and diffused out of the bottom biofilms. In contrast, in the middle biofilm the hydrogen sulfide produced in the deeper parts of the biofilm was oxidized in the upper filamentous biofilm. pH was around 3 in the corroded materials developed in the upper part of the mortar specimens. Therefore, it can be concluded that hydrogen sulfide provided from the bottom biofilms and the sludge settling tank was emitted to the sewer atmosphere, then oxidized to corrosive compounds in the upper and middle parts of the manhole, and only the upper part of the mortar specimens were corroded, because in the middle part of the manhole the generated corrosive compounds (e. g., sulfuric acid) was reduced in the deeper parts of the biofilm...|$|R

40|$|Concrete is {{the most}} widely used {{material}} for the construction of the wastewater collection, storage, and treatment infrastructure. The chemical and physical characteristics of hydrated Portland cement may make it susceptible to degradation under highly acidic conditions. As a result, some concrete wastewater infrastructure may be susceptible to a multistage degradation process known as <b>microbially</b> <b>induced</b> <b>corrosion</b> (MIC). MIC begins with the production of aqueous hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S(aq)) by anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria present below the waterline. H 2 S(aq) partitions to the gas phase where it is oxidized to sulfuric acid by the aerobic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria Thiobacillus that resides on concrete surfaces above the waterline. Sulfuric acid then attacks the cement paste portion of the concrete matrix through decalcification of calcium hydroxide and calcium silica hydrate coupled with the formation of expansive corrosion products and loss of coarse aggregate. The attack proceeds inward, resulting in reduced service life and potential failure of the concrete structure. There are several challenges associated with assessing a concreteâ€™s susceptibility to MIC. First, no standard laboratory tests exist to assess concrete resistance to MIC. Straightforward reproduction of MIC in the laboratory is complicated by the use of microorganisms and hydrogen sulfide gas. Physicochemical tests simulating MIC by immersing concrete specimens in sulfuric acid offer a convenient alternative but do not accurately capture the damage mechanisms associated with biological corrosion.

This study explored the corrosion mechanism at both meso- and micro-scale. ^ Two biological simulation chambers were built to assess the influence of mixture proportions of concrete on the deterioration rate during MIC, using advanced sensors and controllers to automatically maintain the optical growth conditions for sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Twelve mixture designs varying in water to cementitious materials ratios (w/c), supplementary cementitious materials (SCM), cement type, aggregate type, and air content were used in the test. Sample appearance, surface pH, mass, dynamic elastic modulus, and surface profile were monitored periodically. Results showed up to 3. 2 % of weight loss and an acceleration factor greater than 8 which confirmed the success of the chamber system development. Concrete mixtures with 0. 30 w/c, fly ash replacement and Type V cement showed greater corrosion resistance than the other specimens. ^ Noninvasive, self-referencing microsensors were used to characterize real time biofilm activity.

Specimens with w/c of 0. 30, 0. 42 and 0. 60 had similar performance against deterioration. Increase in aluminum content could improve the corrosion resistance as calcium aluminate cement samples had the lowest corrosion rates. The effectiveness of the silicone quaternary ammonium salts against MIC was confirmed.

Selective affinity of the bacterial cells towards the mineral surface was observed through adsorption studies. Bacterial byproduct like extracellular protein (EP) was isolated from bacteria. The protein profile of the EP of bacterial cells grown in presence and absence of minerals (haematite, corundum, quartz and calcite) was also studied. The role of such proteins in selective mineral separation was demonstrated through <b>microbially</b> <b>induced</b> selective flotation. This study has demonstrated the utility and amenability of <b>microbially</b> <b>induced</b> mineral beneficiation {{through the use of}} bacterially generated metabolic products and mineral-grown bacterial cells.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{time-dependent}} seismic fragility of reinforced concrete bridges with chloride <b>induced</b> <b>corrosion</b> under spatially varying ground motions. The time-varying {{characteristic of the}} chloride corrosion current density and the uncertainties related to the structural, material and corrosion parameters are both considered in the probabilistic finite element modeling of the example RC bridge at different time steps during its life-cycle. Spatially varying ground motions at different bridge supports are stochastically simulated and used as inputs in the fragility analysis. Seismic fragility curves of the corroded RC bridge at different time steps are generated using the probabilistic seismic demand analysis (PSDA) method. Numerical results indicate that both chloride <b>induced</b> <b>corrosion</b> and ground motion spatial variations {{have a significant effect}} on the bridge structural seismic fragility. As compared to the intact bridge, the mean peak ground accelerations (PGAs) of the fragility curves of the RC bridge decrease by approximately 40 % after 90 years since the initiation of corrosion. Moreover, the effect of ground motion spatial variations changes along with the process of chloride <b>induced</b> <b>corrosion</b> owing to the structural stiffness degradation. Neglecting seismic ground motion spatial variations may not lead to an accurate estimation of the lifetime seismic fragility of RC bridges with chloride <b>induced</b> <b>corrosion...</b>|$|R
