50|$|A <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> can be {{characterized}} and qualified by measuring its near-field and far-field distributions, {{as well as by}} measuring one of these distributions while restricting the other. Guidelines for constructing a <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> and qualifying its output {{can be found in the}} ANSI/TIA/EIA-455-54 fiber optic test procedure (FOTP).|$|E
50|$|When {{the telecom}} {{industry}} converted to near-exclusive use of single-mode fiber ca. 1984, multimode fiber was re-purposed {{for use in}} LANs, such as Fiber Distributed Date Interface (FDDI), then under development. The output modal power distribution of a <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> {{is similar to the}} surface-emitters used in those first LAN transmitters, but this was fortuitous coincidence. On average, but not in every case, the OFL bandwidth measured using a <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> is lower than that produced by excitation of a partial mode volume (restricted mode launch or RML), such as occurs with directly coupled laser diodes.|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, a <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> {{mode mixer}} is a device for {{inducing}} mode coupling in an optical fiber, or a device that, itself, exhibits a uniform output intensity profile {{independent of the}} input mode volume or modal excitation condition. Mode scramblers are used to provide a modal distribution that is independent of the optical source for purposes of laboratory, manufacturing, or field measurements or tests. Mode scramblers are primarily used to improve reproducibility of multimode fiber bandwidth measurements.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of a <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> {{is to create a}} uniform, overfilled launch {{condition}} that can be easily reproduced on multiple measurement systems, so that measurement systems have essentially the same launch conditions and can measure approximately the same bandwidth despite having different laser sources. These were used for this purpose in the first U.S. NIST round-robins on multimode fiber. The overfilled launch (OFL) was created to reduce measurement variability, and improve concatenation estimates for multimode fibers, used at that time for telecom 'long haul' (e.g., 7-10 km 850 nm or 20-30 km 1300 nm) systems.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two common}} types of mode scramblers: the [...] "Step-Graded-Step" [...] (S-G-S) and the [...] "step index with bends". The S-G-S <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> is {{actually}} an assembly, a fusion-spliced concatenation of a step-index profile, a graded-index profile and another step-index profile fiber. [...] Typically, each segment is approximately 1 meter long, and may use segments of unconventional size to produce the distribution required according to core size of fiber to be tested. Unconventional fiber size was not an issue, as they were developed by fiber manufacturers, but some test equipment has difficulty complying with revised qualification standards, and now use [...] "Step Index with Bends" [...] mode scramblers, which can be adjusted to purpose. Step Index with Bend mode scramblers are created simply by routing a specially designed step-index multimode fiber {{through a series of}} small radius bends, or by compressing fiber against surfaces with specific roughness. The implementations are simple, but generally less reproducible, and require care to avoid over-stressing the fiber.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{theoretically}} {{analyze the}} loss and branching ratio of multimode optical branching waveguides {{by using a}} ray tracing method to obtain less mode-dependent branching characteristics. First, a 2 × 2 optical mixing and branching waveguide with a step-index profile are considered. It is found that an optimum length to achieve a low loss and stable branching ratio exists. Second, a waveguide with <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> is investigated. By sacrificing some amount of insertion loss, the mode dependence can be minimized...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} mode coupling effects at a microbend along a graded-index (GI) multimode fiber (MMF). By matching the incident and excited mode fields at the microbend, we obtain the coupling coefficients among the guided modes at different microbending conditions. The theoretical results compare well with the experimental results from near-field measurements on a GI MMF subject to microbending. The usefulness of our theory is demonstrated with two applications: (i) {{an explanation of the}} operation principle of a wavelength-switchable fiber laser that contains a fiber Bragg grating in a GI MMF and (ii) quantification of the function of a microbend-based <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler.</b> Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} a fiber optic microbending sensing system. An optical {{time domain reflectometer}} (OTDR) and a <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> were used to construct a serially configured fiber optic microbending system. The main objective {{of the study was}} to analyse the response (sensitivity) of different types of optical fibers to microbends induced by linear displacements of the <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> plate. Simultaneous measurements of loss at two points were investigated. The types of fiber tested were single-mode (SMF 8 / 125) and multimode (MMF 62. 5 / 125, MMF 50 / 125) optical fiber. The fibers were spliced to form serial connection. Power losses at the two points measurement were noted with different linear displacement applied. Based on the result, SMF 8 / 125 shows a wider range of detectable pressure induced by the linear displacement from 12. 6 to 20. 3 µm, whereas for MMF 62. 5 / 125 the range observed was from as low as 9. 8 µm up to 14. 7 µm. It was observed that SMF 8 / 125 showed two sensitivities which are 0. 016 dB/µm for the initial linear displacement and 1. 281 dB/µm at higher displacement. It shows that there is a threshold value of linear displacement before a high sensitivity can be achieved. The sensitivity of MMF 62. 5 / 125 is divided into three different parts, namely 0. 092 dB/µm for the first part, 0. 646 dB/µm for the second part and 0. 281 dB/µm for the third part. As for simultaneous measurements at the two points microbends induced, the second point reading loss in the serial configuration was affected by the increasing pressure at the first point. The second part is further away from the OTDR. Similar results were obtained for every fiber tested except for the response from the single-mode-multimode configuration. The loss at the second point (with constant linear displacement) did not show any noticeable decrease but the signal appeared to have relatively higher nois...|$|E
40|$|A {{wavelength}} switchable multiwavelength actively mode-locked fiber-ring laser {{based on}} highly nonlinear photonic crystal fiber (PCF) and polarization-dependent mode coupling to multimode-fiber Bragg grating (MMFBG) is proposed. Twenty meters of highly nonlinear dispersion-shifted PCF (DS-PCF) is {{inserted into the}} fiber ring cavity to suppress gain competition through the four-wave-mixing (FWM) effect. A <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> {{is attached to the}} multimode fiber (MMF) to introduce a polarization-dependent mode coupling to the MMFBG. Through changing polarization in the cavity, stable and switchable one-wavelength, two-wavelength (wavelength spacing of 0. 8 and 2. 4 nm), and three-wavelength simultaneously actively mode-locked optical pulse trains at a repetition rate of 5 GHz are obtained. We show that high nonlinearity introduced by the nonlinear PCF in the cavity can improve significantly supermode suppression ratio (SMSR) of the multiwavelength pulses generated and a sidemode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 58 dB is realized.

40|$|Detailed {{strain and}} {{temperature}} {{characteristics of a}} 2 °slanted multimode fiber Bragg grating (MFBG) are developed theoretically and observed experimentally. Results show that the strain and temperature sensitivities are almost the same for different transmission dips of the 2 °slanted MFBG. Utilizing two characteristics of the 2 °slanted MFBG, namely 1) resonant wavelength intensities strongly affected by excited mode propagating before the grating and 2) uniform strain sensitivities of different resonant wavelengths, a switchable and tunable multiwavelength fiber Raman ring laser is realized. The configuration is simple and multipurpose. Results show that the laser can generate single-, dual-, three-, four-, and five-wavelength lasing by switching between each operation if a <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> (MS) that is inserted {{in front of the}} slanted MFBG is adjusted; furthermore, a 4. 2 -nm continuous wavelength-tuning range is achieved by straining the slanted MFBG when the MS is fixed.

40|$|Interest in the {{transmission}} of high intensities through optical fibers is being motivated by {{an increasing number of}} applications. Using different laser types and fiber materials, various studies are encountering transmission limitations due to laser-induced damage processes. The authors have found that fiber transmission is often limited by a plasma-forming breakdown occurring at the fiber entrance face. System attributes that will affect breakdown and damage thresholds include laser characteristics, the design and alignment of laser-to-fiber injection optics, and fiber end-face preparation. In the present work the authors have combined insights gained in past studies in order to establish what thresholds can be achieved if all system attributes can be optimized to some degree. The multimode laser utilized past modifications that produced a relatively smooth, quasi-Gaussian profile. The laser-to-fiber injection system achieved a relatively low value for the ratio of peak-to-average fluences at the fiber entrance face, incorporated a <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler</b> to generate a broad mode power distribution within the initial segment of the fiber path, and had improved fixturing to insure that the fiber axis was collinear with the incident laser beam. Fiber end faces were prepared by a careful mechanical polishing schedule followed by surface conditioning using a CO{sub 2 } laser. In combination, these factors resulted in higher thresholds for breakdown and damage than they had achieved previously in studies that utilized a simple lens injection system...|$|E
40|$|CYCLOPS 2 is {{an upgrade}} for the UCLES high {{resolution}} spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, scheduled for commissioning in semester 2012 A. By replacing the 5 mirror Coudé train with a Cassegrain mounted fibre-based image slicer CYCLOPS 2 simultaneously provides improved throughput, reduced aperture losses and increased spectral resolution. Sixteen optical fibres collect {{light from a}} 5. 0 arcsecond^ 2 area of sky and reformat it into {{the equivalent of a}} 0. 6 arcsecond wide slit, delivering a spectral resolution of R = 70000 and up to twice as much flux as the standard 1 arcsecond slit of the Coudé train. CYCLOPS 2 also adds support for simultaneous ThAr wavelength calibration via a dedicated fibre. CYCLOPS 2 consists of three main components, the fore-optics unit, fibre bundle and slit unit. The fore optics unit incorporates magnification optics and a lenslet array and is designed to mount to the CURE Cassegrain instrument interface, which provides acquisition, guiding and calibration facilities. The fibre bundle transports the light from the Cassegrain focus to the UCLES spectrograph at Coudé and also includes a fibre <b>mode</b> <b>scrambler.</b> The slit unit consists of the fibre slit and relay optics to project an image of the slit onto the entrance aperture of the UCLES spectrograph. CYCLOPS 2 builds on experience with the first generation CYCLOPS fibre system, which we also describe in this paper. We present the science case for an image slicing fibre feed for echelle spectroscopy and describe the design of CYCLOPS and CYCLOPS 2. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, published in Proc.
