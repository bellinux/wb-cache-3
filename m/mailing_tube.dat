50|$|Klipsch's {{interest}} in engineering {{was influenced by}} his father, an instructor {{of mechanical engineering at}} Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Although he was only 12 when his father died, Klipsch's {{interest in}} science and engineering endured. He built his first speaker using a <b>mailing</b> <b>tube</b> and a pair of earphones at the age of 15, which was a year before the first public radio broadcast.|$|E
50|$|A Sphere {{manages to}} send his dying apostle back {{on his way to}} Flatland via a <b>mailing</b> <b>tube</b> before bombs destroy both Messiah, Inc. and A Sphere himself, but A Square’s journey back is halted by A Sphere's hovercraft, who {{attempts}} to crush A Square to avenge A Sphere's death. But, an X-Axis ship crashes into and destroys the hovercraft, and A Square ends up plunging in freefall toward Flatland and through its surface into unknown regions below, where he experiences a revelation on dimensionality and infinity.|$|E
50|$|One of Tinker Toy’s most {{distinctive}} features is the toy’s packaging. Initially, the <b>mailing</b> <b>tube</b> design {{was chosen to}} reduce shipping costs. Early versions of the packaging included an address label on the tube with space for postage. To assist consumers in differentiating between the various offerings, sets were placed in mail tube packages of different sizes and also delineated with a number (ex: 116, 136) and a name (ex: major, prep, big boy, junior, grad). A colorful “how-to” instruction guide accompanied each set. In the 1950s, color was added and the wooden sticks appeared in red, green, blue, and yellow.|$|E
5000|$|Turbo Pan (ca. 1985) is an {{interactive}} sculpture consisting of cardboard <b>mailing</b> <b>tubes</b> of varying lengths {{mounted on the}} rim of a bicycle wheel. A vacuum cleaner with reversed air flow both causes the wheel to spin and plays the tubes as they pass by, creating a hybrid between [...] "zoetrope, barrel organ, and Tibetan prayer wheel." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Reports on {{the number}} of {{underground}} communications are greatly exaggerated. In the days of Stalin, who was very afraid of assassination attempts, there was in fact a single-track underground railway line running from the Kremlin to his so-called [...] "Nearby Dacha" [...] in Volynskoye. Today, neither the Dacha nor the subway line are in use. In addition, there were underground transport links between the General Staff and several other government facilities. In 1991 a pneumatic <b>mail</b> <b>tube</b> was constructed between the CPSU Central Committee building in Moscow's Old Square and the Kremlin." ...|$|R
5000|$|American Craig Ramsell {{reportedly}} {{came up for}} {{the idea}} for his boomwhackers in 1994 while at home recovering from radiation therapy for cancer. While cutting cardboard tubes into shorter lengths for recycling he happened to notice the different pitches resulting from the different lengths and decided to investigate their creative potential. He experimented with various plastics before settling on plastic <b>mailing</b> <b>tubes.</b> [...] He and his partner, wife Monnie Ramsell, formed DrumSpirit as a sole proprietorship to market the tubes. The original plastic boomwhackers were first produced in 1995. The current version, which is far more durable than the earlier prototype, was released in 1997.|$|R
5000|$|In 1915 kau cim sticks were {{introduced}} to the United States under the trade name [...] "Chi Chi Chinese Fortune Teller" [...] by the Pacific Dry Goods Company of San Francisco, California, where a large population of Chinese immigrants had settled. The Chi Chi sticks, 78 in number, were made in China of bamboo but they were marked with Arabic numerals instead of Chinese characters, and were packaged in a bright yellow and red chipboard tube with a black lid (like a modern <b>mailing</b> <b>tube).</b> They were accompanied by a rolled-up booklet of 78 rhyming interpretations that fit inside the tube with the sticks.|$|E
50|$|Painted in Paris, the reproductions {{are brought}} into Spain by Bourne's wife, an upper-class young American girl named Eve Lewis, who loves Bourne {{in spite of}} his criminality. In the first few dozen pages of the book Bourne {{successfully}} steals, with no twinges of remorse, three masterpieces from the castle of his supposed friend, the Duchess of Dos Cortes, and arranges for his wife to smuggle them to Paris for a highly profitable sale. When she arrives in Paris, however, she discovers that the <b>mailing</b> <b>tube</b> in which the paintings were being carried is now empty. The rest of the book is the narrative of their downhill path, {{as well as that of}} most of those people unlucky enough to have found themselves in their orbit.|$|E
40|$|Educational Media Services {{produces}} poster sessions as a continuous- roll print {{referred to}} as a “window shade ” or rollout poster. Poster sessions can be designed by Media Services staff with your content, or if you choose to design your own poster, you can use Powerpoint to assemble your content for proofing and printing on the wide-format printer in Media Services. Poster printing is offered in high-resolution color (720 x 720 dpi) on either semi-gloss or glossy paper. Posters can be of varying lengths and up to 48 inches high. The continuous roll prints can be conveniently carried to meetings in a large <b>mailing</b> <b>tube</b> or other lightweight container. It is strongly suggested that a small version of your poster be printed to proof all the design elements including fonts, placement, scans, and alignment. You may also want an additional small print for office or lab display. Allow about three days production time for proofing, printing and any finishing necessary. Full design services will take an additional couple days. Printing to semi-gloss paper costs $ 9. 50 per square foot, and printing to glossy paper costs $ 15. 00 per square foot...|$|E
5000|$|The coin {{operated}} newspaper {{vending machine}} {{was invented in}} 1947 by inventor George Thiemeyer Hemmeter. Hemmeter's company, the Serven Vendor Company, was based in Berkeley, California, and had been making rural <b>mail</b> <b>tubes</b> and honor racks. The new invention could be adjusted to accept coins of different denominations (depending {{on the cost of}} the paper sold). The newspaper rack was able to be used with one hand, and took around 30 seconds to dispense a paper. Two models, one with a capacity for 1250 pages of newsprint, the other 2500 pages, were brought into production initially. [...] By 1987, over one million machines had been distributed.|$|R
50|$|During this time, Tainter {{worked with}} the Bells on several inventions, amongst them the {{photophone}} and phonograph, which they developed into the Graphophone, a substantial improvement of Edison's earlier device, for which Tainter received several patents along with the Bells. Edison subsequently sued the Volta Graphophone Company (of which Tainter was part owner) for patent infringement, but the case was settled by a compromise between the two.In 1886, he married Lila R. Munro, {{and over the next}} years worked in Washington, perfecting his graphophone and founding a company trying to market the Graphophone as a dictation machine: the first Dictaphone. In 1887 Tainter invented the helically wound paper tube as an improved graphophone cylinder. This design was light and strong, and came to be widely used in applications far removed from its original intent, such as <b>mailing</b> <b>tubes</b> and product containers.|$|R
50|$|Although the Beach Pneumatic Transit {{lasted for}} only three years, the project {{gave way to}} the New York {{pneumatic}} <b>tube</b> <b>mail</b> system, which was based on the request that Beach had made to Tweed and which ran until 1953.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A thin fiber or sheet {{curled into}} a {{circular}} container has a detached region whose shape and force ratios are independent of material properties and container radius. We compute this shape and compare it with experiments. The discrete forces acting {{at either end of}} the detached region have a ratio that depends only on the length of the fiber or sheet relative to the circle radius. We calculate this force ratio in three regimes of circle radius. PACS numbers: 46. 70. Hg, 87. 80. Ek, 87. 85. Uv, 87. 85. Ox A sheet of office paper coiled into a <b>mailing</b> <b>tube</b> hugs the wall of the tube in order to minimize its bending. But the contact with the wall is incomplete; near the edge, the paper detaches or takes off from the wall and rejoins the cylinder only at the edge. Such detachment is a commonplace feature of coiled sheets or fibers small and large. Here we show that the detached region has a universal shape that touches down at an angle of 24. 1 degrees. Moreover, the takeoff point experiences a focused force controlled by the length of the fiber or sheet. ‡ Present address: Physique et Mécanique des Milieux Hétérogènes, École Supérieure de Physique et d...|$|E
5000|$|The {{pneumatic}} <b>tube</b> <b>mail</b> was {{a postal}} system operating in New York City from 1897 to 1953 using pneumatic tubes. Following {{the creation of}} the first pneumatic mail system in Philadelphia in 1893, New York City's system was begun, initially only between the old General Post Office on Park Row and the Produce Exchange on Bowling Green, a distance of 3,750 feet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{failure of}} {{pneumatic}} tubes {{to live up}} to their potential as envisaged in previous centuries has placed them in the company of flying cars and dirigibles as ripe for ironic retro-futurism. The animated television series The Jetsons featured pneumatic tubes that people could step into and be sucked up and swiftly spat out at their destination. In the animated television series Futurama, set in the 31st century, large pneumatic tubes are used in cities for transporting people, whilst smaller ones are used to transport <b>mail.</b> The <b>tubes</b> in Futurama are also used to depict the endless confusion of bureaucracy: an immense network of pneumatic tubes connects all offices in New New York City to the [...] "Central Bureaucracy", with all the capsules being deposited directly into a huge pile in the main filing room, with no sorting or organization.|$|R
5000|$|On October 7, 1897, Depew inaugurated the New York {{pneumatic}} <b>tube</b> <b>mail,</b> declaring: [...] "This {{is the age}} of speed. Everything {{that makes}} for speed contributes to happiness and is a distinct gain to civilization. We are ahead of the old countries in almost every respect, but we have been behind in methods of communication within our cities. In New York this condition of communication has hitherto been barbarous. If the Greater New York {{is to be a}} success, quick communication is absolutely necessary. I hope this system we have seen tried here to-day will soon be extended over all the Greater New York." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the committee extended to all proposed legislation relating to the carrying of the mails, both foreign and domestic. It included {{the determination of the}} location, construction, and maintenance of post offices and post roads; the acquisition, lease, or transfer of realty or facilities for postal purposes; and certain aspects of the employment and management of postal employees, such as the pay and leave of letter carriers, and the settlement of claims brought by employees or contractors. It included the regulation of the Postal Service, including postal rates, the franking privilege, and the printing of stamped envelopes. At various times the Railway Mail Service, ocean <b>mail</b> service, pneumatic <b>tube</b> service, postal savings banks, postal telegraphy, the Air Mail Service, and Rural Free Delivery were included in its jurisdiction.|$|R
40|$|Background: Epigenetic {{epidemiology}} {{has proven}} an important research {{discipline in the}} delineation of diseases of complex etiology. The approach, in such studies, is often to use bio-banked clinical material, however, many such samples were collected for purposes other than epigenetic studies and, thus, potentially not processed and stored appropriately. The Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) includes more than 100, 000 peripheral and umbilical cord blood samples shipped from maternity wards by ordinary <b>mail</b> in EDTA <b>tubes.</b> While this and other similar cohorts hold great promises for DNA methylation studies the potential systematic changes prompted by storage at ambient temperatures have never been assessed on a genome-wide level. Methods and Results: In this study, matched EDTA whole blood samples were stored up to three days at room temperature prior to DNA extraction and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (MeDIP-seq). We established {{that the quality of}} the MeDIP-seq libraries was high and comparable across samples; and that the methylation profiles did not change systematically during the short-time storage at room temperature. Conclusion: The global DNA methylation profile is stable in whole blood samples stored for up to three days at room temperature in EDTA tubes making genome-wide methylation studies on such material feasible...|$|R
