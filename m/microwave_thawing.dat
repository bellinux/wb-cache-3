40|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>thawing</b> of materials, which melt over {{a finite}} {{temperature}} range, are analyzed using the effective heat capacity method. The {{state of the}} material, solid, liquid or mush is deduced from the equilibrium liquid volume fraction vs. temperature relationship for the substance, and the microwave power is calculated from Maxwell's equations. Using Galerkin finite elements, the microwave power, temperature and liquid volume fractions were obtained for <b>microwave</b> <b>thawing</b> of tylose slabs. Thawing progresses from the inside and/or outside depending on the slab thickness. For slabs 5 cm, thawing progresses predominantly {{from the surface of}} the sample. Resonances, during which the microwave power absorption is high, causes the 2 -cm slab to thaw quicker than 1 -cm slabs. A power law for the thawing time vs. sample thickness yields an exponent of 1. 56 for <b>microwave</b> <b>thawing</b> and 2 for conventional thawing. To control the temperature rise in the liquid regions, simulations were carried out with an on-off control on the microwave power.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate {{the effect of}} freezing and <b>microwave</b> <b>thawing</b> on the solution stability of cefuroxime. METHODS: Cefuroxime 1. 5 g in 100 mL of dextrose 5 % in polyolefin bags was frozen individually (group A) or in one package (group B) for 98 days at - 20 degrees C. The solutions were then thawed using microwaves at 270 (light cycle) or 800 watts (hard cycle) and stored at 4 degrees C. The cefuroxime concentration was measured by HPLC. Visual inspection was performed and pH was measured at that time. Stability of the solution {{was defined as a}} concentration remaining superior to 90 % of the initial concentration by regression analysis. RESULTS: No color change or precipitation in the solutions was observed. In group A, stability was at least 23 and 21 days after light and hard cycle thawing, respectively. In group B, stability was at least 21 and 18 days, respectively, with the pH increasing without affecting chromatographic parameters.

The aim of the review is to collect information and results about this method. Methods: A systematic review of the scientific literature about injectable drug stability studies was performed. The data are presented in a table and describe name of the drug, producer, final concentration, temperature and time of freezing storage, type of <b>microwave</b> oven, <b>thawing</b> power, method of dosage and results after treatment or final long-term storage at 5. ±. 3. °C. Results: From 1980 to 2014, 59 drugs were studied by MFTT {{and the results were}} presented in 49 publications. Forty papers were presented by 8 teams (2 to 18 by team). The temperatures of freezing storage vary from - 70. °C to - 10. °C, the time storage from 4. hours to 12 months, the thaw from low to full power. Dosages are mainly made by high performance liquid chromatography. Most of the 59 drugs are stable during and after treatment. Only 3 teams have tested the long-term stability after MFTT, the first for ganciclovir after 7 days, the second for ceftizoxime after 30 days and the third for 19 drugs after 11 to 70 days.

40|$|In this study, {{a survey}} was {{conducted}} to both evaluate the consumers’ general attitudes for purchasing and storing the raw chicken and determine the thawing practices used for defrosting frozen chicken at home. About 75 % of the consumers indicated purchasing chicken meat {{at least once a}} week or more. Furthermore, the majority (82. 16 %) of those who stored at least a portion of the raw chicken stated freezing the raw chicken meat at home. Freezing the chicken meat was considered to have no effect on the quality by 43. 49 % of the consumers while 56. 51 % thought that freezing had either negative or positive effects on the quality. The survey study indicated that top five most commonly used thawing practices included thawing on the kitchen counter, thawing in the refrigerator, thawing in the warm water, <b>thawing</b> in the <b>microwave,</b> and <b>thawing</b> under tap water. In addition, an experimental study was conducted to determine the effects of these most commonly used thawing practices on some quality characteristics of the chicken meat including pH, drip loss, cooking loss, color analysis and textural profile analysis. Although, L* value for thawing on the kitchen counter was the lowest, after cooking, none of the thawing treatments have a significant effect on the color values. <b>Thawing</b> in the <b>microwave</b> produced the highest drip loss of 3. 47 % while the lowest drip loss of 0. 62 % was observed with thawing in the refrigerator. On the other hand, <b>thawing</b> in the <b>microwave</b> and refrigerator caused the lowest cooking loss values of 18. 29 % and 18. 53 %, respectively.

40|$|<b>Microwave</b> (MW) <b>thawing</b> of 2 D frozen {{cylinders}} {{exposed to}} uniform plane waves from one face, is modeled using the effective heat capacity formulation with the MW power {{obtained from the}} electric field equations. Computations are illustrated for tylose (23 % methyl cellulose gel) which melts over a range of temperatures giving rise to a mushy zone. Within the mushy region the dielectric properties are functions of the liquid volume fraction. The resulting coupled, time dependent non-linear equations are solved using the Galerkin finite element method with a fixed mesh. Our method efficiently captures the multiple connected thawed domains that arise due to the penetration of MWs in the sample. For a cylinder of diameter D, the two length scales that control the thawing dynamics are D/D-p and D/lambda(m), where D-p and lambda(m) are the penetration depth and wavelength of radiation in the sample respectively. For D/D-p, D/lambda(m) much less than 1 power absorption is uniform and thawing occurs almost simultaneously across the sample (Regime I). For D/D-p much greater than 1 thawing is seen to occur from the incident face, since the power decays exponentially into the sample (Regime III). At intermediate values, 0. 2 < D/D-p, D/lambda(m) < 2. 0 (Regime II) thawing occurs from the unexposed face at smaller diameters, from both faces at intermediate diameters and from the exposed and central regions at larger diameters. Average power absorption during thawing indicates a monotonic rise in Regime I and a monotonic decrease in Regime III. Local maxima in the average power observed for samples in Regime II are due to internal resonances within the sample. Thawing time increases monotonically with sample diameter and temperature gradients in the sample generally increase from Regime I to Regime III. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Semi-analytical {{solutions}} for one-dimensional models of <b>microwave</b> <b>thawing</b> and one and two-dimensional models of microwave reactors are presented. Each {{of the models}} includes, {{as part of the}} governing equations, a forced heat equation and a steady-state version of Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s equations. The temperature dependent properties of a material, the electrical conductivity and the thermal absorptivity, result in the coupling of these equations. Numerical models presented validate the semi-analytical results for the heating and thawing scenarios considered in this thesis. The <b>microwave</b> <b>thawing</b> of a one-dimensional slab and cylinder are both considered, where power-law temperature dependencies are assumed. The speed of the moving phase boundary is governed by the Stefan condition. A feedback control process is used to examine and minimise slab melting times. This allows a thawing strategy to be developed which greatly shortens the thawing time whilst avoiding thermal runaway, hence improving the efficiency of the thawing process. One and two-dimensional continuous-flow microwave reactors are also examined, which are unstirred so the effects of diffusion are important. A reaction-diffusion equation describes the reactant concentration with the reaction rate described by the Arrhenius law. A stability analysis is performed on the semi-analytical reactor model.

Methods: Five replicates of a mixtures of 4 g piperacillin and 0. 5 g tazobactam in 20 mL of water plus 100 mL of 5 % dextrose were prepared and stored in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags. The stability of the mixtures was studied after freezing for 3 months at - 20 °C followed by thawing in a microwave oven and additional storage at 4 °C for up to 60 days. The concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam in each sample were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The samples were inspected visually, and pH was measured. Results: After 3 months of storage at - 20 °C, <b>microwave</b> <b>thawing,</b> and 35 days of storage at 4 °C, more than 90 % of the initial concentration of both piperacillin and tazobactam remained. At this point, the lower 95 % confidence limit of the best-fit line by linear regression of percent remaining was 90. 1 % for piperacillin and 90. 3 % for tazobactam. The pH decreased by 1. 16 units over 35 days of storage at 4 °C, but no colour change of precipitation was observed.

Analytical solutions for finding the interface locations at various time steps are obtained. Transient interface positions and complete phase change time is predicted by two models for solidification and by three models for melting. To validate the analytical results, experiments {{are carried out}} to find the transient positions of the front. The agreement {{was found to be}} good for model with conduction and heat generation in solidification process, but in melting the model with conduction, convection and heat generation gives a better prediction. Validated analytical model is extended to study the phase change behavior and heat transfer characteristics inside PCM.

Total solidification time depends on Stefan number and heat generation parameter &# 0946;, whereas complete melting time depends on equivalent thermal conductivity.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the amino acids content in green pea {{and the quality of}} pea protein. The study covered raw seeds; fresh seeds cooked to consumption consistency; and two kinds of frozen products prepared for consumption: frozen seeds obtained using the traditional method and frozen seeds of the ready-to-eat type. Compared with the raw material, cooked fresh pea contained more isoleucine (15 %), valine (14 %) and arginine (24 %) but less tyrosine (17 %); cooked pea from the traditional frozen product contained less sulphur-containing amino acids (12 %) and alanine (13 %); while pea from the frozen product of the ready-to-eat type contained a similar or higher amount (from 12 % to 38 %) of amino acids, except for sulphur-containing amino acids (less 12 %). The protein of green pea was of very good quality, both in raw seeds and in those prepared for consumption. In comparison with the FAO/WHO/ 1991 standard, the CS indexes exceeded 100.

40|$|Objective To study {{degradation}} kinetics of malachite green and leucomalachite green in different aquatic products. Methods After extracted and purified, samples were detected by high pressure liquid chromatography, {{and the results}} were analyzed with SPSS software and {{degradation kinetics}} software. Results Degradation of malachite green and leucomalachite green in different aquatic products’ matrix was fit to pseudo-first order kinetics equations．The degradation rates of malachite green were 57. 9 %, 48. 0 %, 23. 0 %, and the degradation rates of leucomalachite green were 46. 6 %, 43. 4 %, 19. 8 % in three aquatic products’ matrixes, respectively. For carp matrix added concentration of 50 μg/kg, malachite green and leucomalachite green degradation rate constants were K (50 μg/kg) = 0. 00338 d? 1, K (50 μg/kg) = 0. 00268 d? 1 in natural thawing. and K (50 μg/kg) = 0. 00359 d? 1, K (50 μg/kg) = 0. 00321 d? 1 in <b>microwave</b> <b>thawing,</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{enthalpy}} {{method is}} primarily developed for studying phase {{change in a}} multicomponent material, characterized by a continuous liquid volume fraction (phi(1)) vs temperature (T) relationship. Using the Galerkin finite element method we obtain solutions to the enthalpy formulation for phase change in 1 D slabs of pure material, by assuming a superficial phase change region (linear (phi(1) vs T) around the discontinuity at the melting point. Errors between the computed and analytical solutions are evaluated for the fluxes at, and positions of, the freezing front, for different widths of the superficial phase change region and spatial discretizations with linear and quadratic basis functions. For Stefan number (St) varying between 0. 1 and 10 the method is relatively insensitive to spatial discretization and widths of the superficial phase change region. Greater sensitivity is observed at St = 0. 01, where the variation in the enthalpy is large. In general {{the width of the}} superficial phase change region should span at least 2 - 3 Gauss quadrature points for the enthalpy to be computed accurately. The method is applied to study conventional melting of slabs of frozen brine and ice. Regardless of the forms for the phi(1) vs T relationships, the thawing times were found to scale as the square of the slab thickness. The ability of the method to efficiently capture multiple thawing fronts which may originate at any spatial location within the sample, is illustrated with the <b>microwave</b> <b>thawing</b> of slabs and 2 D cylinders.

Microwave power absorption, temperature, and stream functions were studied for various cases. For samples of diameter D, thawing was contrasted between samples for 0. 032 <D/D_p< 3. 73 and 0. 10 <D/λ_m< 1. 58. These ratios were D_p computed based on the liquid-phase penetration depth D and wavelength of microwave radiation in the medium λ_m.

Thawing was contrasted for MWs being incident from {{the top and bottom}} faces of the cylinder and with the thawing dynamics in the absence of convection in the liquid. Our simulations indicate that convection plays a small role for D/D_p ≪ 1 and thawing is independent of the direction of MWs.

Advance preparation of intravenous solution could be useful to improve quality, time management, and cost-savings of drug delivery. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how freezing, long-term storage, and <b>microwave</b> <b>thawing</b> can affect the stability of sufentanil citrate and levobupivacaine HCl in NaCl 0. 9 % (saline) (w/v) polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags. METHODS: The stability of 5 bags of solution containing sufentanil 500 microg and levobupivacaine 625 mg per 500 mL of saline solution in PVC bags was studied after freezing for 4 months at - 30 degrees C, thawing in a microwave oven with a validated cycle, and storage at 4 degrees C. The concentrations of the drugs were measured by HPLC using a reversed-phase column, a mobile phase consisting of 18 % acetonitrile (v/v) in tertabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate buffer 0. 03 M pH 3. 00 +/- 0. 05, and UV detection at 235 nm for sufentanil and 260 nm for levobupivacaine. Visual inspection and pH measurement were also performed. RESULTS: No color change or precipitation was observed. Sufentanil and levobupivacaine were stable for at least 70 days at 4 degrees C after freezing and thawing. Throughout this period, the 95 % lower confidence limit of the concentration-time profile remained > 90 % of the initial concentration. During this period, the pH value remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits defined here, a mixture of sufentanil citrate and levobupivacaine HCl may be prepared in advance and kept frozen...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Microwave {{freeze-thaw}} treatment (MFTT) of injectable {{drugs can}} support {{the development of}} centralized intravenous admixtures services (CIVAS). The aim of this review is to collect information about the stability of cytotoxic and hazardous drugs after this treatment. Methods: The scientific literature about drug stability studies was reviewed. The data describe {{the name of the}} drug, the manufacturer, the final concentration, the temperature and time of freezing storage, type of microwave oven, the thawing power, the measurement, the method and the results after treatment and final long-term storage at 5 ± 3 °C. Results: From 1980 to 2011, nine drugs (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, daunorubicine, doxorubicine, epirubicine, fluorouracile, ganciclovir, methotrexate sodium, mitomycine C) were studied after MFTT and the results were presented in 10 publications. The storage freezing temperature ranged from - 15 °C to - 30 °C, the time storage from 14 to 364 days, the thaw from moderate to full power. High performance liquid chromatography is mainly used to measure drug concentrations. All drugs are stable during and after the treatment. However, mitomycine needs to be stored at - 30 °C. The long-term stability after MFTT was evaluated only for the ganciclovir after 7 days, and for fluorouracile after 28 days. The concentration of the seven drugs was measured after one to 11 freezing-thawing cycles with a loss below 5 %. Conclusions: This review can help the hospital pharmacist to take in charge the productions of nine dose-banded ready-to-use injectable cytotoxic and hazardous drugs. Freezing enhances their long-term stability without altering their chemical stability.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Calcium levofolinate infusions {{could be}} {{prepared}} in advance by a centralized intravenous additive service (CIVAS) to improve safety and time management. OBJECTIVE: To investigate {{the effect of}} freezing, <b>microwave</b> <b>thawing</b> and long-term storage at 5 +/- 3 degrees C on the stability of calcium levofolinate in 5 % dextrose solution. METHODS: Solutions of 250 mL of 5 % dextrose in polyolefin bags (n = 5) containing approximately 400 mg of calcium levofolinate were prepared under aseptic conditions and frozen for 95 days at - 20 degrees C. The solutions were then thawed using microwaves and stored at 5 +/- 3 degrees C for 1 month. The calcium levofolinate concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Visual inspection was performed and pH was measured periodically during the storage at 5 +/- 3 degrees C. Stability of the solution {{was defined as a}} concentration remaining superior to 90 % of the initial concentration by regression analysis as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). RESULTS: No colour change or precipitation in the solutions was observed. Calcium levofolinate infusions were stable when stored at 5 +/- 3 degrees C during 1 month after freeze-thaw treatment. Throughout this period, the lower confidence limit of the estimated regression line of concentration-time profile remained above 90 % of the initial concentration. Slight change in pH values from 6. 52 +/- 0. 01 to 6. 50 +/- 0. 01 during storage time did not affect retention time on HPLC and has no clinical consequence, the solutions remaining in the acceptable range for perfusion (4 <or= pH <or= 10). CONCLUSION: Under the conditions of this study, calcium levofolinate in 5 % dextrose infusion may be prepared, frozen in advance by CIVAS, and then microwave thawed before use. Such treatment extends long-term stability and releases pharmacist's time for major activities such as checking medication order errors...|$|E
40|$|Most {{outbreaks}} of foodborne illness in the United States {{occur as a}} result of improper food-handling and preparation practices in homes or food establishments. Some food-safety recommendations that are difficult to incorporate into handling and cooking procedures have contributed to a gap between food-safety knowledge and the actual behavior. The first part (Chapter 3, 4) of this study sought to ensure microbial safety by establishing alternative processing of meat products that can be easily practiced by food-operators and consumers. In Chapter 3, a novel method was developed to thaw frozen chicken-breast by submersion in hot water at 60 °C, an appropriate temperature setting for foodservice hot-holding equipment. This method is rapid (compared to either refrigerator or cold-water thawing that also uses a significant amount of water), safe, and the final cooked-product sensory-quality was not different from refrigerator-thawed and cooked product (<b>microwave</b> <b>thawing</b> results in localized overheating). Chapter 4 developed marinade-cooking (91 °C) and holding (60 °C) procedures for hamburger-patties. Frozen patties were partially grilled and finished cooking in marinade. The moderate temperature of marinade cooking overcomes the chances of thick-patties being surface-overcooked while innermost portions remain undercooked as seen in high-temperature cooking methods (grilling and pan-frying). Consumers liked the marinade-finished cooked and held patties (up to 4 h) equally or more (holding-time dependent) compared to patties grilled and held in a hot-steam cabinet. Reducing salt in perishable foods including cheese is microbial-safety concern especially in their distribution and storage. The second part (Chapter 5, 6) of this study sought to evaluate microbial safety of low-salt hard-type cheese. Aged Cheddar cheeses were inoculated with either Listeria monocytogenes (3. 5 log CFU/g) or Salmonella spp. (4. 0 log CFU/g) and their survival or growth was monitored at 4, 10, and 21 °C for up to 90, 90, and 30 d, respectively. Low-salt (0. 7 % NaCl) Cheddar formulated at pH 5. 1 or 5. 7 exhibited no-growth or gradual reduction in L. monocytogenes and Salmonella counts. The results suggest that low-salt Cheddar is as safe as its full-salt counterparts (1. 8 % NaCl) and that salt may only be a minor food-safety hurdle regarding the post-aging contamination and growth of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella...|$|E
