ACC. te IN THE OLD LITHUANIAN TEXTS Summary In the old Lithuanian texts the atonic form gen., dat., acc. <b>m</b> (<b>i),</b> <b>t</b> (<b>i)</b> (Zinkevičius 1981, 49) is {{also used}} {{alongside}} the orthotonic genitive, dative and accusative forms {{of the first and}} the second person. The usual forms are mi, ti or the shortened ones -m or -t, except some forms te : used in the meaning of the second person accusative in the hymnal written by Saliamonas Mozerka Slavočinskis (SG) IOzapay pamażu / Meldźiu te pamażu SG I 60, 4 – 5, Sunau te girdźiu raudanti / Aſż ſaweſp tawe biłanti SG I 95, 16 – 17 and Aß teyſingay ir łáymingay / G ȧ rbin ċ iau te tułomis SG II 98, 26 – 27. It is interesting that the clitic -te is used instead of the usual -ti in the old writings. The above-mentioned forms cannot be analysed apart from the reflexive particle, the origin of which is pronominal as well. Hermann is known to have paid attention to this phenomenon (1926, 83). It is thought that the reflexive particle se reflects the Baltic * s (Zinkevičius 1966, 331 f.; Mažiulis 1959, 13; Rosinas 1995, 36). With reference to the form the Balts can be thought to have had other forms of accusative of pronominal clitics, such as * m, * t (Rosinas 1995, 36). Consequently, the forms with -te attested in the hymnal of Slavočinskis and in „Knyga nobažnystės“ show that the Baltic *t enclitic form te ‘tave’ is directly attested. </p...|$|R

I come from the {{database}} community, although with a dissertation in database support for hypertext (while at Princeton University) I have never really been a “core database ” researcher. With 5 years (Bachelor’s and Master’s) at <b>M.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>T.,</b> <b>I</b> had also had more machine learning than most. This led to my first real “data-mining ” work (although it was not called that at the time) : applying machine learning techniques to a problem in heterogeneous databases. Schema integration, or more specifically schema element matching, has all of the hallmarks we see in good knowledge discovery problems: – Lots of data—by definition, multiple databases worth. – A desire for the big picture—what types of data (columns) in one database match columns in others? – No simple answers—even experts would disagree on the correct answer to a simple question: Do two columns contain the same type of data or not? – Too little knowledge—even well-documented schemas often evolve into something new without the documentation keeping pace. I left Northwestern University to join The MITRE Corporation to work with others doing database integration work. That same year, data mining hit the big time with the first KDD conference. MITRE needed data-mining experts, and with my background, I became one of them. That said, I think the field is a natural fit.

Fluctuating heat production concentrated in one point. 2. Fluctuating heat production concentrated in one line of length I. The calculation shows, that the fluctuation can not penetrate to the spots, where the temperature was measured. The temperatures along the axis of the flame, reduced to an appropriate scale, have been plotted against l/z and against l /~/z (z being the height above the heat source), in one of which cases a straight line should be obtained according totheory. The horizontal temperature distribution in the above mentioned scale is in good agreement with theory. Deviations are discussed and a table of theoretical values of temperature is given. Temperatures have been measured by line reversal in the manner describ-ed in a paper by v. d.

The double mutant possessing <b>M</b> 827 <b>I</b> and <b>T</b> 929 <b>I</b> (Vssc 1 MITI/Vsscβ) caused a ∼ 4. 0 mV hyperpolarizing shift and the triple mutant, Vssc 1 MITILF/Vsscβ, caused a ∼ 3. 2 mV depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation curves. Vssc 1 MITI/Vsscβ, Vssc 1 TILF/Vsscβ, and Vssc 1 MITILF/Vsscβ caused depolarizing shifts (∼ 6. 6, ∼ 7. 6, and ∼ 8. 8 mV, respectively) in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation curves.

The most recent adverse effect of cimetidine relates to a possible drug-drug interaction. Initially two case reports of cimetidine-potentiated warfarin sodium toxicity were reported (5, 6). Puurunen and Pelkonen (7) demonstrated prolongation of hexobarbital sleeping time and inhibition of the amino-pyrine breath test in rats pretreated with cimetidine.

40|$|AimTo {{evaluate}} the 1 -year outcome of Minimally Invasive Single Implant Treatment (<b>M.</b> <b>I.</b> S. <b>I.</b> <b>T.)</b> based on ridge preservation and contour augmentation {{in patients with}} a high aesthetic risk profile. Materials and MethodsPeriodontally healthy non-smoking patients with a failing tooth in the anterior maxilla (15 - 25) were selected. All were {{in need of a}} single implant and demonstrated high risk for aesthetic complications given mid-facial recession at the failing tooth and/or a buccal bone dehiscence and/or a thin-scalloped gingival biotype. Patients without mid-facial recession (NRG) received flapless tooth extraction and ridge preservation using a collagen-enriched bovine-derived xenograft, flapless installation of a bone condensing implant with variable-thread design (4 - 6 months later), a provisional screw-retained crown and connective tissue graft (CTG) inserted in the buccal mucosa (3 months later) and a permanent crown (3 months later). Patients with mid-facial recession (RG) were treated similarly, yet they received a CTG at the time of ridge preservation. All patients were treated by an experienced periodontist using a microsurgical approach. Primary outcome variables included papillary and mid-facial recession. Clinical parameters, pink (PES) and white aesthetic score (WES) were considered secondary outcome variables. ResultsFifty patients (25 females, 25 males; mean age 39, range 19 - 81; 42 in NRG and 8 in RG) met the selection criteria and consented to the treatment. Forty-seven could be examined at 12 months and all implants survived. Mean bone loss amounted to 0. 48 mm (range 0. 00 - 1. 80) at 12 months. Papillary recession was minimal in both groups at 12 months (mean 0. 3 mm), as was mid-facial recession in the NRG (mean 0. 1 mm). Twelve patients in the NRG even demonstrated coronal migration of the mucosal margin following CTG and needed adaptation of the provisional crown to induce soft tissue retraction. Due to CTG at the time of ridge preservation in the RG, mid-facial soft tissue gain amounted to 0. 9 mm at 12 months, hereby eliminating 2 / 3 rd of the initial recession. PES and WES were favourable pointing to 10. 9 / 14 and 8. 2 / 10 respectively.

40|$|An {{improved}} in vitro rearing system, {{based on a}} silicone-reinforced Parafilm® M membrane, human hair tufts and reconstituted human blood, enabled the large-scale rearing of pediculicide-susceptible (EC-HL) and resistant (FL-HL and BR-HL) strains of human head lice. Developmental time differed for early instars but differences became synchronized as lice matured. Mean survivorship amongst the three strains reared in vitro {{were not significantly different}} when compared to EC-HL and FL-HL reared in vivo. ^ FL-HL and CA-HL were resistant to permethrin compared with susceptible PAHL (5. 5 - and 3. 4 -fold, respectively) and EC-HL (8. 5 - and 5. 3 -fold, respectively). Permethrin-resistant lice were cross-resistant to pyrethrum and DDT. Permethrin resistance was synergized by piperonyl butoxide (PBO) in CA-HL. Resistance to malathion in FL-HL (1. 4 - to 2. 2 -fold) and CA-HL (2. 1 - to 3. 6 -fold) was detected. Malathion resistance in FL-HL was synergized by S. S. S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF) and by PBO in CA-HL. Malathion/permethrin-resistant BR-HL lice were synergized by DEF but not synergized by PBO. PBO protected BR-HL from malathion, indicating suppressed desulfuration. Abamectin resistance in FL-HL (1. 7 - to 2. 5 -fold) and CA-HL (1. 8 - to 2. 3 -fold) was detected. No resistance to lindane was found. Thus, multiple resistance mechanisms against commonly available and widely used pediculicides and insecticides are apparently occurring. ^ Results from linkage analysis substantiate that permethrin resistance in human head louse populations in the U. S. is widespread but occurs at varying frequencies. The log survival time versus logit mortality regression lines of susceptible-homozygotes, resistant-homozygotes and heterozygotes determined that the resistance trait was complete recessive. Permethrin resistance is highly correlated with the presence of the <b>T</b> 917 <b>I</b> and L 920 F point mutations, which are suitable for detection by a variety of DNA-based diagnostic techniques. ^ Electrophysiological assessments determined that the three mutations (<b>M</b> 815 <b>I,</b> <b>T</b> 917 <b>I</b> and L 920 F) associated permethrin- and DDT-resistance in head louse caused depolarizing shift of ∼ 3. 2 and ∼ 8. 8 mV in the voltage dependent activation and steadystate inactivation, respectively, and completely abolished permethrin sensitivity when correspondingly inserted into house fly para-orthologous, voltage sensitive sodium channel and expressed in Xenopus oocytes (<b>M</b> 827 <b>I,</b> <b>T</b> 929 <b>I</b> and L 932 F). Amongst these kdr mutations, <b>T</b> 929 <b>I</b> appears to be the major resistance-causing mutation. ...|$|R

I have bene [...] fited from his suggestions and owe him the greatest debt of all. He, more than anyone else in my graduate career, has given me the impression that not only could I learn from him, but that he also could learn from me. This, it seems to me, is all that anyone desires. Also, I must thank Hugh Matthews and Noam Chomsky for valuable criticism of earlier parts of this work. In addition, Ken Hale, Paul Kiparsky, and Haj Ross have lent their time to reading some of the earlier work of this dissertation, and I am grateful. I should also thank the faculty for giving me the opportunity of teaching some of the contents of this thesis in my last year at <b>M.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>T.</b> And <b>I</b> thank those students who helped clarify some of my ideas, especially John Makhoul. Finally, I lovingly express my appreciation to Luise for putting up with this in-the first place.
