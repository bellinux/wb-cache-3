5|$|Once it was {{determined}} that dry berthing was physically possible for the ship, it was necessary to make a preliminary evaluation of the engineering viable ways in which dry berthing could actually be accomplished. Again, an independent <b>maritime</b> <b>engineering</b> firm was contracted to study the full range of dry berth alternatives and to present a report of their findings to BTF and to TPWD.|$|E
5|$|With this vote-of-confidence in place, BTF {{contracted}} with an independent <b>maritime</b> <b>engineering</b> firm {{to make a}} survey of the ship to determine her condition. If the ship is not structurally sound enough to support herself when permanently resting on keel blocks, then the question of dry berthing would be moot. The survey reflected that, although her hull leaks, her keel and main supporting internal structure is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the ship in a dry berth.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the Indus valley developed a system of standardization, using weights and measures, evident by the excavations made at the Indus valley sites. This technical standardization enabled gauging devices to be effectively used in angular measurement and measurement for construction. Calibration was also found in measuring devices along with multiple subdivisions in case of some devices. One of the earliest known docks is at Lothal (2400 BCE), located away from the main current to avoid deposition of silt. Modern oceanographers have observed that the Harappans must have possessed knowledge relating to tides {{in order to build}} such a dock on the ever-shifting course of the Sabarmati, as well as exemplary hydrography and <b>maritime</b> <b>engineering.</b>|$|E
