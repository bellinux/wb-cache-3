5|$|During the First Indochina War, Thảo was a {{communist}} {{officer in the}} Vietminh and helped oversee various operations in the Mekong Delta in the far south, at one point commanding his future enemy Nguyễn Khánh, who briefly served the communist cause. After the French withdrawal and the partition of Vietnam, Thảo stayed {{in the south and}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> renouncing communism. He became part of the military establishment in the anti-communist southern regime and quickly rose through the ranks. Nominally Catholic, Thảo befriended Diệm's elder brother, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục—the devoutly Roman Catholic Ngô family strongly favored co-religionists and had great trust in Thảo, unaware that he was still loyal to the communists. He went on to serve as the chief of Bến Tre Province, and gained fame after the area—traditionally {{a communist}} stronghold—suddenly became peaceful and prosperous. Vietnamese and US officials, as well as journalists hostile to or supportive of Saigon, misinterpreted this as a testament to Thảo's great ability, and he was promoted to a more powerful position where he could further his sabotage. Thảo and the communists in the local area had simply stopped fighting, so that the communists could quietly recuperate, while Thảo would appear to be very skillful and be given a more important job where he could do more damage.|$|E

25|$|According to some, Fleva's {{fight against}} {{government}} abuse was what caused his fall during a cabinet reshuffling, {{only three months}} after electoral victory. C. Bacalbașa notes that Fleva first attracted his colleagues' hostility when he inspected first-hand, and punished, {{the damage done by}} government representatives in the village of Spineni. Sturdza interpreted this work as a sign of disloyalty, and the National Liberal paper Voința Națională <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> Fleva, publishing allegations about his conduct in both public and private.

Henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed the decisions of his son. Ford started another company, Henry Ford and Son, and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> taking himself and his best employees to the new company; {{the goal was to}} scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value. (He was determined to have full control over strategic decisions.) The ruse worked, and Ford and Edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors, thus giving the family sole ownership of the company.|$|E

Francis declared war on 12 July 1542, and the French immediately launched an offensive with the five French armies against Charles. One of them, commanded by his son Charles, Duke of Orléans went to Luxembourg. Another, led by Francis's eldest son, Henry, Dauphin of France, marched to Roussillon towards the frontiers of Spain.

25|$|When Parliament {{began its}} {{investigation}} into monopolies and other abuses in England, and later Ireland in 1621, Buckingham <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> support to avoid action being taken against him. However, the king's {{decision to send}} a commission of inquiry to Ireland, that included parliamentary firebrands, threatened to expose Buckingham's growing, often clandestine interests there. Knowing that the king had assured the Spanish ambassador that the Parliament {{would not be allowed}} to imperil a Spanish matrimonial alliance, he therefore surreptitiously instigated a conflict between the Parliament and the king over the Spanish Match, which resulted in the Parliament's premature dissolution in December 1621 and a hobbling of the Irish commission in 1622. Irish reforms introduced in 1623–24 by Lionel Cranfield, Earl of Middlesex and Lord Treasurer, were largely nullified by Middlesex's impeachment and disgrace in the violently anti-Spanish 1624 parliament—spurred on by Buckingham and Prince Charles.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Zheng He {{may have}} left the Chinese coast {{in the autumn of}} 1417. Admiral Zheng He first made port at Quanzhou to load up the fleet's cargoholds with {{porcelain}} and other goods. Archaeological finds of contemporary Chinese porcelain have been excavated at the East African places visited by Zheng He's fleet. A Ming tablet at Quanzhou commemorates that Admiral Zheng He burned incense for divine protection for this voyage on 31 May 1417. The fleet visited the following places: Champa, Pahang, Java, Palembang, Malacca, Semudera, Lambri, Ceylon, Cochin, Calicut, Shaliwanni (possibly Cannanore), Liushan (Maladive and Laccadive Islands), Hormuz, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, Brava, Zhubu, and Malindi. For Arabia and East Africa, the most-likely route was Hormuz, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, Brava, Zhubu, and then Malindi. Duyvendak suggested that Zheng He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> military force at Mogadishu and Lasa due to the unwelcome reception by the locals.|$|E

The imperial inspector Zhao Wenhua reiterated the emperor's wishes that surrender was not an option, so Hu Zongxian <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> receiving Xu Hai's surrender while waiting for the opportune moment to strike. In the meantime Xu Hai had settled in the Shen Family Estate (沈家莊, Shenjiazhuang) of Pinghu, where he recruited up to 300 new followers by hosting banquets for his neighbours, adding to the thousand or more raiders still under his command and remnants of Chen Dong's group next to the estate. He grew increasingly recalcitrant, refusing an invitation to an official Mid-Autumn party and even killing an envoy from Hu Zongxian.|$|E

25|$|The {{successful}} {{landing at}} Guantanamo and {{the readiness of}} the Marines for the Spanish-American War were {{in contrast to the}} slow mobilization of the United States Army in the war. In 1900, the General Board of the United States Navy decided to give the Marine Corps primary responsibility for the seizure and defense of advanced naval bases. The Marine Corps formed an expeditionary battalion to be permanently based in the Caribbean, which subsequently practiced landings in 1902 in preparation for a war with Germany over their siege in Venezuela. Under Major Lejeune, in early 1903, it also undertook landing exercises with the Army in Maine, and in November, blocked Colombian Army forces sent to quash a Panamanian rebellion, an action which led to the independence of Panama. Marines stayed in Panama, with brief intermissions as they were deployed for other actions, until 1914. From 1903 to 1904, 25 Marines protected American diplomats in Abyssinia, modern day Ethiopia. A small group of Marines <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> force in Tangier to resolve the kidnapping of Ion Perdicaris in the summer of 1904.

At the same time, one of Thảo's brothers had been appointed as North Vietnam's ambassador to East Germany, having served as vice chairman of the Vietminh's Resistance Committee for the South during the war against the French.

The previous year, when the punk rock revolution began in Great Britain, was to be both a musical and a cultural [...] "Year Zero". Even as nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a nihilistic attitude summed up by the Sex Pistols slogan [...] "No Future"; in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, [...] "punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England." [...] While [...] "self-imposed alienation" [...] was common among [...] "drunk punks" [...] and [...] "gutter punks", {{there was always a}} tension between their nihilistic outlook and the [...] "radical leftist utopianism" [...] of bands such as Crass, who found positive, liberating meaning in the movement.

Later in the morning, while on the run, Thảo made a broadcast using a military radio system to call for Khánh's departure and defend his actions, which he described as being {{in the best interest of}} the nation. Eager to remove Khánh, the Americans provided aircraft to transport the officers, Quát, and his civilian cabinet to the meeting at short notice. The motion was precipitated by Thi, who gained the support of Kỳ, and the final vote was unanimous. Sửu and Quát, who were not members of the Armed Forces Council, concurred with the military’s decision to depose Khánh. [...] Kỳ, Thi and Thiệu became the key figures in a junta that continued with Sửu and Quát as a civilian front, although General Trần Văn Minh became the nominal commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
