5|$|One of Innis's primary {{contributions}} to communications studies was {{to apply the}} dimensions {{of time and space}} to various media. He divided media into time-binding and space-binding types. Time-binding <b>media</b> <b>are</b> durable. They include clay or stone tablets. Space-binding <b>media</b> <b>are</b> more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{radio in}} the United Kingdom is being {{promoted}} by radio stations and the broadcasting industry {{on the premise that}} it provides superior quality sound over AM, a wider choice of radio stations, is easier to use, and is resistant to the interference which other broadcast <b>media</b> <b>are</b> susceptible to. On the other hand critics say that coverage is not yet sufficient and the quality can be less than that of FM.|$|E

5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular <b>media</b> <b>are</b> unable to report on activities that the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|English and French are {{recognized}} by the Constitution of Canada as official languages. All federal government laws are thus enacted in both English and French, with government services available in both languages. Two of Canada's territories give official status to indigenous languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government. In the Northwest Territories, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich'in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tłįchǫ.

5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth <b>media</b> <b>are</b> used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E

50|$|Why {{do people}} choose {{one form of}} media over another? According to the Galileo Model, there are {{different}} forms of media spread throughout three-dimensional space. The closer one form of <b>media</b> <b>is</b> to another the more similar the source of <b>media</b> <b>is</b> to each other. The farther away from each form of <b>media</b> <b>is</b> in space, the least similar the source of <b>media</b> <b>is.</b> For example, mobile and cell phone are located closest in space where as newspaper and texting are farthest apart in space. The study further explained the relationship between self-concept {{and the use of}} different forms of media. The more hours per day an individual uses a form of media, the closer that form of <b>media</b> <b>is</b> to their self-concept.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} if the buffering {{power of}} embryo culture <b>media</b> <b>is</b> compromised by expiration. Design: Buffering potential of expired culture <b>media</b> <b>was</b> evaluated by measuring pH values. Setting: Fertility Laboratory, the University of Texas Medical Branch, USA. Materials and methods: The pH of expired culture <b>media</b> <b>were</b> measured and {{compared with those}} of unexpired ones in three experimental conditions: (1) pre-incubation, (2) CO 2 incubation and (3) post-incubation. Sequential media, comprising Quinn's advantage fertilization, cleavage and blastocyst media (Sage assisted reproduction products Inc.), <b>were</b> used. The <b>media</b> <b>were</b> divided into expired and unexpired groups, based on the manufacturer's indicated expiration dates. The unexpired group was evaluated in their original condition (first time opened). The expired media bottles underwent more than one opening. The pH of the <b>media</b> <b>was</b> measured sequentially in conditions 1, 2 and 3. Results: The expired media (30 – 390 days) displayed significantly (p< 0. 05) different pH values compared to unexpired media in pre-incubation condition. However, expired <b>media</b> <b>were</b> capable of yielding similar pH values (p⩾ 0. 23) to those of the corresponding unexpired controls in CO 2 incubation as well as post-incubation suggesting that the buffering capacity of the <b>media</b> <b>is</b> apparently not affected by expiration. Conclusion: Time-dependent nutrient depletion, not the weakening of the buffering system, is probably the determining factor in setting the shelf life of the culture media...|$|R
