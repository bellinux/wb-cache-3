The conventional way of inspecting the blades is for workers to rappel down the blade, taking a day per turbine.

40|$|Offshore {{wind farms}} {{generate}} underwater noise during construction, operation and decommissioning. Different foundation designs are in use for offshore wind farms. Steel <b>monopiles,</b> jackets made of four steel pinpiles and gravity-based foundations are {{applied in the}} Belgian part of the North Sea. Both <b>monopiles</b> and jacket pinpiles are hammered into the bottom and as such excessive noise is generated during their installation. This paper aims at comparing the emitted underwater noise generated during the piling activities of two wind farms, each using {{a different type of}} pile foundation: steel <b>monopiles</b> were used in the Belwind wind farm (Bligh Bank), while jacket pinpiles were chosen for the C-Power project (phases 2 and 3) on the Thorntonbank. Underwater noise was measured from a rigid hull inflatable boat at various distances from the pile driving location during the installation of steel <b>monopiles</b> and pinpiles. Analysis focused on the quantification of the discontinuous impulsive pile driving-generated underwater noise. Zero to peak sound pressure level (Lz-p), unweighted sound exposure level (SEL), cumulative SEL and 1 / 3 octave spectra were computed in order to quantify and compare the underwater noise. Lz-p and SEL were normalized to 750 m distance from the piling location. Piling of the <b>monopiles</b> generated a Lz-p between 179 and 194 dB re 1 µPa. Although piling of the smaller pinpiles was expected to be less noisy, no significant differences with <b>monopiling</b> could be demonstrated (pinpiling Lz-p: 172 - 189 dB re 1 µPa). Similarly, also SEL, varying between 145 and 168 dB re 1 µPa 2 s, exerted no statistical difference between mono- and pinpiling and furthermore near identical spectra were measured for both types of piling. The rather wide variability within and broad overlap between both types of piling can possibly be attributed to the (small scale) differences in bottom type {{as well as in the}} setup used. However, the radius of discomfort in the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena was estimated at 30 km and 19 km for <b>monopiles</b> and pinpiles, respectively. Furthermore, the pinpiling (four pinpiles per foundation) took about 2. 5 times more time than the <b>monopiling</b> and will as such have a prolonged impact onto the marine fauna. When standardised to megawatt installed (3 MW turbines on the <b>monopiles</b> and 6 MW turbines on the jacket foundations) both types of piling will score about equally...|$|R
40|$|As todays <b>monopiles</b> are {{regarded}} to have large diameters and considerably small embedding length to diameter ratios, current design methods {{are not entirely}} compatible with the engineering problem and may lead to conservative design. Additionally, vibro-driven <b>monopiles</b> can be a cost-effective and noise reducing alternative to standard impact driven ones. However up to now the influence of this technique {{with respect to the}} lateral load bearing behavior is not fully explored. To gain knowledge on pile-soil interaction for large diameter <b>monopiles</b> and to investigate differences due to the installation process, an extensive test campaign is carried out at the Test Center for Support Structures in Hannover. This contribution presents the design process and preliminary results of t he first phase Analysis of diameter-effects of the test campaign...|$|R
40|$|THESIS 10601 Wind energy plants, dolphins, {{and many}} other ocean {{engineering}} structures are supported on large diameter rigid <b>monopiles.</b> For such structures lateral loads are more critical for the design and analysis compared with the gravitational loads and foundation piles are required to withstand {{a large number of}} repeated lateral load cycles during their design life. In such applications, the lateral forces and bending moments resulting from wind/wave loadings must be economically and safely transferred to the sea bed. Such requirements make the pile response deflection sensitive in addition to be load earring capacity posturing. The behaviour of large diameter rigid <b>monopiles</b> in general, under long-term low-amplitude repeated lateral loading, is not well documented. Existing methods for estimating the accumulated lateral strain (rotation) response of <b>monopiles</b> are based on very limited field/experimental laboratory data and are currently not capable of explicitly accounting for site-specific soil properties and loading characteristics...|$|R
25|$|For example, the Horns Rev {{wind farm}} from 2002 in the North Sea west of Denmark {{utilizes}} 80 large monopiles of 4 metres diameter sunk 25 meters {{deep into the}} seabed, while the Lynn and Inner Dowsing Wind Farm {{off the coast of}} England went online in 2008 with over 100 turbines, each mounted on a 4.7-metre-diameter <b>monopile</b> foundation in ocean depths up to 18 metres of water.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first phase}} {{consisted}} of 175 Siemens Wind Power SWT-3.6 turbines and two offshore substations, giving a wind farm with a peak rated power of 630MW. Each turbine and offshore substation is erected on a <b>monopile</b> foundation, and connected together by [...] of 33kV array cables. The two offshore substations {{are connected to}} an onshore substation at Cleve Hill (near Graveney) on the north Kent coast, by four 150kV subsea export cables, in total [...] It is named after London because the power goes to the London grid.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{strain gauges}} and accelerometers (acc) {{as well as}} an autarkic data {{acquisition}} unit had to be installed inside large <b>monopiles</b> of a recently built off-shore wind farm in the North Sea. Those <b>monopiles</b> are open-ended steel tube piles with diameters of about 6  m and lengths of 55 – 60  m, depending on the position in the wind farm. Since the different measurement sections (MS) where distributed {{along the length of the}} pile, a mechanical protection of the measurement equipment against the penetration into the soil had to be installed, too.|$|R

40|$|Short rigid large-diameter <b>monopiles</b> {{have been}} widely used for {{offshore}} wind turbines. The rotation of the piles is strictly controlled to render safe operation of the wind turbines. Consequently, the determination of the bearing capacity within an allowable angular rotation of the <b>monopiles</b> is an important issue. In this study, six lateral loading tests (at 1 g) were conducted on a rigid model pile in low liquid limit silt (ML) soil (with two relative densities). The tests reveal a rotational center at a depth of (0 : 75 - 0 : 85) L (L = embedded length of the pile) and work-hardening load-displacement curves (a continual increase in soil pressures even at a very large rotational angle). The test results were used to establish new p-y curves using a coefficient of subgrade reaction nh that is correlated to the local pile displacement. In particular, an analytical expression is developed to estimate the net lateral soil resistance p on a circular pile using peak-onpile radial stress. The new p-y curves and analytical solutions capture the measured p-y curves and the load-displacement relationship of the <b>monopiles</b> in cohesionless soils...|$|R
2500|$|The typical {{construction}} process for a wind turbine subsea <b>monopile</b> foundation in sand includes driving a large hollow steel pile, of some 4m in diameter with approximately 50mm thick walls, some 25m {{deep into the}} seabed, through a 0.5m layer of larger stone and gravel to minimize erosion around the pile. [...] A [...] "transition piece (complete with pre-installed features such as boat-landing arrangement, cathodic protection, cable ducts for sub-marine cables, turbine tower flange, etc.)" [...] {{is attached to the}} now deeply driven pile, the sand and water are removed from the centre of the pile and replaced with concrete. [...] An additional layer of even larger stone, up to 0.5m diameter, is applied {{to the surface of the}} seabed for longer-term erosion protection.|$|E
50|$|The {{installation}} of J-Tubes for offshore renewable monopiles {{was viewed as}} a costly approach, and a 'latching' type of cable protection system which penetrates the outer wall of the <b>monopile,</b> via a specifically designed angled aperture enables the simplification of <b>monopile</b> design, and removes the need for additional works post pile driving which usually involved the use of divers. This approach is becoming the industry standard in <b>monopile</b> design, assisting developers to reduce their costs for construction.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{presented in}} the paper moves {{from the results of}} a feasibility study recently carried out {{for the development of a}}n offshore wind farm off the cost of Rimini, in the Northern Adriatic Sea. The work, based on in-situ measurements of the environmental conditions, assessed the suitability of the considered area for the development of a relatively large wind farm, although at the profitability limit. The study has considered 60 offshore wind turbines installed on <b>monopiles,</b> as they are, at present, the most common solution and a quantification of the investment costs could be reliably completed. With reference to such case, the paper addresses the use of caisson foundations, a convenient alternative to <b>monopiles</b> in water of shallow to intermediate depth, with the final aim of improving the overall cost-effectiveness of the investment...|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began in}} June 2006. Contractor for the {{foundation}} installation was MT Højgaard: the foundation design was by Ramboll, Smulders supplied the WTG foundations, turbine towers by Bladt Industries, <b>monopiles</b> and transition pieces were from Sif; piling {{was done by}} Menck, with Mammoet Van Oord supplying lifting barge platform Jumping Jack.|$|R
25|$|The {{offshore}} wind {{industry is not}} fully industrialized, as supply bottlenecks still exist as of 2017. <b>Monopiles</b> up to 11 m diameter at 2,000 tonnes can be made, but the largest so far are 1,300 tonnes which is below the 1,500 tonnes limit of some crane vessels. The other turbine components are much smaller.|$|R

5000|$|A {{large number}} of <b>monopile</b> {{foundations}} have been utilized in recent years for economically constructing fixed-bottom offshore wind farms in shallow-water subsea locations. [...] For example, a single wind farm {{off the coast of}} England went online in 2008 with over 100 turbines, each mounted on a 4.74-meter-diameter <b>monopile</b> footing in ocean depths up to 16 metres of water.|$|E
50|$|The {{wind farm}} lies {{approximately}} 23 km {{west of the}} village of Egmond aan Zee, in the North Sea. (Note that {{between it and the}} coast lies another wind farm, OWEZ.) It consists of 60 Vestas V80-2.0MW wind turbines and has a total nameplate capacity of 120 MW. The wind turbine towers rest on steel <b>monopile</b> foundations, in water depths of 19 to 24 meters. Each <b>monopile</b> is a steel tube with diameter of about 4 meters, length of over 50 meters, weighing 320 tonnes, and driven 30 meters into the seabed. The construction barge Sea Jack required about 2 hours to drive in each <b>monopile</b> after positioning it.|$|E
50|$|Construction of a 27 turbine {{wind farm}} using 2.3 MW {{turbines}} began in February 2011, with commissioning initially expected for 2012. Turbine foundations {{were to be}} up to 5.5m diameter <b>monopiles</b> either drilled and/or piled up to a depth of 35m. Inter turbine electrical connections and the connection to shore were to be energised at 33kV.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the high}} {{certification}} standards of offshore constructions and the already completed design phase of the <b>monopiles,</b> neither welding nor drilling into the piles was possible. This {{was not an issue}} for the installation of the sensors themselves since the application of miniature strain gauges and accelerometers by means of thin layer adhesives or spot welding is common practice. However, the fastening of a 40  kg data acquisition unit, several hundreds of meters of cable and steel profiles for the protection of sensors and cables to a pile wall that would be driven with energies of more than 1000  kJ per blow and accelerations of more than 1000  g (earth gravity) was a big challenge. In close cooperation, the Institute of Joining and Welding and the Institute for Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering of Technische Universität Braunschweig in Germany developed a method by adhesive bonding of all required components for a scientific pile driving monitoring, which was successfully used during the installation of three large-scale <b>monopiles.</b>|$|R

40|$|The Q 7 is {{the second}} {{offshore}} wind farm in the Dutch sector of the North Sea and, at 23 km off the Dutch coast, the world's first to be located outside the 12 -mile limit. To support the wind turbines, <b>monopiles,</b> 54 metre long steel pipes with a diameter of 4 metres, are hammered into the seabed. The underwater radiated noise during the impulsive hammering of 9 out of 61 <b>monopiles</b> was measured. Although {{there is a wide}} concern about the impact of piling noise on marine life, there are no widely accepted criteria for the maximum acceptable noise levels.

The Q 7 data have been analysed in terms of a broadband sound exposure level, peak pressure and pulse duration and a 1 / 3 -octave band frequency spectrum of the sound exposure at different hydrophone locations, for each hammer stroke that has been recorded. The results are discussed in relation to the stroke energy, the hydrophone distance and depth and to proposed noise exposure criteria for marine mammals...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{relevance of}} offshore {{wind in the}} energy mix motivates continual research efforts for the optimisation of foundation systems. Currently, <b>monopiles</b> are still the most common foundations for offshore wind turbines (OWTs), due to their simplicity and the low costs for production/assembly. However, the modern trends towards larger OWTs and water depths pose new geotechnical challenges {{in the design of}} more cumbersome and expensive <b>monopiles.</b> In this work, the potential of 3 D finite element (FE) modelling for OWT applications is illustrated. The dynamic response of a soil-monopile-OWT system is numerically simulated by accounting for (i) dynamic hydro-mechanical (HM) coupling in the soil and (ii) cyclic plasticity modelling. In particular, the UCSD 08 sand model developed by Yang and Elgamal (2008) has been adopted and calibrated against laboratory test results on medium dense sand. FE results are presented to highlight the combined influence of wind/wave loading and soil non-linearity on the dynamic OWT performance (and specifically on the main natural frequency). The results presented support the beneficial role that 3 D FE modelling may play in the improvement of existing design methods. Geo-engineerin...|$|R
