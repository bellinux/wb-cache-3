40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} multi domain {{physical}} model of permanent magnet synchronous machines, considering electrical, magnetic, thermal and mechanical effects. For each {{component of the}} model, the main wave as well as lower and higher harmonic wave components of the magnetic flux and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> may be considered. The permanent magnets are modeled as discrete azimuthal segments in order to consider possible partial demagnetization effects. For each magnet segment a linearized temperature dependent B-H curve is considered. The main advantage of the presented model is that time transient operational behavior of a permanent magnet synchronous machine can be considered under various electrical, magnetic, thermal and mechanical conditions. The electromagnetic condition of surface magnet machine is compared with finite element analysis...|$|E

40|$|A simple {{expression}} is derived for the linear {{growth rate of}} R-X mode, auroral kilometric radiation under the assumptions of cold plasma wave dispersion and (omega sub pe) -squared is much less than (Omega sub e) -squared, where omega sub pe and Omega sub e are the electron plasma frequency and gyrofrequency, respectively. The result is valid for all wave normal angles and all frequencies above the right-hand cutoff frequency. With this expression, {{it is not necessary}} to evaluate the full dispersion tensor, and variations of the growth rate with plasma parameters are easily obtained. Applying the new expression, it is found that kilometric radiation growth rates are strongly dependent upon the magnitude of the <b>magnetic</b> field-aligned <b>potential</b> <b>difference,</b> and that significant growth of radiation at harmonics of the fundamental is unlikely in regions where (omega sub pe) -squared is much less than (Omega sub e) -squared...|$|R
40|$|Experimental results {{obtained}} last years corroborate a prediction made by I. O. Kulik {{forty years ago}} that the energy dissipation does not result in disappearance of equilibrium circular current observable in the normal state of superconductor rings and normal metal rings. Contrary interpretations of the persistent current as a Brownian motion or a dissipationless current are compared in {{the point of view of}} the observations of this phenomenon at presence of an electric <b>potential</b> <b>difference.</b> Distinctions between the quantum phenomena at atomic and mesoscopic levels are accentuated. In connection of the quantum oscillations in <b>magnetic</b> field of <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> observed on asymmetric rings with the persistent current, it is pointed out that an experimental check of such phenomenon at thermodynamic equilibrium is possible.

5000|$|A {{homopolar}} generator is a DC electrical generator comprising an electrically conductive disc or cylinder rotating {{in a plane}} perpendicular to a uniform static <b>magnetic</b> field. A <b>potential</b> <b>difference</b> is created between {{the center of the}} disc and the rim (or ends of the cylinder) with an electrical polarity that depends on the direction of rotation and the orientation of the field. It is also known as a unipolar generator, acyclic generator, disk dynamo, or Faraday disc. The voltage is typically low, on the order of a few volts in the case of small demonstration models, but large research generators can produce hundreds of volts, and some systems have multiple generators in series to produce an even larger voltage. They are unusual in that they can source tremendous electric current, some more than a million amperes, because the {{homopolar generator}} can be made to have very low internal resistance.|$|R
40|$|We present two {{theoretical}} {{schemes for}} spin filters in one-dimensional semiconductor quantum wires with spatially modulated Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) {{as well as}} weak <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential.</b> For case I, the SOC is periodic and the weak <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential</b> is applied uniformly along the wire. Full spin polarizations with opposite signs are obtained within two separated energy intervals. For case II, the weak <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential</b> is periodic while the SOC is uniform. An ideal negative/positive switching effect for spin polarization is realized by tuning the strength of SOC. The roles of SOC, <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential,</b> and their coupling on the spin filtering are analyzed. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|General {{expressions}} of magnetic vector (MV) and magnetic gradient tensor (MGT) {{in terms of}} the first- and second-order derivatives of spherical harmonics at different degrees/orders are relatively complicated and singular at the poles.

Using our newly derived formulae, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential,</b> vector and gradient tensor fields and also the third-order partial derivatives of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential</b> field at an altitude of 300 km are calculated based on a global lithospheric magnetic field model GRIMM_L 120 (GFZ Reference Internal Magnetic Model, version 0. 0) with spherical harmonic degrees 16 – 90.

40|$|The Magnetic Field Solver {{computer}} program calculates {{the magnetic field}} generated {{by a group of}} collinear, cylindrical axisymmetric electromagnet coils. Given the current flowing in, and the number of turns, axial position, and axial and radial dimensions of each coil, the program calculates matrix coefficients for a finite-difference system of equations that approximates a two-dimensional partial differential equation for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential</b> contributed by the coil. The program iteratively solves these finite-difference equations by use of the modified incomplete Cholesky preconditioned-conjugate-gradient method. The total <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential</b> as a function of axial (z) and radial (r) position is then calculated as a sum of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>potentials</b> of the individual coils, using a high-accuracy interpolation scheme. Then the r and z components of the magnetic field as functions of r and z are calculated from the total <b>magnetic</b> <b>potential</b> by use of a high-accuracy finite-difference scheme.
