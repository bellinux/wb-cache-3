5000|$|The dressed metal {{goes back}} in the fire, is brought near to welding heat, removed from the fire, and brushed. Flux is {{sometimes}} applied, which prevents oxygen from reaching and burning the metal during forging, and it is returned to the fire. The smith now watches carefully to avoid overheating the metal. There is some challenge to this because, to see {{the color of the}} metal, the smith must remove it from the fire—exposing it to air, which can rapidly oxidize it. So the smith might probe into the fire with a bit of steel wire, prodding lightly at the mating faces. When the end of the wire sticks on to the metal, it is at the right temperature (a small weld forms where the wire touches the <b>mating</b> <b>face,</b> so it sticks). The smith commonly places the metal in the fire so he can see it without letting surrounding air contact the surface. (Note that smiths don't always use flux, especially in the UK.)Now the smith moves with rapid purpose, quickly taking the metal from the fire to the anvil and bringing the mating faces together. A few light hammer taps bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the flux—and finally, the smith returns the work to the fire. The weld begins with the taps, but often the joint is weak and incomplete, so the smith reheats the joint to welding temperature and works the weld with light blows to [...] "set" [...] the weld and finally to dress it to the shape.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — There {{is a need}} in {{the field}} of modular {{robotics}} for a low-profile docking face {{with a wide range of}} performance. Mechanical self-aligning geometry features for docking faces of modular reconfigurable robot systems can be varied to improve the reliability of connection systems. This paper presents a new two-layer <b>mating</b> <b>face</b> design for robots that are constrained to move in a plane. It has a provably larger area of acceptance than any to date. We present an analysis of both position and orientation misalignments with simulated results over a two parameter design space comparing this connector with two other best-in-class shapes. The results show an average acceptance area increase approximately 88 % over gendered mating faces and approximately 138 % over non-gendered mating faces. I...|$|E
40|$|A {{coupling}} device for tubular members of large truss structures with {{a locking collar}} being the only moving part is described. Each tubular member is constructed with an end bell section that has a belled flange with a <b>mating</b> <b>face,</b> and a necked area which is smaller in diameter than the tubular members to be joined. A split ring is affixed to each tubular member and is constructed so that when two tubular members are laterally moved into axial alignment and the collar is rotated over it, the split ring loads the joint with axial forces by pressing the belled flange mating surfaces together, and a preloading force {{is provided by the}} collar mating with a taper {{on the outside of the}} split rings. All free play is thereby removed by preloaded force. A major object is to provide an ability to remove and replace individual tubular members without disturbing other structural parts of a truss structure. An additional anticipated use of this joint is to couple high pressure fluid lines...|$|E
40|$|When perceiving a face, we {{can easily}} {{decide whether it}} belongs to a human or {{non-human}} primate. The categorical decision of whether a face belongs to your own or a related species is of great importance for social interaction and <b>mating.</b> <b>Face</b> stimuli of humans, monkeys, and monkey - human hybrids (morphs) were used {{to shed light on}} categorization of faces into different species by humans and non-human primate subjects. Behavioral studies in both species were conducted with the goal of delineating the category boundary across the human - monkey continuum. In monkeys single unit recordings of face responsive neurons in inferior temporal cortex are currently conducted, with the goal of delineating the category boundary based on the response of these neurons to face stimuli. Preliminary findings suggest that both humans and non-human primates tend to draw the species boundary away from the centre of the continuum and that the boundary is shifted towards the category to which the observer belongs. The findings suggest differential neural mechanisms for categorization of human and monkey faces...|$|E

30|$|To avoid {{losses in}} {{potential}} gaps in any <b>mating</b> <b>faces,</b> we deposited ∼ 2 μm of Al on all Cu surfaces {{which are in}} contact with the Al cavity (the copper insert after evaporation of Al and other parts are shown in Figure 1 (d)). Before deposition the surface of the copper inserts facing the interior of the cavity was covered with Al tape. Deposition was done in e-beam evaporator at a 45 ∘ angle to taped surface under constant rotation of the insert about the deposition direction. After that procedure, and sealing the cavities <b>mating</b> <b>faces</b> with indium wire to ensure light tightness, the cavity demonstrated a Q = 102, 000, which is an order of magnitude improvement over the quality factor of the bare copper cavity. An additional measurement of the same cavity several months later showed a decrease of internal Q to the value of 80, 000, which we associated with oxidation of the evaporated Al film. The quality factor of the cavity showed no power dependence within a wide range of powers from approx. − 50 dBm to − 160 dBm (∼ 109 - 10 − 2 photons in the cavity).|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that, presumably {{as a way to}} protect one’s current romantic relationship, individuals involved in a heterosexual romantic relationship tend to give lower attractiveness ratings to attractive opposite-sex others as compared to uninvolved individuals (i. e., the derogation effect). The present study importantly extends this research by examining whether romantic relationship status actually biases memory for the facial appearance of attractive (vs. unattractive) mates. To address this issue, we used a reverse-correlation technique (Mangini and Biederman, 2004 M. C. Mangini and I. Biederman, Making the ineffable explicit: Estimating the information employed for face classification. Cognitive Science, 28 (2004), pp. 209 – 226. Mangini & Biederman, 2004), originally developed to get a visual approximation of an individual’s internal representation of a target category or person. In line with the derogation effect, results demonstrated that romantically involved (vs. uninvolved) individuals indeed held a less attractive memory of a previously encountered attractive <b>mate’s</b> <b>face.</b> Interestingly, they also held a more attractive memory of an unattractive <b>mate’s</b> <b>face</b> as compared to uninvolved individuals. This latter finding may suggest that romantically involved (as compared to uninvolved) individuals differentiate opposite-sex others along the attractiveness dimension less...|$|R

The smith also carefully shapes <b>mating</b> <b>faces</b> so that as they come together {{foreign material}} squeezes out as the metal is joined. To clean the faces, protect them from oxidation, and provide a medium to carry foreign material out of the weld, the smith sometimes uses flux—typically powdered borax, silica sand, or both.|$|R
