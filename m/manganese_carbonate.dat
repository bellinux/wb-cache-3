The geochemical system in the secondary egress drift of Caphouse Colliery near Horbury, UK, is an ideal system for studying these processes.

The most important variation in sedimentary chemical composition is the increase in SiO 2 concentration through the Pliocene diatomaceous sequences, which dilutes most other major and trace element components by various degrees. This biogenic input is largest at Site 794 (Yamato Basin), moderately developed at Site 797 (Yamato Basin), and of only minor importance at Site 795 (Japan Basin), potentially reflecting basinal contrasts in productivity with the Yamato Basin recording greater biogenic input than the Japan Basin and with the easternmost sequence of Site 794 lying beneath the most productive waters.

In Brazil, in the State of Amapá and northwest of Pará, they are represented by the Vila Nova Group, constituted by a basal unit of metabasalts, covered by metasediments of clastic and chemical origin. The basal metasediments, the Serra do Navio Formation, are made of a cyclothem with lenses of manganese marbles {{at the top of}} each cycle. Under the intense weathering of the Amazon, these lenses were oxidized to large {{deposits of}} high-grade manganese oxides. The exploitation of these oxides left behind the <b>manganese</b> <b>carbonates</b> and low-grade oxides. The overlaying Serra da Canga Formation presents a calcium and magnesium domain grading to an iron domain with banded silicate and oxide iron formations, mined for iron ores. Overlapping structures and superposed metamorphic crystallizations indicate two phases of dynamothermal metamorphism, the first one with axis to north-northeast and the second one to northwest, with an intermediate phase of thermal metamorphism related to syntectonic granitic intrusions. Shears oriented north-south, possibly formed during the first dynamothermal metamorphism and reactivated in the second, are ideal sites for hydrothermalism and gold mineralization, which is greater when occurs in iron formation and carbonate-bearing rocks, as it happened at the Tucano mine.

Detailed chemical, petrographic, and X-ray investigations reveal that these diagenetic carbonates have a complex mineralogical composition. At least five different carbonate phases are identified: calcium-rich rhodochrosite, rhodochrosite, manganosiderite, siderite, and calcite. <b>Manganese</b> <b>carbonates</b> are the dominant carbonate phases formed throughout the section.

At approximately 620 meters below seafloor (mbsf), three concretions of iron carbonates occur, which indicates a special pore-water chemistry. Thin section analyses from this level show (1) several generations of diagenetic carbonates, (2) widespread secondary cavity formation in burrow structures, and (3) various cement precipitations in voids. We suggest that this level represents a hiatus or highly condensed sequence, as indicated by (1) the low carbonate content in host sediments, (2) carbonate dissolution reflected by the high ratio of benthic to planktonic foraminifers, and (3) complex diagenetic alteration in the carbonate concretions. Iron and manganese enrichments observed in lithologic Unit IV may have been derived from a hydrothermal source at the adjacent, then active, Labrador Sea mid-ocean ridge. Authigenic smectites forming numerous pseudomorphs of siliceous microfossils are precipitated in burrow structures.

The distribution of total and different chemical forms of copper and manganese has been studied using sequential extraction techniques.

This means that, the mobility and bioavailability of cupper and manganese in EL-Mex bay is higher than that in Abu-Kir bay.

This material poses an environmental and health risk to surrounding ecosystems and communities, and disposal costs are increasing. Ferromanganese slag contains an appreciable amount of residual manganese metal, which can be exploited. Previous work has shown that the slag can be leached fully, while rejecting the silica to a residue. The methods that were investigated to recover manganese from the leach solution included hydroxide precipitation to upgrade the leach solution followed by <b>manganese</b> <b>carbonate</b> precipitation to produce a pure <b>manganese</b> <b>carbonate</b> product or a <b>manganese</b> <b>carbonate</b> furnace feed material, which would be recycled to increase manganese recoveries in the production of ferromanganese. In addition, electrowinning of electrolytic manganese dioxide from the leach solution was studied. The methods were compared in terms of selectivity, costs, and product quality. Co-recovery of the leach residue, which is a potential cement additive, is discussed. Among the methods investigated to upgrade the pregnant leach solution, hydroxide precipitation utilizing ammonia to adjust the pH appears to be the most effective in removing major impurities such as iron, aluminium, and silica to less than 1 ppm. The <b>manganese</b> <b>carbonate</b> and impure <b>manganese</b> <b>carbonate</b> furnace feed products met quality specifications. However, although the production of these materials was technically viable, the large amounts of base reagent that were required to raise the pH, and the associated high operating costs, rendered the process uneconomic.

Additional benefits included an increase in the manganese content of the impure <b>manganese</b> <b>carbonate</b> furnace feed material, and a substantial reduction in the dilution of the pregnant leach solution, thereby maintaining high manganese concentrations that rendered the solution viable for electrowinning of electrolytic manganese dioxide, the production of which yielded a current efficiency of 74 %.

There are few systematic changes in solid-phase chemistry resulting from the opal-A/opal-CT or opal-CT/quartz silica phase transformations. Most major and trace element concentrations are controlled by the aluminosilicate fraction of the sediment, although the effects of diagenetic silica phases and <b>manganese</b> <b>carbonates</b> are of localized importance. REE total abundances (Sum REE) in the Japan Sea are strongly dependent upon the paleoceanographic position of a given site with respect to terrigenous and biogenic sources. REE concentrations at Site 794 overall correspond well to aluminosilicate chemical indices and are strongly diluted by SiO 2 within the upper Miocene-Pliocene diatomaceous sequence. Eu/Eu* values at Site 794 reach a maximum through the diatomaceous interval as well, most likely suggesting an association of Eu/Eu* with the siliceous component, or reflecting slight incorporation of a detrital feldspar phase. SumREE at Site 795 also is affiliated strongly with aluminosilicate phases and yet is diluted only slightly by siliceous input. At Site 797, SumREE is not as clearly associated with the aluminosilicate fraction, is correlated moderately to siliceous input, and may be sporadically influenced by detrital heavy minerals originating from the nearby rifted continental fragment composing the Yamato Rise. Ce/Ce* profiles at all three sites increase essentially monotonically with depth and record progressive diagenetic LREE fractionation. The observed Ce/Ce* increases are not responding {{to changes in the}} paleoceanographic oxygenation state of the overlying water, as there is no independent evidence to suggest the proper oceanographic conditions. Ce/Ce* correlates slightly better with depth than with age at the two Yamato Basin sites. The downhole increase in Ce/Ce* at Sites 794 and 797 is a passive response to the diagenetic transfer of LREE (except Ce) from sediment to interstitial water. At Site 795, the overall lack of correlation between Ce/Ce* and Lan/Ybn suggests that other processes mask the diagenetic behavior of all LREEs. First-order calculations of the Ce budget in Japan Sea waters and sediment indicate that ~ 20 % of the excess Ce adsorbed by settling particles is recycled within the water column and that an additional ~ 38 % is recycled at or near the seafloor. Thus, because the remaining excess Ce is only ~ 10 % of the total Ce, there is not a large source of Ce to the deeply buried sediment, further suggesting that the downhole increase in Ce/Ce* is a passive response to diagenetic behavior of the other LREEs. The REE chemistry of Japan Sea sediment therefore predicts successive downhole addition of LREEs to deeply buried interstitial waters...|$|R
