5|$|Ronald Lockley (1903–2000), {{among many}} studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered {{the science of}} bird migration. He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the Manx shearwater, living on the remote island of Skokholm. These small seabirds <b>make</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the longest migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year. This {{behaviour}} led {{to the question of}} how they navigated.|$|E

25|$|When the Muisca {{structure}} disappeared {{under the}} Spanish Conquest, {{the territory of}} the Confederations of the zaque and zipa were included in a new political division within the Spanish colonies in America. The territory of the Muisca, located in a fertile plain of the Colombian Andes that contributed to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most advanced South American civilizations, became part of the colonial region named Nuevo Reino de Granada. The priests and nobility of the Muisca were eliminated. Only the Capitanias remained. Much information about the Muisca culture was gathered by the Spanish administration and by authors such as Pedro de Aguado and Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita. The Spaniards created indigenous areas to keep the survivors, who were obligated to work the land for them in what were called encomiendas. The colonial era contributed to the importance of Bogotá, and people from the area would {{play an important role in}} the fights for independence and republican consolidation. The wars of independence of three nations (Colombia with Panamá, Venezuela, and Ecuador) were led by the descendants of the conquerors. Aboriginal, African, and mixed race people were soldiers, no less important a role.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{discovery}} of SSRI drugs the treatment for mood disorders were relatively limited. Now, however {{there are dozens of}} antidepressants on the market for the treatment of depression. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were the first drugs to be developed for the treatment of depression, dating back to the early 1950s. Because of their undesirable adverse-effect profile and high potential for toxicity, due to their non-selective pharmacological effects, strict regiments were for taking the drugs which limited their use. Because of this, researchers looked for other alternative with similar effectiveness but fewer adverse effects e.g. drugs that did not cause cardiac conduction abnormalities in overdoses or had the tendency to cause seizures, which led to {{the discovery}} of the SSRI drugs. The SSRIs are the most significant class of antidepressants marketed in recent years and <b>make</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the major medicinal discoveries of the last few decades. SSRIs were the first drugs to establish beyond doubt a pathophysiological role for 5-HT in affective illnesses and in the broad spectrum of anxiety disorders. Likewise, they were the first to confirm the inhibition of neurotransmitter re-uptake as an important therapeutic principle.|$|E
25|$|The charioteer {{would have}} had to use great skill to ensure that the radius of each turn of the chariot was correct to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the wheels exactly stop rotating. Unless he did this correctly, the {{pointing}} doll would not have kept aiming to the south. He {{would have been able to}} adjust the direction in which it aimed by making turns that were more or less sharp. This would sometimes have given him opportunities to use the chariot dishonestly. If it was being demonstrated to spectators, for example, and was being driven around in front of them, making many turns, the charioteer, who would have known which way was south, would have been able to make the chariot appear to work extremely accurately as a compass for long periods. The spectators could have been shown the machinery, and would have seen that the charioteer could not manipulate the doll. They would presumably have been impressed by the apparent accuracy of the mechanism. It is possible that this type of chariot was sometimes constructed with the prime purpose of fraudulently impressing spectators. Possibly, people who built these chariots deceived their own employers with them, which could have gained them fame and fortune provided nobody tried using the chariots for real navigation.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the deaths of}} leading characters in similarly countercultural films of the time, such of Ben, Duane Jones' character in Night of the Living Dead, and Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda in Easy Rider, in which said characters are killed by similarly disenfranchised groups, the bounty killers are working as part of the State, acting in the service of capital by helping to protect it. What further separates the deaths of the heroes and the anti-authoritarian position of The Great Silence from Romero and Hopper's films is that, unlike Night of the Living Dead and Easy Rider, which were produced without the restrictions of well-established genre conventions, Corbucci's film also subverts and comments on the genre that it is part of. Donato Totaro states that the film's title [...] "is rich in possible meaning, suggestive not only of the great white expansive snow, the lead character's muteness, but the late 1960s political defeats that impacted Corbucci's mood that led him to <b>make</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the grimmest Westerns ever made".|$|E
