25|$|Kundera often {{explicitly}} identifies {{his characters}} as figments of his imagination, commenting in the first-person on {{the characters in}} entirely third-person stories. Kundera {{is more concerned with}} the words that shape or mold his characters than with their physical appearance. In his non-fiction work, The Art of the Novel, he says that the reader's imagination automatically completes the writer's vision. He, as the writer, thus wishes to focus on the essential, arguing that the physical is not critical to understanding a character. Indeed, for him the essential may not even include the interior world (the psychological world) of his characters. Still, at times, a specific feature or trait <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> character's idiosyncratic focus.|$|E
25|$|As a {{theoretical}} or speculative science it is purely descriptive and not practical, being correlated {{on the one}} hand to physical science and on the other to history. Its method is {{the same as that of}} physical science, being distinguished from the latter only by its matter. The ontological basis of ethics is the unity of the real and the ideal, and the psychological and actual basis of the ethical process is the tendency of reason and nature to unite in the form of the complete organization of the latter by the former. The end of the ethical process is that nature (i.e. all that is not mind, the human body as well as external nature) <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> perfect symbol and organ of mind.|$|E

500|$|Russell's view {{of human}} nature, like that of Thomas Hobbes, is {{somewhat}} pessimistic. By Russell's account, the desire to empower oneself is unique to human nature. No other animals besides Homo sapiens, he argues, are capable of being so unsatisfied with their lot, that they should try to accumulate more goods than meet their needs. The [...] "impulse to power", as he calls it, does not arise unless one's basic desires have been sated. (Russell 1938:3) Then the imagination stirs, motivating the actor to gain more power. In Russell's view, the love of power is nearly universal among people, although it takes on different guises from person to person. A person with great ambitions <b>may</b> <b>become</b> <b>the</b> next Caesar, but others may be content to merely dominate the home. (Russell 1938:9) ...|$|E

[...] He finally came to the conclusion that, in spite of orders that limited him to the Carolinas, he would best serve the British cause by going to Virginia to join his army with that of Phillips and Arnold. [...] Writing after the campaign, he explained that he did not feel he could effectively support Lord Rawdon, who he had left in command in South Carolina, and that he would be unable to gain control of North Carolina until Virginia had been pacified. [...] Since he had not received instructions from Clinton in some time, he wrote the general a letter specifically requesting direction: [...] "I am very anxious to receive your Excellency's commands, being as yet totally in the dark as to the intended operations of the summer.
