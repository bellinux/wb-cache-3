Finding the proper balance between the promotion of content learning and language mastery represents one of the challenges that we all face. When we make a commitment to promoting the acquisition of content, we can facilitate the process by meeting three conditions: • First, we need to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>our</b> learners consider input {{from a variety of sources}} representing diverse perspectives on related subject matter. • The second condition is that we need to guide our students in revisiting input for different purposes. • And finally, we want to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>our</b> students have many opportunities to synthesize knowledge that originates from multiple sources.
