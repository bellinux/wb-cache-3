25|$|In February 1554, the Imperial {{ambassador}} in England Simon Renard heard that Thomas Wyatt, who had conspired against Mary I of England, made an allegation against Henri Cleutin. Wyatt said that d'Oisel {{had spoken to}} his associate the soldier James Croft, asking him to hinder the marriage of Philip II and Mary Tudor, help place Princess Elizabeth on the throne, and marry her to Edward Courtenay, and have Mary Tudor executed. D'Oisel, Wyatt said, had made the same offer to <b>Mr</b> <b>Rogers,</b> Peter Carew, one named South, and William Pickering, the first dapifer, with promises of money, assistance and soldiers from France.|$|E
25|$|Guest {{began his}} career in theatre during the early 1970s {{with one of his}} {{earliest}} professional performances being the role of Norman in Michael Weller's Moonchildren for the play's American premiere at the Arena Stage in Washington D.C. in November 1971. Guest continued with the production when it moved to Broadway in 1972. The following year he began making contributions to The National Lampoon Radio Hour for a variety of National Lampoon audio recordings. He both performed comic characters (Flash Bazbo—Space Explorer, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rogers,</b> music critic Roger de Swans, and sleazy record company rep Ron Fields) and wrote, arranged and performed numerous musical parodies (of Bob Dylan, James Taylor and others). He was featured alongside Chevy Chase and John Belushi in the Off-Broadway revue National Lampoon's Lemmings. Two of his earliest film roles were small parts as uniformed police officers in the 1972 film The Hot Rock and 1974's Death Wish.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumstance}} of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rogers</b> having preached at Paul's cross, after Queen Mary {{arrived at}} the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep to his house. He did so, though he might have escaped; and though he perceived {{the state of the}} true religion to be desperate. He knew he could not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget a wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. But all these things were insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.|$|E

The scheme works until Chief Wiggum conducts a raid on the store. Despite this, the boys manage to keep the profits from their time managing the store. Meanwhile, Homer has been helping a recovering Comic Book Guy look for a friend, but his attempts fail until he meets Agnes Skinner. Comic Book Guy and Agnes become romantically involved. However one night while they are kissing in bed, Chief Wiggum charges Comic Book Guy for his pirated videotapes. Bart and Milhouse, freed from running the Android's Dungeon, decide that they had fun, but {{it was time to}} go back to school.

2500|$|After <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rogers</b> {{had been}} long and straitly imprisoned, and lodged in Newgate among thieves, often examined, and very uncharitably entreated, and at length {{unjustly}} and most cruelly condemned by Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, the fourth day of February, {{in the year of}} our Lord 1555, being Monday in the morning, he was suddenly warned by the keeper of Newgate's wife, to prepare himself for the fire; who, being then sound asleep, could scarce be awaked. At length being raised and awaked, and bid to make haste, then said he, [...] "If it be so, I need not tie my points." [...] And so was had down, first to bishop Bonner to be degraded: which being done, he craved of Bonner but one petition; and Bonner asked what that should be. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rogers</b> replied that he might speak a few words with his wife before his burning, but that could not be obtained of him.|$|E

2500|$|Fred Rogers (voiced by [...] "Giant" [...] Brian Carothers) was an {{impersonation}} of the children's show host. Like {{the real}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rogers,</b> Fred {{spoke in a}} quiet monotone voice and would talk about his neighbors and puppet shows. If a guest said a very obscure or difficult word, Fred would ask them to repeat it again and then tell them [...] "I knew that you could." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the time}} came {{that he should be}} brought out of Newgate to Smithfield, the place of his execution, Mr. Woodroofe, one of the sheriffs, first came to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rogers,</b> and asked him if he would revoke his abominable doctrine, and the evil opinion of the Sacrament of the altar. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rogers</b> answered, [...] "That which I have preached I will seal with my blood." [...] Then Mr. Woodroofe said, [...] "Thou art an heretic." [...] "That shall be known," [...] quoth <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rogers,</b> [...] "at the Day of Judgment." [...] "Well," [...] said Mr. Woodroofe, [...] "I will never pray for thee." [...] "But I will pray for you," [...] said Mr. Rogers; and so was brought the same day, the fourth of February, by the sheriffs, towards Smithfield, saying the Psalm Miserere by the way, all the people wonderfully rejoicing at his constancy; with great praises and thanks to God for the same. And there in the {{presence}} of Mr. Rochester, comptroller of the queen's household, Sir Richard Southwell, both the sheriffs, and a great number of people, he was burnt to ashes, washing his hands in the flame as he was burning. A little before his burning, his pardon was brought, if he would have recanted; but he utterly refused it. He was the first martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in Queen Mary's time that gave the first adventure upon the fire. His wife and children, being eleven in number, ten able to go, and one sucking at her breast, met him by the way, as he went towards Smithfield. This sorrowful sight of his own flesh and blood could nothing move him, but that he constantly and cheerfully took his death with wonderful patience, in the defence and quarrel of the Gospel of Christ." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several buildings, monuments, {{and works}} of art are {{dedicated}} to Rogers' memory, including a mural sponsored by the Pittsburgh-based Sprout Fund in 2006, [...] "Interpretations of Oakland," [...] by John Laidacker that featured <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rogers.</b> Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania completed construction of The Fred M.

Broughton and William R. Coe were among its leaders. Coe served almost its entire history. Throughout that profitable 50-year history, the VGN continued to follow the Page-Rogers policy of [...] "paying up front for the best." [...] It became particularly well known for treating its employees and vendors well, another investment that paid rich dividends.

More importantly, he did not shy away from dealing with difficult issues of death and divorce but rather encouraged children to express their emotions in a healthy, constructive manner, often providing a simple answer to life's hardships." [...] Following Rogers' death, the U.S. House of Representatives in 2003 unanimously passed Resolution 111 honoring Rogers for [...] "his legendary service to the improvement of the lives of children, his steadfast commitment to demonstrating the power of compassion, and his dedication to spreading kindness through example." ...|$|E
