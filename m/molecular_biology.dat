5|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>biology</b> is {{the study}} of biology at the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. <b>Molecular</b> <b>biology</b> is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated.|$|E

5|$|Archaea host a {{new class}} of {{potentially}} useful antibiotics. A few of these archaeocins have been characterized, but hundreds more are believed to exist, especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so they may have novel modes of action. In addition, they may allow the creation of new selectable markers for use in archaeal <b>molecular</b> <b>biology.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1945, Delbrück's famous Phage Course {{was taught}} {{for the first}} time, inspiring, among others, a young James D. Watson; it was {{repeated}} for many years after. CSH Symposia important in the cross-fertilization of ideas among <b>molecular</b> <b>biology's</b> pioneers were held in 1951, 1953, 1956, 1961, 1963, and 1966.|$|R
5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} {{was becoming}} more sophisticated, with the increasing role of <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious of {{the direction in which}} immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{this body}} of {{research}} established the central dogma of <b>molecular</b> <b>biology,</b> which states that proteins are translated from RNA, which is transcribed from DNA.

5|$|In 1971–72, {{he wrote}} four books, most notably, Genes, Dreams and Realities, which caused great {{controversy}} {{due to its}} strident attacks on <b>molecular</b> <b>biology,</b> cellular biology, and claims that cancer and various other diseases were incurable {{and that it was}} pointless to try to do so. He also predicted that scientific progress would end soon.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Division of Biology at Caltech, the Laboratory of <b>Molecular</b> <b>Biology</b> (and its precursors) at Cambridge, {{and a handful of}} other institutions, the Pasteur Institute became a major center for <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by Max Perutz and John Kendrew, focused on the rapidly developing field of structural biology, combining X-ray crystallography with Molecular modelling and the new computational possibilities of digital computing (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the military funding of science). A number of biochemists led by Frederick Sanger later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of macromolecular structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, François Jacob and Jacques Monod followed the 1959 PaJaMo experiment with a series of publications regarding the lac operon that established the concept of gene regulation and identified what came to be known as messenger RNA. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology—a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and <b>molecular</b> <b>biology.</b> The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E
