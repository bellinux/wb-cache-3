5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant <b>modular</b> <b>form</b> Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E
5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly <b>modular</b> <b>form,</b> of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the choir of York.|$|E

25|$|Around 1955, Japanese mathematicians Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama {{observed}} a possible link between two apparently completely distinct branches of mathematics, elliptic curves and modular forms.

40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} “generalized modular forms,” {{initiated}} here, grows naturally out of questions inherent in rational conformal field theory. The latter physical theory studies q-series arising as trace functions (or partition functions), which generate a finite-dimensional SL(2,Z) -module. It {{is a natural}} step to investigate whether these q-series are in fact <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> in the classical sense. As it turns out, {{the existence of the}} module does not, of itself, guarantee that this is so. Indeed, our Theorem 1 shows that such q-series of necessity behave like <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> in every respect, with the important exception that the multiplier system need not be of absolute value one. The Supplement to Theorem 1 shows that such q-series are classical <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> exactly when the scalars relating the q-series generators of the module have absolute value one. That is, the SL(2,Z) -module in question is unitary. (There is the further restriction that the associated representation is monomial.) We prove as well that there exist generalized <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> which are not classical <b>modular</b> <b>forms.</b> (Hence, as asserted above, the q-series need not be classical <b>modular</b> <b>forms.)</b> Beyond Theorem 1 and its Supplement, which serve to relate our generalized <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> to classical <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> (and thus justify the name), this work develops a number of their fundamental properties. Among these are a basic result relating generalized <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> to classical <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> of weight 2 and so, as well, to abelian integrals. Further, we prove two general existence results and a complete characterization of weight k generalized <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> in terms of generalized <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> of weight 0 and classical <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> of weight k...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{elliptic}} <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> has gained significant momentum from {{the discovery of}} relaxed yet well-behaved notions of modularity, such as mock <b>modular</b> <b>forms,</b> higher order <b>modular</b> <b>forms,</b> and iterated Eichler-Shimura integrals. Applications beyond number theory range from combinatorics, geometry, and representation theory to string theory and conformal field theory. We unify these relaxed notions {{in the framework of}} vector-valued <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> by introducing a new class of SL_ 2 (Z) -representations: virtually real-arithmetic types. The key point of the paper is that virtually real-arithmetic types are in general not completely reducible. We obtain a rationality result for Fourier and Taylor coefficients of associated <b>modular</b> <b>forms,</b> introduce Petersson pairings, and examine Hecke theory. As a result, we discover inner products for mixed mock <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> and provide spectral deformations of mixed mock <b>modular</b> <b>forms</b> via Poincaré series.

25|$|The Éolienne Bollée was {{designed}} to be constructed in a <b>modular</b> <b>form,</b> thus allowing éoliennes of various sizes to be built.

The éoliennes built with this type of tower have a very distinctive appearance. The actual turbine itself consists of two rings, the first being the stator and the second being the rotor. The stator has more blades than the rotor. A new device added to the 1885 patent was a funnel affixed to the stator, enabling the éolienne to capture wind from a larger area than the rotor, and increasing its speed through the turbine. A small fantail operated upwind of the rotor, and through a system of gears turned the turbine to face the wind. Also, through a counterweight system, it turned the turbine out of wind as the wind speed increased, thus preventing damage in very strong winds, when the éolienne would be edge on into the prevailing wind.|$|E
