5|$|Coursed <b>mud</b> {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist <b>mud</b> is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More <b>mud</b> is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled <b>mud,</b> a hand-made <b>mud</b> form is filled with wetter <b>mud</b> and allowed to dry.|$|E
5|$|Adult solitary wasps {{spend most}} of their time in {{preparing}} their nests and foraging for food for their young, mostly insects or spiders. Their nesting habits are more diverse than those of social wasps. Many species dig burrows in the ground. <b>Mud</b> daubers and pollen wasps construct <b>mud</b> cells in sheltered places. Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from <b>mud,</b> often with multiple cells, attached to the twigs of trees or against walls.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>MUDs</b> {{restrict}} player versus player combat, often abbreviated as PK (Player Killing).

5|$|Earth {{structure}} materials may be {{as simple}} as <b>mud,</b> or <b>mud</b> mixed with straw to make cob. Sturdy dwellings may be also built from sod or turf.

5|$|Gategood {{could not}} get through on the radio because the petrol {{generator}} that supplied power to the radios at <b>Mud</b> Bay had broken down, thereby cutting Arnold's link with <b>Mud</b> Bay, Milne Force and Taleba Bay. Arnold launched an attack on Kilia at 09:10, supported by two 3-inch mortars and 100rounds that had been brought up from <b>Mud</b> Bay. A promised air strike failed to arrive. Instead, Japanese aircraft strafed the Australian positions, {{as well as the}} ketch Maclaren King in <b>Mud</b> Bay with wounded men on board, resulting in further casualties. Arnold attempted a flanking movement with A Company, but it became lost in the jungle. The attack then became a frontal one against the main Japanese defences, which Arnold chose not to press.|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{interference}} on wireless {{systems such as}} 4 G and beyond {{is expected to be}} more severe {{due to the fact that}} the cells are expected to become more condensed (i.e.,femto-cells) and the dimension of wireless technologies keeps increasing from one generation to another. For example, large MIMO systems with tens to hundreds of transmit/receive antennas are proposed for 4 G and beyond in order to achieve high spectral efficiencies [2, 3]. To combat these different types of interferences, multiuser detectors (<b>MUDs)</b> have been developed [1]. <b>MUDs</b> are used mainly to reduce the effect of interference in wireless/wired systems and hence to increase system capacity and throughput. A large variety of <b>MUDs</b> was developed in the literature [1]. Typically, they range from simple but poor performance <b>MUDs</b> to complex but excellent performance <b>MUDs.</b> The challenge is usually to devise <b>MUDs</b> that tradeoff between low complexity and good performance. Applications of <b>MUDs</b> are diverse and in fact they have been applied to various wireless/wired systems such as MIMO-OFDM, SFBC-OFDM, OCDMA, just to name a few [4 – 6].|$|R
5|$|Gunpowder {{was used}} to loosen the marl, which was then removed by steam shovels. Various other steam-powered devices were used to remove <b>mud,</b> clay and rock. All the hard {{material}} was used for embankments and quay roads around the docks. The <b>mud</b> was placed behind these, and in trenches to seal the works from water, using special side-tipping wagons.|$|E

Most of the <b>mud</b> seals were excavated at modern-day Elephantine; {{it is possible}} that more of them lie under the garden of the current museum of Elephantine. These seal impressions bear more inscriptions than the stone bowls, however most of the seals are only preserved as small fragments and their surfaces have been roughened over the years.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{set out for}} help, {{unaware that}} Maggie is tagging along, while Marge and Lisa stay behind. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart plummet into a raging river where they lose their clothes, but hide their nakedness with leaves and <b>mud.</b> Marge and Lisa make {{themselves}} comfortable by a campfire, while the boys freeze in the wilderness. The next day, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive, only to be attacked by the bees, but evades them by jumping into a <b>mud</b> pit. A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in <b>mud,</b> mistaking him for Bigfoot, and soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers.|$|E

The biological fertilizers investigated in this study were Nitroxin and Barvar 2. Application of filter <b>muds</b> led to decreases in nitrogen, phosphorus and Cd of canola seeds. On the other hand, increase of filter <b>muds</b> application led to increase of Zn, Cu, Fe and Pb content in canola seeds. Biological and chemical fertilizers application resulted in increases of nitrogen, phosphorus and cadmium contents in canola seeds. Biofertilizers also increased phosphorus and cadmium contents in canola seeds...|$|R
