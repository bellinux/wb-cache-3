40|$|In {{addition}} to the ubiquitous structural relaxation of viscous supercooled liquids, <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols</b> and several other hydrogen-bonded systems display a strong single-exponential electrical low-frequency absorption. So far, this so-called Debye process could be observed only using dielectric techniques. Exploiting a combination of broad-band and high-resolution rheology experiments for three isomeric octanols, unambiguous mechanical evidence for the Debye process is found. Its spectral signature {{is similar to the}} viscoelastic fingerprint of small-chain polymers, enabling us to estimate the effective molecular weight for the supramolecular structure formed by the studied <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols.</b> This finding opens the venue for the application of further non-dielectric techniques directed at unraveling the microscopic nature of the Debye process and for an understanding of this phenomenon in terms of polymer concepts.

40|$|Hydrogen {{bonds are}} {{essential}} for the structure and dynamics of alcohols, aqueous solutions, and water. Because of their low tendency of crystallization and large variability in molecular configuration, <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols</b> have often been studied as model systems for hydrogen-bonded fluids in general. This thesis contains investigations of the structuring in <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols</b> on molecular level employing x-ray scattering methods such as x-ray diffraction and x-ray Raman scattering. The x-ray diffraction patterns of <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols</b> yield information about supramolecular structures via a characteristic prepeak on the low momentum-transfer side of the main diffraction peak. These structures are suggested to be ring- or chainlike in the investigated <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols.</b> Mixtures of the chain building 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol with the halogen alkanes 2 -ethylhexyl bromide and 2 -ethylhexyl chloride were investigated by x-ray diffraction to track the changing of supramolecular structures due to mixing. Moreover, mixtures of ring building <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols</b> 4 -methyl- 3 -heptanol, 2 -butyl- 1 -octanol and 2 -hexyl- 1 -decanol were studied by means of x-ray diffraction to observe structural rearrangements leading to chainlike structures in the mixtures. Furthermore, the complex pressure and temperature behavior of 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol and 4 -methyl- 3 -heptanol has {{raised questions about the}} role of hydrogen bonding in these systems at extreme conditions. The x-ray diffraction patterns of these two liquids were measured at pressures up to 4500 bar at temperatures of 273 K, 300 K, and 343 K and at temperatures in the range from 130 K to 380 K at ambient pressure. These results are discussed in terms of formation and destruction of supramolecular arrangements. Additionally, the dynamic structure factors of four different octanol isomers were measured by x-ray Raman scattering at the oxygen K-edge to obtain further information about the hydrogen bond network in alcohols. An ultimate goal is to investigate the dynamics in liquids on a molecular length scale with femtosecond resolution. Therefore, novel instruments are necessary. A machine delivering highly coherent hard x-rays with a short pulse length is the European XFEL, which is being built up in Hamburg at the moment. This light source asks for an extremely fast sample injection system, delivering a sample of just a few microns thickness. A Microliquids FlatJet system is perfectly suited for this purpose. Such a device was purchased, characterized and tested in the frame of this thesis.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the by Gainaru et al. [2013] newly discovered low frequency mechanical crossover observed in monohydroxy alcohols by diluting neat 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol (2 E 1 H) with squalane. The complex shear modulus is being measured using a PSG transducer, developed by Christensen and Olsen [1995] at Roskilde University, that allows measurements with frequencies ranging from 10 ^(- 3) - 10 ^ 6 Hz. From the assumption that monohydroxy alcohols {{can be described as}} shortchain polymers, a model proposed by Bo Jakobsen based on an addition of the Maxwell and the Rouse model from Gray et al. [1977] is being investigated and compared to existing mechanical data of 2 E 1 H. The model is fitted to data for the <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohol</b> 2 E 1 H obtained from Gainaru et al. [2013], indicating that monohydroxy alcohols may be described as short-chain polymers. The three investigated properties of the liquids are low frequency crossovers, the broadness of the alpha-peaks, and the low frequency viscosities. It is concluded that the experimental equipment at NSM Roskilde University needs to be optimized with a wider shear modulus and frequency measuring range, to be able to observe crossovers in solutions of 2 E 1 H and squalane. The broadest alpha-peak is observed for 0. 353 mole fraction squalane in 2 E 1 H, indicating a hindering in the forming of H-bonds at relatively low concentrations of squalane. An extra contribution to the viscosity is observed for both liquids and intermediate solutions. By comparing data of solutions of 2 E 1 H and squalane with experimental data from the Glass & Time data repository, it is suggested that a broad alpha-peak and an extra viscosity contribution are generic for monohydroxy alcohols and possibly also polymers of low molecular weight. Similar properties are observed for liquid squalane, which in addition shows a strong temperature dependence, comparable to the structurally similar polymer polybutadiene (PB 20) ...|$|E

Lett. 107, 118304 (2011) ] revealed anomalous behavior in various static quantities near 250 K. To check whether corresponding observations {{can be made for}} other <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols</b> as well, these experimental methods were applied to such substances with 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 carbon atoms in their molecular backbone. All studied liquids exhibit a change of behavior near 250 K which is tentatively ascribed to effects of hydrogen bond cooperativity. By analyzing the NIR band intensities, a linear cluster size is derived that agrees with estimates from dielectric spectroscopy. All studied alcohols, except 4 -methyl- 3 -heptanol, display a dominant Debye-like peak.

40|$|Glass-forming <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols</b> exhibit {{not only}} a {{structural}} relaxation but also a slower, single-exponential Debye-type relaxation process which already freezes in the liquid phase. By using dielectric spectroscopy, we study how these relaxations evolve when the aprotic alkyl halide n-bromobutane is added to n-butanol, thereby diluting the hydrogen-bond network. The structural relaxation times smoothly vary over the concentration range of this completely miscible binary system. The Debye process remains unaffected by the dilution of the OH groups up to n-bromobutane mole fractions of about 50 %. For larger hydroxy dilutions, it turns rather abruptly into a feature which develops significant spectral broadening and it becomes faster. In the dilute limit, the decoupling between the time scale of the Debye process {{and that of the}} structural relaxation amounts to almost 6 decades when extrapolated to the glass transition temperature. This relatively large, strongly concentration dependent decoupling is interpreted in analogy to normal modes in polymers. The present results suggest that the structural and the Debye-like responses of <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols</b> are unrelated...|$|R

In this work, we apply broadband shear-mechanical spectroscopy to a systematic series of octanol structural isomers, x-methyl- 3 -heptanol (with x ranging from 2 to 6). We find that {{the characteristics of the}} mechanical signature overall follow the systematic behavior observed in dielectric spectroscopy. However, the influence from the molecular structure is strikingly small in mechanics (compared to roughly a factor 100 increase in dielectric strength) and one isomer clearly does not conform to the general ordering. Finally, the mechanical data surprisingly indicate that the size of the supramolecular structures responsible for the Debye process is nearly unchanged in the series.

40|$|We present {{nonlinear}} dielectric {{measurements of}} glass-forming 1 -propanol, a prototypical {{example for the}} <b>monohydroxy</b> <b>alcohols</b> that are known to exhibit unusual relaxation dynamics, namely an additional Debye relaxation, slower than the structural alpha relaxation. Applying high ac fields of 468 kV/cm allows for a detailed investigation of the nonlinear properties of all three relaxation processes occurring in 1 -propanol, namely the Debye, alpha, and beta relaxation. Both the field-induced variations of dielectric constant and loss are reported. Polarization saturation and the absorption of field energy govern the findings in the Debye-relaxation regime, well consistent with the suggested cluster-like nature of the relaxing entities. The behavior of the alpha relaxation is in good accord with the expectations for a heterogeneous relaxation scenario. Finally, the Johari-Goldstein beta-relaxation in 1 -propanol seems to exhibit no or only weak field dependence, in agreement with recent findings for the excess wing of canonical glass formers.

40|$|Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv.

Cessation of nitrite production also could not be attributed to leakage of nitrate from the cells. Although some nitrate did leak from the cells, most of the nitrate was still in the cells by the time anaerobic nitrite production ceased. We infer the existence of a small metabolic pool and a large storage pool of nitrate, such that nitrite production ceases when the metabolic pool is depleted of nitrate. The metabolic pool of nitrate in tobacco cells decreased 170 -fold as the culture aged from 3 to 5 days. However, total cellular nitrate during this period remained relatively constant...|$|R

The objects of the investigation were as follows I. To ascertain by the investigation of changes occasioned in the physical properties density, refractivity, viscosity, heat of mixing, magnetic susceptibility, what changes, physical or chemical, occur when the compounds are mixed. The changes sought included compound formation, (inter molecular coordinated), de association, association. II. To ascertain whether magnetic measurements are likely to prove more suitable than others for indicating the changes which occur. III. To examine the results with the view of obtaining an insight into the electronic and magnetic relationships of the molecules. The liquids used were mixtures of n-butyl alcohol with iso propyl, normal propyl, iso butyl and methyl butyl alcohols respectively, and the density, refractivity, viscosity, and magnetic susceptibility of a complete series of mixtures were examined in each case. Heat of mixing measurements were made only in the case of n-butyl alcohol with iso-propyl alcohol. The heat change as shown by preliminary experiments proved to be too small and to vary so little in the various mixtures as to be useless for the present purpose, particularly as the accuracy of the method employed was in many cases not so great as the divergences observed. <p...|$|R
40|$|Recently three {{different}} experimental studies on ultrafast solvation dynamics in <b>monohydroxy</b> straight-chain <b>alcohols</b> (C- 1 -C- 4) {{have been carried}} out, with an aim to quantify the time constant (and the amplitude) of the ultrafast component. The results reported are, however, rather different from different experiments. In {{order to understand the}} reason for these differences, we have carried out a detailed theoretical study to investigate the time dependent progress of solvation of both an ionic and a dipolar solute probe in these alcohols. For methanol, the agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results [Bingemann and Ernsting J. Chem. Phys. 1995, 102, 2691 and Horng et al. J: Phys, Chern, 1995, 99, 17311] is excellent. For ethanol, propanol, and butanol, we find no ultrafast component of the time constant of 70 fs or so. For these three liquids, the theoretical results are in almost complete agreement with the experimental results of Horng et al. For ethanol and propanol, the theoretical prediction for ionic solvation is not significantly different from that of dipolar solvation. Thus, the theory suggests that the experiments of Bingemann and Ernsting and those of Horng et al. studied essentially the polar solvation dynamics. The theoretical studies also suggest that the experimental investigations of Joo et al. which report a much faster and larger ultrafast component in the same series of solvents (J. Chem. Phys. 1996, 104, 6089) might have been more sensitive to the nonpolar part of solvation dynamics than the polar part. In addition, a discussion on the validity of the present theoretical approach is presented. In this theory the ultrafast component arises from almost frictionless inertial motion of the individual solvent molecules in the force field of its neighbors...|$|R
