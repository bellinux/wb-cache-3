The detection limit for the drugs was 100 - 500 pg in an injected volume. The recovery of the drugs from urine and plasma samples was 60 - 65 %. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) exhibited high chemoresistance to current treatments. Here weaimed at identifying and repositioning approved drugs that could be selectively toxic toward OSCCcells. Through a cell-based drug screening of 1, 280 chemical molecules, we selected compounds lethalto oral cancer SCC- 25 cells, while sparing normal keratinocyte HaCaT cells. Within the chemical library,the natural flavonoid luteolin {{was identified as a}} potent cytotoxic agent against oral cancer cells invitro, along with <b>metixene</b> hydrochloride and nitazoxanide. Of note, they exhibit low toxicity and highefficiency compared to the standard-of-care, such as cisplatin and the epidermal growth factorreceptor inhibitor tyrphostin. From a molecular standpoint, luteolin causes phosphorylation of ataxiatelangiectasia mutated (ATM) and H 2 AX in a DNA repair pathway and can be efficiently combinedwith a checkpoint kinase (CHK) pharmacological inhibitor. Thus, luteolin emerges as a potent cytotoxicand/or adjuvant therapy in oral cancer, as it is a natural compound presenting better effects in vitrocompared to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Future in vivo exploration is next required toprovide the proof-of-concept that luteolin could be an efficient anticancer molecule...|$|E
