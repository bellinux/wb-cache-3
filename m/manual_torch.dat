5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the <b>manual</b> <b>torch</b> has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E
50|$|<b>Manual</b> <b>torch</b> brazing is a {{procedure}} where {{the heat is}} applied using a gas flame placed {{on or near the}} joint being brazed. The torch can either be hand held or held in a fixed position depending on whether the operation is completely manual or has some level of automation. Manual brazing is most commonly used on small production volumes or in applications where the part size or configuration makes other brazing methods impossible. The main drawback is the high labor cost associated with the method as well as the operator skill required to obtain quality brazed joints. The use of flux or self-fluxing material is required to prevent oxidation. Torch brazing of copper can be done without the use of flux if it is brazed with a torch using oxygen and hydrogen gas, rather than oxygen and other flammable gases.|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableLiquid core {{optical ring}} {{resonators}} (LCORRs) allow label-free detection of biological chemical molecules, along with low sample consumption {{and a low}} detection limit. The LCORR is a glass capillary that is heated and pulled to a diameter of about 100 ?m and a wall thickness of a few microns. The LCORR being hollow naturally provides a fluidic channel to deliver the sample to the sensor. The cross section forms a ring resonator that supports whispering gallery modes (WGMs), which interact with the sample inside the capillary. Three devices are essential to conducting LCORR research. These devices are an LCORR puller, a taper puller, and a syringe pump. The LCORR puller and taper puller cannot be purchased, so must be made out of necessity. Syringe pumps can be purchased but are very expensive, so cheaper versions were made. Also the pulling of LCORRs was modeled in MatLab using a simplified steady-state equation solved by the forward derivative method. For the LCORR puller a setup was made that consists of two computer controlled CO 2 lasers, two computer controlled slides driven by stepper motors, and a program with a user interface created in LabVIEW to control the setup. For the taper puller a setup was made that consists of two computer controlled slides driven by stepper motors, a <b>manual</b> <b>torch,</b> and a program with a user interface created in LabVIEW to control the setup. For each syringe pump (total of 3) a setup was made that consists of one slide driven by a stepper motor, an LCD screen, LED indicators, and a PIC microcontroller to run these components...|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{property of}} aluminium alloys is sensitivity to heat. Workshop procedures are {{complicated by the fact}} that aluminium, unlike steel, melts without first glowing red. <b>Manual</b> blow <b>torch</b> operations require additional skill and experience. Aluminium alloys, like all structural alloys, are subject to internal stresses after heat operations such as welding and casting. The lower melting points {{of aluminium alloys}} make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief. Stress can be relieved and controlled during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven, followed by gradual coolingâ€”in effect annealing the stresses.|$|R

5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the <b>manual</b> GTAW <b>torches.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of fully automatic GMAW processes may {{rely on the}} development of sophisticated equipment to emulate the <b>manual</b> welding <b>torch</b> oscillation pattern or {{on the development of}} high level methods of control to prevent the appearance of defects, especially the lack of sidewall fusion. An intermediate solution is to optimise the weaving parameters of a conventional pattern oscillator {{in such a way as}} to minimise the level of rejection. A prototype of a computerised system to work with Pulsed-GMAW equipment, in the vertical-up position, was proposed to produce a minimal level of rejection for welds in plates up to 25 mm thick. The system basically consists of optimised mode control algorithms, based on theoretical and experimental models of weld pool behaviour. Three tasks are performed by the system; the selection of parameters for an optimum working point, an off-line simulation of the operation and real-time error monitoring of the process. Statistical experimental modelling was applied in order to build most of the optimised models, because of the large number of variables to be treated and their complex inter-correlation. The welding variables were correlated with single responses. Partial and Correlation Analysis techniques were used to discover the relationship between the variables and the responses. Regression Analysis was then applied as a means of obtaining the 'weight' of the most significant variables. Finally, since some variables were found to be collinear, a corrective technique for biased variables was employed. Acceptance criteria for bead shapes were proposed and assessed. The effect of the oscillation parameters and other welding variables on the bead formation was analyzed and an operational 'envelope' for the parameters determined. A theoretical approach to predict the occurrence of poorly shaped beads, due to the lack of metal bridge between the joint walls, was successfully developed and applied in parallel with the statistical experimental methods. Equations for optimising the bead shape and for determining the operational envelope contours were subsequently generated and evaluated. An extension of the system to an actual adaptive control scheme was discussed and sensors and signals to be used were evaluated. Finally, a process instability phenomenon in long test plates was identified and investigated. This instability may prevent the use of GMA W in some conditions in the vertical-up position...|$|R
