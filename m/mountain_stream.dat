5|$|The {{region was}} known for its wine. Since the 15th century the local {{inhabitants}} practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners' Guild in 1447, the oldest such guild in the German-speaking world. Terraced vineyards extended {{up the sides of}} the Krems River until it became a <b>mountain</b> <b>stream</b> and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation. The Loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture. As the terrain became steeper, the vines grew in terraces built from the dark Urgestein, primordial rock. From Dürenstein to Krems the river makes its wide curve; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line-of-sight between the two towns.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the painted}} {{production}} of Verrocchio's workshop {{was done by}} his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ, painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe {{in a manner that}} was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again, although this is believed to be apocryphal. Close examination reveals areas that have been painted or touched-up over the tempera using the new technique of oil paint; the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown <b>mountain</b> <b>stream</b> and much of the figure of Jesus bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo. Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the Archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.|$|E

25|$|It {{divided the}} creek into an upper stretch, mostly a wild <b>mountain</b> <b>stream,</b> {{and a lower}} stretch closer to the Hudson that {{gradually}} becomes more estuarine. Above the reservoir, its water quality is closely monitored, {{not only for its}} role in the city's water supply but to preserve its local economic importance as a recreational resource. As the upper Esopus {{is one of the most}} productive trout streams in the Northeast, fly fishermen still come in great numbers to take trout from its relatively accessible banks. Canoeists and kayakers have been drawn to its whitewater, which has also spawned a busy local tubing industry in the summer months. The lower Esopus is mainly an aesthetic and ecological resource, although the estuary at Saugerties is a popular bass fishery.|$|E
25|$|The Eaton Canyon Natural Area Park {{is located}} where the <b>mountain</b> <b>stream</b> debouches into the {{foothill}} wash {{at the base}} of the San Gabriel Mountains. The park is administered by the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation. The county administers the lower two-thirds of the area below the toll road bridge. Most of the 190 acres (0.8km2) that comprises the natural area lie on the northern boundaries of the old Rancho San Pascual and Rancho Santa Anita on land designated for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Once the railroad gave up the land, it was opened for homesteading. The nature center is unique in the area because it houses exhibits that educate on the flora and fauna local to the San Gabriel Valley Southern California. The center was rebuilt in 1998 after the 1993 fire destroyed the previous facility.|$|E
25|$|There are {{concerns}} about the ecological impact of introducing the wels catfish to non-native regions. These concerns {{take into account the}} situation in Lake Victoria in Africa, where Nile perch were introduced and rapidly caused the extinction of numerous indigenous species. This severely impacted the entire lake, destroying much of the original ecosystem. The introduction of foreign species is almost always a burden on the affected ecosystem. Following the introduction of wels catfish, some fishes' numbers are in clear and rapid decline. Since its introduction in the Mequinenza Reservoir in 1974, it has spread {{to other parts of the}} Ebro basin, including its tributaries, especially the Segre River. Some endemic species of Iberian barbels, genus Barbus in the Cyprinidae, were once abundant especially in the Ebro river but due to competition from and predation by wels catfish have since disappeared in the middle channel Ebro. The ecology of the river has also changed, as there is now a major growth in aquatic vegetation such as algae. Barbel species from <b>mountain</b> <b>stream</b> tributaries of the Ebro that wels catfish have not colonized are not affected.|$|E

The site has been designated by the Countryside Council for Wales as the 1000th Site of Special Scientific Interest in Wales, because of its importance to an understanding of Welsh geomorphology.

500|$|Lake Neepaulin is a {{man-made}} lake created from the damming of Neepaulakating Creek, a small <b>mountain</b> <b>stream</b> {{that was not}} named until 2002.

These headwaters are located a short distance south of County Route 650 (Libertyville Road) roughly halfway between the hamlet of Libertville in Wantage Township and Sussex Borough. Lake Neepaulin's elevation is [...] 509 feet (155m) above sea level. The lake is the center of a private residential development. From the dam, the creek flows southeast for [...] before flowing into Papakating Creek, a tributary of the Wallkill River. The creek, lake, and its watershed are located in the Kittatinny Valley which is underlain by dark shale and limestone of the Martinsburg Formation and has soils that are glacial in origin.|$|E

500|$|The opening song, [...] "And It Stoned Me", {{was written}} about {{feelings}} of ecstasy received from witnessing and experiencing nature, in a narrative describing a rural setting with a county fair and <b>mountain</b> <b>stream.</b> Morrison said he based it on a quasi-mystical experience he {{had as a}} 12 year old fishing in the Comber village of Ballystockart, where he once asked for water from {{an old man who}} said he had retrieved it from a stream. [...] "We drank some and everything seemed to stop for me", the singer recalled, adding that it induced a momentary feeling of quietude in him. According to Hinton, these childhood images foreshadowed both spiritual redemption and—in Morrison's reference to [...] "" [...] in the chorus—sexual pleasure. AllMusic's Tom Maginnis argued that the singer was instead likening the experience to the first time hearing jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. The largely acoustic title track featured piano, guitar, saxophone, electric bass, and a flute over-dub backing Morrison, who sang of an adult romance set in Autumn and imitated a saxophone with his voice near the song's conclusion. [...] "This is a rock musician singing jazz, not a jazz singer, though the music itself has a jazz swing", Hinton remarked, noting how its rhythm is played in triplets rather than rock's archetypical quadruple time signature. [...] "Crazy Love" [...] was recorded with Morrison's voice so close to the microphone that it captured the click of Morrison's tongue hitting the roof of his mouth as he sang. He sings in falsetto, producing what Hinton felt was a sense of intense intimacy, backed by a female chorus.|$|E
