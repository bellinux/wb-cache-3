The analysis showed that starch content in tubers of <b>medium-early</b> potato cultivars depends more on precipitation than on thermal conditions. The relationship between starch content in tubers and precipitation and thermal conditions varied in different stations. In four stations (Karżniczka, Sulejów, Uhnin, Węgrzce) it depended on precipitation noted in August, in two (Uhnin and Słupia) – in July and in other two (Naroczyce and Słupia) – in June. Positive influence of temperature on starch content was noted only in August in Karżniczka.

40|$|An {{objective}} {{evaluation of}} maize hybrids in intensive cropping systems requires identification {{not only of}} yield components and other agronomically important traits but also of stability parameters. Grain yield and its components were assessed in 11 maize hybrids with different lengths of growing season (FAO 300 - 700 maturity groups) using analysis of variance and regression analysis at three different locations in Western Serbia. The test hybrids and locations showed significant differences in grain yield, grain moisture content at maturity, 1, 000 -kernel weight and ear length. A significant interaction was observed between all traits and the environment. The hybrids with higher mean values of the traits, regardless of maturity group, generally exhibited sensitivity i. e. adaptation to more favourable environmental conditions as compared to those having lower mean values. Regression coefficient (bi) values for grain yield mostly suggested no significant differences relative to the mean. The medium-season hybrid gave high yields and less favourable values of stability parameters at most locations and in most years, as compared to mediumlate hybrids. As compared to <b>medium-early</b> hybrids, medium-late hybrids (FAO 600 and 700) mostly exhibited unfavourable values of stability parameters i. e. a specific response and better adaptation to favourable environmental conditions, and gave higher average yields. Apart from producing lower average yields, FAO 300 and 400 hybrids showed higher yield stability {{as compared to the}} other hybrids tested. Medium-late hybrids had higher yields and showed a better response to favourable environmental conditions compared to early-maturing hybrids.

The four possible growing seasons are defined as early (June–October), <b>medium-early</b> (July–November), medium-late (October–March) and late (February–June) and have already been characterized by assessing weather, soil and crop type, yield level and yield determining, yield limiting and yield reducing factors. However, there is scarce or no information on the possibilities of expanding actual crop frontiers, either at regional or national level and on the potential yield of the crop in different agro-ecological zones.

40|$|In the Mediterranean region, {{progress}} in selection for yield in harsh environments is hampered by large environmental variation between seasons and locations. This study analyses the genotype-by-environment (GE) interaction of 36 two-rowed genotypes of barley, grown in 14 environments in Syria and North Africa. It assesses {{the effect of}} growth type (winter or spring type) and heading date on the GE interaction and determines whether or not high-yielding (HY) environments are representative of low-yielding (LY) ones. Average grain yield per environment ranged from 7 to 513 g m- 2. Genotypes and environments were classified by a cluster analysis and the interaction was analysed with an additive main effects and multiplicative interaction model. Genotypes were classified into four clusters, related to their growth type and earliness of heading. Environments were clustered into HY and LY groups; this classification was related to seasonal rainfall and temperature. <b>Medium-early</b> heading winter types had a positive interaction with LY environments and a negative interaction with HY environments, whereas late heading genotypes (spring and winter types) had the opposite interaction pattern. Early heading spring types had above-average mean yields; the highest-yielding among them tended to have a low interaction with environments. High-yielding environments did not discriminate well between genotypes with high or low yields in LY environments, and may thus have limited value for yield selection for LY environments.

AikenMary Beth KirkhamPrior studies {{indicate}} clumped planting can increase grain sorghum yield up to 45 % under water deficit conditions by reducing tiller number, increasing radiation use efficiency, and preserving soil water for grain fill. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate effects of planting geometry on sorghum grain yield. The field study was conducted in seven environments with two sorghum hybrids, four populations, and two planting geometries. Crop responses included leaf area index, yield, and components of yield. Delayed planting decreased yield by 39 %, and a later maturing hybrid increased yield, relative to an early hybrid, by 11 % under water sufficiency. Clumped planting increased the fraction of fertile culms (culms which formed panicles) from 5 - 14 %. It reduced the number of culms m- 2 by 12 % under water limiting conditions (at one of two locations) but increased culms m- 2 16 % under water sufficiency. Seeds per panicle and seed weight generally compensated for differences in panicles m- 2, which were related to different planting population densities. Although agronomic characteristics of hybrids varying in maturity have been widely studied, little information exists concerning their physiological differences. Therefore, the objective of the greenhouse study was to determine if stomatal resistance, leaf temperature, and leaf chlorophyll content differed between two DeKalb grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] hybrids. They were DKS 36 - 16 and DKS 44 - 20, of <b>medium-early</b> and medium maturity, respectively, when grown under field conditions in Kansas. Seeds were planted in a greenhouse. Stomatal resistance and leaf temperature were measured 55 days after planting with a Decagon Devices (Pullman, WA) diffusion porometer, and chlorophyll content was measured 119 days after planting with a Konica Minolta (Osaka, Japan) SPAD chlorophyll meter.

The experimental factors were foliar fertilizers applied alone or in combination (Basfoliar 12 - 4 - 6, ADOB Mn, Solubor DF) and two levels of soil mineral fertilization (N 1 P 1 K 1 - 80 kg N × ha - 1, 80 kg P × ha - 1, 120 K × ha - 1; N 2 P 2 K 2 - 120 kg N × ha - 1, 144 kg P × ha - 1, 156 K × ha - 1). The experimental materials comprised potato tubers. The symptoms of soft rot (Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum), late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and dry rot (Fusarium spp.) were evaluated in 5 kg potato samples, and were expressed as the percentage mass of infected tubers. The rates of common scab (Streptomyces scabies) and black scurf (Rhizoctonia solani) infection were estimated on 100 tubers collected randomly after harvest, according to a nine-point scale, and were presented as a percentage infection index. In the laboratory, fungi were isolated on PDA medium from potato tubers immediately after harvest and after five-month storage. The incidence of tuber diseases depended on potato cultivars affected. The severity of tuber diseases varied between treatments with two levels of NPK fertilization and foliar fertilization. The lowest number of Fusarium- infected tubers was obtained from treatments where three foliar fertilizers were applied in combination, which was confirmed by the lowest abundance of fungal isolates. More fungi were isolated from potato tubers after harvest than after storage, but pathogens were more frequently isolated from stored tubers. After harvest, the lowest number of pathogenic fungi was isolated from the tubers of cv. ‘Adam’ in the non-fertilized treatment, and after storage – from the tubers of the late cultivars in the treatment with three foliar fertilizers applied in combination...|$|E

Moench] {{is a direct result of}} accumulated heat units (growing degree days) from emergence to physiological maturity. This study was conducted in 1994 and 1995 to determine the effect of planting date on the phenological development of six grain sorghum genotypes grown in the Brazos Bottom (Burleson County), near College Station, Texas. The grain sorghum genotypes consisted of two <b>medium-early,</b> two medium, and two medium-late maturity classes. Experimental design was a randomized complete block utilizing split plots with eight replications. Main plots consisted of an early and late planting date, and subplots consisted of the six genotypes. Data collected was represented as the number of days and growing degree days (base temperature = 7 o 7) from emergence to each of nine phonological stages. Average number of days and growing degree days (GDD) to each phenological stage of development throughout this study were significantly affected by the interactions of genotype x planting date, genotype x year, planting date x year, and genotype x planting date x year. These interactions were due to the individual and combined response of the genotypes to the differences in growing conditions between the early and late planting dates and years. Average number of days from emergence to each phenological stage of development decreased as planting was delayed. On average, number of days at the late planting from emergence to floral initiation (stage 3), anthesis (stage 6), and physiological maturity (stage 9) were reduced 15. 5, 11. 8, and 8. 4 %, respectively. Accumulated GDD to each stage of development showed mixed results between 1994 and 1995. The late planting in 1994 required more GDD, while in 1995 the early planting required more GDD to reach a specific stage of development. Yields and yield components showed no specific response to planting date. This lack of response was probably due to the abbreviated time (I 3 days) between planting dates...|$|E
