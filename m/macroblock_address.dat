50|$|For each slice, {{the slice}} length and the <b>{{macroblock}}</b> <b>address</b> (i.e. index {{with respect to}} the raster scan order) of the first macroblock (MB) of the slice are extracted by the slice parser (Figure 2). This information, together with the slice itself, is stored in memory (shown as DRAM). In addition, a list of pointers (Figure 2, a pointer for each slice, and each pointing to the memory location where a slice is stored), should be generated. The list of pointers, together with the address of the first macroblock of the slice, will be used to navigate through the out of order slices. The slice length will be used to transfer the slice data from the DRAM to the decoderâ€™s internal memory.|$|E
