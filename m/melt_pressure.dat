40|$|As a major polymer {{processing}} technique, polymer,extrusion is {{a continuous}} process, during which material properties, machine variables, and process variables {{interact with each}} other to determine the final product quality., Precise control of key process variables such as barrel temperatures and <b>melt</b> <b>pressure</b> are crucial to ensure a good product quality in the extrusion process. In this paper, the overall extruder control system is constructed by two independent control loops, a single-input single-output (SISO) control of the <b>melt</b> <b>pressure</b> at die output, and a multiinput-multioutput (MIMO) control of the barrel temperatures. The dynamic behaviors of <b>melt</b> <b>pressure</b> and barrel temperatures were analyzed first. The characteristics of the <b>melt</b> <b>pressure</b> dynamics were as follows: nonlinear and time-varying while the extruder barrel temperatures were nonlinear, slow response, and different zones were highly coupled. Advanced control algorithms were adopted to control these key variables. Experimental results demonstrate the fast response, near-zero overshoot, and precise tracking performance of the proposed control strategies. The robustness of the entire control system was verified through different operating conditions including materials and set points. Ultimately the performance of the entire control system was verified by product quality. The product quality improved significantly with the proposed controller...|$|E

40|$|Melting TiAl based alloys in ceramic {{crucibles}} {{often leads}} to chemical contamination, alloy heterogeneity and non-metallic inclusions. The severity of such phenomena usually depends {{on the nature of}} crucible materials, the melting stock composition and the melting parameters, namely superheating time and temperature and <b>melting</b> <b>pressure.</b> Among the referred drawbacks, Al loss during melting is a critical aspect, as its concentration in TiAl based alloys has a very strong effect in their mechanical properties. Although a few studies of critical factors affecting the evaporation behaviour of Al during electron beam and induction skull melting of Ti-Al alloys had been carried out, until now no information was released on this subject for the ceramic crucible induction melting process. 	In this work a Ti- 48 Al alloy was induction melted in a zircon crucible with Y 2 O 3 inner layer, using 50 and 100 ºC superheating temperatures and 0, 60 and 90 second holding times, and poured into a graphite mould. The effect of different temperature/time combinations in the alloy composition, Al loss by evaporation and extent of the metal/crucible interaction was studied for different <b>melting</b> <b>pressures.</b> 	Al loss was found to increase significantly for <b>melting</b> <b>pressures</b> below around 10 - 1 mbar, at a rate that increases as <b>melting</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases, until a maximum rate is reached, remaining constant for lower pressure levels.

A novel temperature sensor {{consisting of a}} grid of thermocouple junctions was used to take multiple temperature readings in real time across melt flow in a single screw extruder. <b>Melt</b> <b>pressure</b> in the die and power consumption were also monitored. Three extruder screws at a range of screw speeds were examined for a commercial grade of low density polyethylene. Results showed melt temperature fields at low throughputs to be relatively independent of screw geometry with a flat-shaped temperature profile dominated by conduction. At high throughputs, melting performance and measured temperature fields were highly dependent upon screw geometry. A barrier-flighted screw with Maddock mixer achieved significantly better melting than single flighted screws.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Plastic Film and Sheeting and the definitive published version is available at [URL] SAGE Publications. The process dynamics of single-screw extrusion on mixtures of polypropylene (PP) and recycled PP were studied using a statistical, design of experiments (DoE) approach. For a conventional screw design, the barrel temperature, screw speed and two vastly different melt viscosity polypropylene mixtures were selected as the independent factors, whilst <b>melt</b> <b>pressure,</b> mass output, screw torque and temperature rise at the die due to shear heating were the dependent responses. A central composite design (CCD) {{in the framework of}} response surface methodology (RSM) was constructed, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to determine the significance of the response surface models. The resulting statistical and response surface predictions have demonstrated that the low viscosity component concentration in the blend is a dominating factor on <b>melt</b> <b>pressure</b> and screw torque, apart from the expected effect of screw speed on output. Viscous heating is affected only by screw speed and recycled polypropylene concentration. Furthermore, the predictions have identified a wider process operating window with increased low-viscosity component concentration. The data confirm that statistical tools make quantitative predictions for the effects of experimental process variables, in accordance with the expected qualitative trends towards process optimisation, providing scope towards its application in scaled-up industrial processes...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{discovery}} of a nonclassical rotational inertia (NCRI) in solid He- 4 below 0. 2 K by Kim and Chan has revived great interest in the problem of supersolidity and initiated intensive study on the properties of solid He- 4. A direct proof that the onset of NCRI corresponds to the supersolid transition would be the observation of a corresponding drop of the entropy of solid He- 4 below the transition temperature. We have measured the <b>melting</b> <b>pressure</b> of ultrapure He- 4 in the temperature range from 0. 01 to 0. 45 K with several single crystals grown at different pressures and with the accuracy of 0. 5 mu bar. In addition, supplementary measurements of the pressure in liquid He- 4 at constant volume have been performed, which allowed us to eliminate {{the contribution of the}} temperature-dependent properties of the pressure gauge from the measured <b>melting</b> <b>pressure</b> data. With the correction to the temperature-dependent sensitivity of the pressure gauge, the variation of the <b>melting</b> <b>pressure</b> of He- 4 below 320 mK obeys the pure T- 4 law due to phonons with the accuracy of 0. 5 mu bar, and no sign of the transition is seen (Todoshchenko et al. in JETP Lett. 85 : 454, 2007). This sets the upper limit of similar to 5 center dot 10 (- 8) R for a possible excess entropy in high-quality He- 4 crystals below 320 mK. At higher temperatures the contribution from rotons in the superfluid He- 4 has been observed. The thermal expansion coefficient of the superfluid He- 4 has been measured in the range from 0. 01 to 0. 7 K with the accuracy of similar to 10 (- 7) 1 /K, or by two orders of magnitude better than in previous measurements. The roton contributions to the <b>melting</b> <b>pressure</b> and to the pressure in liquid at a constant volume are consistent and yield the value of 6. 8 K for the roton gap, which is very close to the values obtained with other methods.
