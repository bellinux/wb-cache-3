40|$|Cohort {{design is}} a type of nonexperimental or {{observational}} study design. In a <b>cohort</b> <b>study,</b> the participants do not have the outcome of interest to begin with. They are selected based on the exposure status of the individual. They are then followed over time to evaluate for the occurrence of the outcome of interest. Some examples of <b>cohort</b> <b>studies</b> are (1) Framingham <b>Cohort</b> <b>study,</b> (2) Swiss HIV <b>Cohort</b> <b>study,</b> and (3) The Danish <b>Cohort</b> <b>study</b> of psoriasis and depression. These studies may be prospective, retrospective, or a combination of both of these types.

40|$|The term cohort has military, not medical, roots. A cohort was a 300 – 600 -man {{unit in the}} Roman army; ten cohorts {{formed a}} legion (figure 1). The {{etymology}} of the term provides a useful mnemonic: a <b>cohort</b> <b>study</b> consists of bands or groups of persons marching forward in time from an exposure {{to one or more}} outcomes. This analogy might be helpful, since <b>cohort</b> <b>studies</b> have a bevy of confusing synonyms: incidence, longitudinal, forward-looking, follow-up, concurrent, and prospective study. 1, 2 Although the terminology can seem daunting, the <b>cohort</b> <b>study</b> is easy for clinicians to understand, since it flows in a logical direction (unlike the case-control study). Here, we explain the terminology, describe {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} <b>cohort</b> <b>studies,</b> consider several logistical concerns, mention two permutations of <b>cohort</b> <b>studies,</b> and summarise their analysis. Data collection: forwards and backwards A <b>cohort</b> <b>study</b> follows-up two or more groups from exposure to outcome. In its simplest form, a <b>cohort</b> <b>study</b> compares the experience of a group exposed to some factor with another group not exposed to the factor. If the former group has a higher or lower frequency of an outcome than the unexposed, then an association between exposure and outcome is evident. The defining characteristic of all <b>cohort</b> <b>studies</b> is that they track people forward in time from exposure to outcome. Researchers doing this kind of study must, therefore, go forward in time from the present or go back in time to choose their cohorts (figure 2). Either way, a <b>cohort</b> <b>study</b> moves in the same direction, although gathering data might not.
