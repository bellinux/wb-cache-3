5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow {{is treated}} as a species of least concern, or not {{threatened}} with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , estimated population of 2.4million individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. In years without sufficient rains, many birds fail to breed {{and those that do}} produce fewer offspring. Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number. The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases: A. r. sanctorum of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct, and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s. Populations of the species in southern California are also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and agricultural development in the region. Additionally, the sparrow is known to have been poisoned by the rodenticide warfarin, though <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> {{to determine the effects of}} pesticides on the rufous-crowned sparrow.|$|E

5000|$|In the European Sociological Review, {{sociologist}} John Goldthorpe {{argued that}} the book relied too heavily on income inequality over other forms of inequality (including broader economic inequality), and demonstrated a one-dimensional understanding of social stratification, with social class being in effect treated as merely a marker for income.

25|$|Nipple {{stimulation}} and breastfeeding {{triggers the}} release of natural oxytocin in the body, therefore {{it is thought that}} encouraging the baby to suckle soon after birth may reduce the risk of PPH for the mother.

25|$|Benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam, are {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} treatment of mania or acute psychosis-induced aggression. In this context, benzodiazepines are given either alone, or in combination with other first-line drugs such as lithium, haloperidol or risperidone.

50|$|After {{the city}} and police {{department}} described an emerging mental health crisis in Vancouver in 2013, the province implemented three of their five recommendations within a year, including new Assertive Community Treatment teams and a nine-bed urgent care facility at St. Paul's Hospital.

25|$|As the {{workplace}} is changing to include more group-based systems, researching motivation within these groups is of growing importance. To date, {{a great amount of}} research has focused on the Job characteristic theory and the Goal-setting Theory. While <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> that draws on a broader range of motivation theories, research thus far has concluded several things: (a) semi-autonomous groups report higher levels of job scope (related to intrinsic job satisfaction), extrinsic satisfaction, and organizational commitment; and (b) developmentally mature teams have higher job motivation and innovation. Further, voluntarily formed work teams report high work motivation. Though research shows that appropriate goal-setting influences group motivation and performance, <b>more</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> in this area (group goals, individual goals, cohesiveness, etc.). There are inseparable mediating variables consisting of group cohesiveness, commitment, and performance. As {{the workplace}} environment calls for more and more teams to be formed, research into motivation of teams is ever-pressing. Thus far, overarching research merely suggests that individual-level and team-level sources of motivation are congruent with each other. Consequently, research should be expanded to apply more theories of motivation; look at group dynamics; and essentially conclude how groups can be most impacted to increase motivation and, consequently, performance.|$|E
