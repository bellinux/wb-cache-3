5000|$|A further Canadian {{find was}} {{specimen}} TMP 90.104.01, a partial skeleton with skull in 1990 discovered at Manyberries in Alberta. Brachylophosaurus has subsequently become better known from fossils found in Montana than Alberta, however, despite its specific name canadensis. These include specimens MOR 720, a braincase; MOR 794, a very complete skeleton with skull {{of an adult}} individual; and MOR 940, another braincase. Near Malta, Montana an entire bonebed of Brachylophosaurus fossils has been uncovered containing over eight hundred specimens, that have been catalogued under number MOR 1071. [...] In 1994 at Malta in Phillips County, amateur paleontologist Nate Murphy discovered a complete and uncrushed Brachylophosaurus skeleton which he nicknamed [...] "Elvis". Subsequently, even more informative finds were made by Murphy and his team from the Judith River Dinosaur Institute. On 20 July 2000, specimen JRF 115H or [...] "Leonardo", a fully articulated and partially [...] "mummified" [...] skeleton of a subadult Brachylophosaurus, was discovered by Dan Stephenson. It {{is considered one of}} the most spectacular dinosaur finds ever, and was included in the Guinness Book of World Records. They subsequently excavated [...] "Roberta", an almost complete gracile skeleton, and [...] "Peanut", a partially preserved juvenile with some skin impressions. [...] "Peanut" [...] was discovered in 2002 by Robert E. Buresh and is on display at the Institute in <b>Malta,</b> <b>MT.</b> [...] In May 2008, Steven Cowan, public-relations coordinator at the Houston Museum of Natural Science, discovered a Brachylophosaurus skeleton subsequently dubbed [...] "Marco" [...] from the same area as Leonardo.|$|E
