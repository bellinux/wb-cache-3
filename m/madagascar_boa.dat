50|$|The Reptile Habitat is {{the first}} {{building}} encountered heading west after exiting the tunnel under Riverside Drive and is located within the shores region. It is a fully indoor facility, containing numerous snakes, terrapins, and tortoises. The Columbus Zoo has also bred many threatened reptile species, including Jamaican <b>boas,</b> <b>Madagascar</b> ground <b>boas,</b> yellow-spotted river turtles, Roti Island snake-necked turtles, and eastern plains garter snakes.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the local}} {{reptiles}} present are: Labord's chameleon, various plated lizards, Henkel's leaf-tailed gecko, big-headed gecko, <b>Madagascar</b> ground <b>boa,</b> giant hog-nosed snake, spear-nosed snake and kapidolo.|$|R
50|$|Acrantophis dumerili, {{commonly}} known as Dumeril's <b>boa</b> and the <b>Madagascar</b> ground <b>boa,</b> is a non-venomous boa species found on Madagascar and Reunion Island. No subspecies are currently recognized.|$|R

50|$|Sanzinia madagascariensis (also {{known as}} the Malagasy tree <b>boa,</b> or <b>Madagascar</b> tree <b>boa)</b> is a non-venomous boa species endemic to the island of Madagascar. Two {{subspecies}} are currently recognized: S. m. madagascariensis and S. m. volontany.|$|R
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} has both native and {{introduced}} predators. Native predators include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus), the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and the <b>Madagascar</b> ground <b>boa</b> (Boa madagascariensis). Introduced predators include the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), the domestic cat and the domestic dog.|$|R
50|$|Predators of the sifaka {{include the}} fossa, a puma-like mammal native to Madagascar, and aerial hunters such as hawks. The sifaka usually avoids these attacks with its agile {{acrobatics}} {{through the trees}} high above the ground. However, they {{have been known to}} attack by biting and scratching and have even been witnessed fighting off a <b>Madagascar</b> ground <b>boa.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} also known for its herpetofauna. More than 100 species of frogs are found within a 30 km radius of Analamazaotra Forest Station. There are at least five species of {{chameleon}} including the brown pygmy leaf chameleon, Parson's chameleon, short-horned chameleon, nose-horned chameleon, and short-nosed chameleon. The forest station {{is also home to}} the <b>Madagascar</b> tree <b>boa.</b>|$|R
40|$|An adult <b>Madagascar</b> tree <b>boa</b> (Sanzinia madagascariensis) {{underwent}} coeliotomy {{for investigation}} of a coelomic mass. At surgery, a large mass originating from the peri-pancreatic adipose tissue and involving the gall bladder was removed. The snake did not recover from general anesthesia. A complete postmortem was performed, and samples were submitted to the University of Glasgow for histopathology. On histological examination, the mass was composed of adipose tissue infiltrated with a poorly demarcated spindle cell neoplasm. The neoplastic cells were highly pleomorphic with abundant cytoplasm and frequent clear cytoplasmic vacuoles, suggestive of adipocyte origin. Immunohistochemical characterization of the mass was inconclusive. Metastatic neoplastic cells were present within vessels in the liver, lungs, and brain. As an incidental finding, the gonads contained both maturing ovarian follicles and seminiferous tubules with intact germinal epithelium and evidence of spermatogenesis, along with other features {{of male and female}} gonad anatomy. The current report describes a rare neoplasm in snakes within an intersex <b>Madagascar</b> tree <b>boa...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Temperate Zone {{features}} {{animals from}} temperate zones around the world. The zoo's nine-banded armadillos Kirby and Penny. The zoo's rare three black-footed cats and cape hyrax {{can also be}} found in the Temperate Zone. The zoo's Siamese crocodiles Hillary and Bill live in the Temperate Zone during the winter. Other reptiles found in the temperate Hall include a <b>Madagascar</b> tree <b>boa,</b> crested geckos, and Madagascar flat-tailed tortoises.|$|R
50|$|McKeown {{worked as}} a supervising herpetologist at the Honolulu Zoo during the 1970s and early 1980s. During this time, he {{developed}} a number of breeding programs for some lizard and tortoise species. For his commitment to captive breeding the Madagascar angulated tortoise (Geochelone yniphora), McKeown received the AAZPA conservation award. McKeown received zoo awards for being the first to breed Madagascar ploughshare tortoises. He also administered the first long-term breeding program for the <b>Madagascar</b> ground <b>boas.</b>|$|R
50|$|One hundred {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} on the reserve, of which 63 are endemic to Madagascar, including the endangered Madagascan serpent eagle (Eutriorchis astur) and the red owl (Tyto soumagnei), which is a vulnerable species on the IUNC Red List. There are also nineteen species of reptiles and seven species of lemurs: Indri indri, Propithecus, Varecia variegata, Eulemur fulvus, Eulemur rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus and the aye-aye. Among the reptiles, there are nineteen species, including Calumma gallus, Calumma furcifer and the <b>Madagascar</b> tree <b>boa</b> Sanzinia madagascariensis.|$|R
50|$|Mammals {{found in}} this forest include the apex {{predator}} fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the fanaloka (Fossa fossana), northern ring-tailed mongoose and numerous bat species. Lemurs occurring here include the crowned lemur, northern sportive lemur, gray mouse lemur, Sanford's brown lemur and the aye-aye. Numerous geckos inhabit the reserve including the Henkel's leaf-tailed gecko, big-headed gecko and day gecko. Other local reptiles are the <b>Madagascar</b> ground <b>boa,</b> the white-lipped chameleon (Furcifer minor) and Oustalet's chameleon, the world's largest chameleon, which can attain 68 centimetres in length.|$|R
50|$|Reptiles {{at the zoo}} include Aldabra giant tortoise, Amazonian palm viper, American alligator, American {{crocodile}}, Aruba Island rattlesnake, black-breasted leaf turtle, black caiman, dusky pygmy rattlesnake, eastern green mamba, eastern coral snake, eastern diamondback rattlesnake, eastern hognose, Egyptian cobra, eyelash viper, Florida cottonmouth, Florida pine snake, Gila monster, Grand Cayman Island rock iguana, green tree python, jungle carpet python, king cobra, lance-headed rattlesnake, long-nosed viper, <b>Madagascar</b> tree <b>boa,</b> Neuwied's lancehead snake, New Caledonian giant gecko, New Guinea crocodile monitor, prehensile-tailed skink, red rat snake, red spitting cobra, scarlet kingsnake, southern copperhead, tiger viper, timber rattlesnake, and West African mamba.|$|R
50|$|The reserve has an {{impressive}} number of endemic birds with over twenty-three recorded. Altogether there are seventy-three species of birds, twenty species of reptiles and fifteen species of mammals (including six species of lemurs) are known in this reserve, {{as well as}} twenty-four species of reptiles and 194 species of plants. The wetlands are the biggest attraction for birds which include the Madagascan fish eagle (Haliaeetus vociferoides) which is critically endangered and Bernier's teal (Anas bernieri) which is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Reptiles found in the reserve include the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and the <b>Madagascar</b> Ground <b>Boa</b> (Acrantophis madagascariensis).|$|R
40|$|Sanzinia and Acrantophis) MIGUEL VENCES & FRANK GLAW To {{assess the}} phylogeography and genetic {{variation}} of Malagasy boas {{of the genera}} Acrantophis (A. madagascariensis, A. dumerilii) and Sanzinia (S. madagascariensis), we analysed sequences of the 16 S rRNA gene in 12 Sanzinia and seven Acrantophis specimens. We found a surprisingly high differentiation between eastern and western/north-western populations of Sanzinia. This divergence was almost {{twice as high as}} between the two Acrantophis species. In spite of the absence of diagnostic morphological differences between eastern and western Sanzinia, the species status of these two ancient phylogeographic clades is probable, but can not be fully ascertained. We therefore describe the western Sanzinia populations as a new subspecies, based on a holotype specimen from Ankarafantsika forest, and diagnosed by its colour pattern (brown vs. mostly greenish in the nominate subspecies) and genetic differentiation. Unlike two widespread frog species that have a phylogeographically complementary east-west distribution, in Sanzinia the western subspecies reaches the Sambirano region (including Nosy Be) and probably Montagne des Français in northern Madagascar, while the rainforests of southern Madagascar (around Tolagnaro) are populated by the eastern subspecies. The <b>Madagascar</b> <b>boas</b> are widely distributed, relatively abundant and their occurrence is not restricted to pristine natural habitats. The current extent of local exploitation of these boas for food and leather apparently does not really threaten the species. However, the occurrence of the new subspecies seems to be more closely associated with the endangered dry forests of western Madagascar, and its status should therefore be carefully monitored...|$|R
500|$|The most {{significant}} predators {{of the gray}} mouse lemur are the Madagascar long-eared owl and barn owl. [...] Studies conducted in Beza Mahafaly Reserve and Kirindy Mitea National Park indicate a predation rate of around 25% (percent population taken by predators per year), the highest known for any primate species. [...] However, given the species' high reproductive potential, predation {{does not appear to}} have a drastic effect on its populations. [...] Other raptors, such as Henst's goshawk and other owls, also prey upon this species. Snakes, such as Ithycyphus miniatus (a native colubrid snake) and the <b>Madagascar</b> tree <b>boa,</b> as well as mammalian predators, such as the ring-tailed mongoose, narrow-striped mongoose, fossa, and domestic dogs are also known to prey on the gray mouse lemur. [...] Mammalian predators often discover tree holes serving as nests, and enlarge the opening so they can catch and eat the occupant. This puts strong selective pressure on the choice of nest hole opening diameter and deepness.|$|R
50|$|Early 2013 saw {{the opening}} of a new meerkat {{enclosure}} alongside the currently under construction reptile and small mammal building. In late March 2013, a new jungle gym for children to play in was built next door the safari skyride, replacing an exhibit that once held Indian muntjacs, Stanley cranes, and African spurred tortoises. The Indian muntjacs have been moved to a non-public area, the Stanley cranes had moved to the Safari Ride and the African spurred tortoises had moved near the orangutan island. In mid-April 2013, a Baird's tapir and a Ruppell's griffon vulture were added to the zoo, and can be seen in a safari-ride preserve area. A capybara was added to the South America yard in late April 2013. In 2015 phase 1 of the Reptile Building opened to the public to view various reptiles and amphibians, including the Komodo dragon. In August 2016, a new serval exhibit opened adjacent to the bat exhibit. The zoo will have new animals include pygmy hippos and giant anteaters on Summer 2017. On June 26, the reptile house was expanded with a new hallway containing 13 additional exhibits for 15 new species including rhino iguanas, rhino rat snakes, <b>Madagascar</b> tree <b>boas,</b> prehensile-tailed skinks, Dominican mountain boas, veiled chameleons, and emerald tree boas. Later this year, the African clawless otters will move to a new home near the playground, and two new primate islands similar to the existing ones holding chimpanzees and orangutans will be made to be viewed from the Safari Train Ride.|$|R
