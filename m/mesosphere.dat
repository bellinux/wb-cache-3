5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, {{there were few}} new {{insights}} into the nature of noctilucent clouds. Wegener's conjecture, that they were composed of water ice, was later shown to be correct. Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the <b>mesosphere</b> until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed {{for the first time that}} the occurrence of the clouds coincided with very low temperatures in the <b>mesosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the upper <b>mesosphere</b> and thermosphere of Venus are completely different {{from those in the}} lower atmosphere. At altitudes 90–150km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere. The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside <b>mesosphere</b> at the altitudes 90–120km. The temperature of this layer—230K (−43°C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere—100K (−173°C). The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1Δg), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27μm. This radiation from the altitude range 90–100km is often observed from the ground and spacecraft. The nightside upper <b>mesosphere</b> and thermosphere of Venus is also the source of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible for the low temperature of the nightside thermosphere.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mesosphere</b> of Venus {{extends from}} 65km to 120km in height, and the {{thermosphere}} begins at approximately 120km, eventually reaching {{the upper limit}} of the atmosphere (exosphere) at about 220 to 350km. The exosphere is the altitude at which the atmosphere becomes collisionless.|$|E
5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the <b>mesosphere,</b> which would lead to more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds. A complementing theory is that larger methane emissions from intensive farming activities produce more water vapour in the upper atmosphere. Methane concentrations {{have more than doubled}} in the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, flying aboard Atlantis was the GPP payload which {{consisted}} of two experiments – the GPP experiment and the Photogrammetric Appendage Structural Dynamics Experiment (PASDE). The payload was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center's Special Payloads Division. The GPP studied the Earth's thermosphere, ionosphere and <b>mesosphere</b> energetics and dynamics using broadband spectroscopy. GPP also studied spacecraft interactions with the atmosphere by observing shuttle and Mir glow, shuttle engine firings, water dumps and fuel cell purges.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 2007, the AIM {{satellite}} (Aeronomy of Ice in the <b>Mesosphere)</b> was launched. It is {{the first}} satellite dedicated to studying noctilucent clouds, and made its first observations on May 25, 2007. Images taken by the satellite show shapes in the clouds {{that are similar to}} shapes in tropospheric clouds, hinting at similarities in their dynamics.|$|E
5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder <b>mesosphere,</b> which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be a major contributor to the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, <b>mesosphere,</b> and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the <b>Mesosphere</b> {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds were}} first {{detected}} from space by an instrument on the OGO-6 satellite in 1972. The OGO-6 observations {{of a bright}} scattering layer over the polar caps were identified as poleward extensions of these clouds. A later satellite, the Solar <b>Mesosphere</b> Explorer, mapped {{the distribution of the}} clouds between 1981 and 1986 with its ultraviolet spectrometer. The clouds were detected with a lidar in 1995 at Utah State University, even when they were not visible to the naked eye. The first physical confirmation that water ice is indeed the primary component of noctilucent clouds came from the HALOE instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The Venus Express probe {{has shown}} through stellar {{occultation}} that the atmospheric haze extends much further {{up on the}} night side than the day side. On the day side the cloud deck has a thickness of 20km and extends up to about 65km, whereas on the night side the cloud deck {{in the form of}} a thick haze reaches up to 90km in altitude—well into <b>mesosphere,</b> continuing even further to 105km as a more transparent haze. In 2011, the spacecraft discovered that Venus has a thin ozone layer at an altitude of 100km.|$|E
5|$|SvalSat {{is part of}} NASA's Near Earth Network. This {{includes}} {{support for}} the Earth Observing System, which includes satellites such as Aqua, Aura, Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite, and QuikSCAT, {{as well as the}} Small Explorer program which includes Galaxy Evolution Explorer, the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite, Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission, Thermosphere Ionosphere <b>Mesosphere</b> Energetics and Dynamics, Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and Transition Region and Coronal Explorer. SvalSat and Poker Flat are collectively responsible for half of the network's 140 daily passes. Satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration using SvalSat includes the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. Other American satellites include the United States Geological Survey's Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 and the private Iridium Communications' satellites.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mesosphere</b> of Venus can {{be divided}} into two layers: the lower one between 62–73km and the upper one between 73–95km. In the first layer the {{temperature}} is nearly constant at 230K (−43°C). This layer coincides with the upper cloud deck. In the second layer temperature starts to decrease again reaching about 165K (−108°C) at the altitude of 95km, where mesopause begins. It is the coldest part of the Venusian dayside atmosphere. In the dayside mesopause, which serves as a boundary between the mesophere and thermosphere and is located between 95–120km, temperature increases to a constant—about 300–400K (27–127°C)—value prevalent in the thermosphere. In contrast, the nightside Venusian thermosphere is the coldest place on Venus with temperature as low as 100K (−173°C). It is even called a cryosphere.|$|E
25|$|Resolved: The United States federal {{government}} should substantially increase its exploration and/or development of space beyond the <b>Mesosphere.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{homosphere}} and heterosphere: The homosphere {{includes the}} troposphere, stratosphere, and <b>mesosphere.</b> The {{upper part of}} the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.|$|E
25|$|Distribution in the <b>mesosphere</b> {{is similar}} to the {{stratosphere}} except at much higher altitudes. Because of the need for maximum cooling of the water vapor to produce noctilucent clouds, their distribution tends to be restricted to polar regions of Earth. A major seasonal difference is that convective lift from below the <b>mesosphere</b> pushes very scarce water vapor to higher colder altitudes required for cloud formation during the respective summer seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres. Sightings are rare more than 45 degrees south of the north pole or north of the south pole.|$|E
25|$|The {{troposphere}} {{begins at}} the surface and extends up to an altitude of 65 kilometres (an altitude at which the <b>mesosphere</b> has already been reached on Earth). At {{the top of the}} troposphere, temperature and pressure reach Earth-like levels. Winds at the surface are a few metres per second, reaching 70m/s or more in the upper troposphere. The stratosphere and <b>mesosphere</b> extend from 65km to 95km in height. The thermosphere and exosphere begin at around 95 kilometres, eventually reaching the limit of the atmosphere at about 220 to 250km.|$|E
25|$|Two cirriform {{clouds that}} form higher {{up in the}} {{stratosphere}} and <b>mesosphere</b> have common names for their main types. They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth. Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the Solar System and beyond. However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as methane, ammonia, and sulfuric acid as well as water.|$|E
25|$|Pressure varies {{smoothly}} {{from the}} Earth's surface {{to the top}} of the <b>mesosphere.</b> Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. One can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude. Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure, and it is necessary to know these to compute an accurate figure. The graph at right was developed for a temperature of 15°C and a relative humidity of 0%.|$|E
25|$|At high altitudes, {{primarily}} {{above the}} <b>mesosphere,</b> {{there is enough}} UV radiation from the sun of very short wavelength to cause ionization. When the ions collide with electrically neutral particles they recombine and emit photons in the process, causing airglow. The degree of ionization is sufficiently large to allow a constant emission of radiation even during the night when the upper atmosphere is in the Earth's shadow. Lower in the atmosphere all of the solar photons with energies above the ionization potential of N2 and O2 have already been absorbed by the higher layers and thus no appreciable ionization occurs.|$|E
500|$|As the <b>mesosphere</b> {{contains}} {{very little}} moisture, approximately one hundred millionth that of {{air from the}} Sahara desert, and is extremely thin, the ice crystals can form only at temperatures below about [...] This means that noctilucent clouds form predominantly during summer when, counterintuitively, the <b>mesosphere</b> is coldest, therefore they can't be observed (even if they are present) inside the Polar circles because the Sun is never low enough under the horizon at this season at these latitudes. Noctilucent clouds form mostly near the polar regions, because the <b>mesosphere</b> is coldest there. Clouds in the southern hemisphere are about [...] higher {{than those in the}} northern hemisphere.|$|E
500|$|Odd {{structures}} {{known as}} polar vortices lie within the cold polar collars. They are giant hurricane-like storms four {{times larger than}} their terrestrial analogs. Each vortex has two [...] "eyes"—the centres of rotation, which are connected by distinct S-shaped cloud structures. Such double eyed structures are also called polar dipoles. Vortices rotate with the period of about 3 days {{in the direction of}} general super-rotation of the atmosphere. The linear wind speeds are 35–50m/s near their outer edges and zero at the poles. The temperature at the cloud-tops in the each polar vortex is much higher than in the nearby polar collars reaching 250K (−23°C). The conventional interpretation of the polar vortices is that they are anticyclones with downwelling in the centre and upwelling in the cold polar collars. This type of circulation resembles a winter polar anticyclonic vortex on Earth, especially the one found over Antarctica. The observations in the various infrared atmospheric windows indicate that the anticyclonic circulation observed near the poles penetrates as deep as to 50km altitude, i.e. {{to the base of the}} clouds. The polar upper troposphere and <b>mesosphere</b> are extremely dynamic; large bright clouds may appear and disappear over the space of a few hours. One such event was observed by Venus Express between 9 and 13 January 2007, when the south polar region became brighter by 30%. This event was probably caused by an injection of sulfur dioxide into the <b>mesosphere,</b> which then condensed forming a bright haze. The two eyes in the vortices have yet to be explained.|$|E
500|$|They are {{the highest}} clouds in Earth's atmosphere, located in the <b>mesosphere</b> at altitudes of around [...] They are too faint to be seen during daylight, and are visible only when {{illuminated}} by sunlight from below the horizon while the lower layers of the atmosphere are in the Earth's shadow. Noctilucent clouds are not fully understood and are a recently discovered meteorological phenomenon; there is no confirmed record of their observation before 1885, although {{they may have been}} observed a few decades earlier by Thomas Romney Robinson in Armagh. [...] Doubts now surround Robinson's out-of-season records, following observations, from several points around high northern latitudes, of NLC-like phenomena following the Chelyabinsk bolide entry in February 2013 (outside the NLC season) that were in fact stratospheric dust reflections visible after sunset.|$|E
500|$|The {{altitude}} of the troposphere most similar to Earth {{is near the}} tropopause—the boundary between troposphere and <b>mesosphere.</b> It is located slightly above 50km. According to measurements by the Magellan and Venus Express probes, the altitude from 52.5 to 54km has a temperature between 293K (20°C) and 310K (37°C), and the altitude at 49.5km above the surface is where the pressure becomes the same as Earth at sea level. As manned ships sent to Venus {{would be able to}} compensate for differences in temperature to a certain extent, anywhere from about 50 to 54km or so above the surface would be the easiest altitude in which to base an exploration or colony, where the temperature would be in the crucial [...] "liquid water" [...] range of 273K (0°C) to 323K (50°C) and the air pressure the same as habitable regions of Earth. As CO2 is heavier than air, the colony's air (nitrogen and oxygen) could keep the structure floating at that altitude like a dirigible.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} very surface layers, the {{atmosphere}} {{is in a state}} of vigorous circulation. The upper layer of troposphere exhibits a phenomenon of super-rotation, in which the atmosphere circles the planet in just four Earth days, much faster than the planet's sidereal day of 243 days. The winds supporting super-rotation blow at a speed of 100m/s (~360km/h or 220mph) or more. [...] Winds move at up to 60 times the speed of the planet's rotation, while Earth's fastest winds are only 10% to 20% rotation speed. On the other hand, the wind speed becomes increasingly slower as the elevation from the surface decreases, with the breeze barely reaching the speed of 10km/h (2.8m/s) on the surface. Near the poles are anticyclonic structures called polar vortices. Each vortex is double-eyed and shows a characteristic S-shaped pattern of clouds. Above there is an intermediate layer of <b>mesosphere</b> which separates the troposphere from the thermosphere. The thermosphere is also characterized by strong circulation, but very different in its nature - the gases heated and partially ionized by sunlight in the sunlit hemisphere migrate to the dark hemisphere where they recombine and downwell.|$|E

From ground level, they can occasionally be seen illuminated by the sun during deep twilight. Ongoing research indicates that convective lift in the <b>mesosphere</b> is strong enough during the polar summer to cause adiabatic cooling of small amount of water vapour to the point of saturation. This tends to produce the coldest temperatures in the entire atmosphere just below the mesopause. These conditions result in the best environment for the formation of polar mesospheric clouds. [...] There is also evidence that smoke particles from burnt-up meteors provide much of the condensation nuclei required for the formation of noctilucent cloud.|$|E
2500|$|The Uranian {{atmosphere}} can {{be divided}} into three main layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of −300 and 50km and pressures from 100 to 0.1bar; the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between 50 and 4000km and pressures between [...] and the thermosphere/exosphere extending from 4000km to as high as a few Uranus radii from the surface.

2500|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Michael J.

In a plasma, the negative free electrons and the positive ions are attracted to each other by the electrostatic force, but they are too energetic to stay fixed together in an electrically neutral molecule.|$|E
