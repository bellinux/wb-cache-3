25|$|Systematic use {{of child}} labour was common {{place in the}} colonies of European powers between 1650 and 1950. In Africa, colonial administrators {{encouraged}} traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. <b>Millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries. Sophisticated schemes were promulgated where children in these colonies {{between the ages of}} 5–14 were hired as an apprentice without pay in exchange for learning a craft. A system of Pauper Apprenticeship came into practice in the 19th century where the colonial master neither needed the native parents' nor child's approval to assign a child to labour, away from parents, at a distant farm owned by a different colonial master. Other schemes included 'earn-and-learn' programs where children would work and thereby learn. Britain for example passed a law, the so-called Masters and Servants Act of 1899, followed by Tax and Pass Law, to encourage child labour in colonies particularly in Africa. These laws offered the native people the legal ownership to some of the native land in exchange for making labour of wife and children available to colonial government's needs such as in farms and as picannins.|$|E

25|$|While {{most of the}} Millennium Development Goals face a {{deadline}} of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, {{it will be impossible}} to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability. <b>Millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and women will continue to die needlessly, thus placing the rest of the development agenda at risk. It is extremely important that girls have access to an education. For every additional year girls go to school, they receive 20 percent higher wages and suffer 10 percent fewer child deaths. Women with some formal education are more likely to seek medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children’s nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be healthier and better nourished. According to The International Center for Research on Women, the education that a girl receives is the strongest predictor of the age she will marry and is a critical factor in reducing the prevalence of child marriage. The World Bank estimates that an additional year of schooling for 1,000 women helps prevent two maternal deaths. Also, each additional year of formal education that a mother completes translates to her children staying in school an additional one-third to one-half of a year.|$|E

Even though {{he had not seen}} the episode himself, he commented that [...] "at a time when the public mood is overwhelmingly against gay marriage, any show that promotes gay marriage is deliberately bucking the public mood." [...] A researcher for the American Family Association, named Ed Vitagliano, claimed the presentation of same-sex marriage in the episode was [...] "very one-sided". He said that this episode proved [...] "Hollywood's blatant pro-homosexual bias" [...] because despite The Simpsons being [...] "generally kind of a wacky animated program" [...] it was not neutral on the issue. Bozell also worried about the influence the episode would have on children, despite the parental discretion advisory at the beginning, commenting: [...] "You've got a show watched by <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> Do children need to have gay marriage thrust in their faces as an issue? Why can't we just entertain them?"

500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world.

There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame.
