5|$|Frontier {{physician}} Andrew Taylor Still, M.D., DO, {{founded the}} American School of Osteopathy (now the A.T. Still University-Kirksville (Mo.) College of Osteopathic Medicine) in Kirksville, MO, in 1892 as a radical {{protest against the}} turn-of-the-century <b>medical</b> <b>system.</b> A. T. Still believed that the conventional <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease. He founded osteopathic medicine in rural Missouri {{at a time when}} medications, surgery, and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm than good. Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic, castor oil, whiskey, and opium. In addition, unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in more deaths than cures.|$|E

Positron acquired DoseShield Corporation, a developer and manufacturer of automated radiopharmaceutical technology/systems in 2008. In 2009, Positron and its partner Neusoft <b>Medical</b> <b>Systems</b> received FDA approval to sell and distribute their Attrius PET system.|$|R
5|$|Emergency {{medicine}} is a specialty that was first {{developed in the}} United States in the 1960s. For the United States, {{the high number of}} traffic and other accident fatalities in the 1960s spurred a white paper from the National Academy of Sciences; it exposed the inadequacy of the current emergency <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> and led to the establishment of modern emergency medical services. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore followed shortly thereafter, developing their respective emergency medicine systems in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|For instance, a 2008 {{study of}} medical systems in Zambia {{published}} by the International Anesthesia Research Society found that only 50 percent of hospitals had an emergency <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> that transported patients. Just 24 percent of ambulances carried oxygen, with only 40 percent carrying drugs of any kind. Furthermore, only 29 intensive care beds were available {{in all of the}} hospitals surveyed, and these were only found in major hospitals. This implies that the majority of critically ill patients are receiving care in general hospital wards.|$|E

In 1977, Tydings called for the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland to divest its endowment from companies doing business with the apartheid regime in South Africa. He later served as a member of Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland from 2000 to 2005. In September 2008, he was appointed by Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley to the board of the University of Maryland <b>Medical</b> <b>System.</b> As of 2016, he resides in Harford County, Maryland.|$|E

40|$|Questions {{have been}} raised about the {{validity}} of labels such as 'western', 'alternative', and 'traditional' as applied to <b>medical</b> <b>systems.</b> This study shows that the rubric 'traditional' may be validly applied to clusters of <b>medical</b> <b>systems</b> sharing common elements that distinguish them from 'western' systems. At the same time, pluralism in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures must be recognized even within each system. The discussion in this paper analyzes explanatory models, drawing mainly from Asian examples and focussing on pharmaceuticals. A purely cognitive approach may however be insufficient in understanding the different <b>medical</b> <b>systems.</b> A review of socio-historical factors that influence <b>medical</b> <b>systems</b> highlights important processes such as cultural reinterpretation and indigenization that characterize what could be more appropriately described as transitional <b>medical</b> <b>systems.</b> Changes in cultural forms, such as the acceptance of western pharmaceuticals, may still rely on traditional cognitive frames of reference, suggesting eclecticism amid conservatism. Issues of theoretical and practical concern are outlined {{at the end of the}} article. traditional <b>medical</b> <b>systems</b> <b>medical</b> diagnosis pharmaceuticals culture change...|$|R

5|$|In more {{advanced}} developing countries, establishing ambulance transport systems is more feasible, but still requires considerable expertise and planning. Prior to 2004, Pakistan {{did not have}} an organized emergency <b>medical</b> <b>system.</b> In that year, Rescue 1122 was launched as a professional pre-hospital emergency service, and it has managed to achieve an average response time of 7 minutes, comparable to that of developed nations. Some of the critical factors in its success included local manufacture of vehicles, training instructors to certify emergency medical technicians, adopting training materials to the local context, and branching out to include fire and rescue service response under a united command structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dwarf Fortress is anatomically detailed. Combat is {{displayed}} by viewing the log which describes each weapon striking a specific {{part of the}} character's body. Internal organs can get punctured, combatants can fall to the ground, vomit and lose body parts. Each dwarf has individually detailed limbs, each with damageable bone, fat, muscle and skin. Fat can be bruised without breaking bones and vice versa. Injuries sometimes can be permanent. There is a <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> where a hospital {{can be set up}} containing crutches for disabled dwarves, traction benches, plasters and cloth for casts and bandages, thread for suturing, and splints.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Allison, FEMA opened six {{disaster}} recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. After the extensive damage to Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a temporary hospital at the Houston Police Academy. The team of 87medical personnel served over 1,000patients within two weeks of Allison's passage. Similarly, the National Disaster <b>Medical</b> <b>System</b> deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people. Debris removal, which was initially slow, was aided by FEMA to expedite the removal process. FEMA provided 75% of the federal cost of the removal. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses.|$|E
40|$|The on-demand approach, where {{systems are}} {{assembled}} from components by lay users, has seen {{success in the}} consumer electronics industry. Currently, there is growing demand for on-demand capabilities in <b>medical</b> <b>systems</b> so caregivers can create larger <b>medical</b> <b>systems</b> from smaller <b>medical</b> devices. Unlike consumer electronics, <b>medical</b> <b>systems</b> pose challenges for the on-demand approach due to attributes such as device complexity, device variability and safety requirements. In this paper, we propose a formal specification language for on-demand (<b>medical)</b> <b>systems.</b> Our approach {{is based on the}} formalism of Modal I/O Automata, which allows system designers to express complex device requirements and can be used to reason about safety and liveness properties of on-demand <b>medical</b> <b>systems</b> directly from their specifications. We illustrate the applicability of our approach through a case study of a closed-loop patient controlled analgesia system...|$|R

After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. By six months after the storm, around 120,000 Texas citizens applied for federal disaster aid, totaling to $1.05billion (2001USD, $1.36billion 2012USD).|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the <b>Medical</b> <b>System,</b> hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister {{recognized}} that the modernization of Madagascar and its system of state administration could strengthen the country against invasion by a Western power and directed his energy to this end. In 1877, he outlawed the enslavement of the Makoa community. Rainilaiarivony expanded the public education system, declaring school attendance mandatory in 1881 and forming a cadre of school inspectors the following year to ensure education quality. The island's first pharmacy was established by LMS missionaries in 1862, and the first hospital was inaugurated in Antananarivo three years later, followed by the launching in 1875 of a state <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> staffed by civil servant clinicians. Rainilaiarivony enacted a series of new legal codes {{over the course of}} his administration that sought to create a more humane social order. The number of capital offenses was reduced from eighteen to thirteen, and he put an end to the tradition of collective family punishment for the crimes of one individual. Fines were fixed for specific offenses and corporal punishment was limited to being locked in irons. The structure of legal administration was reorganized so that matters that exceeded the authority of the traditional community courts at the level of the fokonolona village collective, administered by local magistrates and village heads, would be referred to the three high courts established in the capital in 1876, although final judicial authority remained with Rainilaiarivony. The Code of 305 Laws established that same year would form the basis of the legal system applied in Madagascar for the remainder of the 19th century and throughout much of the colonial period. To strengthen rule of law, the Prime Minister introduced a rural police force, modernized the court system and eliminated certain unjust privileges that had disproportionately benefited the noble class.|$|E

25|$|While allopathic {{medicine}} {{has followed the}} development of society, osteopathic medicine is a more recent development. The first MD school in the United States opened in 1807 in New York. In 1845, the American Medical Association was formed, and standards were put into place, with a three year program including lectures, dissection, and hospital experience. In 1892, frontier physician Andrew Taylor Still founded the American School of Osteopathy in Kirksville, MO as a protest against the present <b>medical</b> <b>system.</b> A. T. Still believed that the conventional <b>medical</b> <b>system</b> lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease. Throughout the 1900s, DOs fought to gain practice rights and government recognition.

40|$|Challenges to {{dependable}} {{design of}} <b>medical</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Medical</b> software-based <b>systems</b> represent an important class of embedded systems. Along {{with many other}} classes of safety-critical embedded systems, such as avionics and automotive controllers, manufacturing, and mobile communication <b>systems,</b> <b>medical</b> <b>systems</b> are facing a number of challenges to their design process. There are two major factors that complicate the design and implementation of softwarebased <b>medical</b> <b>systems.</b> First, the software complexity of <b>medical</b> <b>systems</b> has been increasing steadily as microprocessors become more powerful and demands on them grow along with the expectations of their capabilities. To mitigate the development cost of software, embedded systems are being designed to flexibly adapt to different environments. The requirements for increased functionality and adaptability make the development of embedded software complex and error-prone. Second, medical devices, like all other kinds of embedded systems are increasingly networked to improve functionality, reliability and maintainability. Networking makes embedded software {{even more difficult to}} develop, since composition and abstraction principles are poorly understood...|$|R
