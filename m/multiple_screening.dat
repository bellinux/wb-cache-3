50|$|There is no {{agreement}} within {{the legal and}} mental health fields whether an individual can be acquitted due to a diagnosis of DID. It {{has been argued that}} any individual with DID is a single person with a serious mental illness and therefore exhibits diminished responsibility and this was first recognized in an American court in 1978 (State v. Milligan). However, public reaction to the result of the case was strongly negative and since that time the few cases claiming insanity have found that the altered consciousness found in DID is either irrelevant or the diagnosis was not admissible evidence. The self-reported nature of the symptoms used to reach a diagnosis makes it difficult to determine their credibility, although objective measuring of brain activation and structural patterns are a promising direction for future scientific research into distinguishing malingered from genuine DID in forensic settings. Forensic experts called on to conduct forensic examinations for DID must use a multidisciplinary approach including <b>multiple</b> <b>screening</b> instruments.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{effects of}} using <b>multiple</b> <b>screens</b> at once on energy intake (EI) are unknown. This study {{compared}} EI of participants {{with access to}} <b>multiple</b> <b>screens</b> (television + iPad + smartphone) versus a single screen (television). METHODS: A laboratory-based, randomized, two-arm parallel (multi-screen vs. single-screen) trial was conducted in 78 adolescents (ages, 13 - 18 years). Food and drink were available during a 1 -hour exposure period. Total EI was the primary outcome. Linear regression {{analyses were conducted to}} test the treatment difference, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and appetite at baseline. RESULTS: Total EI did not differ significantly between the two groups (multi-screen, 758 kcal [standard error = 75] vs. single-screen, 681 kcal [standard error = 75]; difference, + 77 kcal; 95 % confidence interval, - 166 to + 320).

40|$|Abstract Background Given the {{increasing}} burden on colonoscopy capacity, {{it has been}} suggested that faecal immunochemical test (FIT) results could guide surveillance colonoscopy intervals. Against this background, we have evaluated the test accuracy of single and double FIT sampling to detect colorectal cancer (CRC) and/or advanced adenomas in an asymptomatic colonoscopy-controlled high-risk population. Methods Cohort study of asymptomatic high-risk patients (personal history of adenomas/CRC or family history of CRC), who provided one or two FITs before elective colonoscopy. Test accuracy of FIT for detection of CRC and advanced adenomas was determined (cut-off level 50 [*]ng/ml). Results 1, 041 patients provided a FIT (516 personal history of adenomas, 172 personal history of CRC and 353 family history of CRC). Five CRCs (0. 5 %) and 101 advanced adenomas (9. 7 %) were detected by colonoscopy. Single FIT sampling resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for CRC of 80 %, 89 %, 3 % and 99. 9 %, respectively, and for advanced adenoma of 28 %, 91 %, 24 % and 92 %, respectively. Double FIT sampling did not result in a significantly higher sensitivity for advanced neoplasia. Simulation of <b>multiple</b> <b>screening</b> rounds indicated that sensitivity of FIT for advanced adenoma could reach 81 % after 5 screening rounds. Conclusions In once-only FIT sampling before surveillance colonoscopy, 70 % of advanced neoplasia were missed. A simulation approach indicates that <b>multiple</b> <b>screening</b> rounds may be more promising in detecting advanced neoplasia and could potentially alleviate endoscopic burden. </p...|$|E

40|$|IN {{the last}} 20 years medical {{and public health}} {{authorities}} have recognized cardiovascular disease as an increasing problem, the control of which re-quires both organized community and individual action. Ten million persons in the United States are estimated to have cardio-vascular disease, which causes {{one out of every}} two deaths. 1 Patients with these long-term diseases lose many workdays and have much permanent disability. These facts increase the importance of cardiovascular disease as a community problem. Statistics for this group of diseases are based on the incidence and prevalence of diagnosed cases. However, some apparently well persons can have early cardiovascular disease, just as they have diabetes and pul-monary tuberculosis. Only small numbers of them visit their physicians for routine examinations. Some cardiovascular disease will therefore pro-gress undetected to a later stage at which medical care is less effective. <b>Multiple</b> <b>screening</b> may help in early detection. Screening tests are procedures that sort out persons who probably have abnormalities from those who probably do not. 2 <b>Multiple</b> <b>screening</b> is the simultaneous use of two or more screening tests. Persons with positive tests are referred to their physicians for diagnosis and treatment if necessary. Effective mul-tiple screening allows physicians to concentrate their "routine " physical examinations on persons (with abnormal screening tests) who {{are more likely to have}} cardiovascular disease than do other asymptomatic persons. This paper will discuss some problems in screening for cardiovascular disease, and will briefly present the results of four screening tests used i...|$|E
