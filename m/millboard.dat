5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on <b>millboard</b> by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man and a white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, {{it is likely that}} it was painted over a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{generally}} finished life studies {{during three}} evenings sittings. On the first evening he would sketch {{the model in}} charcoal or chalk, and then ink in the outline. On the second he used oil paints {{to fill in the}} figures. On the third he layered glaze and the final coverings of paint. He usually painted on <b>millboard,</b> re-using the reverse for fresh paintings. His female models were typically shop-girls, prostitutes, actresses or poses plastiques models, while his male models tended to be Life Guards recruited from the nearby barracks, who he thought to have an appropriate muscular physique, or occasionally men Etty met in public bath houses.|$|E

500|$|The Wrestlers {{is thought}} to have been painted in around 1840. It is likely that it was {{executed}} at the Royal Academy's life class; despite his senior status, Etty continued to attend there throughout his life. While students at the class usually worked from a single model, Etty would occasionally arrange for [...] "a Treat", in which a group of models would be used to create an entire composition for the students to sketch (often arranged in poses derived from Old Master paintings). Painted on <b>millboard,</b> The Wrestlers was probably executed over the course of three evenings. On the first evening Etty would have drawn the models in chalk or charcoal and inked the outline; on the second evening the figures would have been painted in oil paint, and on the third evening a thin glaze would have been applied to the painting to which colour would then have been added.|$|E
500|$|The {{accident}} {{contributed to}} the Royal Navy changing to breech-loading guns, which could be more conveniently worked from inside the turrets. The fragments of the destroyed gun were re-assembled and displayed {{to the public at}} the Woolwich Arsenal. The committee of inquiry decided that the gun had been double-loaded, but this view was widely questioned, including by Sir William Palliser, designer of the Palliser shell used by these guns. Palliser's view instead was that the shot had been obstructed by a portion of the <b>millboard</b> disc rammed above the shell. Hydraulic power-ramming was thought to be implicated in the double loading as the telescopic hydraulic rammer had not made the double loading obvious, as a manual ramrod would have done. One piece of evidence supporting the double loading theory was the presence of an additional stud torn from a Palliser shell, found amongst the wreckage within the turret. Thunderer was then regarded as an unlucky ship and was placed in reserve at Malta in 1881 and had her machinery [...] Her armament was augmented with a pair of [...] torpedo launchers and a half-dozen 1-inch (25mm) Nordenfelt guns on the hurricane deck. She was recommissioned in 1885 and remained with the Mediterranean Fleet until she was paid off at Chatham Dockyard. The future King George V served aboard Thunderer in 1885–86.|$|E

It comprises mainly the creation of rock-cut products, candles, metallic and clay utensils, screw-rings and screw-hooks and paper-based products. Among these, the manufacturing of paper-based products is the bandwagon of these activities for which Kunnamkulam has a unique place in the state. The different paper-based products include, exercise books, X’mas stars, greetings card, paper files, envelopes, cartons and <b>millboards.</b> Printing and binding are the related activities.|$|R
6000|$|Much of the matter, {{including}} a small MS. volume of those brief verses called Limericks (personal always, generally actionable, and frequently lacking in refinement), I set aside {{at an early}} date. Much else also I rejected as too disjointed and unfinished, or too eccentric. Two bizarre fragments called respectively [...] "Jane in Heaven" [...] and [...] "An Account of a Play," [...] I may perhaps find occasion to issue at a later date, and there were also several brief imitations of Villiers de l'Isle Adam quite alien to contemporary Anglo-Saxon taste, which also I hold over. Sometimes upon separate sheets, sometimes {{in the margins of}} other compositions, and frequently at the end of letters received by him I found a curious abundance of queer little drawings, caricatures of his correspondents, burlesque renderings of occurrences, disrespectful sidenotes to grave and pregnant utterances, and the like. If ever the correspondence of George Boon is published, {{it will have to be}} done in fac-simile. There is a considerable number of impressions of the back of Miss Bathwick's head, with and without the thread of velvet she sometimes wore about her neck, and quite a number of curiously idealized studies of that American reading public he would always so grotesquely and annoyingly insist on calling [...] "Her." [...] And among other things I found a rendering of myself as a short, flattened little object that has a touch of malignity in it I had no reason to expect. Few or none of these quaint comments are drawn with Indian ink upon <b>millboard</b> in a manner suitable for reproduction, and even were they so, I doubt whether the public would care for very many of them. (I give my own portrait--it is singularly unlike me--to show the style of thing he did.) ...|$|E

50|$|Engineered wood {{products}} can be stronger than hardwood because layering methods increase the strength. They are sometimes used just at critical stress areas when maximum strength is needed. Modern furniture making, however, tends {{to rely upon}} a combination of engineered woods and solid woods in frame making. Engineered {{wood products}} commonly used in furniture making include plywood, hardboard, <b>millboard,</b> chipboard, and medium-density fiberboard. Upholstery itself is often applied with staples, and so metal frames will typically have a plywood panel inserted into them as a backer for the upholstery and to allow these staples to be pinned into it.|$|E
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} the tragic roles in which she then specialised, Rachel is not shown looking at the artist, but glancing anxiously {{out of the picture}} with moist eyes. The {{painting}} appears to be unfinished, suggesting that it was painted in a single sitting and Etty did not have the opportunity to have Rachel pose again. Despite this, Etty's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr has described it as a work [...] "of extreme sensitivity and perception". The painting is painted on <b>millboard,</b> and has an oil sketch by Etty of a crouching nude woman on the reverse side.|$|E

50|$|Portrait of Mlle Rachel is an oil {{painting}} on <b>millboard</b> by English artist William Etty, painted during the 1840s and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It shows the tragic actress Élisa Rachel Félix, better known as Mademoiselle Rachel, at the time {{one of the most}} acclaimed actresses in France. The subject is not shown looking at the artist, but glancing anxiously out of the picture with tears in her eyes. The work was probably painted during one of Rachel's tours of London in the 1840s. It appears unfinished, suggesting that it was painted in a single sitting and Rachel did not return to give Etty the opportunity to complete it.|$|E
50|$|William Blake {{developed}} a different technique, painting on <b>millboard</b> in egg tempera to produce both new works and coloured impressions of his prints and book illustrations, including his Pity. Each impression was usually then worked over by hand, using ink and watercolour. Few other artists used the technique until Degas, who made several, often working on them further after printing (Beside the Sea, 1876-7); Pissarro also made several. Paul Gauguin used a variant technique involving tracing, later {{taken up by}} Paul Klee. In the twentieth century the technique became more popular, such as the extraordinary colorful monotypes created by Marc Chagall in the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|Keasbey and Mattison did {{extensive}} research and product development. By 1896, the plant included areas to produce roofing tiles, papers, pipe coverings, and the nation's first asbestos textile plant. By 1897, they were producing asbestos paper and <b>millboard</b> for electrical insulation and welding shields. As of 1905, {{they began to}} use the Hatschek process for manufacturing asbestos cement roofing shingles, which they sold under the name [...] "Century Asbestos Slate". They even released advertising postcards, showing elegant buildings that used the new materials. By 1906, they were treating lumber with asbestos. By 1909, they were making asbestos brake linings for automobiles and railway trains.|$|E
50|$|Frays River is a semi-canalised short {{river in}} England that {{branches}} off the River Colne at Uxbridge Moor and rejoins it at West Drayton. The river {{is believed to}} be a man-made diversion of waters from the River Colne to feed watermills around Uxbridge. The name is originates from John Fray who owned Cowley Hall beside the river in the fifteenth century. Other names for the river are the Uxbridge and Cowley Mill Stream, the Cowley Stream or the Colham Mill Stream. In the 17th century the river powered five mills. Drayton Mill at West Drayton was mentioned in Domesday Book and was used for flour milling, paper-making and the manufacture of <b>millboard.</b> It ceased operation in about 1923.|$|E
5000|$|Nebuchadnezzar {{was part}} of the {{so-called}} Large Colour Prints; a series begun in 1795 of twelve 43 cm x 53 cm colour monotype prints, of most of which three copies were made. These were painted on <b>millboard,</b> [...] after which the board was put through Blake's printing-press with a sheet of dampened paper to make the prints. After they were printed, Blake and his wife Catherine added ink and watercolour to the impressions. It existed in four impressions (copies), now in: Tate Britain in London, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and a fourth which has been missing since 1887. [...] Blake believed that Nebuchadnezzar was connected to the Christian apocalypse and to his personal view on the stages of human development.|$|E

Visual analysis of his paintings focuses on his aesthetic goals {{within the context of}} the French Barbizon School as well as within the American landscape tradition during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. This paper explores the development of Minor???s style and iconography throughout his artistic career and the stylistic influences of Souvenir of Italy are examined {{within the context of the}} Barbizon and Tonalist Schools. Minor???s materials and painting technique are compared to those of Corot and D??az, whose paintings influenced Minor???s works. Minor???s materials in Souvenir of Italy have been analyzed through the techniques of X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Infrared reflectography (IRR), X-radiography, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and cross-sectional analysis. Minor???s materials and painting technique contribute to the present condition and possible future degradation of his paintings. This study has informed the treatment of Souvenir of Italy and helped in an understanding of how the appearance of the painting has altered. Art Conservatio...|$|E
