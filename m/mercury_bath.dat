50|$|In 1811 the ban {{on working}} girls was lifted. In this Napoleonic period, French {{soldiers}} were the main customers of prostitutes in De Wallen. Regulation was brought in and there were compulsory health checks to protect soldiers from venereal diseases. They were given a red card which was a permit to work. If found to be infected the card was taken until they could prove they were disease free again. Because there was no reliable treatment for syphilis until the early 20th century this could mean dangerous treatments such as <b>mercury</b> <b>baths</b> to ease symptoms.|$|R

60|$|He {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the <b>mercury</b> <b>bath,</b> and found on examination that the surface of the mercury was almost always covered with a very fine dust. He found that even the mercury itself was positively full of organic matters; that from being constantly exposed to the air, it had collected an immense number of these infusorial organisms from the air. Well, under these circumstances he felt that the case was quite clear, and that the mercury was not what it had appeared to M. Schwann to be,--a bar to the admission of these organisms; but that, in reality, it acted as a reservoir from which the infusion was immediately supplied with the large quantity that had so puzzled him.|$|E
60|$|Some {{few years}} after this, the {{question}} began to be very hotly discussed in France. There was M. Pouchet, a professor at Rouen, a very learned man, but certainly not a very rigid experimentalist. He published a number of experiments of his own, {{some of which were}} very ingenious, to show that if you went to work in a proper way, there was a truth in the doctrine of spontaneous generation. Well, {{it was one of the}} most fortunate things in the world that M. Pouchet took up this question, because it induced a distinguished French chemist, M. Pasteur, to take up the question on the other side; and he has certainly worked it out in the most perfect manner. I am glad to say, too, that he has published his researches in time to enable me to give you an account of them. He verified all the experiments which I have just mentioned to you--and then finding those extraordinary anomalies, as in the case of the <b>mercury</b> <b>bath</b> and the milk, he set himself to work to discover their nature. In the case of milk he found it to be a question of temperature. Milk in a fresh state is slightly alkaline; and it is a very curious circumstance, but this very slight degree of alkalinity seems to have the effect of preserving the organisms which fall into it from the air from being destroyed at a temperature of 212 degrees, which is the boiling point. But if you raise the temperature 10 degrees when you boil it, the milk behaves like everything else; and if the air with which it comes in contact, after being boiled at this temperature, is passed through a red-hot tube, you will not get a trace of organisms.|$|E

5000|$|A {{key figure}} in the early spread of moral {{treatment}} in the United States was Benjamin Rush (1745-1813), an eminent physician at Pennsylvania Hospital. He limited his practice to mental illness and developed innovative, humane approaches to treatment. He required that the hospital hire intelligent and sensitive attendants {{to work closely with}} patients, reading and talking to them and taking them on regular walks. He also suggested that it would be therapeutic for doctors to give small gifts to their patients every so often. However, Rush's treatment methods included bloodletting (bleeding), purging, hot and cold <b>baths,</b> <b>mercury,</b> and strapping patients to spinning boards and [...] "tranquilizer" [...] chairs.|$|R

2500|$|Work on {{the tower}} began in May 1915. An iron {{structure}} was deemed unsuitable {{due to the}} tropical conditions, and the local ironstone was not suitable for concrete, so materials had to be shipped from Melbourne. However, landing conditions at the site meant the closest location for landing the materials was about [...] to the east, at Christies Bay. A jetty and a tramway were constructed, and the materials were drawn by horses from the landing location. The climate and the grade meant only two round trips could be made each day, and in addition construction could only be carried out on the dry season, from April to November. As a result, construction took three years, completing in June 1917. Though the lantern was installed and ready to be lit, an earthquake hit the tower in August 1917. Though the structure was not damaged, [...] of mercury were lost from the <b>mercury</b> bearing pedestal <b>bath.</b> The lighthouse was finally officially lit on 15 September 1917.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is made of}} {{cast iron}} and consists of nine segments. At {{the foot of the}} tower is one house for the supervisor and four more for the lighthouse keeper. The original light rotated in a <b>mercury</b> <b>bath,</b> which was replaced in the 1960s by an electrical system.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 October 1911, {{the fire}} was put in a <b>mercury</b> <b>bath</b> and changed its characteristic, having since been a {{flashing}} light every 15 seconds. It assumed its present appearance in June 1963: a white-painted tower marked [...] "SAINT-MATHIEU" [...] in red, with a red stripe at the top.|$|E
5000|$|The tower {{original}} {{light source}} was a 55-millimetre (2.2 in) vapourised kerosene incandescent mantle, with an intensity of 150,000 cd and a visible range of [...] The original lens was a Chance Brothers 3rd order 500-millimetre (20 in) dioptric fresnel lens.

40|$|Weight {{of mercury}} in {{electrolytic}} cell of soda industry is usually measured gravimetrically, which is typical labor work in character. Error {{sources of the}} gravimetric method might {{have come from the}} fact that some mercury’s are usually trapped in the cell due to complicated structure of electrolytic cell. This cause unknown errors. In addition, formation of amalgam at the cathode may cause a further uncertainty in the measurement. Total error from gravimetric method is 4 % on average. Radiotracer dilution method provides advantages either for simplification of procedure and reduction of measurement error. In this experiment radioisotope mercury 203 Hg, which was prepared in nuclear reactor was used to examine 13 of 14 electrolytic cells of soda plant. Each electrolytic cell was designed containing approximately 700 kg inactive mercury. Before injection, the radioisotope mercury was mixed with non radioisotope <b>mercury</b> in a <b>bath</b> to obtain a suitable injection aliquots and standard references. Calibration curve, which was derived from two stage dilution processes taken from standard references, was used to examine degree of mixing between radioisotope and non radioisotope mercury and it was also used in weight calculation of non radioisotope mercury in electrolytic cell. Injection was carried out simply by pouring the injection aliquots into the flowing mercury at the inlet side of the cell. Mercury samples from the cells were extracted at regular time intervals and filled into vials for counting. This was done for the primary conformation of the completeness of mixing of the tracer with the non radioisotope mercury in each cell. When complete mixing is achieved, the unknown quantity of mercury in each cell was calculated based on mass balance principle. From the calculation the weight of mercury in each electrolytic cell was not the same and maximum error of measurement obtained from this method is 2. 48 %. Compared to gravimetrically error mentioned above, it was clear that radiotracer dilution method gives better result in terms of higher accuracy and simpler procedure in measurement of the weight of mercury in electrolytic cells. Above all, this method is very suitable to be implemented in soda industry...|$|R

The nanodrill also comprises an achiral outer nanotube attached to a gold electrode but the inner tube is connected to a <b>mercury</b> <b>bath.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{circular}} stone {{tower is}} 55 ft high and still contains the original lantern complete with fresnel lens manufactured by Chance Brothers, using a <b>mercury</b> <b>bath</b> as a low-friction bearing.

50|$|The {{original}} apparatus was supplied in 1833 by W. Hart of Launceston. He supplied six dozen Argand lamps with tin reflectors {{at three}} shillings and sixpence each. In 1835, the apparatus was upgraded by {{installation of a}} revolving shutter which was rotated by a weight-driven clockwork mechanism. In 1838, the original whale oil Argand lamps and the tin mirrors were replaced by a revolving catadioptric system, manufactured by Wilkins and Company of London. The lens floated and rotated in a <b>mercury</b> <b>bath,</b> which served as a bearing. The cost of these upgrades was £2000. In 1851, the luminous intensity of the lantern was further increased.|$|E

50|$|The Norah Head Lighthouse was {{the last}} {{significant}} lighthouse built in New South Wales, a 27 m tower, completed in 1903 with monetary assistance /Hargraves of Noraville after considerable numbers of ships foundered on the coast near the headland. Originally it was powered by a kerosene concentric wick lamp and still today it features a 2nd order bivalve Fresnel lens prism floating on a <b>mercury</b> <b>bath.</b> At first, the prism was rotated by descending weights, but the light was electrified in 1961 and fully automated in 1995. The light flashes once in 15 seconds, and is visible to 27 nmi km, the focal plane is located at 46 m above sea level. For coastal shipping, two additional light signals are shown: a red light in the northeast sector, emitted from 39 m above the sea and a green one towards southwest, emitted from 44 m; both are continuous.|$|E
50|$|It was Van Marum's {{dream to}} create a larger version, and he applied to the Teylers Stichting in 1783 for funding to create such a large {{instrument}} {{in the hope that}} it would add a valuable contribution to the science of electricity. On April 11 of that year his request was granted, and on May 7 Cuthbertson was employed who finished the device a year later and it was proudly installed on Christmas Eve. The machine performed above expectations and was only modified a few times to prevent leaks of the static charge. The study of electricity leakage led to many insights in the study of electricity. The machine was last modified in 1791. For the friction, cushions were used as an improvement over the <b>mercury</b> <b>bath</b> used in the earlier model. For a complete description of the electrostatic generator, an explanation was produced in 1868 by the Parisian author Adolphe Ganot (1804-1887).|$|E
