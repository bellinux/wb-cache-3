25|$|Financially {{commercial}} radio {{struggled to}} <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> as the 1980s economy in Britain was hampered by union strikes. Radio West {{had not made}} any profit since it started and looked set to close, when the neighbouring local station Wiltshire Radio, based in Swindon made an approach to merge the two stations, creating a station covering from Weston-super-Mare {{in the west to}} Swindon and Hungerford in the east, with opt out programming for the two areas. This merger was approved by the Independent Broadcasting Authority and was completed in September 1985.|$|E

Halfway through the {{production}} of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked Krantz outright when he would be paid, and Krantz responded that [...] "The picture didn't <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>money,</b> Ralph. It's just a lot of noise." [...] Bakshi found Krantz's claims to be dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Because Bakshi did not have a lawyer, he sought advice from directors he had become friends with, including Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg, asking them how much they made on their films. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied. Bakshi began pitching his next project, Harlem Nights, a film loosely based on the Uncle Remus story books. The idea interested producer Albert S. Ruddy during a screening of The Godfather.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Fritz the Cat was released, Bakshi {{had become a}} celebrity, but his {{reputation}} was primarily based upon his having directed the first [...] "dirty" [...] animated film. Facing criticism of his work on publicity tours and in trade publications, he began writing poetry to express his emotions. This became a tradition, and Bakshi wrote poems before beginning production on each of his films. The first of these poems was [...] "Street Arabs", which preceded the production of Heavy Traffic in 1972. Inspiration for the film came from penny arcades, where Bakshi often played pinball, sometimes accompanied by his 12-year-old son, Mark. Bakshi pitched Heavy Traffic to Samuel Z. Arkoff, who expressed interest in his take on the [...] "tortured underground cartoonist" [...] and agreed to back the film. Krantz had not compensated Bakshi {{for his work on}} Fritz the Cat, and halfway through the production of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked when he would be paid. Krantz responded, [...] "The picture didn't <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>money,</b> Ralph. It's just a lot of noise." [...] Bakshi found Krantz's claims dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Bakshi did not have a lawyer, so he sought advice from fellow directors with whom he had become friendly, including Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg. He soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied.|$|E
500|$|Branded to Kill was {{released}} to Japanese theatres on June 15, 1967, {{in a double}} bill with Nishimura Shōgorō's Burning Nature. The films were financially unsuccessful and the former fared likewise among critics. Kinema Junpo magazine reported that the films [...] "resulted in less than [...] viewers at Asakusa and Shinjuku and about 500 at Yurakucho on the second day." [...] Both Joe Shishido and Yamatoya Atsushi later recounted having seen Branded to Kill in practically empty theatres, the latter on its opening night. Iijima Kōichi, a critic for the film journal Eiga Geijutsu, wrote that [...] "the woman buys a mink coat and thinks only about having sex. The man wants to kill and feels nostalgic about the smell of boiling rice. We cannot help being confused. We {{do not go to}} theaters to be puzzled." [...] Nikkatsu Studios had been criticized for catering to rebellious youth audiences, a specialty of contract director Seijun Suzuki, whose films had grown increasingly anarchic through the 1960s. This had earned him a large following but it had also drawn the ire of studio head Kyūsaku Hori. On April 25, 1968, Suzuki received a telephone call from a company secretary informing him {{that he would not be}} receiving his salary that month. Two of Suzuki's friends met with Hori the next day and were told, [...] "Suzuki's films were incomprehensible, that they did not <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> and that Suzuki might as well give up his career as a director as he would not be making films for any other companies." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the fourth}} week of November – {{well into the}} lucrative Christmas sales period and close to {{four months after the}} concerts – Harrison voiced his {{frustration}} at the stalemate with Capitol on ABC's late-night chat show, The Dick Cavett Show. Harrison was on the program to promote the Raga documentary with Shankar, but after making a surprise guest performance with Gary Wright's new band Wonderwheel, he launched into a complaint about his US record company's interference and threatened to take the whole album package to Columbia. With the outburst attracting unfavourable attention in the press, where Capitol were viewed as [...] "profiteering on the backs of famine victims", the company eventually backed down and agreed to release the album on Harrison's terms. Of all the labels involved, only Columbia would <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> from The Concert for Bangladesh – 25 cents on every copy sold. Although none of these royalties went to the artist, Dylan and his record company were already benefiting from the exposure provided by the Bangladesh concerts, through the timely release of Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II. Of the other featured artists at the Concert for Bangladesh, the careers of both Preston (A Records) and Russell (Shelter) likewise prospered {{as a result of their}} participation, but their record companies imposed no such conditions on Apple and Capitol. In January 1972, Melody Makers Richard Williams remarked in his Concert for Bangladesh album review: [...] "Between them, Capitol and CBS have proved that, when it comes to awareness and enlightenment, the business is still several years behind the musicians." ...|$|E
50|$|Like nearly {{everything}} in the Soviet Union, they operated under the strict ideological supervision of the Communist Party, and what is more, the creative unions were means of an effective control over the artistic production of their members: the members of these unions had priority in publishing of their works.

In 2010 ESPN published an article about Ohio State football players that had been sanctioned by the NCAA for accepting free tattoos and selling memorabilia they had earned. However, there are many that argue that student athletes selling of personal and earned memorabilia is their right, with gray-areas where which the NCAA has a hard time justifying their punishments.|$|R
50|$|Telstar Records went {{bankrupt}} in 2004, {{largely due to}} the company's habit of giving large advances to artists such as Claire Sweeney and Victoria Beckham who failed to <b>make</b> them <b>any</b> <b>money.</b> In the media much of the blame for the label's failure was placed on their most high-profile signing, Victoria Beckham. However, as most of Telstar's artists were not directly signed to the label, instead being either sub-licensed or part of a number of joint ventures, BMG (soon to be merged with Sony) declined to buy the label's assets outright.|$|R

2500|$|Due to {{the success}} of re-released singles [...] "Itchycoo Park" [...] and [...] "Lazy Sunday" [...] in 1975 and 1976, McLagan, Jones and Marriott were persuaded to re-form Small Faces. Rick Wills took the place of Lane, who pulled out after just two rehearsals. Unknown to the others, Lane was {{suffering}} from multiple sclerosis. The band recorded two albums, Playmates and 78 in the Shade, but the albums were both critical and commercial failures and they disbanded. Marriott did not <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> out of the venture. His earnings were used to extricate him from old binding management contracts. Due to financial problems, Marriott was forced to sell Beehive Cottage, which had been his home since 1968, and move to a small terraced house in Golders Green, London.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{had last}} toured in Australia in 1993 with The Girlie Show World Tour, her fourth concert tour. The country was skipped {{for the next}} five tours until the singer {{released}} her thirteenth studio album, Rebel Heart (2015). To promote the album, Madonna announced the Rebel Heart Tour, and confirmed that she would be coming to Australia with the concert, as well as visit New Zealand for the first time. Before arriving in Australia, Madonna announced an extra show on March 10, 2016, at Melbourne's Forum Theatre. The show was billed as an intimate gig, and was described by the singer as a fusion of music, art and comedy. It was titled as Madonna: Tears of a Clown show and was created for the singer's Australian fans, who had waited for her to perform there for the last 23 years. During her promotional appearance at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2015, Madonna confessed that she is a [...] "kind of closet comedian" [...] and did a skit on the show; she added, [...] "I always do extravaganzas, they always cost a billion dollars to <b>make</b> ... nobody <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> <b>money</b> ... and sometimes I dream about simplicity."

2500|$|WCW {{slid into}} {{a period of}} extravagant {{overspending}} and creative decline; the reasons and the people responsible are still a matter of debate. One possible reason was the overuse of celebrities in pay-per-view matches, such as Dennis Rodman and Jay Leno. Also, WCW's credibility was damaged by product placement, such as Rick Steiner trading barbs with Chucky the killer doll in order to advertise the 1998 film Bride of Chucky. Ernest Miller created a persona that mimicked singer James Brown and every week teased that Brown would appear on Nitro. Brown finally made an appearance on a PPV, however WCW failed to announce and promote Brown's appearance which meant WCW essentially paid Brown to not <b>make</b> <b>any</b> additional <b>money.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In a November 2009 {{article in}} the Toluca Lake, California, Tolucan Times, {{columnist}} Greg Crosby described a visit with Caesar and his wife Florence at their home. Of the couple's meeting, Florence said, [...] "Well, I thought he was nice for the summer ... I {{thought he would be}} just a nice boyfriend for the summer. He was cute-looking and tall, over six feet.... I was in my last year at Hunter College; we were still dating when Sid went into the service, the Coast Guard. Luckily he was stationed in New York so we were able to continue seeing each other, even though my parents weren't too happy about it. They never thought he would amount to anything, that he'd never have a real career or <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>money.</b> But we were married one year after we met, in July of 1943."

[...] At that time the student-run film society Cine Club, headed by Kazuko Kawakita, was sponsoring a major retrospective of Suzuki's films; meant to be the first in Japan to honour a Japanese director. It was scheduled to begin on 10 May, but Hori withdrew all of his films from distribution and refused to release them to the Cine Club. The students were told that [...] "Nikkatsu could not afford to cultivate a reputation for making films understood only by an exclusive audience and that showing incomprehensible and thus bad films would disgrace the company," [...] adding that, [...] "Suzuki's films would not be shown for some time in theaters or by the Cine Club." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tensions {{were also}} {{mounting}} within the band. Albini did not drink alcohol, so Riley and Durango became drinking buddies {{on the road}} while Albini was doing interviews and handling the band's logistics. Riley, however, was drinking to excess, and his behavior ruined several of the band's performances. Albini accused Riley {{of a number of}} other shortcomings including lateness to rehearsals, always needing rides, and [...] "flashes of brilliance offset by flashes of belligerence." [...] However, though he made a number of threats, Albini never fired Riley. Another problem facing the band was that Riley was now in college and both Albini and Durango had to keep day jobs, which limited Big Black's ability to tour. When Durango announced that he intended to enter law school beginning in the fall semester of 1987, the band decided to keep going until he began school and then call it quits. Despite enjoying increased press, radio airplay, record sales, and concert fees, the band did not regret their decision and eschewed the idea of commercial success. According to Riley, [...] "Big Black was never about that. For Big Black to <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>money,</b> it wouldn't have been Big Black anymore." [...] Being a lame duck band was also liberating, as the members no longer had to be concerned with the group's future.
