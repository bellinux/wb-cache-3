Production was expected to reach eight per month from each assembly line by mid-1941.

25|$|Hawker Aircraft was keen {{to market}} the Sea Fury to foreign operators, and {{conducted}} an intense sales drive for their export version of the aircraft, designated Sea Fury F 50. On 21 October 1946, the Royal Netherlands Navy placed an order for ten F 50 aircraft, which were basically identical to the FAA's Sea Fury Mk X aircraft, to equip the Netherlands' first aircraft carrier, the ex-, renamed HNLMS Karel Doorman. The Dutch also ordered an additional twelve FB 60s in 1948 and these were delivered in 1950. A <b>manufacturing</b> <b>licence</b> was also acquired {{for the production of}} a further 25 FB 51s by Fokker Aircraft in the Netherlands, which were delivered from 1951 onwards.|$|E

Thirty-four were acquired by the Spanish Republican Government in 1937 by presenting forged Turkish credentials. This batch was built primarily to bypass the US embargo placed on belligerents during the Spanish Civil War. Referred to as the GE-23 Delfin (en:Dolphin) by the Spanish Republican Air Force, the aircraft fought in the conflict, but were outclassed by opposing fighters and losses were high. Despite this, a victory against a Heinkel He 59B would be the only recorded [...] "kill" [...] by a Grumman biplane fighter.

FASA owned the licence to {{manufacture}} the Renault 4 CV in Spain, and between 1953 and 1958 produced 26, 298 units, which represented 29 % of the total Spanish output. The period was marked by disagreements both between the Spanish partners and between the Spanish partners and Renault, the technology supplier, and {{by the need to}} satisfy the requirements of domestic production. Drawing on unpublished primary sources of information (the Minutes of the Board of Directors and the Shareholders’ Meetings) the article analyses the development of FASA during its early years. The article explores the hypothesis that the developer of FASA decided to locate the factory in Valladolid for personal reasons.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the beginnings of}} aircraft manufacture and maintenance in India through a study of Hindustan Aircraft Limited (est. 1940). Promoted by industrialist Walchand Hirachand, HAL was set up {{with the help of}} capital (initially fifty per cent) from the Mysore Government, which also provided land and other facilities for the company’s factory in Bangalore. Historians of science and technology have yet to study in depth the early history of this specialised industry in India. Further, scholars of 1940 s India have, following {{the point of view of}} actors like Walchand, seen the aircraft industry primarily as an example of colonial imperatives subjugating indigenous entrepreneurship and skill. This is in line with the larger historiography, which often sees S&T in India as being either ‘colonial’ or ‘nationalist’. However, recent work by historians has begun to emphasise the need to understand Indian S&T as an integral part of broader, often extra-imperial, networks. This paper will further develop this historiographical approach by placing the technical practitioners of HAL centre stage. The plant in Bangalore was commissioned by a team of American engineers under W. D. Pawley, who would arrange for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>licences,</b> machinery and materials through his American company, Intercontinent Corporation. These American experts supervised a team of Indian engineers and technicians; the factory was run by the US Army during the latter years of World War II. Using a variety of sources (including the biography of Walchand Hirachand; official records and correspondence in the British Library, and printed material in the Karnataka State Archives), this paper {{examines the}} politics surrounding the founding of HAL, and the training and recruitment of its technical experts. It argues that at a time when colonial institutions were still geared primarily towards teaching civil engineering, American (and British) collaboration, Indian capital, the policies of the princely state of Mysore, and German expertise played an important role in the birth and development of aircraft manufacturing in India...|$|R

The Italian stylist Giovanni Michelotti redesigned the Contessa line in 1964 with a 1300 cc rear-mounted engine.
