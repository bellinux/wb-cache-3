40|$|Summary: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the factors affecting racing performance and to estimate the heritability of racing performance in Arabian horses. In this study the records were obtained from 6203 races of 616 <b>male</b> <b>foals</b> of 37 stallions racing at open races in different race tracks in Turkey during the years of 1991 - 2000. The least squares mean of racing time was found to be 176. 29 ± 0. 95 seconds and there were significant differences (p< 0. 001) in racing years, racing distances, racing groups and race tracks. The estimated mean value for the amount of earning was 15660. 6 ± 556. 7 $ (USA). The effect of mare age, year, distance, racing group, race tracks and foal age on the earning were significant (p< 0. 05; p< 0. 001). There were statistically significant differences among mean value of speed (m/second) for all of the investigated factors and the variance among stallions was found to be significant.

A 10 -month-old, <b>male,</b> pony <b>foal</b> was examined because of stiff gait, marked contractures of the distal portion of the limbs, flexion deformities of the hooves, and moderate hypotonia that had been present from birth. The foal had increased creatine kinase (282 U/liter; reference interval 10 - 135 U/liter), lactate dehydrogenase (1, 188 U/liter; reference interval 150 - 450 U/liter), and aspartate transaminase (377 U/liter; reference interval < 290 U/liter) activities, suggesting muscle disease. Muscle biopsy was performed. In cytochrome oxidase-, succinate dehydrogenase-, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide tetrazolium reductase-reacted sections, the dominant morphologic feature was the absence of oxidative enzyme activity in the cores. By use of immunohistochemical technique with a monoclonal antibody against desmin, the cores were clearly delineated and a desmin network was present within the cores. Ultrastructurally, the core areas were characterized by preserved sarcomeres with irregular Z-lines, with some streaming or zigzag appearance and abnormal sarcoplasmic reticulum profiles and T-tubules.

40|$|Clostridium difficile is an {{emerging}} and potentially zoonotic pathogen, but its prevalence in most animal species, including exhibition animals, is currently unknown. In {{this study we}} assessed the prevalence of faecal shedding of C. difficile by zoo animals, and determined the ribotype, toxin profile and antimicrobial susceptibility of recovered isolates. A total of 200 samples from 40 animal species (36. 5 % of which came from plains zebra, Equus quagga burchellii) were analysed. C. difficile was isolated from 7 samples (3. 5 % of total), which came from the following animal species: chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), dwarf goat (Capra hircus), and Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica hispanica), with one positive sample each; and plains zebra, with 4 positive samples from 3 different individuals. Most recovered isolates (4 / 7, 57. 1 %) belonged to the epidemic PCR ribotype 078, produced toxins A and B, and had the genes encoding binary toxin (i. e. A(+) B(+) CDT(+) isolates). The remaining three isolates belonged to PCR ribotypes 039 (A(-) B(-) CDT(-)), 042 (A(+) B(+) CDT(-)) and 110 (A(-) B(+) CDT(-)). Regardless of their ribotype, all isolates displayed high-level resistance to the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and levofloxacin. Some isolates were also resistant to meropenem and/or ertapenem. A ribotype 078 isolate recovered from a <b>male</b> zebra <b>foal</b> initially showed in vitro resistance to metronidazole (MIC ≥ 256 μg/ml), but lost that trait after subculturing on non-selective media.

40|$|Abstract. The normal muscular {{anatomy of}} the urinary bladder of the horse is reviewed. The basic pattern is an outer {{longitudinal}} and inner circular layer of smooth muscle, except on the dorsal surface where the circular layer is external. This arrangement permits, ac-cording {{to the principles of}} mechanics, preferential bulging of the dorsal surface. At the time of birth the urachus is functionally closed, or nearly so. During parturition external pressure on the distended bladder may cause dorsal rupture because the urachus is closed, the penile urethra of the male is compressed in the pelvic canal, and the dorsal surface of the bladder is anatomically a weak point. Rupture of the dorsal surface was produced ex-perimentally by simulating the in vivo conditions in vitro. Rupture of the urinary bladder of newborn foals has been described by several authors [24, 7, 81. Although precise frequency data are not availa-ble, the majority of cases occur in males.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effect of gender on the growth of Criollo foals, in order to use this information as a reference for breeding as well as in future research. Body height, thoracic perimeter, and cannon bone perimeter of 75 foals were measured from two farms in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Lat. 32 °, 33 &# 8242;, 58 &# 8243;, Long. 53 °, 22 &# 8242;, 33 &# 8243;) and from three generations over three years. In both farms, animals were kept under the same range and feeding conditions. Nonlinear regression models were applied to describe the growth curves for the three traits over the experimental period. Cannon bone perimeter was greater in males than in females (P< 0. 001) but the predicted curves for body height and thoracic perimeter did not differ between genders. For all traits, the highest rate of increase was achieved in the first year of life (body height = 74 %, thoracic perimeter = 76 %, and cannon bone perimeter = 63 % for males and 83 % for females).
