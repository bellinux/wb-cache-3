[...] The actress read the script and recorded her lines at a recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona; upon first glance, Greer suggested that the raunchy and risque nature of the script would prevent any television stations from picking up the series. [...] "So when I found out it was picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' And I went, 'Really?'

Ed Morrissey, another conservative Christian writer, wrote that bending the word of God to one's own ideology makes God subservient to an ideology, {{rather than the other}} way around. Joseph Farah, editor-in-chief of WorldNetDaily, stated: [...] "I've seen some incredibly stupid and misguided initiatives by 'conservatives' in <b>my</b> <b>day,</b> but this one takes the cake" [...] and [...] "There's certainly nothing 'conservative' about rewriting the Bible". Creation Ministries International wrote [...] "Forcing the Bible to conform to a certain political agenda, no matter if one happens to agree with that agenda, is a perversion of the Word of God and should therefore be opposed by Christians as much as 'politically correct' Bibles." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{retirement}} from professional Scouting, Goodman served the National Council of Churches (NCC) during 1951–1954 as the NCC's first general {{director of the}} United Church Men, a laymen's program he formed to strengthen men's ties to local churches and their communities. Goodman publicly inaugurated the laymen's group on October 7, 1951 in Cincinnati, Ohio. By the end of 1952, United Church Men departments were formed in more than 24states, providing financial support to NCC-affiliated colleges and missionary work. His new post entailed working closely with Eugene Carson Blake, NCC president (1954–1957), and meeting frequently with officials of the participating denominations in the NCC. Speaking with various men's church groups in the U.S. and abroad was, he believed, a means of promoting brotherhood. Reflecting on his NCC service with these notable church leaders, Goodman said {{more than a decade}} later, [...] "Great faith and devoted service, I am very sure, are for ordinary folk {{as well as for the}} clergy. ... I have been privileged to know some great clergymen in <b>my</b> <b>day</b> ... but I have also known and loved some truly great laymen, men whose lives and works matched their faith". Goodman retired from his NCC post on September 1, 1954 because of tuberculosis.|$|E
