The BRDF value of the specimen coated with <b>matte</b> <b>coating</b> Z 306 at 0. 65 μm was obtained. On {{the basis of the}} scattering characteristics of the specimen coated with <b>matte</b> <b>coating</b> Z 306, the microfacet-based model suitable for roughness <b>matte</b> <b>coating</b> was selected and corrected. The corrected microfacet-based model was used to model and process the measurement data and to obtain the BRDF data of the specimen in the whole hemisphere space to make up the defects of the less data and measurement errors. The BRDF data of the <b>matte</b> <b>coating</b> was induced to the software to analyze the stray light of an optical system and to compare the performance with the results of the stray light measurement. It shows that after the measurement data are processed by the correction microfacet-based model, the analysis results of the stray light have high consistency with the measurement results of the stray light, and the logarithm value of the ratio of tested value and analyzed value is less than 0. 5. The results demonstrate that the BRDF model is necessary and the data processing is accurate, which provides an important method for stray light suppression in optical systems. © 2016, Science Press.

40|$|Protecting an {{aircraft}} from {{the extremes of}} environments during service begins at the interface between topcoat and environment. The topcoat considered here is an aliphatic polyurethane (PU) based <b>matte</b> <b>coating.</b> This paper examines the degradation of the PU topcoat {{through the use of}} a novel HyperTest which combines ultra-violet (UV) and ozone as the degradation method. To benchmark the technique against accepted accelerated testing methods, QUV was used and samples were tested between two and 56 days. For The HyperTest, samples were degraded at increments between one to 120 minutes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) determined that 56 days of UV exposure was equivalent, in terms of the extent of the chemical degradation of the topcoat, to one to two minutes of UV/ozone (UV/O 3) exposure. There was a significant increase in carbonyl component with increasing oxygen concentration for samples treated with The HyperTest, whereas no clear degradation trend was observed for the samples exposed to UV alone. After 60 minutes of UV/O 3 exposure a steady-state mechanism is established as the oxidative decomposition of the PU coating. The proposed degradation mechanism of the PU topcoat, through UV/O 3 exposure, is the reaction of atomic oxygen with the polymer matrix/binder through hydrogen abstraction producing a hydroxyl group. This further decomposes to produce a carbonyl component observed in the XPS analysis. The products of degradation are simple volatile molecules such as CO 2 and H 2 O for both testing methods used here. However, the efficient nature of The HyperTest, requiring only minutes to degrade samples as shown here, proves it to be a viable complementary technique to established methods of laboratory accelerated testing...|$|E

50|$|Polymer {{flat plate}} {{collectors}} are {{an alternative to}} metal collectors and are now being produced in Europe. These may be wholly polymer, or they may include metal plates in front of freeze-tolerant water channels made of silicone rubber. Polymers are flexible and therefore freeze-tolerant and can employ plain water instead of antifreeze, {{so that they may}} be plumbed directly into existing water tanks instead of needing heat exchangers that lower efficiency. By dispensing with a heat exchanger, temperatures need not be quite so high for the circulation system to be switched on, so such direct circulation panels, whether polymer or otherwise, can be more efficient, particularly at low light levels. Some early selectively coated polymer collectors suffered from overheating when insulated, as stagnation temperatures can exceed the polymer's melting point. For example, the melting point of polypropylene is 160 C, while the stagnation temperature of insulated thermal collectors can exceed 180 C if control strategies are not used. For this reason polypropylene is not often used in glazed selectively coated solar collectors. Increasingly polymers such as high temperate silicones (which melt at over 250 C) are being used. Some non polypropylene polymer based glazed solar collectors are <b>matte</b> black <b>coated</b> rather than selectively coated to reduce the stagnation temperature to 150 C or less.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} {{a method to}} change the surface finish of a {{standard}} polyester-based powder coating paint, from gloss to matt, by depositing ultrathin films of Al 2 O 3 on the powder coating particles. The coating experiments were performed in a fluidized bed reactor at 1  bar and 27  °C, using a gas-phase coating process of alternating exposure of the particles to the two precursors (trimethylaluminium and water), similar to atomic layer deposition (ALD). We varied the number of coating cycles (1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9  cycles) to obtain film thicknesses of the alumina shell ranging from 1 to 30  nm. The average growth per cycle of the process is 3. 5  nm, significantly larger than the one for pure self-limiting ALD. When the average alumina shell was thicker than 6  nm, the shell prevented {{the flow of the}} core particles, even though the powder particles did soften above the glass transition temperature.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of postoperative treatment, surface treatment and stem design on the outcome of primary Total Hip Arthroplasty. The main intention was to study anteverted femoral stems. Material and methods: Study 1 : 43 patients who received an uncemented and hydroxy-apatite coated prosthesis with an anteverted stem were randomized to partial or full weight bearing and followed for 1 year with radiostereometry. The patients in the partial weight bearing group were equipped with a pressure sensitive insole signalling when the patients load exceeded the prescribed weight limit. Study II: 80 patients (84 hips) randomly received a cemented anteverted cobalt-chromium stem (Lubinus SP 2) with either <b>matte,</b> polymethylmetacrylate <b>coating</b> or a polished surface (uncollared) and were followed for 5 years with radiostereometry, DXA and conventional radiography. Study III: 38 patients were randomized to receive either an uncemented stem with reduced stiffness or a solid metal stem. Patients were followed for 7 years using radiostereometry, DXA, conventional radiography, Harris Hip Score and a pain questionnaire. Study IV: 72. 991 primary cemented femoral stem implants (21, 246 Exeter polished stems, 44, 605 Lubinus SPII stems and 7, 140 Spectron EF Primary) from the Swedish Total Hip Arthroplasty were studied. Design-specific characteristics were analysed using separate Cox regression models that were adjusted for gender, age, diagnosis, incision and number of operation (1 st or 2 nd). Results: Study I: The median migration in the two groups was equal and neither did the stem rotations differ. The cup translations, rotations and femoral head penetration were unaffected of postoperative partial weight-bearing or full weight-bearing. Study II: The polished stems subsided more than the matte and precoated versions (p< 0. 0001) and mainly inside the cement mantle. After 1 and 2 years the polished stems had lost significantly less bone mineral in Gruen zones 1, 2, 6 and 7 (p = 0. 004 to 0. 03), but this difference had disappeared after 5 years. Study III: There were no differences in migration, wear or clinical results between the two groups At 2 years loss of bone mineral density was less in Gruen regions 1, 2, 6 and 7 for the Epoch stems (p< 0. 04) but at 7 years only region 7 had significantly denser bone in the Epoch group. No stem was radiographically loose. Study IV: In the selected groups the crude revision rate varied between 0. 8 (Lubinus SPII) and 1. 4 % (Spectron Primary). Decreasing stem size and increasing neck length or offset negatively influenced the risk for non-infectious revision for both the Lubinus and the Spectron stem design. Also male gender negatively influenced the risk for revision for these two stem designs. The risk for revision for the Exeter stem design was only influenced by patient- and surgery-related parameters and not by implant- related parameters. For all the three stem designs studied the use of an anterolateral incision had a protective effect against revision Conclusions: Study I:Immediate weight bearing after the implantation of an anteverted uncemented and hydroxy-apatite coated stem did not have any adverse effect. Immediate full weight bearing – as much as can be tolerated- after uncemented THA of the ABG-type is justified, provided that primary stability of the implant can be achieved. Study II: Polished anteverted cemented femoral stems without a collar subsided more and mainly inside the cement mantle during the first 2 postoperative years compared to <b>matte</b> or PMMA <b>coated</b> collared femoral stems of the same design. During the period of increased subsidence improved bone remodelling was seen around the polished version probably due to a more favourable loading of the proximal femur. No advantages or specific shortcomings were found with the use of a PMMA-coating. Study III: The uncemented fully porous-coated composite Epoch stem showed excellent fixation and good clinical results at medium term. This stem with increased flexibility had positive effects on early proximal bone remodelling compared to a solid uncemented stem during the first 2 postoperative years, but this effect decreased with time, suggesting that the load bearing area of the stem moved distally with time. Study IV: Overall, the survival rate for the three most frequently used cemented stem designs in the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register was high. Variations within each stem design influenced the risk for non-infectious revision for 2 of the implants studied. Our findings underline previous experiences form other implant designs, where relatively modest changes of the stem shape not delivered the expected clinical result...|$|R

The targeted market segment is high-end digital production in the U. S. In the first phase a survey of print providers has been conducted, the sample drawn from the network of printing companies currently engaged with Printing Industry Center (CIAS) research activities. The second phase will be to follow up observations from the survey with a case study approach, working with both print providers and with digital press manufacturers. In {{order to understand the}} characteristics of this digital printing market segment, a demographic study of the respondent group was conducted as part of the survey. This was followed by an exploration of the considerations and paper characteristics that are involved in the paper grade selection decision. The role that paper characteristics and press requirements play in production efficiency and document quality was investigated. The change in paper costs to printers {{over the last few years}} was also explored. Specific research objectives included: identifying the paper grades commonly used for the market segment of production digital printing, identifying the number of brands used and the nature of printing companies’ relationships to suppliers, determining the factors that affect brand and purchase decisions, discovering the relative importance of different paper properties and characteristics, assessing the deficiencies in currently-available paper grades, and determining what improvements are required by digital printers, and what limitations are currently imposed by press design. The leading digital paper grades used in digital printing production were found to be coated gloss, premium uncoated, uncoated calendered, <b>coated</b> <b>matte,</b> uncoated uncalendered, and premium bond. The median number of paper brands used by this sample is five, with a wide range indicating varied practices. When making the paper purchase decision, almost half the time print providers and print purchasers collaborate on the selection of paper grades. Leading factors involved in the paper purchase decision were identified as runnability and print quality, followed in importance by availability of grade, appearance properties, price, multipurpose functionality across different technologies, and product range. The leading paper characteristics considered when making a purchase decision were found to be, in order of importance, toner/ink adhesion, accurate sheet dimensions, dimensional stability, and moisture level. Performance- and runnability-related factors were found to be more important than appearance-related factors in the purchase decision. Evans 2 ̆ 6 LeMa i re (PICRM- 2005 - 06) Overall, the price of papers charged by manufacturers to print producers seems not to be a leading factor in making the paper selection decision. Price was not a key driver in selecting brand or grade type, even though most printers have experienced paper cost increases in the last few years. The area of improvement that printers want to see most is an extended product range, with more sizes, finishes, and basis weights available for their digital presses. The presses currently owned impose paper choice limitations on size, basis weight, thickness, and surface treatment requirements.

40|$|Particles {{are widely}} used in the {{chemical}} industry as raw material and end product. In many applications of particles, it is advantageous {{to give them a}} coating that can either protect the particle from outside influences or give it an additional function. Technologies to provide micron-sized particles with relatively thick coatings (in the order of ?m) are readily available. However, for many applications it would be attractive to apply coatings to fine particles (of the order of 50 ?m or smaller) and to make these coatings thinner (<< 1 ?m). This opens possibilities for new properties. In addition, a lower amount of the compound would be needed to coat the material of interest. This thesis focuses on a technique for depositing ultrathin and conformal films, with control down to nanometre scale, with high a utilisation of the precursors: atomic layer deposition (ALD) applied to fine particles. ALD is a gas-phase coating technique that relies on two self terminating reactions, that form a coating cycle, after which a fraction of a monolayer of compound is deposited on the substrate. This cycle can be repeated a desired number of times to deposit thicker layers. Amongst the wide variety of compounds that have been deposited with ALD, alumina (Al 2 O 3) has been the favourite one to study, due to the ideal layer-by-layer growth mode that is observed when used trimethyl aluminium (TMA) and water as precursors, and its broad applicability in different fields. Thin Al 2 O 3 ALD films have been used, for example, in the fabrication of semiconductor devices, in the production of catalysts and the passivation of the cathode of the Li-ion batteries. Besides these applications, other materials such as polymers or biological products could benefit from the deposition of ultrathin alumina films. However, alumina has been typically deposited at relatively high temperatures, i. e., ~ 170 °C and < 1 mbar, inhibiting its application to heat-sensitive materials. This is our main motivation to investigate the deposition of alumina films at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Working at ambient conditions would, in first place, permit the coating of heat sensitive materials, and, in second place, facilitate the coating process and improve the scaling-up prospects, since less complex equipment would be required. Atomic layer deposition provides accurate control over the film thickness based on the selfterminating nature of the ALD reactions. That means that deposition only takes place {{as long as there are}} surface species available for reaction. The combination of the operating temperature and pressure, and the purging of the reactor with nitrogen after each reaction, ensure the removal of unreacted precursor molecules from the surface of the substrate. However, the physisorption of these unreacted molecules is the main challenge that we face when depositing alumina at 25 °C and 1 bar, since the normal boiling temperature of TMA and water is 125 and 100 °C, respectively. In Al 2 O 3 ALD processes at 170 °C and < 1 mbar, where no physisorption occurs, the thickness of the deposited films depends solely on the number of coating cycles, since once the active sites on the surface are depleted, no more reaction takes place, regardless of the amount of precursors fed to the reactor in excess. In contrast, at ambient conditions, the thickness of the alumina film will depend on the number of cycles and on the dosing time of the precursors due to the accumulation of the unreacted precursor molecules that are fed in excess. In this work, we aimed at controlling the physisorption of the precursors at ambient conditions by adjusting the dosing time of the precursors to the reactor. By feeding the amount of precursor molecules needed to saturate the active sites present on the surface of the substrate (TiO 2 nanoparticles in our case), we obtained similar growths as in pure ALD, i. e., 0. 1 - 0. 2 nm per cycle, even if the reactions are not self-limiting. Complementarily, having a faster growth of the alumina film could be done by dosing both precursors in excess due to the physisorption of unreacted molecules. These findings were applied in the remainder of the thesis to deposit alumina, at ambient conditions, on three different substrates: polymeric powder coating paint, lead-selenide quatum dot (PbSe QD) films, and silicon carbide (SiC) particles. Two of these materials, the powder coating and the QD films, are heat sensitive, thus working at room temperature was essential. Al 2 O 3 films were used to tune the surface appearance of a powder coating (i. e., dry paint without any solvent). The polymeric core particles were coated with alumina films of different thicknesses. The alumina layers partially confined the core material when it softened above the glass transition temperature. As the softened core did not flow during the curing of the paint, it created roughness of the surface, and therefore, a matte surface appearance. The mechanical properties of the <b>matte</b> powder <b>coating</b> were similar to the ones of the originally glossy one. Thin alumina films were used to tune the final appearance of the powder coating paint without the use of foreign particles that would produce the same effect. Additionally, films of PbSe QD crystals, which are nanosized crystals with very interesting properties for semiconductor applications, were passivated using alumina. QDs films have very promising applications, e. g., as high-efficiency photovoltaic material. However, they are air and heat sensitive and irreversibly oxidize after a short exposure to air, losing their good properties. Previous work showed the passivation of the QDs with alumina at temperatures between 25 and 90 °C, and pressures smaller than 1 mbar. In this work, alumina was deposited at 25 °C and 1 bar to efficiently passivate the QDs. At ambient conditions, a fast deposition of alumina took place as a consequence of different groups that can react with TMA, such as hydroxyl and amine groups. Coating with alumina at ambient conditions can be easily coupled with the fabrication of the QD films, which also is done at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The final application we considered is the production of radioactive tracer particles. For fluidized bed studies, we would like to label SiC particles with a minimum change to their other physical properties. SiC particles have a rather inert surface towards radioactive ions. We used the Al 2 O 3 coating to enhance the labelling efficiency of this material and produce a tracer. Typically, a completely different material is used for the tracer particles, such as ?-Al 2 O 3. However, this would produce a mismatch in properties such as size, shape and density between the tracer and the material of study. In this work, alumina films were deposited on SiC particles to mimic the affinity of the ?-Al 2 O 3 particles towards the radioactive ions, and produce a SiC-based tracer. Since the labelling efficiency depends on the alumina film thickness, TMA and water were fed in large excess, achieving a growth per cycle of alumina of about 10 nm. The resulting core-shell particles, with an alumina coating of about 400 nm, had only a slightly lower relative activity as the ?-Al 2 O 3 particle. Nevertheless, this SiC based tracer was used in a particle tracking experiment, having enough activity to be detected by the sensors and reconstruct its trajectory during fluidization. One might argue whether the studied deposition process at atmospheric pressure and room temperature is still true ALD, since the reactions are not self-terminating and we deposit several layers of alumina in each cycle. Nevertheless, it gives the possibility of depositing alumina on heat sensitive materials, with good tunability and control over the films thickness, at operating conditions that would simplify the scaled-up of this technology. The findings in this thesis could be expanded to other applications, such as the coating of biological compounds, that would require low-temperature processing, or the deposition of other compounds at ambient conditions, i. e., zinc oxide (ZnO). This is further discussed in the outlook of this thesis. Chemical EngineeringApplied Science...|$|R
