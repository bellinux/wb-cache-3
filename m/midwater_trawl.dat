50|$|During {{its life}} as a {{research}} vessel, the Vantuna experienced many extraordinary events. It encountered blue whales near Santa Rosa Island. Missile tracks were viewed from its deck, including a missile fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base as well as cruise missiles being tested near Point Mugu. It experienced numerous trips to the beautiful Channel Islands. It experienced long, torturous trips in horrible weather, like the trip to release weather balloons 80 mi offshore for the Navy or the night it took two hours to travel from San Onofre to Dana Point Harbor in 50 kn head winds and six foot wind swell. There were the times when amazing animals were collected; hyperiid amphipods in the <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> and Tilapia, a freshwater fish, caught miles offshore several days after a storm.|$|E
5000|$|Bythaelurus naylori, {{also known}} as the Dusky snout {{catshark}} is a catshark of the family Scyliorhinidae. This species is found from the Southwest Indian Ridge, southwesternIndian Ocean. The specimens were collected from 89-1,443 m depth in both bottom trawls and midwater trawls. The shallowest catch record of the new species, possibly at 89 m, came from a <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl.</b> This species can be distinguished from its two closest congeners, B. giddingsi and B. lutarius, by a combination of prominent comb-like dermal denticles along the upper caudal-fin margin, absence of oral papillae, uniform body coloration, and noticeable dark dusky snout; Bythaelurus giddingsi has oral papillae present and a variegated color pattern, while B. lutarius lacks a caudal crest of enlarged denticles and matures at a much smaller size than the new species.|$|E
50|$|In <b>midwater</b> <b>trawling,</b> a {{cone-shaped}} net can be towed {{behind a}} single boat and spread by trawl doors, {{or it can}} be towed behind two boats (pair trawling) which act as the spreading device. <b>Midwater</b> <b>trawling</b> catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, shrimp, tuna and mackerel, whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic fish such as: cod, squid, halibut and rockfish.|$|R

5000|$|Cape horse {{mackerel}} is a bycatch {{species in the}} offshore demersal trawl, which operates mainly off {{the waters of the}} Western Cape at depths of 110m and deeper. The offshore demersal trawl fishery operates using trawl nets which are dragged behind the boat along the ocean floor at depths from 110 - 800 m. Cape {{horse mackerel}} caught in the <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery are considered to be more sustainable than those caught in the offshore trawl fishery (see Cape horse mackerel assessment for <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl).</b> This fishery primarily targets deepwater hake (Merluccius paradoxus) on soft, sandy bottoms, as well as commercially valuable bycatch species such as kingklip (Genypterus capensis) and monkfish (Lophius vomerinus). Although trawling is a highly unselective fishing method, offshore fishing grounds are not generally very biodiverse (i.e. they are only inhabited by a few species) and the discard rate for this fishery is estimated to be 10% of the total catch. However, this fishing method is likely to have significant impacts on bottom habitats and concerns are expressed around the number of seabird mortalities caused during trawling (estimated at 8000 per year). The hake component of the offshore demersal trawl fishery has been certified by the Marine Stewardship Council since 2004, and the current management system for this fishery employs a number of ecosystem-based management measures which address issues such as bycatch, closed areas and benthic habitat impacts. The Cape horse mackerel is managed in terms of a maximum precautionary catch Limit (MPCL). The MPCL has been maintained at 44 000 tonnes in recent years and accommodates both mid-water-directed and bycatch in the hake-directed demersal trawl sector. Juvenile horse mackerel are occasionally targeted on the West Coast where a 5 000 tonnes precautionary catch limit is enforced (the whole small pelagic sector is closed if the limit is exceeded). Despite the absence of direct evidence of ecosystem change, a potential for ecosystem impact exists, as this is an important small pelagic species, and fills a similar ecosystem niche to other small pelagic species such as sardine and anchovy.|$|E

40|$|IN ADDITION TO the fishes {{and faster}} {{swimming}} invertebrates (euphausiids, squids) usually ob-tained in <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> collections, relatively large species of copepods are also frequently captured. Aside from Sewell's (1929) report of copepods found in six midwater collections {{made in the}} Ind ian Ocean, it has only been {{in recent years that}} midwate r trawl samples have been more or less systematically analyzed for copepods. From the Florida Current, off Miami, an area in which the copepods have been stud ied fairly extensively, Owre and Foyo (1964) re-ported that 21 calanoid species were found only in collections made by the Isaacs-Kidd <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> (Isaacs and Kidd, 1953). Of these, 11 represented new records for the area. In the southwestern Indian Ocean, De Decker and Mombeck (1965) using both vertical plankton net and midwater fish trawl found 274 species of copepods. Of these the fish trawl accounted for 115 species including 43 which were not found in the plankton net collections. In the western Indian Ocean Grice and Hulsemann (1967) studied a series of 30 plankton net and 21 <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> collections obtained between 18 Â°N and 40 0 S. In the <b>midwater</b> <b>trawl</b> col-lections were found 64 species not present in the plankton net collections, including representa-tives of all eight species of the family Mega-calanidae. It thus appears that midwater nets constitute a valuable additional means of sam-pling the calanoid copepod fauna in an open ocean area, and it is hoped that those interested in copepods will examine any available mid-water trawl samples. The samples examined in this study wer...|$|E

40|$|Little work on {{vertical}} distribution of cephalopods was possible before the development, in the 1960 s, of sophisticated opening-closing devices usable on <b>midwater</b> <b>trawls</b> {{such as the}} 10 ft Isaacs Kidd trawl (IKMT; Foxton, 1963; Aron et al. 1964) and the series of rectangular <b>midwater</b> <b>trawls</b> developed by the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences (previously the National Institute of Oceanography) (Clarke, 1969 a; Baker et al. 1973).

40|$|Commercial {{fisheries}} {{are heavily}} {{dependent upon the}} combustion of fossil fuels and as such contribute to increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and the concomitant impact on the world's climate. The fuel use and greenhouse gas intensity of a fishery {{is a function of}} several variables. One that has not been previously investigated is the role of fisheries management. Using historical gear-specific fuel use and landings data, we employ scenarios to examine the potential impact that recent changes in the management of the New England fishery for Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) may have on fishery-related fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, we consider the direct effect of the seasonal ban of <b>midwater</b> <b>trawling</b> in favor of purse seine and fixed gears within Atlantic herring fishing Area 1 A. We also evaluate the indirect effect of reductions to the Area 1 A total allowable catch of Atlantic herring on the regional supply of bait and the resulting potential need to import bait herring from Canada. Our results indicate that because of the five-fold lower fuel intensity of purse seining, relative to <b>midwater</b> <b>trawling</b> (21 L/ton versus 108 - 118 L/ton), the seasonal ban on <b>midwater</b> <b>trawling</b> has the potential to markedly reduce overall fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the herring fishery. These results indicate that management decisions can strongly influence energy demands and resulting greenhouse gas emissions of fisheries. We urge those involved with fisheries management to take this into account when developing policy and management measures. Fisheries management Fuel Greenhouse gas Trawl Purse seine Herring...|$|R
