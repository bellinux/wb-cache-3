2500|$|On the August19, 2005 {{episode of}} Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Cramer {{explained}} {{the origin of}} boo-yah: [...] "Here's what happened: A guy calls me on <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> <b>show,</b> and he says 'You made me a 100 smackers on K-Mart – a hundred points...' – he's from New Orleans – '...and we have one word for that down here and it's boo-yah. Then the next guy calls and he says 'you know you made {{me a lot of}} money on [...] so: boo-yah!' And now they all say it. It's not my rap".|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{problem for}} all too {{many women who}} call in to <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> <b>show,</b> though, is that they just can't get that {{reciprocation}} from men, and women then end up feeling disappointed, disenfranchised, and disillusioned by their failed relationships." ...|$|E
5000|$|Intuition, as Foxx {{describes}} it, {{will focus}} on the needs and wants of the opposite sex. [...] "On <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> <b>show</b> I have this panel of beautiful women and they were talking about how men with a lot of money aren't all that. But if a guy has no money, that's no good either,” Foxx explained. [...] "So I was thinking, What does a woman want? We go from there and build the story and the songs." ...|$|E
50|$|Then, I got <b>my</b> own <b>radio</b> <b>show,</b> which I just {{mentioned}} was fifteen minutes, five nights a week, which Frank Sinatra followed, {{and we knew}} each other pretty well. Me with my little white socks, he with his long pants, but he had just left the Tommy Dorsey Band and I came in at 11:00 with Walter Gross' Orchestra, a seventeen-piece live band. I rehearsed during the afternoon, {{and there was a}} commercial break of about sixty seconds, and Frank Sinatra came in at 11:15. He was billed as the voice that is thrilling millions.|$|R
5000|$|... “First and foremost, {{we wanted}} to try to do more to promote the sorts of filthy rock'n'roll that we liked (as well as {{featured}} on <b>my</b> old <b>radio</b> <b>show)</b> but that most people have never heard simply because they don’t seek it out, have never been exposed to it before, or can't hear my show for one reason or another. And having one central website where people could gather, discuss, share, and promote this music was essential. Secondly, {{we wanted to}} encourage {{each and every one of}} you to support your local independently owned record stores, mailorder sites, and especially the indie labels that produce the vast majority of music featured on GaragePunk Pirate Radio.” Jeff “Kopper” Kopp ...|$|R
5000|$|Una Mullally of The Irish Times {{described}} how [...] "Bottom of the Barrel {{brought me back}} to some of <b>my</b> favourite <b>radio</b> <b>shows,</b> shows where you felt {{there was a real}} connection between both the people in studio and the presenters with their audience", comparing it to Sara Cox on The <b>Radio</b> 1 Breakfast <b>Show</b> and Rick O'Shea. She said that the show [...] "is making me listen to 2fm again" [...] and that [...] "and King's chemistry is fantastic, their references and asides are brilliant and their indignant outsiderness is hilarious". The Sunday Independent Eilis O'Hanlon described the programme as [...] "far more entertaining" [...] than Breakfast Republic, 2fm's breakfast show. Writing for JOE.ie, Joe Harrington described Chris and Ciara podcasts as [...] "weird, clever, current and very funny".|$|R
5000|$|Stein {{quotes from}} {{a passage in}} Darwin's writing that appears to endorse the notion that for a species to thrive the infirm must be culled. He omits the part where Darwin insists this would be [...] "evil" [...] and that man's care for the weak is [...] "the noblest part of our nature." [...] When I asked Stein about this on <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> <b>show</b> he deadpanned, [...] "If any Darwin fans are {{listening}} and we have misquoted him, we are sorry; we don't mean to diss Darwin." ...|$|E

5000|$|On June 2, WTEM {{announced}} that Kornheiser would do his last show on WTEM {{near the end}} of June 2016. Kornheiser said that he would launch a podcast in September 2016. Kornheiser said in a statement, “I have loved every minute on the radio at WTEM, but I felt it was time to pursue a new and appealing challenge. I will be launching a podcast this September. I am excited that this endeavor will allow me to continue to work with so {{many of the people who}} have been a part of <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> <b>show</b> for over the past 20 years. But I will miss all of my friends and colleagues at WTEM.” On Kornheiser's last show aired on June 28, 2016, Kornheiser said, ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{some critics}} gave the record a more lukewarm reception, even {{they could not}} hold back completely. Bettie Lou Vegas at Ink19 listened to the record and wrote: [...] "Seven Storey is {{something}} I would have played into the ground in 1993. While I don't salivate over it now in 2002, it's still quite good." [...] Scott at Punknews.org didn't find that record passé, instead {{he felt that the}} band might have had more to give. In his review, he wrote that [...] "The album definitely has strong points with tracks like 'Unknown Satellite' and 'Dress Rehearsal,' but the majority {{of the rest of the}} album only displays the band's potential. Give this band 5 more years with this new lineup and I bet they'll be able to do something amazing. Until then, they're be in semi-heavy rotation on <b>my</b> college <b>radio</b> <b>show,</b> because that's where good rock like this belongs." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to remaining {{as a key}} member of the Frontier until 2006, Ho hosted weekly radio programmes on two local radio stations in 2006 - on RTHK and PRHK.

40|$|This {{creative}} project combines {{several key}} elements that current successful <b>radio</b> stations and <b>shows</b> undergo {{to maximize their}} profits, increase listeners, and build a strong fan base: on-air work, promotions, sales, and web design. Major radio stations have many employees who diverge their effort into running each specific department. Station disc jockeys focus on the on-air responsibilities; marketing or promotional directors manage all promotional events and branding opportunities; account executives and managers are responsible for all advertising avenues; and webmasters are given the job of keeping an up-to-date and exciting website. Having had background in all four areas through work and school at Ball State, I decided to expand <b>my</b> current <b>radio</b> <b>show</b> duties on college radio WCRD 91. 3 FM to include more on-air preparation, undergo a promotional campaign on the Ball State campus, sell show and segment sponsorship, and design and maintain a professional show website. The following portfolio {{is a collection of}} my work in each area. The on-air portion includes program schedules, audio segments, and show highlights. The promotional part features all of the flyers that were used in the campaign, pictures of Adam Adler Show t-shirts, and static stickers. Sales includes the sales materials used in my presentations and signed contracts from my three sponsors. The web area has several pages from the website and emails and guest book signings from show listeners. This creative project has taught me about the effort of successful radio stations and gave me invaluable real world experience. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} Miller {{showed no}} concern over whether his political stance {{had made him}} less popular or robbed him of the credit of popularizing comedic rants, saying [...] "I'm a 58-year-old man and I’m happy where I’m at. I don’t think about any of that. I go on O’Reilly once a week, I do <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> <b>show</b> and I {{go on the road}} about 20 dates a year. I've winnowed my crowd down to a select few who can support me. If you’re 58 and you’re still worrying about whether you're popular, what are you, in eighth grade? I must have started in earnest when I was 25 so I’m working on a quarter century here. I still talk and they give me green rectangles." [...] Miller told another interviewer that he thinks about half of America likes him and the other half hate him, but he has become comfortable with that, [...] "I used to want everybody to like me, but as you get older you can see there's {{something to be said for}} agitating your enemies." ...|$|E
40|$|As host of The Space <b>Show,</b> <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> talk <b>show</b> {{focusing}} on expanding space commerce, space tourism, and Mars exploration, I frequently receive questions and queries from the program’s listeners. The overriding {{theme of this}} listener feedback strongly suggests that {{a significant part of}} the population does not understand the need for a space program that facilitates the development of space resources, space tourism, a human Mars mission, or even acknowledges the benefits derived from a successful space program. Clearly, space advocates, specific space program proponents, and even NASA do not successfully articulate the case for space development to a wide segment of our population. This paper addresses the feedback received from listeners since starting The Space Show (formerly Business Without Boundaries) in June 2001. In addressing the issues raised by the listening audience, recommendations are offered for how best to both talk with and inform the general public about the importance of having an expanded space program, including a new off-Earth economy resulting from a much expanded commercial space industry. Developing a space economy and space resources requires widespread public support and constructive policymaking. Obtaining this support and enabling the creation of constructive space policies may largely depend on those in the space community doing a better job in helping the public to understand the benefits of space development. The recommendations contained in this paper can serve as a useful and productive guide to winning public support as well as influencing policy makers for the benefit of off-Earth commerce and opportunities...|$|R

40|$|I {{closed my}} eyes and rested a bit while I listened to the <b>radio</b> on <b>my</b> Walkman, trying to gear up for the day ahead. As the bus left the borough of Manhattan and entered The Bronx, the scenery changed and became more industrial; grittier and grimier. Yet on that day, it {{actually}} did not look as bad because the day was so glori-ous. There were many 18 -wheelers on the road and road construction was omnipresent. The bus stopped and started again as it navigated the rough terrain. We were just approaching my stop by the hospital as I tuned <b>my</b> <b>radio</b> to the then Howard Stern <b>radio</b> <b>show</b> for some last minute laughs before heading into the harsh emotional reality of the HIV clinic [...] . little did I know how harsh emotional reality would come to be on this day...|$|R

5000|$|... »Olena Chekan {{came into}} journalism from the theater. Her {{favorite}} activity was to recite poetry. The golden rule of journalism {{is to keep}} balance. Olena often neglected this rule and that’s why readers loved her: she was answering emotions with emotions. She didn’t just formally ask her questions during the interviews, she was talking with her heroes {{as if it were}} a private conversation. For people to interview, she always chose those she found interesting. We had multisided relations with Olena. She was my editor at the Ukrayinskiy Tyzhden (The Ukrainian Week) weekly, and a sensitive and attentive one. She was also my interviewer (we talked about radio art, wine culture and Ukraine). She was my author (she told about her favorite music at <b>my</b> Above Boundaries <b>radio</b> <b>show).</b> And, finally, she was my pen-friend. I liked to receive her letters; they were always clever, witty, ironic and lyrical. I remember very well her essays about her trips; I remember her voice and her laughter. I often feel that I wish to write her a letter and then to wait for her reply. All her letters sent to me were signed by her with an English letter [...] "F". I was the only one who knew that this letter was for the word [...] "forever" [...] (Eternity). And she remained for me like this - [...] "forever".« ...|$|R
