5|$|The Portuguese {{government}} forced black <b>Mozambican</b> {{farmers to}} grow rice or cotton for export, providing little return {{with which the}} farmers could support themselves. Many other workers—over 250,000 by 1960—were pressured to work on coal and gold mines, in neighbouring territories, mainly in South Africa, where they comprised over 30% of black underground miners. By 1950, only 4,353 Mozambicans out of 5,733,000 had been granted {{the right to vote}} by the Portuguese colonial government. The rift between Portuguese settlers and <b>Mozambican</b> locals is illustrated in one way by the small number of people with mixed Portuguese and <b>Mozambican</b> heritage (mestiço), numbering only 31,465 in a population of 8–10 million in 1960 according to that year's census.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia's {{strategic}} position underwent {{a fundamental change}} in June 1975 when the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the <b>Mozambican</b> ports of Beira and Maputo. Initially, the new <b>Mozambican</b> government allowed the Rhodesians continued use of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Clandestine {{trade with}} other nations continued, {{initially}} at a reduced level; among other things, Portugal illicitly labelled unsold Rhodesian tobacco as <b>Mozambican</b> product, then sold it on Salisbury's behalf in Europe and Asia. Through this {{and a series of}} similar sanction-busting operations Rhodesia avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson, and, with the help of South Africa and Portugal, gradually became more self-sufficient. Aiming to directly cut off the main supply lines of oil to Rhodesia, namely the Portuguese <b>Mozambican</b> ports at Beira and Lourenço Marques, Wilson set up the Beira Patrol, a Royal Navy squadron based in the Mozambique Channel, in March 1966. This blockade was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. Too small to cover both Beira and Lourenço Marques, and unable to legally fire on tankers once they were in Portuguese waters, the patrol met with little success, but it endured regardless for nearly a decade.|$|E
50|$|Mozambique has {{extraordinary}} enthnolinguistic diversity, with no {{one language}} dominating demographically. Portuguese serves as a lingua franca allowing communication of <b>Mozambicans</b> with fellow citizens of other ethnicities, including especially white <b>Mozambicans.</b> Of those <b>Mozambicans</b> who speak Portuguese, the majority are non-native speakers, thus spoken with accents of African languages. The lack of native speakers is due, in part, to the exodus of massive number of white <b>Mozambicans</b> to places such as Portugal, South Africa, and Brazil and {{to the fact that}} the country is far from the rest of the Lusosphere. This left very few native speakers of Portuguese in Mozambique.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Mozambican</b> War of Independence was {{an armed}} {{conflict}} between the guerrilla forces of the Mozambique Liberation Front or FRELIMO (Frente de Libertação de Moçambique), and Portugal. The war officially started on September 25, 1964, and ended with a ceasefire on September 8, 1974, resulting in a negotiated independence in 1975.|$|E
5|$|A mass exile of Mozambique's {{political}} intelligentsia to neighbouring countries provided havens {{from which}} radical Mozambicans could plan actions and foment political unrest in their homeland. The {{formation of the}} <b>Mozambican</b> guerrilla organisation FRELIMO {{and the support of}} the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Tanzania, Zambia, Egypt, Algeria and Gaddafi regime in Libya through arms and advisers, led to the outbreak of violence that was to last over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that <b>Mozambican</b> {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E

5|$|Portugal's wars against {{independence}} guerrilla {{fighters in}} its 400-year-old African territories began in 1961 with Angola. In Mozambique, the conflict erupted in 1964 {{as a result}} of unrest and frustration amongst many indigenous <b>Mozambican</b> populations, who perceived foreign rule to be a form of exploitation and mistreatment, which served only to further Portuguese economic interests in the region. Many Mozambicans also resented Portugal's policies towards indigenous people, which resulted in discrimination, traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many Africans, and limited access to Portuguese-style education and skilled employment.|$|E
5|$|Samora Machel became Mozambique's first president. The Reverend Uria Simango, his wife, {{and other}} FRELIMO dissidents {{were arrested in}} 1975 and {{detained}} without trial. Within about two years, fighting resumed with the <b>Mozambican</b> Civil War against RENAMO insurgents plied with Rhodesian and South African military support. Industrial and social recession, Marxist-style totalitarianism, corruption, poverty, inequality and failed central planning eroded the initial revolutionary fervour. Peace returned only in 1992, when the nation achieved relative stability {{for the first time}} in several decades.|$|E
5|$|Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the Portuguese Communist Party, which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist the colonial wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as the attack on the Tancos air base that destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a <b>Mozambican</b> province) was preparing to leave Lisbon with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the Carnation Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E
50|$|The {{power of}} the Niassa Company {{was based on the}} chibalo system, a forced labor policy, which forced the <b>Mozambicans</b> to work on plantations, cotton fields and on public works projects. Additionally <b>Mozambicans</b> were forced to pay hut taxes that kept them in debt. The chibalo system enabled the Niassa Company to {{establish}} plantations and to force peasants to work for them and prevent them from growing their own crops for sale.|$|R

5|$|Biko married Ntsiki Mashalaba in December 1970. They had two {{children}} together: Nkosinathi, born in 1971, and Samora, born in 1975. Biko's wife chose the name Nkosinathi ("The Lord is with us"), and Biko named their second child after the <b>Mozambican</b> revolutionary leader Samora Machel. Angered by her husband's serial adultery, Mashalaba ultimately moved out of their home, {{and by the time}} of his death, she had begun divorce proceedings. Biko had also begun an extra-marital relationship with Mamphela Ramphele. In 1974, she bore him a daughter, Lerato, who died after two months. A son, Hlumelo, was born to Ramphele in 1978, after Biko's death. Biko was also in a relationship with Lorrain Tabane, who bore him a child named Motlatsi in 1977.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, the Royal Rhodesian Air Force was an {{important}} export customer of Britain, purchasing not only Hunters but also De Havilland Vampires and Canberra bombers. Rhodesia later deployed its Hunter FGA.9s extensively against ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas during the Rhodesian Bush War in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, occasionally engaging in cross-border raids over Zambia and Mozambique. The Zimbabwean Air Force Hunters were flown to support Laurent Kabila's loyalists during the Second Congo War, and were reported {{to be involved in}} the <b>Mozambican</b> Civil War. In Somalia, the Siad Barre regime's fleet of ageing Hunters, often piloted by former Rhodesian servicemen, carried out several bombing missions against rebel units in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|San {{hunter and}} gatherers, {{ancestors}} of the Khoisani peoples, were the first known inhabitants of the region that is now Mozambique, followed in the 1st and 4th centuries by Bantu-speaking peoples who migrated there across the Zambezi River. In 1498, Portuguese explorers landed on the <b>Mozambican</b> coastline. Portugal's influence in East Africa grew throughout the 16th century; she established several colonies known collectively as Portuguese East Africa. Slavery and gold became profitable for the Europeans; influence was largely exercised through individual settlers {{and there was no}} centralised administration and, in the meantime, Portugal had turned her attention to India and Brazil.|$|E

5|$|While Hudah {{was located}} in the Mozambique Channel, the cyclone was {{expected}} to cause flood conditions in the <b>Mozambican</b> provinces of Nampula, Cabo Delgado, and potentially Zambezia. Even prior to Hudah, Mozambique was already facing a widespread flood and resultant humanitarian crisis; conditions which were further exacerbated by three tropical cyclones which impacted the country within the previous four months. The Instituto Nacional de Gestão de Calamidades(INGC) warned residents in potentially affected areas to take precautionary measures and secure fishing boats. The South African National Defense Force(SANDF) maintained 50soldiers and other military personnel {{and a number of}} aircraft to monitor the ongoing floods in Mozambique and potential impacts from Hudah. An Australian contingency held operations for a hospital and water purification plant in Chibuto to assist potentially affected populations. Multiple other relief organizations began to supply Mozambique with relief supplies due to the threat of the impending storm. The UN World Food Programme(WFP) sent 1,000tonnes (1,100short tons) of food to Nampula Province and 500tonnes (550short tons) of food to Quelimane Province. The WFP also placed relief aircraft on standby. The <b>Mozambican</b> Ministry of Health sent 30tents and 10rolls of plastic to Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Zambezia provinces. The United States Agency for International Development(USAID) dispatched a group of 12-member search and rescue team to Maputo in order to train local relief crews.|$|E
5|$|While in power, Rajoelina {{periodically}} {{engaged in}} ongoing negotiations to establish {{conditions under which}} {{free and fair elections}} could be held to restore government constitutionality and legitimacy {{in the eyes of the}} international community. On 4 August 2009 Rajoelina met with former Madagascar presidents Ravalomanana, Ratsiraka and Zafy along with former <b>Mozambican</b> President Joaquim Chissano acting as mediator at the four-day mediation crisis talks held in Maputo, Mozambique. The Maputo Accords signed by the four leaders in August and further accords signed in Addis-Abeba in November provided guidelines for a period of consensual political transition. In the months that followed, however, Rajoelina obstructed the implementation of the accords, making unilateral political decisions and filling all important government posts with TGV party representatives.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} standpoint, the Portuguese regular army held {{the upper hand}} during the conflict against the independentist guerrilla forces. Nonetheless, Mozambique succeeded in achieving independence on June 25, 1975, after a civil resistance movement known as the Carnation Revolution backed by portions {{of the military in}} Portugal overthrow the military dictatorship sponsored by US, thus ending 470 years of Portuguese colonial rule in the East African region. According to historians of the Revolution, the military coup in Portugal was in part fuelled by protests concerning the conduct of Portuguese troops in their treatment of some local <b>Mozambican</b> populace. The role of the growing communist influence over the group of Portuguese military insurgents who led the Lisbon's military coup, and, on the other hand, the pressure of the international community over the direction of the Portuguese Colonial War in general, were main causes for the final outcome.|$|E

5|$|In December 1994, Mandela {{published}} Long Walk to Freedom, {{an autobiography}} based around a manuscript {{he had written}} in prison, augmented by interviews conducted with American journalist Richard Stengel. In late 1994, he attended the 49th conference of the ANC in Bloemfontein, at which a more militant national executive was elected, among them Winnie Mandela; although she {{expressed an interest in}} reconciling, Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995. By 1995, he had entered into a relationship with Graça Machel, a <b>Mozambican</b> political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel. They had first met in July 1990 when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits. She turned down Mandela's first marriage proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing her time between Mozambique and Johannesburg.|$|E
5|$|Realising the {{symbolic}} {{significance of the}} dam to the Portuguese, FRELIMO proceeded to spend seven years attempting to halt its construction by force. No direct attacks were ever successful, but FRELIMO had some success in attacking convoys {{en route to the}} site. FRELIMO also lodged a protest with the United Nations about the project, and their cause was aided by negative reports of Portuguese actions in Mozambique. In spite of the subsequent withdrawal of much foreign financial support for the dam, it was finally completed in December 1974. The dam's intended propaganda value to the Portuguese was overshadowed by the adverse <b>Mozambican</b> public reaction to the extensive dispersal of the indigenous populace, who were forced to relocate from their homes to allow for the construction project. The dam also deprived farmers of the critical annual floods, which formerly re-fertilised the plantations.|$|E
5|$|Covert coordinated efforts {{between the}} Rhodesian and Portuguese Armed Forces had started in 1967, {{and soon after}} Cauldron ended, the RLI was {{involved}} in a joint operation in Mozambique. A group of 17 Lusaka-based nationalists infiltrated Mozambique's north-western Tete Province, between Rhodesia and Malawi, in April 1968. Their presence was reported to Portuguese authorities on 20 May by local tribesmen from Catumbula, a small village just north of the Mazoe River, which in that area ran along the border with Rhodesia. A Portuguese patrol contacted and scattered the guerrillas the next day. The nationalist fighters, split into two groups, then moved towards Rhodesia, one team heading south-west and the other south. Acting on information given by the Portuguese, the Rhodesians started Operation Flotilla, based at the border town of Nyamapanda, on 23 May. 1 Commando, RLI was sent out on patrol the same day under Major Peter Rich. However, no trace of the insurgents was reported by Rich's men, apart from the tracks of six men on the northern (<b>Mozambican)</b> side of the Mazoe River. The cadres had not actually left Mozambique; a counter-insurgency effort by the Portuguese military and police resulted in most of them being captured or killed. Six who did eventually cross into Rhodesia in early June were captured by the BSAP.|$|E
