25|$|When the {{genocide}} in Rwanda began in April 1994, some delegates of MSF {{working in the}} country were incorporated into the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> <b>for</b> protection. Both groups succeeded in keeping all main hospitals in Rwanda's capital Kigali operational throughout the main period of {{the genocide}}. MSF, together with several other aid organisations, {{had to leave the}} country in 1995, although many MSF and ICRC volunteers worked together under the ICRC's rules of engagement, which held that neutrality was of the utmost importance. These events led to a debate within the organisation about the concept of balancing neutrality of humanitarian aid workers against their witnessing role. As a result of its Rwanda mission, the position of MSF with respect to neutrality moved closer to that of the ICRC, a remarkable development {{in the light of the}} origin of the organisation.|$|E

5000|$|In early 1935 Empey, {{concerned}} about the growing influence of World Communism in America with its potential for civil strife, and still possessing social connections with the Hollywood film production community, organised a volunteer paramilitary uniformed militia cavalry unit called the Hollywood Hussars, styling himself as its Colonel. As well as a horse-cavalry arm (ostensibly organized around the sport of polo) the unit possessed a <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> <b>for</b> the treatment of casualties, a signals team, motor-cycle dispatch riders, military style police and an intelligence unit. How the organization funded itself was obscure, but there were persistent rumours of the covert involvement of William Randolph Hearst. [...] On its membership roll was Victor McLaglen (who also possessed his own militia unit at that time called The California Light Horse Regiment), Gary Cooper, Ward Bond, with Ted Parsons as its personnel officer. The Hollywood Hussars' charter specifically forbade any involvement with opposing labour disputes, however Empey briefed the press that they were: [...] "Armed to the teeth and ready to gallop within an hour on horseback to any emergency threatening {{the safety of the}} community. Fights or strikes, floods, earthquakes, war, a Japanese invasion or a Communistic revolution." [...] Headquartered at the Hollywood Athletic Club, they described themselves as a volunteer [...] "military-social unit, devoted to the advancement of American ideals". Gary Cooper quit the unit a few months after joining following attacks upon it by the left-wing press with calls for targeted boycotts of his films, publicly stating that: [...] "the Hussars are not the social group that I had thought they were, the men behind it are trying to organize a national, semi-military organization of a political nature". In response, Empey confirmed that it was his intention to expand the organization nationally, but denied that it was politically driven or in sympathy with the Fascist movements that were engulfing the European continent at that time ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Complex {{and chronic}} illnesses, such as Cancer demand {{the use of}} {{specialist}} treatment protocols, administered and monitored by a co-ordinated team of professionals. Home based care of chronic illnesses (e. g. cancer patients) {{by a team of}} professionals is often a necessity, due to the protracted length of the illness. Hospital based treatment is limited, often demand based for short periods of time. As it is not possible for the health care team to be physically present by the patient at all times, or at any time physically together, whilst the patient is undergoing treatment, a principal aim of the current project is to overcome this problem, through DITIS 1, (∆ΙΤΗΣ, in Greek). DITIS is a system that supports Virtual <b>Medical</b> <b>Teams</b> dealing with the home-healthcare of cancer patients in Cyprus. It aims to support the creation, management and co-ordination of virtual <b>medical</b> <b>teams,</b> <b>for</b> the continuos treatment of the patient at home, and if need for periodic visits to places of specialist treatment and back home...|$|R

40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Homeland Security Affairs (June 2007), v. 3 no. 2 The world is threatened with a pandemic, an event {{considered to be}} the greatest public health risk, with the potential to kill as many as forty to fifty million people, sicken hundreds of millions, and significantly impact the global economy. Countries and health organizations throughout the world are monitoring the threat and developing strategic plans and systems to prepare for the inevitable and possibly imminent event of a pandemic. The United States has made it a national priority to develop strategic plans to coordinate preparedness and response efforts at the federal, state, and local levels. A relatively small but critical aspect within these plans calls for the utilization of the National Disaster Medical System's civilian-based <b>medical</b> <b>teams,</b> to assist state and local governments {{in the event of a}} pandemic. Generally, past deployments of these federal assets have had positive results; however, the reliance on these civilian-based <b>medical</b> <b>teams</b> <b>for</b> response in a pandemic is unsound. The medical professionals, who primarily comprise the team, may be reluctant to participate in a pandemic due to the increased health risks to themselves and their families. Moreover, the hospitals and medical systems that employ these civilian responders may be unwilling or unable to allow their participation in the federal response system. The federal government should reconsider its reliance on this civilian-based resource in the event of a pandemic, and focus instead on enhancing existing state and local public health and medical capabilities and resources...|$|R
