5|$|In 1995, Toriyama {{detailed}} the equipment he used for Dragon Ball. He used a G-pen nib by Zebra, usually getting three chapters {{out of one}} because he typically does not press down hard. Toriyama used black drawing ink made by Pilot, but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten-year-old fine point Tenshōdō brush. His whiteout was also made by Luma. He received free Kent paper, similar to Bristol board, from a seller connected to Shueisha, and used a 0.5mm 2B lead <b>mechanical</b> <b>pencil</b> and a wide ruler at least 30cm long.|$|E
25|$|Off Beat is {{hand-drawn}} by Quick on Bristol {{paper with}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>pencil,</b> micron pens, India ink and brush. Initially, toning {{was done by}} hand, but issues with moiré led Quick to screentone using Adobe Photoshop, with each page checked by her editor in light of persistent problems. While freelancing for Central Park Media, she found lettering with Adobe Illustrator frustrating, and opted to have Tokyopop's Vanessa Satone oversee the process for Off Beat instead.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{carbon-based}} compounds like graphene {{have also}} been proposed. First identified in the nineteenth century, an easy method of producing graphene was not available until 2004. Being a particular form of carbon, graphene typically exists in its stable form of graphite, a widely used material in many applications – the lead in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>pencil</b> being an example. When a single monolayer of carbon atoms is extracted from nonconductive bulk graphite, electrical properties are observed contributing to semiconductor behavior, making it a viable substitute for silicon. More research {{will need to be}} performed, however, on sub 50nm graphene layers, as its resistivity value increases and thus electron mobility decreases.|$|E

500|$|After {{developing}} a loose plot together, Joshua wrote the full scripts and suggested layouts. Ultra {{was the first}} comic book Joshua wrote. From there, Jonathan did the pencils by hand with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>pencil</b> and inks with a Micron pen. After scanning the inked artwork and editing it where needed on a Wacom tablet, he would add the colors and letters. He worked at an average rate of one page per day. They {{were able to make}} one full issue every four weeks. The Lunas described the creation of Ultra as [...] "organic", admitting they had a plan but saying they [...] "figured out a lot of things as [...] were doing them". A plot synopsis and a five-page sample of the comic was submitted blindly to and accepted by Image Comics publisher Erik Larsen.|$|E

50|$|In {{spite of}} the name, pencil leads do not contain the toxic {{chemical}} element lead, but are typically made with graphite and clay, or plastic polymers. Compared to standard <b>pencils,</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>pencils</b> have a smaller range of marking types, though numerous variations exist. Most <b>mechanical</b> <b>pencils</b> can be refilled, but some inexpensive models {{are meant to be}} disposable and are discarded when empty.|$|R

5000|$|Mechanical pencils {{dispense}} the graphite lead progressively {{during use}} and thus {{do not require}} sharpening; such pencils are sometimes called [...] "self-sharpening". A type of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pencil</b> has a rotating gear mechanism which rotates the lead slightly every time the lead is lifted off the paper, helping to maintain a consistent, sharp point. If a finer or broader line is needed, a separate <b>mechanical</b> <b>pencil</b> using a lead with a different diameter is required.|$|E
