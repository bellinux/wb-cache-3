50|$|Oil {{recovered}} from the Inglewood field is processed onsite to remove water and gas. Produced water - water pumped up from the formation along with the oil - is reinjected into the formation {{by means of a}} series of water injection wells scattered throughout the oilfield. Gas is processed onsite to remove hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants, and once it is of marketable quality is sold to the Southern California Gas Company. Oil after processing is temporarily stored in tank farms onsite and <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> to the sales facility in the northeastern part of the oil field, immediately south of the Community Center at Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. Oil is sold and transported away from the field in a pipeline owned by Chevron to area refineries where it is mostly made into gasoline for sale in the Southern California market.|$|E
50|$|Coal {{pipelines}} are pipelines used {{to transport}} coal {{from where it}} is mined to where it is consumed. For very short distances, large trucks are used to transport coal, but trains and barges are preferred for long distances. In some cases it is more economical to <b>move</b> the coal <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> than <b>by</b> train or barge. This can happen {{when there is no}} suitable railway or waterway to transport the coal, or when it must be moved very long distances.|$|R
50|$|The BP Oil Terminal at Hamble, {{linked to}} Fawley <b>by</b> <b>pipeline,</b> {{provides}} {{storage and distribution}} facilities for crude oil and refined petroleum products.

50|$|Large {{quantities}} of fluid feedstock or product may enter or leave a plant <b>by</b> <b>pipeline,</b> railroad tank car, or tanker truck. For example, petroleum commonly {{comes to a}} refinery <b>by</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Pipelines can also carry petrochemical feedstock from a refinery to a nearby petrochemical plant. Natural gas is a product which comes {{all the way from}} a natural gas processing plant to final consumers <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> or tubing. Large {{quantities of}} liquid feedstock are typically pumped into process units. Smaller quantities of feedstock or product may be shipped to or from a plant in drums. Use of drums about 55 gallons in capacity is common for packaging industrial quantities of chemicals. Smaller batches of feedstock may be added from drums or other containers to process units by workers.|$|R

50|$|Refineries {{which use}} {{a large amount}} of steam and cooling water need to have an {{abundant}} source of water. Oil refineries therefore are often located nearby navigable rivers or on a sea shore, nearby a port. Such location also gives access to transportation by river or by sea. The advantages of transporting crude oil <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> are evident, and oil companies often transport a large volume of fuel to distribution terminals <b>by</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Pipeline may not be practical for products with small output, and rail cars, road tankers, and barges are used.|$|R

50|$|Freight {{transport}} {{has undergone}} similar changes, increasing in volume and shifting from railways onto the road. In 1953 89 billion tonne kilometres of goods were moved, with rail accounting for 42%, road 36% and water 22%. By 2010 {{the volume of}} freight moved had more than doubled to 222 billion tonne kilometres, of which 9% was <b>moved</b> <b>by</b> rail, 19% by water, 5% <b>by</b> <b>pipeline</b> and 68% <b>by</b> road. Despite the growth in tonne kilometres, the environmental external costs of trucks and lorries in the UK have reportedly decreased. Between 1990 and 2000, {{there has been a}} move to heavier goods vehicles due to major changes in the haulage industry including a shift in sales to larger articulated vehicles. A larger than average fleet turnover has ensured a swift introduction of new and cleaner vehicles in the UK.|$|R
