5000|$|Mother {{of vinegar}} is a {{substance}} {{composed of a}} form of cellulose and acetic acid bacteria that develops on fermenting alcoholic liquids, which turns alcohol into acetic acid {{with the help of}} oxygen from the air. It is added to wine, cider, or other alcoholic liquids to produce vinegar. Mother of vinegar is also known as <b>Mycoderma</b> <b>aceti,</b> a New Latin expression, from the Greek μὑκης ("fungus") plus δἐρμα ("skin"), and the Latin aceti ("of the acid"). [...] The naming of the bacteria has been rather fluid due to its original identification near the inception of bacteriology. Currently, the preferred naming is Acetobacter aceti.|$|E
