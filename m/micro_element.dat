40|$|We {{present a}} new hybrid method for dilute gas flows that couples a continuum- fluid {{description}} to the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique. Instead {{of using a}} domain-decomposition framework, we adopt a heterogeneous approach with micro resolution that can capture non-equilibrium or non-continuum fluid behaviour both close to bounding walls and in the bulk. A continuum-fluid model is applied across the entire domain, while DSMC is applied in spatially-distributed micro regions. Using a field-wise coupling approach, each <b>micro</b> <b>element</b> provides a local correction to a continuum sub- region, the dimensions of which are identical to the <b>micro</b> <b>element</b> itself. Interpolating this local correction between the micro elements then produces a correction {{that can be applied}} over the entire continuum domain. Key advantages of this method include its suitability for flow problems with varying degrees of scale separation, and that the location of the micro elements is not restricted to the nodes of the computational mesh. Also, the size of the micro elements adapts dynamically with the local molecular mean free path. We demonstrate the method on heat transfer problems in dilute gas flows, where the coupling is performed through the computed heat fluxes. Our test case is micro Fourier flow over a range of rarefaction and temperature conditions: this case is simple enough to enable validation against a pure DSMC simulation, and our results show that the hybrid method can deal with both missing boundary and constitutive information...|$|E

Iron is used in chlorophyll synthesis which is found in chloroplast, the organelle that contributes to increase in biomass of the plant, deficiency of iron causes chlorosis in leaves where they appear yellowish instead of green.

Twelve novel legume species were grown for a period of 42 weeks under glasshouse conditions at Lincoln University in an acidic high country soil (Ashwick stoney / bolder silt loam) from the Lees Valley (North Canterbury). Phosphorus was applied at eight rates (0, 10, 30, 60, 100, 250, 500, 1500 mg P kg⁻¹ soil) while lime (100 % CaCO₃) was applied at five rates (0, 2, 5, 8, 15 t ha⁻¹ equivalent).

Reaching of high green (over 80 t ha- 1) and dry matter yield (approx. 20 t ha- 1) with low investment during all period of utilization makes alfalfa production very economical. Divergent selection materials were used to create high productive domestic alfalfa cultivars with excellent field persistence, which is important factor for high and stable yield during entire exploitation period. On the other hand, alfalfa is {{a rich source of}} crude protein with excellent digestibility. Proteins from alfalfa herbage are the cheapest source of protein in animal feed. Content of crude protein strongly depend on development stage of plant material and can be 200 to 240 g kg- 1 DM, while crude protein yield can be over 3. 5 t ha- 1. Besides that, alfalfa herbage had a high content of macro and <b>micro</b> <b>element,</b> which are so important for animal health.

Materials and methods: We collected samples from 100 people aged 21 – 55. 40 persons were healthy, 46 were HIV infected. HIV infected patients have been divided into 3 groups according to CD 4 cellscount: more than 500, 200 – 499, less than 200. Neutron activation analysis (NAA) was used to detectmicroelements in the hair.

Levels of I, Au,Hg, Sr were higherthan in healthy persons, Cr, Mn, Zn, U levels were normal. Levels of K was decreased 5 times and Ni wasdecreased 2 times compare to norm.

The first factor is kinds of manure fertilizer (no manure fertlizer as control/K 0, cow faeces/K 1, chicken faeces/K 2, and goat faeces/K 3 manure fertilizer 3 tons/ha respectively), and the second one is urea dose (N 0 /No urea fertilizer as controll, N 1 / 92 kg/ha, N 2 / 184 kg/ha, and N 3 / 276 kg/ha). Each of the combination factor was three times replicated. The result of the research could be concluded that (1) The interaction between kinds of manure fertilizer and urea fertilizer dose occur on the plant dry weight at 60 days age, the root dry weight at 60 days age, the leave area at 40 dats age, the leave are index at 40 days age, The relative growth rate at 60 and 80 dats age, and no interaction in N absorption (The difference of N absorption just on the urea dose and kinds of manure fertilizer separately) and no interaction in yield of maize (2) The best growth of maize P- 11 hybrid was obtained by the combination treatment of cow manure fertilizer 3 tons/ha and urea fertilizer 184 kg/ha (3) Also for the best quality of yield (1000 seed dry weight) and the highest production were obtained that dose...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} air {{pollution}} in Quetta city was determined on heavy traffic areas using roadside trees as an indicator. The leaves of Cupressus sp., Fraxinus excelsior, Pinus longifolia, Rubinea pseudoaccasia were collected and analyzed for their macro, <b>micro</b> <b>elements</b> and heavy metal concentration. These elements were detected and estimated by using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Significantly high contents of zinc, manganese, lead and cadmium were found. These are highly toxic for all living systems. The common source of these elements on tree leaves is motor vehicles. M. A. Jinnah road {{was found to be}} most polluted...|$|R

40|$|In {{a two-year}} field {{experiment}} we used leaf analysis {{to evaluate the}} effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi {{on the content of}} some macro elements (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and <b>micro</b> <b>elements</b> (Zn, Mn, Fe) in grapevine leaves at the beginning of softening/veraison of grape berries. The contents of the individual elements differed which was caused both by the different varieties of Rulandské modré (Pinot Noir) and Frankovka (Blaufränkisch), and by the effect of the conditions of the year (2010, 2011), and by the actual treatment of the experiment (untreated control, mycorrhizal /AM/ plants). In 2010 the contents of all the nutrients in leaves of the variety Rulandské modré (Pinot Noir) were optimal {{with the exception of the}} contents of Ca and Mg in 2011 and content of K in 2010. In the mycorrhizal plants in both years only calcium increased significantly (3. 50 [*]% as against 3. 29 [*]% and 1. 54 [*]% as against 1. 31 [*]%, respectively). The contents of <b>micro</b> <b>elements</b> in the variety Rulandské modré (Pinot Noir) fluctuated irregularly; only the content of Mn was higher in the control treatment in both years. The variety Frankovka (Blaufränkisch) showed a small to great Ca deficit in the leaves in both years; in 2010 also a K deficit and in 2011 a deficit in Mg. The contents of N, K and Mn increased significantly in the mycorrhizal treated plants both in 2010 and in 2011...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the contribution of GIS for studying the environmental spatial impacts of using mixed irrigation water on soil pollution in El Fayoum Governorate. To achieve this target, different localities affected by mixed irrigation water were selected at Tamia Districts, Fayoum Governorate. Aerial photo-interpretation followed by conventional field check and laboratory analyses were integrated with the GIS to provide a suitable base map for the study. The main physical and chemical characteristics of 52 soil profiles, representing the different mapping units, were stored into ILWIS GIS. The Geopedologic aspects of the area were assessed and discussed. Three map units were selected from the geographic database {{in such a way}} that part of the unit is irrigated with fresh water and the other part with mixed water. An obvious increase of the <b>micro</b> <b>elements</b> and heavy metals concentration (Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn) in the mixed water, as compared to the fresh water, is recorded. Data of the impact of using mixed irrigation water on soil salinity and pollution reflected some hazard trends on soil properties, where remarkable increases in soil salinity, <b>micro</b> <b>elements</b> and heavy metals in all the studied soils irrigated with mixed water occurred. The observed hazard effects varied among the different soils in the area, mainly due to texture and drainage conditions. Key Words: GIS, mixed irrigation water, environmental impacts, soil pollution, Tamia soils. 1...|$|R
