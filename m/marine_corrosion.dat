40|$|The {{atmospheric}} corrosion of carbon steel is an extensive topic {{that has been}} studied {{over the years by}} many researchers. However, until relatively recently, surprisingly little {{attention has been paid to}} the action of <b>marine</b> chlorides. <b>Corrosion</b> in coastal regions is a particularly relevant issue due the latter’s great importance to human society. About half of the world’s population lives in coastal regions and the industrialisation of developing countries tends to concentrate production plants close to the sea. Until the start of the 21 st century, research on the basic mechanisms of rust formation in Cl − -rich atmospheres was limited to just a small number of studies. However, in recent years, scientific understanding of <b>marine</b> atmospheric <b>corrosion</b> has advanced greatly, and in the authors’ opinion a sufficient body of knowledge has been built up in published scientific papers to warrant an up-to-date review of the current state-of-the-art and to assess what issues still need to be addressed. That is the purpose of the present review. After a preliminary section devoted to basic concepts on atmospheric <b>corrosion,</b> the <b>marine</b> atmosphere, and experimentation on <b>marine</b> atmospheric <b>corrosion,</b> the paper addresses key aspects such as the most significant corrosion products, the characteristics of the rust layers formed, and the mechanisms of steel <b>corrosion</b> in <b>marine</b> atmospheres. Special attention is then paid to important matters such as coastal-industrial atmospheres and long-term behaviour of carbon steel exposed to marine atmospheres. The work ends with a section dedicated to issues pending, noting a series of questions in relation with which greater research efforts would seem to be necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} NaCl particle-induced {{atmospheric}} corrosion is facilitated by in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis through real time identification of corrosion products. Droplet formation on carbon steel by the deliquescence of pre-deposited NaCl particles that {{were exposed to}} high relative humidity (RH) (> 80 %), and corrosion initiation under the droplets were observed using an optical microscope. Pitting initiated within several minutes under the NaCl droplets. In situ and ex situ Raman spectra from the various rust species that formed during the corrosion process show that green rust (GR) formed close to the corrosion pit (i. e., anodic site) while lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH) clusters precipitated outside of the GR region. A small amount of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) was also detected, mostly in the transitional region from GR to lepidocrocite. Upon exposure to an ambient atmosphere, GR transformed to lepidocrocite. This study confirms that the initial rust formed in NaCl particle-induced <b>marine</b> atmospheric <b>corrosion</b> of carbon steel is GR and lepidocrocite. While revealing the initiation mechanisms of NaCl particle-induced <b>marine</b> atmospheric <b>corrosion</b> of carbon steel, this study also provides insights for future studies involving wet-dry cycle exposures, which are more akin to the real atmospheric corrosion process...|$|R

However, no matter how big the impact of this technology can be to industry and research, it still is in a very early stage of development compared to traditional computer vision. One reason for this is that, the moment the camera goes into the water, a whole new set of challenges appear. On one hand, cameras have to be made waterproof, <b>marine</b> <b>corrosion</b> deteriorates materials quickly and access and modifications to experimental setups are costly, both in time and resources.

40|$|Abstract. For an {{infrastructure}} construction located in marine environments, maintaining good durability for the structures always imposes serious challenges, {{especially for the}} structure made of reinforced concrete. Concrete exposed to marine environment may deteriorate {{as a result of}} combined effects of both physical and chemical actions from <b>marine</b> environment. <b>Corrosion</b> of the reinforced steel bars that are embedded in the concrete is the most serious problem. Therefore, a method to protect the reinforced concrete in the marine environment from damages due to material deterioration and corrosion is proposed in this study. The method is through the application of bentonite material by utilizing its very finely divided form so that the larger capillary pores in concrete can be filled up. In this way, the impermeability of concrete material can be enhanced and then improve the corrosion resistant ability of the material...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{corrosion}} behavior of B 10 copper-nickel alloy in marine environment. Accelerated degradation test under marine environmental conditions {{was designed and}} performed based on the accelerated testing principle and the corrosion degradation mechanism. With the prolongation of <b>marine</b> <b>corrosion</b> time, the thickness of Cu 2 O film increased gradually. Its corrosion product was Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl, which increased in quantity over time.

Through the nonlinear fitting of corrosion rate and corrosion quantity (corrosion weight loss), degradation data of different corrosion cycles, the quantitative effects of two major factors, i. e., dissolved oxygen (DO) and corrosion medium temperature, on corrosion behavior of copper alloy were analyzed. The corrosion failure prediction models under different ambient conditions were built. One-day corrosion weight loss under oxygenated stirring conditions was equivalent to 1. 31 -day weight loss under stationary conditions, and the corrosion rate under oxygenated conditions was 1. 31 times higher than that under stationary conditions.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, Low Frequency (LF) RFID {{sensing system}} {{is used to}} characterise <b>marine</b> {{atmospheric}} <b>corrosion</b> on steel samples. Considering the conductivity and permeability variation in the corrosion layer, optimisation of sensing sensitivity and communication distance of commercial RFID tags placed on both coated and uncoated samples (exposure duration between 1 and 12 months) for impedance matching and appropriate operation frequencies are analysed. To balance the communication distance between RFID reader and tag and to match the impedance variation of RFID tags on metallic samples, a concept of wireless power transfer (WPT) through strongly coupled magnetic resonance (SCMR) method at RFID is applied. Static and transient features are extracted and selected to characterise corrosion. To enhance the sensing sensitivity to corrosion characterisation, further experimental studies {{have been carried out}} using ferrite sheets. The proposed LF RFID sensing system has been validated using commercial RFID tags with different feature extractions and selection of features for corrosion characterisation...|$|R
40|$|Because {{field studies}} seldom recover coupons less than 6 months from {{immersion}} they provide {{no information about}} early corrosion behaviour. Linear or power law functional behaviour for corrosion loss with time is often assumed. New field studies performed on the Australian east coast and described herein using very closely spaced recoveries of coupons show that the corrosion loss-time behaviour is initially highly non-linear and then almost linear until corrosion product formation begins to control the rate of corrosion. The reasons for this behaviour are {{discussed in terms of}} the recently introduced multi-phase phenomenological model for <b>marine</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Conventional oxygen diffusion arguments are then used to provide a mathematical model to describe the main part of this behaviour.

40|$|In <b>marine</b> environments <b>corrosion</b> is {{exacerbated}} by formation of destructive biofilms containing sulphate-reducing bacteria, which promote corrosion by forming corrosive species, such as H 2 S. Corrosion-causing biofilms are often resistant to inactivation by biocides since the biofilm bacteria are protected by a matrix of exopolymeric substances (EPS). Paradoxically, a biofilm of the endospore-forming Paenibacillus polymyxa can actually inhibit corrosion. Sol gel technology and immobilized microorganisms have been combined in a unique coating that inhibits corrosion on aluminium alloys, being low-cost, effective and environmentally friendly. Viability studies show that P. polymyxa endospores are able to withstand solvent concentration of up to 50 % and an acid concentration of up to 1. 5 M and germinate within a biotic sol-gel coating.
