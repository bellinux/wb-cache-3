25|$|Normally the Imperial {{children}} were kept under female supervision {{until they were}} seven. However, {{by the time he}} was five Konstantin had become too willful and difficult for a governess to handle and his father appointed a male tutor for him. Nicholas I intended that Konstantin would eventually become Admiral General of the Russian Fleet and with this in mind chose Fyodor Litke as tutor for his son. Litke, who had circumnavigated the globe at the age of twenty, was a brash and bold man, unafraid of controversy or offense, and he passed these qualities along to his student. He trained the boy in naval sciences and filled his head with tales of the sea, gaining the friendship of his pupil for life. Languages were an important part of Konstantin's education; he learned Russian, English, German and French. As he grew older, his lessons increased in length and complexity to encompass mathematics, science, statistics, and government administration. There were also early military lessons and drills. Konstantin also enjoyed <b>music,</b> <b>learning</b> to play the piano and cello. He loved drawing and had great appreciation for the arts. He also became an enthusiastic reader and his fascination with Homer led him to translate the Odyssey from German.|$|E

500|$|In 1919, Smith {{picked cotton}} {{for a week}} to earn himself {{the money to buy}} a $3.50 clarinet. [...] Smith learned to play several {{instruments}} {{by the time he was}} eighteen years old. In 1922, Smith and his family moved to Dallas. [...] He joined the Voodie White Trio, playing Alto saxophone and clarinet. In 1923, he began his professional music career playing alto saxophone with the medicine shows, though he had to play very loudly to draw in more customers. This experience led to Smith defining his own musical style, known for being loud. The time with the medicine shows also led to Oran [...] "Hot Lips" [...] Page inviting Smith to join his group, the Oklahoma City Blue Devils, in 1925. Over the next few years, Smith wrote much of the group's <b>music,</b> <b>learning</b> from banjo player Johnny Clark, writing lyrics with co-workers from the bank that he worked in.|$|E

40|$|The essays {{collected}} in Music Education in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance show a wide diversity of approaches to musical pedagogy, which they illuminate {{in new and}} often suggestive ways; they make {{a significant contribution to}} the history of music pedagogy and will amply repay careful study. Collectively, the essays address five questions. What pedagogical methods were used? What did students learn? Who were the teachers, and who the students? Where and when was <b>music</b> <b>learned?</b> Why was <b>music</b> <b>learned?</b> Readers led by the book’s title to assume that the Middle Ages and the Renaissance will receive equal treatment may be disappointed: only three of the book's seventeen essays are devoted to medieval topics. “Early Modern” would have served the later period more appropriately than “Renaissance,” as publications addressed include those as late as Mace (1676) and Playford (1683). A comprehensive bibliography would have been a service to readers...|$|R

2500|$|Gordon's <b>music</b> <b>learning</b> {{theory is}} based on his {{research}} on music aptitude in line with cognitive theories regarding the organization of incoming stimuli. Gordon's research suggests that music aptitude is normally distributed {{in the general population}} similar to intellectual aptitude. His research also suggests that music aptitude that a child is born with can only be maintained with repeated positive exposure to musical experiences soon after (or even before) birth, up until approximately age 9 where a child reaches [...] "stabilized" [...] music aptitude.|$|E

He was an avid reader on a wide range of topics. Friends recall his reading constantly.|$|E
2500|$|Belafonte {{started his}} career in music as a club singer in New York {{to pay for his}} acting classes.

At first, he was a pop singer, launching his recording career on the Roost label in 1949, but later he developed a keen interest in folk <b>music,</b> <b>learning</b> material through the Library of Congress' American folk songs archives.

2500|$|Similar criticisms include {{accusations that}} Gordon's skills-based {{programs}} of applying <b>Music</b> <b>Learning</b> Theory are [...] "probably too narrow and limited in scope {{to provide students}} access to diversity of musical belief systems, practices, and groups that exists", a concern of writer Paul G. Woodford and music education theorist Bennett Reimer. Woodford credits Gordon for his highly developed system {{about the nature of}} music teaching and learning, but cautions that Gordon's system is too prescriptive and proscriptive to students and teachers, and that music educators should also be aware of the diversity of practices and strive to not exert pressure on students to conform to conventional musical thought and behavior. Gordon's 1997 response responds to this indirectly, arguing that his methodology leaves room for other methodologies to be taught alongside it.|$|E
2500|$|Criticisms of <b>music</b> <b>learning</b> theory include Paul Woodford's {{concerns}} that the theory itself is a misnomer, and rather than a learning theory it is a [...] "taxonomy of musical preconditions for critical thinking", and that [...] "rather than overwhelming younger students in the beginning stages of instruction by focusing only on the complexities of music, teachers should use approaches such as Gordon's along with Kodaly, Orff, and other methodologies, to help students master basic musical skills and knowledge that are prerequisites to more independent kinds of thinking." [...] Gordon responded to these claims, arguing that Woodford misunderstood elements of Gordon's methodology, erroneously associating Gordon with [...] "clapping of rhythms", as well as misunderstanding the difference between chronological and musical age, the difference explaining why tonal and rhythm patterns should be taught independently {{in order to create}} a foundation for [...] "complex cognition and independent musical thinking that relates to larger musical forms". Gordon also agrees with Woodford's comment that Gordon's approach should be taught alongside other methodologies, also asserting that he agrees with Woodford's suggestion that [...] "students should introduced to the full range of real-life kinds of musical thinking including less conventional, and even atypical, musical practices." ...|$|E
