5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} more dense substances, such as <b>mineral</b> <b>oil,</b> lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{are usually}} {{conducted}} using only small quantities {{of a few}} grams in a fume hood. Small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol. The alkali metals must be stored under <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> or an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas, except for lithium, which reacts with nitrogen. Rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air, even under oil, because even {{a small amount of}} air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide; for the same reason, potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen-containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months.|$|E

40|$|Low {{viscosity}} {{base oils}} {{are one of}} the candidates for fuel saving lubricants for internal combustion engines. These lubricants reduce viscous friction under hydrodynamic conditions, so reduce total energy loss at tribological contact. However, these oils provide thinner oil films resulting in magnified wear. Therefore, wear protection of rubbing surfaces is very important to apply low viscosity oils in practice. Effects of phosphorus-containing additives on antiwear properties of low viscosity base oils were evaluated under boundary lubrication conditions using a four-ball type wear tester according to ASTM D 4172. For <b>mineral</b> based <b>oils,</b> dialkyl phosphonates considerably reduced wear whereas trialkyl and triaryl phosphonates did not. Compatibility of additive with <b>mineral</b> based <b>oil</b> depends on the refining process of the oil. Wear prevention by phosphorus-containing additive in solvent-extracted <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> was sometimes unpredictable. Additive response for hydrogen-refined <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> was better than that for solvent-extracted oils. The results showed good accordance with phosphorus contents on the worn surfaces obtained by surface analysis. At least 0. 062 mass% (620 ppm) of phosphorus is required to achieve sufficient antiwear properties in hydrogen-refined <b>mineral</b> <b>oils.</b> Synthetic esters have good lubricity in comparison with <b>mineral</b> <b>oils.</b> However, conventional antiwear additives for <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> are not always effective for synthetic esters, especially low viscosity esters. Hydroxyalkyl phosphates, with a polar functional group in the molecule, reduced wear effectively even at 0. 016 mass% (160 ppm) of phosphorus in low viscosity synthetic esters. The new additives provided boundary films with high phosphorus contents. Kinetics of the boundary film formation were examined by the electric contact resistance method. Formation of the boundary film from the new additives was higher than that from conventional additives. The replenishment process of the boundary film under dynamic conditions is very important for low viscosity lubricants...|$|R

5|$|Two {{kinds of}} control {{measures}} have been advocated since the 19th century. One aims at total pest population reduction, while the other is aimed at protection of the particular crop. , integrated pest management (IPM), an array of techniques and approaches to control pests, was recommended. Practices such as deep ploughing, mechanical destruction, and trap crops are also used to kill different instars. Chemical control is widely successful, and includes the use of applying <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> inside the tip of each corn ear, which suffocates the young larvae. Pesticides are one method by which corn earworm populations are controlled; however, since they have been widely used, the insects have become resistant to many pesticides. The use of biological controls, such as the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis and various forms of nematodes, is also common, although not without their own problems. Corn earworm moths are not always vulnerable to the bacterium, and they are only afflicted by nematodes once the larvae have pupated and dropped to the ground.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react with water, but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E

It helps coat the intestine, but is not very effective for severe impactions or sand colic since it may simply bypass the obstruction. <b>Mineral</b> <b>oil</b> has the added benefit of crudely measuring GI transit time, a process which normally takes around 18 hours, since it is obvious when it is passed. The detergent dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DDS) is also commonly given in oral fluids. It is more effective in softening an impaction than <b>mineral</b> <b>oil,</b> and helps stimulate intestinal motility, but can inhibit fluid absorption from the intestine and is potentially toxic so is only given in small amounts, two separate times 48 hours apart. Epsom salts are also useful for impactions, since they act both as an osmotic agent, to increase fluid in the GI tract, and as a laxative, but do run the risk of dehydration and diarrhea. Strong laxatives are not recommended for treating impactions.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was the {{development}} of a fast technique for analysis of typical anthropogenic contaminants in soil, e. g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> resp. heavy metals. The detection was based on laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIF) and laser-induced Breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). We could demonstrate that stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) is a suitable method for simultaneous generation of multiple excitation lines for multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy. The characterization of the Raman shifter revealed that a mixture of methane and hydrogen permits the generation of SRS with high pulse energies between 250 and 400 nm, which is the wavelength range relevant for detection of PAH and <b>mineral</b> <b>oils.</b> The combination of the Raman shifter with an intensified CCD-camera and a fiber-optical interface allowed the design of a new fiber-optic sensor array. The realized fiber-optical sensor was ruggedized and simple in design. Measurements with spiked soils gave excellent detection limits in the ppm-range for PAH and <b>mineral</b> <b>oils.</b> Time-resolved excitation-emission fluorescence spectra allowed a significant gain in the available analytical information, especially for complex matrices such as humic substances and <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> in soil.
