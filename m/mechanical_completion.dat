60|$|When this {{is taken}} into account, {{it will be}} seen {{that the fact that}} there is a great deal of {{repetition}} in The Ring does not distinguish it from the old-fashioned operas. The real difference is that in them the repetition was used for the <b>mechanical</b> <b>completion</b> of conventional metric patterns, whereas in The Ring the recurrence of the theme is an intelligent and interesting consequence of the recurrence of the dramatic phenomenon which it denotes. It should be remembered also that the substitution of symphonically treated themes for tunes with symmetrical eight-bar staves and the like, has always been the rule in the highest forms of music. To describe it, or be affected by it, as an abandonment of melody, is to confess oneself an ignoramus conversant only with dance tunes and ballads.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPost-combustion CO 2 capture (PCC) {{technology}} offers flexibility {{to treat the}} flue gas from both existing and new coal-fired power plants and {{can be applied to}} treat all or a portion of the flue gas. Solvent-based technologies are today the leading option for PCC from large coal-fired power plants as they have been applied in large-scale in other applications. Linde and BASF are working together to further improve a post-combustion capture technology incorporating BASF's novel aqueous amine-based process {{based on the results of}} the joint development of BASF, Linde and RWE at the PCC pilot plant in Niederaussem, Germany. This {{technology offers}} significant benefits compared to other solvent-based processes as it aims to reduce the regeneration energy requirements using novel solvents that are very stable under the coal-fired power plant feed gas conditions. BASF has developed the desired solvent based on the evaluation of a large number of candidates and long-term small pilot-scale testing has been performed on a lignite-fired flue gas. Linde has evaluated a number of options for capital cost reduction in large engineered systems for solvent-based PCC technology. Pilot-scale demonstration on a coal-fired power plant flue gas at a 1 - 1. 5 MWe scale is currently planned under a project supported by DOE (project award DE-FE 0007453). <b>Mechanical</b> <b>completion</b> of the pilot plant was achieved in July 2014 and the final commissioning activities are being completed to enable start-up of operations in late 2014. The pilot plant incorporates the capability to test a number of unique features of the Linde-BASF technology aimed at lowering the overall energy consumption as well as resulting in capital cost reduction. In this presentation, the details of the fabrication, construction and start-up of the pilot plant will be discussed. The pilot plant incorporates significant instrumentation and control features to enable automated and stable operation, and the ability to reliably check and verify mass and energy balance closures with adequate redundancies. Detailed plans for the parametric and long-term testing will be discussed; these tests are aimed at validating the technology performance against targets set based on a preliminary techno-economic assessment, and, the stability of the solvent with continued operation over an extended period...|$|E

30|$|Based on Table  17 (group B), skin {{factor is}} 11.67 for {{drainage}} radius of 10, 000 ft. In this case, if skin factor reduces {{to the values}} of 5 or 0, the gas production rate increases from 118 MMSCFD to 160 and 204 MMSCFD by considering the current value of bottom-hole pressure and average reservoir pressure in Eq. (8). In other words, the daily volume of gas production of this well would increase to 42 – 86 MMSCFD (maximum 73 %). Hence, finding the reason for this high skin factor is essential as the first step before suggesting a suitable remedy for this problem. Accordingly, five different skin factors will be introduced and their existence evaluated for the objective well. In the ideal conditions, a vertical well which is completed as open-hole, produces single-phase fluid from formation with no damage at a rate determined by Darcy’s law (Ahmed and McKinney 2011). There are five types of skin factor observed in real cases, including <b>mechanical</b> skin, <b>completion</b> pseudoskin, geometrical pseudoskin, multiphase pseudoskin, and rate-dependent skin frequently occur in hydrocarbon reservoirs (Ahmed and McKinney 2011; Ezenweichu and Laditan 2015; Jianchun et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 110 - 113). This {{thesis is}} part of an extensive study conducted by Research Team 308 Achieving Zero Rework Through Effective Supplier Quality Practices from the Construction Industry Institute (CII). The main objectives of this study are centered on the belief that owners, contractors, and suppliers in the construction industry engage in multiple supplier quality (SQ) practices to ensure that project components are procured to the site with the highest quality possible in order to avoid any rework associated with components that are defective or do not conform to the required specifications. Furthermore, data obtained for this study focuses on four different types of material: tagged/engineered equipment, fabricated goods (structural steel and pipe spools), and manufactured/bulk goods (non-engineered/bulk valves). 	The first outcome of this study was the development of a Supplier Quality Process Map (SQPM) that illustrates how the process of procuring components to the project site with sufficient quality is currently being implemented by the Engineer-Procure-Construct (EPC) industry. A detailed description of the SQPM is provided and depicts five major stages within the process. The first two stages illustrate the supplier selection process {{and the development of a}} quality plan. These stages are known as planning and selection and execution. The last three stages pertain to key milestones where measurements for the quality of the production process occur; these stages are release from shop, received on site, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>completion.</b> 	 The second outcome was a statistical analysis of how SQ practices are used by EPC contractors and how these SQ practices impact the resulting quality of goods supplied based on the number of non-conformances (NCs) throughout the process outlined in the SQPM. The statistical analysis resulted in several findings related to the SQ process: More NCs are found when more time is spent observing and inspecting work; developing a quality control/inspection and testing (QC/IT) plan, and projecting the cost of the inspection effort with the supplier helps find problems earlier in the SQ process. Moreover, for meetings held before execution (specifically before any manufacturing, fabrication, or assembly takes place) results suggest that NCs will appear at the shop (upstream), which is a good way of avoiding higher costs associated with the correction of NCs on site (downstream). Moreover, the use and implementation of registered or certified quality management systems (QMS) does not affect the number of NCs found throughout the SQPM. 	The third outcome is the statistical comparison of a group of companies, labeled as highly effective companies (HECs), to regular companies. Results show that HECs find NCs earlier in the SQPM, engage in more hours of observation in suppliers' facilities, and put more effort in the planning phases by conducting more pre-award and pre-inspection meetings, aimed at reducing the number of NCs.

40|$|USDOE {{performed}} a (CERCLA) non-time critical removal (NTCR) {{action at the}} Small Arms Training Area (SATA) Site Evaluation Area (SEA) located at the Savannah River Site (SRS), in Aiken, South Carolina. From 1951 to May 2010, the SATA {{was used as a}} small weapons practice and qualifying firing range. The SATA consisted of 870. 1 ha (2, 150 ac) of woodlands and open field, of which approximately 2. 9 ha (7. 3 ac) were used as a firing range. The SATA facility was comprised of three small arms ranges (one static and two interactive), storage buildings for supplies, a weapons cleaning building, and a control building. Additionally, a 113 - m (370 -ft) long earthen berm was used as a target backstop during live-fire exercises. The berm soils accumulated a large amount of spent lead bullets in the berm face during the facilities 59 - years of operation. The accumulation of lead was such that soil concentrations exceeded the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) residential and industrial worker regional screening levels (RSLs). The RSL threshold values are based on standardized exposure scenarios that estimate contaminant concentrations in soil that the USEPA considers protective of humans over a lifetime. For the SATA facility, lead was present in soil at concentrations that exceed both the current residential (400 mg/kg) and industrial (800 mg/kg) RSLs. In addition, the concentration of lead in the soil exceeded the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 261. 24) regulatory limit. The TCLP analysis simulates landfill conditions and is designed to determine the mobility of contaminants in waste. In addition, a principal threat source material (PTSM) evaluation, human health risk assessment (HHRA), and contaminant migration (CM) analysis were conducted to evaluate soil contamination at the SATA SEA. This evaluation determined that there were no contaminants present that constitute PTSM and the CM analysis revealed that no constituents posed a migration risk to groundwater. The NTCR action involved removal of approximately 12, 092 m 3 (15, 816 yd 3) of spent bullets and lead-impacted soil and off-site disposal. The removal action included soils from the berm area, a fill area that received scraped soils from the berm, and soil from a drainage ditch located {{on the edge of the}} berm area. Also included in the removal action was a mixture of soil, concrete, and asphalt from the other three range areas. Under this action, 11, 796 m 3 (15, 429 yd 3) of hazardous waste and impacted soil were removed from the SATA and transported to a permitted hazardous waste disposal facility (Lone Mountain Facility in Oklahoma) and 296 m 3 (387 yd 3) of nonhazardous waste (primarily concrete debris) were removed and transported to a local solid waste landfill for disposal. During the excavation process, the extent was continuously assessed through the use of a hand-held, field-portable X-ray fluorescence unit with results verified using confirmation sampling with certified laboratory analysis. Following the completion of the excavation and confirmation sampling, final contouring, grading, and establishment of vegetative cover was performed to stabilize the affected areas. The NTCR action began on August 17, 2010, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>completion</b> was achieved on April 27, 2011. The selected removal action met the removal action objectives (RAOs), is protective of human health and the environment both in the short- and long-term, was successful in removing potential ecological risks, and is protective of surface water and groundwater. Furthermore, the selected NTCR action met residential cleanup goals and resulted in the release of the SEA from restricted use contributing to the overall footprint reduction at SRS...|$|E
40|$|Subject of {{this study}} was to compare the clinicaly {{established}} method of osteochondral autografts with the treatment of crushed spongiosa as cartilage defectfilling. The aim of the study was to assess the cartilage healing in the group of the osteochondral transfer, the crushed spongiosa and a non-treated defect in a histological and mainly an immunohistochemical way. In particular it was the intention to assess the dependence of cartilage healing on the regeneration of the subchondral bone as a mechanical support. A total of 24 two year old merino-mix sheep were used. Osteochondral defects were created in both condyles in the left knee. The defect was filled either at the lateral or the medial side with the osteochondral transfer or the crushed spongiosa. The harvesting defect remained empty and served as a control with natural healing. Two postoperative observation periods of three and six months were chosen. Histological evaluation of the cartilage bone regeneration products was carried out after staining with Safranin O as well as immunhistologic staining of collagen type I and collagen type II. The results of the study showed, that the applied crushed spongiosa was not able to withstand the results of the osteochondral transfer group and improve the cartilage regeneration. The implant was not able to provide the expected <b>mechanical</b> support until <b>completion</b> of bone regeneration. Histologically, there was a significant debased bony support of the defect as well as a lack of cartilage. The operationmethod of crushed spongiosa could not improve the cartilage regeneration. A positive influence of good bony support on the quality of the regenerated cartilage was demonstrated in the OCT-group after three month. A good bony ingrowth correlated with high ratings in the score system. The conclusion is that despite of beginning degenerative evidence, the osteochondral transfer was superior to the other operationmethods...|$|R
