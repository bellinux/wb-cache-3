40|$|Background: Adequate {{knowledge}} {{is essential for}} making informed decisions. We attempted to determine the level <b>of</b> knowledge about <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> birth control methods in five representative samples of European women. Study design: Randomly selected women, aged 18 - 49 years, completed an anonymous survey in Germany, France, the UK, Sweden and Romania (N= 1137). Participants were asked about how contraceptive methods work and if providers should inform them about this issue. Multiple linear regression {{was used to evaluate}} women’s characteristics associated with their knowledge <b>of</b> <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Results: The majority of women identified the unequivocal mode <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> condoms, sterilization and abortion. Less than 2 % identified all possible <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine devices. Highly-educated women correctly identified the <b>mechanism</b> or <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> more methods than less educated women (β coef. = 0. 22, 95 %CI= 0. 01 - 0. 43). Regardless of their sociodemographic characteristics and their belief about when human life begins, most women (75 %) stated that the provider should inform them about possible postfertilization effects. Conclusions: 	European women have low knowledge about <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> several contraceptive methods. The majority want to be informed about possible postfertilization effects. Since adequate {{knowledge is}} essential for making informed decisions, providers are encouraged to inform women about all possible <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> contraceptives...|$|R

40|$|Study Design. A {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis {{of studies on}} the putative <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> lumbar supports in lifting activities. Objective. To summarize the evidence bearing on the putative <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> lumbar supports. Summary of Background Data. A restriction of trunk motion {{and a reduction in}} required back muscle forces in lifting are two proposed <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> lumbar supports. Available studies on these putative <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> lumbar supports have reported contradictory results. Methods. A literature search for controlled studies on <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> lumbar supports was conducted. The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed. The evidence for the two proposed <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>of</b> lumbar supports was determined in meta-analyses. Results. Thirty-three studies were selected for the review. There was evidence that lumbar supports reduce trunk motion for flexion-extension and lateral bending, with overall effect sizes of 0. 70 (95 % confidence interval [Cl] 0. 39 - 1. 01) and 1. 13 (95 % Cl 0. 17 - 2. 08), respectively. The overall effect size for rotation was not statistically significant (0. 69; 95 % Cl - 0. 40 - 4. 31). There was no evidence that lumbar supports reduce the electromyogram activity of erector spinae muscles (effect size of 0. 09; 95 % Cl - 0. 41 - 0. 59) or increase the intra-abdominal pressure (effect size of 0. 26; 95 % Cl - 0. 07 - 0. 59). Conclusion. There is evidence that lumbar supports reduce trunk motion for flexion-extension and latera bending. More research is needed on the separate outcome measures for trunk motion before definite conclusions can be drawn about the work conditions in which lumbar supports may be most effective. Studies of trunk motion at the workplace or during specified lifting tasks would be especially useful in this regard...|$|R

BZP has a lower potency effect on the noradrenaline reuptake transporter and the dopamine reuptake transporter. BZP has a high affinity action at the alpha2-adrenoreceptor, it is an antagonist at the receptor, like yohimbine, which inhibits negative feedback, causing an increase in released noradrenaline.|$|E
