The modified enzyme also differs from the normal polymerase in some of its enzymatic parameters. The specific activity of the <b>modified</b> <b>RNA</b> polymerase is markedly lower (i. e., ¼) than that of the normal enzyme. The decrease in activity is probably due to an alteration in the β′ subunit of the polymerase.

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that cells of higher eukaryotes express double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNAs) either naturally or {{as the result of}} viral infection or aberrant, bidirectional transcriptional readthrough. These duplex molecules can exist in either the cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments. Cells have evolved distinct ways of responding to dsRNAs, depending on the nature and location of the duplexes. Since dsRNA molecules are not thought to exist naturally within the cytoplasm, dsRNA in this compartment is most often associated with viral infections. Cells have evolved defensive strategies against such molecules, primarily involving the interferon response pathway. Nuclear dsRNA, however, does not induce interferons and may play an important posttranscriptional regulatory role. Nuclear dsRNA appears to be the substrate for enzymes which deaminate adenosine residues to inosine residues within the polynucleotide structure, resulting in partial or full unwinding. Extensively <b>modified</b> <b>RNAs</b> are either rapidly degraded or retained within the nucleus, whereas transcripts with few modifications may be transported to the cytoplasm, where they serve to produce altered proteins.

One transcript (R 1. 1 RNA) was generated using phage T 7 RNA polymerase and a cloned segment of phage T 7 DNA containing the R 1. 1 RNase III processing site. The second transcript was the phage T 7 polycistronic early mRNA precursor, which was synthesized using E. coli RNA polymerase and T 7 genomic DNA. The RNA transcripts contained phosphorothioate diester groups at positions including the scissile bonds. The <b>modified</b> <b>RNAs</b> were stable to incubation in Mg 2 +-containing buffer, and were specifically cleaved by RNase III.

40|$|RNAs {{are central}} to all gene {{expression}} through the control of protein synthesis. Four major nucleosides, adenosine, guanosine, cytidine and uridine, compose RNAs and provide sequence variation, but are limited in contributions to structural variation as well as distinct chemical properties. The ability of RNAs to play multiple roles in cellular metabolism is made possible by extensive variation in length, conformational dynamics, and the over 100 post-transcriptional modifications. There are several reviews of the biochemical pathways leading to RNA modification, but the physicochemical nature of modified nucleosides and how they facilitate RNA function is of keen interest, {{particularly with regard to}} the contributions of modified nucleosides. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are the most extensively <b>modified</b> <b>RNAs.</b> The diversity of modifications provide versatility to the chemical and structural environments. The added chemistry, conformation and dynamics of modified nucleosides occurring at the termini of stems in tRNA’s cloverleaf secondary structure affect the global three-dimensional conformation, produce unique recognition determinants for macromolecules to recognize tRNAs, and affect the accurate and efficient decoding ability of tRNAs.

40|$|Antisense RNA may {{regulate}} {{the expression of}} a number of eukaryotic genes, but little is known about its prevalence or mechanism of action. We have used a model system in which antisense control can be studied both genetically and biochemically. Late in polyoma virus infection, early-strand mRNA levels are down-regulated by nuclear antisense RNA from the late strand. Analysis of early-strand transcripts isolated late in infection revealed extensive base modifications. In many transcripts almost half of the adenosines were altered to inosines or guanosines. These results suggest modification of RNA duplexes by double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase or a related enzyme. Probes that detect only <b>modified</b> <b>RNAs</b> revealed that these molecules are not highly unstable, but accumulate within the nucleus and are thus inert for gene expression. Antisense-induced modifications can account for most or all of the observed regulation, with the lowered levels of early-strand RNAs commonly observed late in infection resulting from the fact that many transcripts are invisible to standard hybridization probes. This work suggests that similar antisense-mediated control mechanisms may also operate under physiological conditions in uninfected eukaryotic cells, and leads to the proposal that there is a novel pool of nuclear RNAs that cannot be seen with many molecular probes heretofore used...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} immunostimulatory RNAs (isRNAs) on the {{expression}} of immuno-suppressive factors are largely unknown. Indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) is a key negative regulator of immune responses {{and it has been}} implicated in hampering immunity against tumours. Here we show that the activation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) - 7 / 8 with isRNAs or R 848, a specific ligand for TLR 7 / 8, can induce IDO expression in human monocytes, but not in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC). In contrast to TLR 7 / 8 agnosists, treatment of the same moDC with interferon-γ-induced IDO expression. Treatment of monocytes with 2 ′-O-methyl uridine-modified isRNAs alone does not induce IDO, but totally abrogated the effects of unmodified isRNAs. Like isRNAs, synthetic viral RNAs and cytomegalovirus (CMV) induced IDO in monocytes, whereas TLR 2 ligand lipopeptide Pam 3 Cys exhibited no effect. Furthermore, IDO positive monocytes suppressed autologous T-cell activation. Collectively, these data indicate for first time that the potency of TLR 7 / 8 signalling pathways to induce IDO expression in monocytes is silenced when the cells are programmed to differentiate into dendritic cells. The immunosuppressive properties of IDO might confer an advantage to CMV-infected monocytes to escape T-cell responses. The findings that 2 ′-O-methyl <b>modified</b> <b>RNAs</b> can block isRNA-induced IDO expression would facilitate the design of new TLR inhibitors...|$|E
