Awarded "The Best Comedy Kids TV Series" in Anugerah Lawak Warna and was nominated as Top 5 in "Favourite Drama TV Show" for "Astro On the Go Fan Choice Awards", its effectiveness cannot be argued. Besides that, the snippets of the show have had almost one million YouTube views and the sitcom had garnered 50, 000 Facebook fans and the informal teaching methods employed by the media to help students with English are affirmed were often {{more effective than the}} formal methods employed in schools. Hence, with all of these compliments and support from the society, the intention to investigate more on the discernment of using "Oh <b>My</b> English" <b>program</b> in English lesson from ESL learners should be carried out, so that, its effectiveness towards the students will be proven. Therefore, a quantitative study was conducted to investigate whether students of SMK Sultan Abu Bakar, Muar, Johor prefer "Oh <b>My</b> English" <b>program</b> to be used in English lessons as well as to identify how "Oh <b>My</b> English" <b>program</b> motivates students in learning English language and to examine the suitability of the "Oh <b>My</b> English" <b>program</b> in term of its program features, contents and practicality. The findings have let to interesting discussion that the students of SMK Sultan Abu Bakar, Muar, Johor prefer "Oh <b>My</b> English" <b>program</b> to be used in English lesson, the program motivates the students in several ways and it is proven that the <b>program</b> of "Oh <b>My</b> English" is suitable in term of its program features, content and practicality.

2500|$|Former anchor Krista Erickson {{wrote an}} article for National Newswatch in 2015 that singled out former Quebecor {{vice-president}} Kory Teneycke, {{who was in charge}} of the channel, for criticism calling him a [...] "controlling authoritarian" [...] whose pro-Conservative Party [...] "partisanship often went into overdrive" [...] at the channel's expense. Erickson blame Teneycke for the channel reporting during the 2011 federal election of a 16-year-old incident involving [...] Jack Layton being allegedly found in a massage parlour by police. [...] "There was no arrest, no criminal charge, therefore no criminal behaviour. On these facts, the justification of public interest was arguably thin," [...] according to Erickson, who claimed Sun News Network management nevertheless coached its on-air staff to treat the story as if it was [...] "a major sex scandal involving the NDP leader." [...] Erickson also claims that during the 2012 Alberta provincial election campaign, Teneycke [...] "instructed me to stop reporting on the homophobic gaffes of [...] Wildrose candidates" [...] and that Teneycke [...] "also demanded a segment discussing the Wildrose leader's record on abortion be removed from <b>my</b> <b>program</b> lineup".|$|E

40|$|My {{dissertation}} recitals {{focus on}} music written or arranged for trumpet and percussion instruments. The three programs are conceived {{in such a}} way that each recital stands on its own as a successful concert. Each program begins with a piece of early music, the oldest of which is from the 13 th century. In an attempt to highlight the rich history of music for the trumpet and kettledrum, I have included fanfare works for each recital. The fanfares I have selected are written by some of the most notable composers in history, such as Richard Wagner, Claudio Monteverdi, and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. In contrast to these brilliant fanfares, the first half of each recital includes a song, originally written for voice and piano, arranged for muted trumpet and marimba. It is my hope that the inclusion of these songs in <b>my</b> <b>programs</b> will help expand the recital repertoire for trumpeters to include these and other such works. The first half of each recital ends with a lengthy modern work for trumpet and percussion. <b>My</b> <b>programs</b> include two premieres, one of which is a work for trumpet and programmed drums composed by myself. The modern works featured on <b>my</b> <b>programs</b> often emphasize the wide range of tonal colors available to both percussionists and trumpeters. Each recital will end with a jazz-oriented piece that will include improvisation. The diversity presented in these programs is a testament to how deep and broad the relationship is that exists between trumpet and percussion. Another goal in this type of programming, in addition to creating an interesting and enjoyable set of music, is to showcase my own versatility as a performer of a wide variety of genres...|$|R

40|$|MRF 4 (herculin/Myf- 6) {{is one of}} {{the four}} member MyoD family of {{transcription}} factors identified by their ability to enforce skeletal muscle differentiation upon a wide variety of nonmuscle cell types. In this study the mouse germline MRF 4 gene was disrupted by targeted recombination. Animals homozygous for the MRF 4 bh 1 allele, a deletion of the functionally essential bHLH domain, displayed defective axial myogenesis and rib pattern formation, and they died at birth. Differences in somitogenesis between homozygous MRF 4 bh 1 embryos and their wild-type littermates provided evidence for three distinct myogenic regulatory <b>programs</b> (<b>My</b> 1 -My 3) in the somite, which correlate temporally and spatially with three waves of cellular recruitment to the expanding myotome. The first <b>program</b> (<b>My</b> 1), marked initially by Myf- 5 expression and followed by myogenin, began on schedule in the MRF 4 bh 1 /bh 1 embryos at day 8 post coitum (E 8). A second <b>program</b> (<b>My</b> 2) was highly deficient in homozygous mutant MRF 4 embryos, and normal expansion of the myotome failed. Moreover, expression of downstream muscle-specific genes, including FGF- 6, which is a candidate regulator of inductive interactions, did not occur normally. The onset of MyoD expression around E 10. 5 in wild-type embryos marks a third myotomal <b>program</b> (<b>My</b> 3), the execution of which was somewhat delayed in MRF 4 mutant embryos but ultimately led to extensive myogenesis in the trunk. By E 15 it appeared to have largely compensated for the defective <b>My</b> 2 <b>program</b> in MRF 4 mutants. Homozygous MRF 4 bh 1 animals also showed improper rib pattern formation perhaps due to the absence of signals from cells expressing the <b>My</b> 2 <b>program.</b> Finally, a later and relatively mild phenotype was detected in intercostal muscles of newborn animals...|$|R
