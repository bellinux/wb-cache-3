50|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>mitotic</b> <b>index</b> is to measure {{cellular}} proliferation. The <b>mitotic</b> <b>index</b> is an important prognostic factor predicting both overall survival and response to chemotherapy in most types of cancer. It may lose much of its predictive value for elderly populations. For example, a low <b>mitotic</b> <b>index</b> loses any prognostic value for women over 70 years old with breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the <b>mitotic</b> <b>index</b> {{is simply}} a {{measurement}} to determine the percentage of cells undergoing mitosis. Mitosis is the division of somatic cells when genetic information from one single cell is equally dispersed into two daughter cells. Durations of the cell cycle and mitosis vary in different cell types. An elevated <b>mitotic</b> <b>index</b> indicates more cells are dividing, and thus obvious in cancer cells, The <b>mitotic</b> <b>index</b> may be elevated during necessary processes to life, such as the normal growth of plants or animals, as well as cellular repair {{the site of an}} injury.|$|E

Conversely, algal and digestive cell <b>mitotic</b> <b>indices</b> decrease in starved hydra. The temporal relationships of algal and host cell division differ in fed hydra and regenerating peduncles. After feeding, algal and digestive cell <b>mitotic</b> <b>indices</b> both reach a peak {{at about the same}} time; during regeneration, first the algae and then the digestive cells divide. Thus, mitotic digestive cells in regenerating peduncles contain more algae than those in gastric regions of fed hydra. However, in both cases mitotic digestive cells contain more algae than non-mitotic cells. The algae appear to be par-titioned at random between daughter digestive cells at teleophase. It is suggested that the division of the symbiotic algae is closely related to that of the digestive cells in which they are maintained. Mitosis of algae is stimulated by host cell mitosis, but in non-dividing cells algal mitosis is restricted. Possible mechanisms by which the host digestive cells could restrict algal division are discussed...|$|R

Because of this inhibitory action, we investigated whether VPA would affect chromatin supraorganization, <b>mitotic</b> <b>indices</b> {{and the frequency of}} chromosome abnormalities and cell death in HeLa cells. Image analysis was performed by scanning microspectrophotometry for cells cultivated for 24 h, treated with 0. 05, 0. 5 or 1. 0 mM VPA for 1 - 24 h, and subjected to the Feulgen reaction. TSA-treated cells were used as a predictable positive control. DNA fragmentation was investigated with the TUNEL assay. Chromatin decondensation was demonstrated under TSA and all VPA treatments, but no changes in chromosome abnormalities, <b>mitotic</b> <b>indices</b> or morphologically identified cell death were found with the VPA treatment conditions mentioned above, although decreased <b>mitotic</b> <b>indices</b> were detected under higher VPA concentration and longer exposure time. The frequency of DNA fragmentation identified with the TUNEL assay in HeLa cells increased after a 24 -h VPA treatment, although this fragmentation occurred much earlier after treatment with TSA. The inhibition of histone deacetylases by VPA induces chromatin remodeling in HeLa cells, which suggests an association to altered gene expression. Under VPA doses close to the therapeutic antiepileptic plasma range no changes in cell proliferation or chromosome abnormalities are elicited.

All mice were inducted for epidermoid carcinoma with 9, 12 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA) and 12 -o-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) topically. Tumor size diameter were measured before and after the administration of Phaleria macrocarpa, paclitaxel and cysplatin, and combined for 9 weeks. <b>Mitotic</b> <b>index</b> were measured at the end of treatment.
