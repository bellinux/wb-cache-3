40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that numerical modeling {{tools such as}} a RANS-VOF model can be applied confidently to reduce the level of uncertainty from empirical guidance and provide for a deterministic quantification of the hydraulic response associated with any arbitrary Caisson breakwater superstructure geometry. The RANS-VOF model used for this paper is first satisfactorily validated against laboratory measurements (surface elevation, overtopping and pressure) of a caisson breakwater on a rubble-mound foundation and then applied to several prototype caisson breakwater superstructure geometries. Numerical simulations {{presented in this paper}} for prototype geometries demonstrate that curved/inclined parapets, when compared <b>with</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>face</b> caisson breakwaters <b>with</b> the same crest elevation, can lead to large increases in overtopping as well as downward forces. Expectedly, the landward forces are reduced by the implementation of a curved or recessed and inclined parapet when compared to a caisson <b>with</b> a completely <b>vertical</b> <b>face.</b> During large overtopping events, the model results show that much larger short-duration seaward loads can be generated for curved and inclined superstructures when compared to <b>vertical</b> <b>face</b> geometries. This is in general agreement with previous laboratory experiments as well as field observations of seaward caisson sliding and failure resulting from large overtopping events. Further, numerical experiments indicate that the overtopping response of a superstructure can vary noticeably due to small changes in the recessed length of an inclined or curved parapet. The numerical model also easily provides for the quantification of the variation of instantaneous and peak overtopping discharges along the crest of the caisson superstructure, and which can provide for useful guidance in the design of various crest infrastructure components, such as drainage systems, flow deflectors, wave power devices etc...|$|R

40|$|Ice {{interaction}} <b>with</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>faces</b> {{of structures}} {{can result in}} regular vibrations given certain conditions such as temperature and speed of interaction. The mechanism that can provide this regular behaviour is studied. Fracture in general does not offer a solution in compressive failure. An approach based on viscoelastic theory, with softening resulting from microstructural change, is given. The pivotal observation was a layer of microstructurally modified ice adjacent to the structure or indentor, together with high local pressures transmitted into the layer. The microstructural changes include microfracturing and recrystallization. A series of triaxial tests was performed to determine the inputs into the viscoelastic theory. The theory recognizes changes in the microstructure of the ice {{by means of a}} state variable, which is a function of prior stress history, and therefore of location within the ice mass. The theory and the calibration thereof are reviewed, and the results of triaxial tests examined. One feature of these tests is the occurrence of “runaway ” strains and associated localization of damage. This appears to be sensitive to confining pressure, and {{is considered to be a}} key factor in the rapid load drops observed in ice-structure interaction. Temperature effects are also studied. Directions for future research are identified...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is a {{preliminary}} study of the Venetian fortifications of Nafpaktos (Lepanto) {{within the context of the}} 15 th century defensive architecture in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin. Throughout the 15 th century the Most Serene Republic of Venice strived continuously to reinforce the fortifications of the Lepanto, a Venetian holding from 1407 to 1499. Apart from some interventions carried out for the reinforcement of the walls of the medieval Upper City, the building from the ground up of the Lower City’s fortified enclosure, intended to protect part of the older suburbs and the extremely important for the Venetian State city’s port, are dated to this era. The enclosure was built in phases, in a typical 15 th century manner, a period marked by the continuous improvements of artillery and the corresponding improvements of fortifications in response to them. The earlier parts of the fortifications had the typical form of medieval fortifications, with a rather thin wall, <b>with</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>faces,</b> reinforced <b>with</b> rectangular towers. The subsequent phase consisted of parts of the walls and bastions that have an inclined outer face (scarpa) and a thick parapet with the serrated crenellations, often equipped with early type cannon-ports. The later parts of the defenses with bastions (bastioni) with a distinctive truncated cone shape, crowned with thick parapets (parapetti) over a rounded cornice (cordone), and vaulted cannon port on the lower levels, belong to the last development phase of fortifications around 1500, right before the final adoption of the “bastion system” (fronte bastionato) in the second quarter of the 16 th century...|$|R

Liu (1981) applied a Lagrangian-Eulerian method for the kinematical description of fluid-structure interaction. Ramaswamy and Kawahara (1987) analyzed large free surface motions in the fluid domain including sloshing using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian kinematical description. A particle finite element method was used by Idelsohn et al. (2006) to discretize the fluid continuum into particles. A number of studies were carried out on the hydrodynamic effects of ground supported water tanks. Details of these studies can be found in Valeti (2013).|$|R

If the wall of the building faces toward the South, but does not face due South, the gnomon will not lie along the noon line, and the hour lines must be corrected.

40|$|Abstract: The {{capacity}} {{of an existing}} spillway can be increased by lengthening the spillway crest, or increasing the discharge coefficient or operating head, or any combination of these approaches. Constructing a labyrinth weir in an existing spillway {{is an example of}} an effective way to increases the spillway crest length and the corresponding discharge capacity for the same operating head. Thus, labyrinth weir are well suited to the sites where increasing the spillway width and maximum reservoir water surface elevation would be difficult, yet larger discharge are needed. This type of weir consists of series of slender walls having a repeating shape in plan, usually triangular or trapezoidal <b>with</b> <b>vertical</b> upstream <b>faces</b> and steeply slopping downstream faces. Over the past few decades, labyrinth spillways have been constructed throughout the world. Definite guidelines and theoretical procedures pertaining to hydraulic design of this type of weir not completely established.
