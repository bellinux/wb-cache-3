The two are visually very similar, but vocally distinct.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mouse-colored</b> <b>tyrannulet</b> (Phaeomyias murina) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Tyrannidae, the tyrant flycatchers. It is {{monotypic}} within the genus Phaeomyias. It occurs {{in a wide range}} of scrubby and wooded habitats in tropical and subtropical South America, being absent from the southernmost part of the continent, the high Andes and dense rainforest. It also occurs in Panama and Costa Rica. It is generally common, but its small size and dull plumage results in it often being overlooked - or at least not identified, as it resembles several other tyrant flycatchers.|$|E
