5|$|The 1990s saw an {{increasing}} interest in international cuisines. Sushi, in particular, has taken hold {{as a popular}} style for eating out and as an entrée for events. In restaurants, fusion cuisine, with the <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> classic cuisines such as French and Japanese with local ingredients has become widespread. In the 2000s, the trend of “eating healthy” {{with an emphasis on}} organic and whole grain foods has become prominent, and medical research has led many Israelis to re-embrace the Mediterranean diet, with its touted health benefits.|$|E
5|$|The White Stripes used a low-fidelity {{approach}} to writing and recording. Their music featured a <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> garage rock and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo were also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black—which was used on every album and single cover the band released—as {{well as the}} band's fascination with the number three. The band's discography consists of six studio albums, one live album, two extended plays (EP), one concert film, one tour documentary, 26 singles, and 14 music videos. Their last three albums each won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{her recent}} motherhood, life experiences, and growing {{affinity}} for British rock band Coldplay, {{caused her to}} shift toward a more introspective outlook with her fourth studio album Afrodisiac, a venture with producer Timbaland into the experimental illbient aesthetic, which fuses ambient, dub, and breakbeat soundscapes with progressive sampling methods. A four-year hiatus and a few life-changing occurrences caused Norwood {{to return to the}} music industry in late 2008 with Human, her fifth studio album, which discussed topics of spiritual love, genuine heartache and universal honesty, and musically explored urban pop music. Experiencing a career and personal rejuvenation, Norwood was eager to scale back her previous pop venture and return to authentic R sound on her sixth studio album Two Eleven. The album was a <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> both Norwood's now-classic urban pop template and the bass-heavy trends of post-2000's contemporary hip-hop.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternate}} theory {{states that}} the system was introduced by the Nambudiri Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area {{since at least the}} 1st-century AD, there was a large influx from around the 8th-century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs. The Brahmins treated almost all of those who acceded to their priestly status as shudra, permitting only a small number to be recognised as kshatriya, these being some of the local rulers who co-operated with them. Certainly by the 11th-century, this combination of association with kings and invaders, and with the destruction or take-over of Buddhist temples, had made the Brahmins by far the largest group owning land in the region and they were to remain so until very recent times. Their introduction of Sanskrit and their <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> it with the local Tamil language to form Malayalam was also striking. Their dominating influence was to be found in all matters: religion, politics, society, economics and culture.|$|E

500|$|The {{sound of}} [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] has been {{compared}} to U2's 1987 single [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name," [...] prompted by a similar style of guitar playing, {{as well as to the}} atmospheric tone of the band's 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire. The <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> guitar and piano in the introduction was likened by the Edmonton Journal to the Coldplay song [...] "Clocks."

Critics also noticed similarities between some melodies and Mitsuda's previous work Chrono Trigger, though reviewers felt that those of Xenogears were more [...] "widely based" [...] and had a distinctive Celtic sound. The reviewers also praised the sound system used for the instrumental tracks as being up to the highest standard for the PlayStation console.|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful Liar" [...] is a mid-tempo song; musically, it is a <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> Shakira's Latin and Middle Eastern styles with Beyoncé's {{contemporary}} hip hop and R styles. Its {{theme is}} female empowerment; two female protagonists sing about being charmed {{by the same}} man, but instead of fighting over him, both ladies agree {{that he is not}} worth their time. The song was well received by music critics, who praised generally Beyoncé's and Shakira's collaboration. [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] was nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 50th Grammy Awards and the Spanish version was nominated for Record of the Year at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2007.

The reviewer of StarCraft for IGN praises the <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> the story into the gameplay and implies that the development of the characters {{during the course of the}} story, particularly that of Kerrigan, is unforgettable.

500|$|During the tour, Bowie's {{observation}} of two seminal American proto-punk artists {{led him to}} develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust character: a <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou Reed, producing [...] "the ultimate pop idol".

[...] Film scholar Casey Charness described [...] "cine-dance" [...] as [...] "a <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> the distinctive strengths of dancing and filmmaking that had never been done before" [...] and adds that Donen and Kelly [...] "seem to have elevated Hollywood dance from simplistic display of either dancing or photographic ability into a perception that incorporates both what the dancer can do and what the camera can see... developed a balance between camera and dancer that... encouraged both photographer and choreographer to contribute significantly to the creation and final effectiveness of dance." ...|$|E
500|$|After Betty and Rita {{find the}} decomposing body, they flee the {{apartment}} and their images are split apart and reintegrated. David Roche notes that Rita's lack of identity causes a breakdown that [...] "occurs {{not only at the}} level of the character but also {{at the level of the}} image; the shot is subjected to special effects that fragment their image and their voices are drowned out in reverb, the camera seemingly writing out the mental state of the characters". Immediately they return to Betty's aunt's apartment where Rita dons a blonde wig—ostensibly to disguise herself—but making her look remarkably like Betty. It is this transformation that one film analyst suggests is the <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> both identities. This is supported by visual clues, like particular camera angles making their faces appear to be merging into one. This is further illustrated soon after by their sexual intimacy, followed by Rita's personality becoming more dominant as she insists they go to Club Silencio at 2 a.m., that eventually leads to the total domination by Camilla.|$|E
500|$|Before Davenport left Constantinople {{to travel}} to Aleppo {{and then into the}} desert, he visited the royal stables, and also took {{advantage}} of an opportunity to view the Sultan during a public appearance. [...] He displayed his artistic ability and talent for detail by sketching several portraits of Abdul Hamid II from memory about a half-hour after observing him, as Davenport believed the ruler unwilling to have his image drawn. Davenport's personal impression of the Sultan was sympathetic, viewing him as a frail, elderly man burdened by the weight of his office but kind and fatherly to his children. Davenport compared his appearance as a <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> the late congressman from Maine, Nelson Dingley, with merchant and philanthropist Nathan Straus, commenting of the Sultan, [...] "I thought... that no matter what crimes had been charged to him, his expressionless soldiers, his army and its leaders were possibly more to blame than he." [...] Believing that he needed to keep his sketches a secret, he carried the sketch book in a hidden pocket throughout his journey, and at customs smuggled it onto the steamer home hidden inside a bale of hay.|$|E
50|$|Each player {{tries to}} earn reward money by {{participating}} in the capture of seven outlaws during multiple rounds of play. Outlaws are captured through the accumulation of capture points, awarded to players who play sets or <b>melds</b> <b>of</b> cards representing the outlaws, or who play cards which build on the <b>melds</b> <b>of</b> others.

500|$|Other {{tracks were}} noted for their retro stylization. [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] is {{a throwback to}} 1960s doo-wop and Philadelphia soul, with a slow tempo and modern drums. [...] "Party" [...] {{achieves}} a vintage aesthetic through minimalistic production, replete with heavy synthesizers and a 1980s smooth-funk groove. The song is unique for its conversation-like structure, in which Beyoncé and guest-vocalist André 3000 sing verses that allude to socialization at parties. Elements of Prince's style was found on [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] and [...] "I Care". [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] is an uptempo funk song, with lyrics that advise the listener to live life to the fullest while cautioning them {{about the consequences of}} excess. The chorus of [...] "I Care" [...] was compared to [...] "Purple Rain", with themes of sadness and resentment, the song uses soft background vocals and dense percussion. [...] "Love on Top" [...] was noted for its energetic key changes with a joyful tone, evoking the work of Michael and Janet Jackson. Its retro sound is marked by a <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> horns as well as sweet backing harmonies that are most prominent on its bridge and chorus.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews {{focused on}} the show's fusion of Wild West and outer space motifs. TV Guides Matt Roush, for instance, called the show [...] "oddball" [...] and [...] "offbeat", and noted how {{literally}} the series took the metaphor of space operas as Westerns. Roush opined that the shift from space travel to horseback was [...] "jarring", but that once he got used to this, he found the characters cleverly conceived, and the writing a crisp balance of action, tension and humor. Several reviewers, however, criticized the show's setting; Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that the <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> the western and science fiction genres was a [...] "forced hodgepodge of two alarmingly opposite genres {{just for the sake}} of being different" [...] and called the series a [...] "vast disappointment", and Carina Chocano of Salon.com said that while the [...] "space as Wild West" [...] metaphor is fairly redundant, neither genre connected to the present. Emily Nussbaum of the New York Times, reviewing the DVD set, noted that the program featured [...] "an oddball genre mix that might have doomed it from the beginning: it was a character-rich sci-fi western comedy-drama with existential underpinnings, a hard sell during a season dominated by Joe Millionaire".|$|E
500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{after the release}} of No Line on the Horizon. David Fricke of Rolling Stone enjoyed the song, writing, [...] "The rising-falling effect of the harmony voices around Bono... is a perfect picture of where he really wants to be, when he gets to the line about 'vision over visibility.'" [...] Blender considered it the high-point of the album, comparing it to the band's 1987 single [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Reviewer Rob Sheffield complimented the <b>melding</b> <b>of</b> bass, guitar, and vocals, calling it [...] "the kind of gimme-divinity anthem that U2 cut their teeth on, except it really does seem like they've gotten better at these songs now that they've picked up some bummed-out adult grit. Bono actually sounds scared of something in this song, and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual, the fear gives his voice some heft." [...] NME felt that it was the [...] "most impressive" [...] song on the album, describing it as a [...] "gorgeously sparse prayer built around Adam Clayton's heartbeat bassline and Bono's rough growl", and noting that despite its seven-minute length, it did not feel too long. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was more critical of the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have enough of a tune to support the full seven-minute gospel treatment", a sentiment that The Times agreed with.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} score for a meld, the cards {{comprising}} the given combination must all be in {{hand at the}} same time; thus cards played to previous tricks may not be included in melds.
