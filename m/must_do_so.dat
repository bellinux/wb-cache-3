5|$|Warren {{convened a}} meeting of the justices, and {{presented}} to them the simple argument that the only reason to sustain segregation was an honest belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the Court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.|$|E
5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those who study early 17th century lyric poetry <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E

Examples of popular schemes include http(s), ftp, mailto, file, data, and irc. URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), although non-registered schemes are used in practice.|$|E
5|$|Article 7 of the Indiana Constitution {{governs the}} term length of Supreme Court Justices. When {{there is a}} vacancy on the Court, a new justice is {{nominated}} using {{a variation of the}} Missouri Plan. First, the Judicial Nominating Commission submits a list of three qualified nominees to the governor. The governor then selects the new Justice from the list. If the governor fails to choose a replacement within sixty days, the chief justice or the acting chief justice <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> The Judicial Nomination Commission Chief Justice selects the chief justice from the sitting associate justices for a five-year term. The chief justice presides over the Court. When the position of chief justice becomes vacant, the most senior member of the Court serves as the acting chief justice until a new one is chosen by the Judicial Nominating Commission. The chief justice also serves as chairman of the Judicial Nominating Commission.|$|E

25|$|Elections are ostensibly by secret ballot. However, {{only one}} {{candidate}} {{who has been}} selected by the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland appears on the ballot. A voter may cross off the candidate's name to vote against them. However, anyone voting against the Front's candidate <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> without any secrecy. In most polling stations the voter <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> with a red pen next to the ballot box in sight of electoral officials. At some polling stations there is a separate ballot box for 'no' votes. Many North Korean defectors claim such an act of defiance is too risky to attempt.|$|E

There is no constitutional requirement that extradited fugitives be tried only for the crimes named in the extradition proceedings.|$|E
