40|$|Abstract- This paper {{introduces}} a new mechanism for load balancing in a network. Load balancing {{is a computer}} networking method for distributing workload across multiple computing resources such as computers, a computer cluster network links,central processing units or disk drives. Load Balancing is usually provided by dedicated software or hardware, such as a <b>multilayer</b> <b>switch</b> or Domain Name System Sever Process. There are various algorithms to perform load balancing. In this paper we will discuss how to perform load balancing using heaps and discuss the advantage and disadvantages of using this method to perform load balancing...|$|R

Here the switch is assigned a single virtual IP address. Traffic arriving at the switch is then directed to one of the real web servers attached to the switch. This has the advantage of balancing load, increasing total capacity, improving scalability, and providing increased reliability by redistributing the load of a failed web server and providing server health checks.|$|R

The application delivery controller (ADC) is assigned a single virtual IP address (VIP) that represents the pool of servers. Traffic arriving at the ADC is then directed to one of the servers in the pool (cluster, farm) based on a number of factors including application specific data values, application transport protocol, availability of servers, current performance metrics, and client-specific parameters. An ADN provides the advantages of load distribution, increase in capacity of servers, improved scalability, security, and increased reliability through application specific health checks.|$|R

Using multiple components with load balancing, instead of a single component, may increase reliability through redundancy. The balancing service is usually provided by a dedicated program or hardware device (such as a <b>multilayer</b> <b>switch).</b> One of the most common applications of load balancing is to provide a single Internet service from multiple servers, sometimes known as a server farm. Commonly load-balanced systems include popular web sites, large Internet Relay Chat networks, high-bandwidth File Transfer Protocol sites, NNTP servers and DNS servers. The load balancing system is a set of substitute buffer to share the server load, when their load exceeds its limit. The proposed technique gives an effective way to overcome the load balancing problem. Serving to more number of client requests is the main aim of every web server, but due to some unexpected load, the server performance may degrade In this paper we proposes a software enabled load balancing model by introducing the concept of sub servers for regional services to overcome the overhead of the main server...|$|R
