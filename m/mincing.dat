40|$|When {{fatty fish}} are {{transformed}} into surimi, lipid oxidation takes place, decreasing {{the quality of}} the product. This study was aimed to identify the critical stages of the process in terms of the development of lipid oxidation. Horse mackerels were transformed into surimi on a pilot line and samples taken (hand-skinned fillets = <b>minced</b> fillets, <b>mince,</b> washed and refined <b>minces,</b> paste, surimi and washing water). Most of the lipids were removed during the process and neutral lipids were lost in higher proportion than polar lipids. As a consequence, total lipids of surimi contained more polyunsaturated fatty acids (338 ± 19 g kg- 1) than total lipids of the <b>minced</b> fillets (220 ± 8 g kg- 1). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was higher in the <b>minced</b> fillets than in the <b>mince</b> because less subcutaneous fat and dark muscle were removed during hand-mincing, indicating that the settings of the skinning-deboning machine can strongly influence the final quality of the product. Concentrations of lipid oxidation products increased significantly during the next stages of surimi processing. The increase was more pronounced for TBARS than hydroperoxides. Concentrations in hydroperoxides were similar in <b>mince</b> and washed <b>mince</b> (15. 3 ± 2. 8 and 16. 6 ± 2. 8 mmoles kg- 1 lipid) and increased in refined <b>mince</b> (29. 6 ± 2. 8 mmoles kg- 1 lipid).

At a muscular 6'2", Fleming originally disapproved of his casting as James Bond, believing him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond; he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven playing the role.

Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger, [...] "He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and that really was the tenor of what the script was always trying to display". After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London.

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Minced</b> fish technology {{provides an opportunity for}} more efficient utilisation of small under-utilised fish species. The efficient utilisation of the enormous resources of small pelagic fish, particularly in developing countries, will lead to a significant improvement in human nutrition in general and in protein intake in particular. In the present study, whole uneviscerated sprats (Sorattus sprattus) were utilised to produce <b>mince</b> using a Baader 694 flesh/bone separator The versatility and stability of the resulting <b>mince</b> was investigated by examining the nutritional microbiological and sensory properties of the <b>mince</b> as incorporated into fish balls, where the fish <b>mince</b> was the major ingredient, and into fish sausages where the fish <b>mince</b> was used as a partial meat protein substitute. The investigation studied the effects of pre-cooking the raw material, and the effects of washing on fish <b>mince</b> quality and yield. Products produced from both unwashed and washed <b>mince</b> were found to have satisfactory shelf-lives, i. e. remained within acceptable microbiological limits, for both chilled and frozen storage. Overall products manufactured from the washed <b>mince</b> when compared with those from the unwashed <b>mince</b> had sensory properties that are generally considered to be mare acceptable to the consumer, particularly in developed countries where bland products are favoured. However, the washed <b>mince</b> has much higher production costs, and this should be taken into consideration in consumer testing, particularly in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|It was {{established}} that inclusion of black radish homogenate into model <b>minced</b> meat from different meat types (beef, pork, chicken) facilitates {{an increase in}} a degree of system hydrophilicity. In the experimental samples, the water binding capacity increased {{with an increase in}} the radish homogenate content at a level of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 % of meat weight. For example, in <b>minced</b> beef, it increased from 68 % (control) to 80 % (50 % of black radish homogenate), in <b>minced</b> pork from 55 to 73 %, in <b>minced</b> chicken from 72 to 82 %, respectively. An increase in water binding capacity in model <b>minced</b> meat was due to a pH shift from 5. 9 – 6. 05 to 6. 25 – 6. 43 (depending on a meat type) and the content of neutral salts in the dispersion system of the radish homogenate.
