50|$|A multiway merge {{allows for}} the files outside of memory to be merged in fewer passes than in a binary merge. If there are 6 runs that need be merged then a binary merge would need to take 3 merge passes, {{as opposed to a}} 6-way merges single <b>merge</b> <b>pass.</b> This {{reduction}} of merge passes is especially important considering the large amount of information that is usually being sorted in the first place, allowing for greater speed-ups while also reducing the amount of accesses to slower memory.|$|E
5000|$|The {{limitation}} to single-pass merging {{is that as}} {{the number}} of chunks increases memory will be divided into more buffers, so each buffer is smaller. This causes many smaller reads rather than fewer larger ones. Thus, for sorting, say, 50 GB in 100 MB of RAM, using a single <b>merge</b> <b>pass</b> isn't efficient: the disk seeks required to fill the input buffers with data from each of the 500 chunks (we read 100MB / 501 ~ 200KB from each chunk at a time) take up most of the sort time. Using two merge passes solves the problem. Then the sorting process might look like this: ...|$|E
40|$|SQL queries {{containing}} GROUPBY and aggregation occur {{frequently in}} decision support applications. Grouping with aggregation is typically done by first sorting the input and then performing the aggregation {{as part of}} the output phase of the sort. The most widely used external sorting algorithm is merge sort, consisting of a run formation phase followed by a (single) <b>merge</b> <b>pass.</b> The amount of data output from the run formation phase can be reduced by a technique that we call early grouping. The idea is straightforward: simply form groups and perform aggregation during run formation. Each run will now consist of partial groups instead of individual records. These partial groups are then combined during the merge phase. Early grouping always reduces the number of records output from the run formation phase. The relative output size depends on the amount of memory relative to the total number of groups and the distribution of records over groups. When the input data is uniformly distributed [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{concerns}} the experimental validation of recent numerical predictions of pipe blockage during the vertical hydraulic transport of ore for {{the deep sea}} mining industry. A hydraulic circuit, incorporating an 8. 5 m riser pipe of 99. 4 mm inner diameter, was built to identify and quantify the dominant transport mechanisms during conveying, <b>merging</b> and <b>passing</b> of two batches of solids. Experiments were conducted with single batches and various combinations of two batches, including two types of sand (0. 39 mm and 1. 05 mm), two types of gravel (6. 34 mm and 11. 20 mm) and Polystyrene granulate (2. 80 mm). Experiments indicated a decreasing influence of axial dispersion for an increasing particle size and particle density. By measurement data analysis, it is proven that axial dispersion is negligible for coarser solids, implying a larger risk of concentration peaks during transport compared to recent numerical calculations which assumed Taylor dispersion. Experiments with two merging batches revealed the ability for sand to <b>merge</b> and <b>pass</b> the gravel, whereas polystyrene merges and fuses with the gravel leading to pipe blockage. This discrepancy is thought to originate from a specific solids diameter ratio between both batches. A relation is suggested between the occurrence of pipe blockage and Terzaghi’s filter rules. The report concludes that the volume fraction of solids can rise significantly during the merging process and that for certain solids combinations, the merging process can lead to blockage of the riser.

40|$|Magnetosheath plasma peertated {{into the}} magnetospere {{creating}} the particle cusp, and similarly the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B(sub y) component penetrates the magnetopause. We reexamine the phenomenology of such penetration to investigate {{implications for the}} magnetopause merging site. Three models are popular: (1) the 'antiparallel' model, in which merging occurs where the local magnetic shear is largest (usually high magnetic latitude); (2) a tilted <b>merging</b> line <b>passing</b> through the subsolar point but extending to very high latitudes; or (3) a tilted <b>merging</b> line <b>passing</b> through the subsolar point in which most merging occurs within a few Earth radii of the equatorial plane and local noon (subsolar merging). It is difficult {{to distinguish between the}} first two models, but the third implies some very different predictions. We show that properties of the particle cusp imply that plasma injection into the magnetosphere occurs most often at high magnetic latitudes. In particular, we note the following: (1) The altitude of the merging site inferred from midaltitude cusp ion pitch angle dispersion is typically 8 - 12 R(sub E). (2) The highest ion energy observable when moving poleward through the cusp drops long before the bulk of the cusp plasma is reached, implying that ions are swimming upstream against the sheath flow shortly after merging. (3) Low-energy ions are less able to enter the winter cusp than the summer cusp. (4) The local time behavior of the cusp as a function of B(sub y) and B(sub z) corroborates predictions of the high-latitude merging models. We also reconsider the penetration of the IMF B(sub y) component onto closed dayside field lines. Our approach, in which closed field lines ove to fill in flux voids created by asymmetric magnetopause flux erosion, shows that strich subsolar merging cannot account for the observations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Magnetoacoustic {{waves in}} a Harris neutral current sheet are investigated.

40|$|We study {{families}} of one-dimensional matter-wave bright solitons {{supported by the}} competition of contact and dipole-dipole (DD) interactions of opposite signs. Soliton families are found, and their stability is investigated in the free space and {{in the presence of}} an optical lattice (OL). Free-space solitons may exist with an arbitrarily weak local attraction if the strength of the DD repulsion is fixed. In the case of the DD attraction, solitons do not exist beyond a maximum value of the local-repulsion strength. In the system which includes the OL, a stability region for subfundamental solitons is found in the second finite band gap. For the existence of gap solitons (GSs) under the attractive DD interaction, the contact repulsion must be strong enough. In the opposite case of the DD repulsion, GSs exist if the contact attraction is not too strong. Collisions between solitons in the free space are studied too. In the case of the local attraction, they <b>merge</b> or <b>pass</b> through each other at small and large velocities, respectively.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} the {{structure}} of wall turbulence have lead {{to the development of a}} conceptual model that validates and integrates many elements of previous models into a relatively simple picture based on self-assembling packets of hairpin vortex eddies. By continually spawning new hairpins the packets grow longer in the streamwise direction, and by mutual induction between adjacent hairpins the hairpins are strained so that they grow taller and wider as they age. The result is a characteristic growth angle in the streamwise-wall normal plane. The spanwise growth of individual packets implies that packets must either <b>merge</b> or <b>pass</b> through each other when they come into contact. Direct numerical simulations of the growth and interaction of spanwise adjacent hairpins shows that they merge by the vortex connection mechanism originally proposed by Wark and Nagib (1990). In this mechanism the quasi-streamwise legs of two hairpins annihilate each other, by virtue of having opposite vorticity, leaving a new hairpin of approximately double the width of the individuals. PIV measurements in planes parallel to the wall support this picture. DNS of multiple hairpins shows how the spanwise scale doubles when the hairpins form an array. 1...|$|R
