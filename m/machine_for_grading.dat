40|$|One of {{important}} coffee beans quality {{is the size}} uniformity. To confirm with the standart requirement, coffee beans have to be graded before being traded. Until now, grading process is still carried out fully manual, so that the grading cost is very expensive about 40 % of total processing cost. Meanwhile, shortage of skill workers is as a limiting factor of the process. Therefore, <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> <b>grading</b> coffee beans is good alternative for grading cost. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed a table vibration type coffee grading machine for grouping of coffee beans in order to consistent quality and reduce grading cost. The machine has dimension of 272 cm length, 126 cm height, and 144 cm width. The machine has three primary components, i. e. grader table, combustion engine, and beam. The machine has three kinds of grader table that each grader table has different holes size, i. e. 7 mm x 7 mm for top grader table, 5 mm x 5 mm for axle grader table, and 4 mm x 4 mm for bottom grader table. Each grader table has dimension of 206 cm length, 105. 5 cm height, and 14 cm width. The grading mechanism is by vibration grader table with the power source 5. 5 HP combustion engine. The results shown that the outlet are in farms of three grades of coffee beans with connected to each compartement. Assessment of the grading machine reveals that the optimum capacity of 1, 406 kg/hour reached when the speed 2, 600 rpm and the angle 10 O. Economic analysis showed that operational cost for grading one kilogram Robusta coffee beans with moisture content 13 — 14 % wet basis is Rp 7. 17.

40|$|Coffee {{consumers}} {{request a}} good quality of green coffee {{to get a}} good coffee cup taste. Defective beans e. g. black bean, brown bean and broken bean are associated to low coffee quality which give negative effects to final taste. To meet the standard export requirement, coffee beans have to be graded before being traded. Until now, grading process is generally carried out manually. The method gives better product, so the grading cost is very expensive about 40 % of total processing cost. Meanwhile, shortage of skill workers is a limiting factor of the process. Therefore, improving the manual sorting by providing <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> <b>grading</b> of green coffee is good alternative to reduce the grading cost. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed a table conveyor type grading machine in order to improve the performance of the manual grading productivity and consistent quality and to reduce the grading cost. The conveyor belt has a dimension of 5700 mm of length, 610 mm of width and 6 mm of thickness. The rotating of belt conveyor powered by an electro motor 3 HP, 3 phase and 1420 rpm. The result showed that the optimum capacity of grading machine was 390 kg/hour reached when the speed 16 rpm and 3 kg/m 2 of green beans on belt conveyor with productivity 1870 kg/man-day compared to the productivity full manually process 743 kg/man-day. Percentage of product in outlet 1 was 4. 2 % as broken beans, 0. 26 % as brown beans, 0. 68 % as one hole in beans and 0. 61 % as more than one hole in beans.

40|$|AbstractImprovement {{of quality}} and value {{addition}} of agricultural produces has gained higher concern in recent times in Sri Lanka due to creation of new opportunities for sale of agricultural commodities in open market at competitive prices. Grading according to the sizes is an important value adding technique for most agricultural products. And also {{the price of the}} many agricultural products varies significantly according to their uniformity in size. Uniformity in size not only makes the produce more attractive to consumers but also improve its processing qualities. At present, size grading of most agricultural crops including big onion are carried out manually by crop collectors, whole sellers and retail sellers, most of farmers market their products without any grading. In Sri Lanka, persons engaging in post-harvest crop handling such as collectors, whole sellers, retail sellers, and farmers have less chance to use high technical and costly grading technique. And also local market survey reported, retail market price of the big onion bulbs are significantly varied according to its size. Hence, this research study attempted to design and development of a low cost size <b>grading</b> <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> size <b>grading</b> of big onion bulbs.

40|$|Structural designs {{codes and}} {{standards}} {{are based on a}} reliable knowledge of the mechanical properties of materials. Alongside seasoning and preservation, grading plays a fundamental role in the production of reliable, natural structural products such as timber. Unfortunately, grading of bamboo is not implemented in a standardised or systematic manner, if at all. This may partly explain why bamboo, despite its many sustainable attributes, remains a marginal material in engineered structures. Currently, in partnership with the International Standards Organisation (ISO) Coventry University and the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR) are drafting a grading standard. This INBAR Working Paper presents research into potential <b>grading</b> methodologies <b>for</b> one species of bamboo – Guadua angustifolia Kunth – and recommends criteria <b>for</b> both visual <b>grading</b> and <b>machine</b> <b>grading.</b> <b>For</b> visual <b>grading,</b> the diameter of bamboo culms is deemed to be an important consideration when <b>grading</b> <b>for</b> flexural capacity – a 10 percent increase in external diameter results in a 24 percent increase in flexural capacity. Wall thickness is considered to be critical to shear and tension perpendicular capacities. <b>For</b> <b>machine</b> <b>grading,</b> three main properties were found to be significant: flexural stiffness – important for the design of beams, slender struts and portal frames; linear mass – to help infer density, which is closely correlated to strength properties; and external diameter – which correlated well with flexural capacity and stiffness. It is important to note, that measuring any of these properties can be undertaken in a quick, simple, cost-effective and non-destructive manner. The paper suggests that additional properties that may be critical to design or other applications should be further researched – sheer strength or tensile strength perpendicular to fibres, for instance, which are important to the process of connection design. Implemented effectively, the grading methodologies presented have the potential to enhance the supply of bamboo and deliver positive benefits to producers, contractors, engineers, and consumers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: This paper {{introduces}} latent {{semantic analysis}} (LSA), a <b>machine</b> learning method <b>for</b> representing {{the meaning of}} words, sentences, and texts. LSA induces a high-dimensional semantic space from reading a very large amount of texts. The meaning of words and texts can be represented as vectors in this space and hence can be compared automatically and objectively. Psychological theory: A generative theory of the mental lexicon based on LSA is described. The word vectors LSA constructs are context free, and each word, irrespective of how many meanings or senses it has, is represented by a single vector. However, when a word is used in different contexts, context appropriate word senses emerge. Current applications: Several applications of LSA to educational software are described, involving the ability of LSA to quickly compare the content of texts, such as an essay written by a student and a target essay. Potential medical applications: An LSA-based software tool is sketched <b>for</b> <b>machine</b> <b>grading</b> of clinical case summaries written by medical students...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Structural timber in Europe {{is either}} graded {{visually}} or by machine. Both grading methods {{are applied to}} limit the variation in engineering properties of sawn timber. The obtained grading results are largely dependent on the method chosen. In addition, parameters such as species, source, and cross-section of the timber, {{as well as the}} applied grading rules also play a role. To what extent these parameters- depending on the chosen grading method- actually affect timber properties and yields is of interest for both producers and users of sawn timber. For analysing the different grading results, laboratory data of 10704 spruce specimens were evaluated. The used cross-section has a major influence on the grading result. Furthermore, the used grading rule and the method applied to determine characteristic values are essential <b>for</b> the <b>grading</b> result. The origin of the timber influences the grading results of both grading methods. While the yields <b>for</b> <b>machine</b> <b>grading</b> are always higher than <b>for</b> visual <b>grading,</b> both grading methods are prone to fall short of the declared properties. It is recommended to adjust the normative framework as well as to regulate both grading procedures similarly...|$|R

40|$|Australian-grown Pinus radiata D. Don (radiata pine) timber, 35 x 150 mm and 35 x 200 mm in cross-section, was {{mechanically}} {{and visually}} graded, then subjected to mechanical testing to determine {{modulus of elasticity}} and modulus of rupture. Results were compared to previous ones for radiata pine 35 x 120 mm and 35 x 90 mm in cross-section, and to normally accepted in-grade strength and stiffness requirements. Timber stiffness met the accepted requirements for all the visual and mechanical grades. Under the 1973 Australian visual grading rules the material had comparable strength ratings to that of mechanically graded timber. If, however, the current visual rules had been used the timber strength of the F 8 and F 7 grades would have been inadequate. A return to the 1973 rules appears warranted. <b>For</b> <b>machine</b> <b>grading,</b> the lower 2. 5 percentile of modulus of rupture was, <b>for</b> most <b>grades,</b> slightly below the normally accepted limits and a minor change to the current grading programmes appears to be warranted for the larger cross-sections.

The investigated sample comprised more than 900 pieces of timber of Norway spruce (Picea abies) from Sweden, Norway and Finland. The coefficient of determination between the indicating property (IP) to bending strength and the measured bending strength was as high as R 2 = 0. 69, while the coefficient of determination between dynamic MOE and measured bending strength was R 2 = 0. 53.

Unlike aluminium, concrete or steel which are produced within a quality control system, softwood is a natural product with considerable variability. Before a softwood structural member can be used it must be either visually graded or machine graded. In this non machine grading research, considerable laboratory testing is used to develop a series of statistical relationships, so that softwood properties such as modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture of the recovered softwood can be estimated from the softwood's specific gravity, annular rings per inch and date of construction of the building being demolished.

40|$|Computer-aided {{decision}} support in medical problems is a prominent research area nowadays. In this PhD thesis, two approaches are shown {{to support the}} medical decisions for diabetic retinopathy (DR). This disease {{is one of the}} most common causes of blindness in the developed countries. Thus, timely and precise detection is essential for a large population. Furthermore, high reliability of the diagnosis is also desired. The first major contribution of this thesis is an approach to the early detection of DR on color fundus images. This approach aims to detect the earliest signs of DR, namely microaneurysms (MAs). Since MA detection in color fundus images is a very challenging task, we propose a novel ensemble-based framework to ensure reliable fusion of MA detection output, namely ensembles. This approach proved its capabilities in exhaustive evaluation, including a competition dedicated to the comparison of MA detectors (Retinopathy Online Challenge), where it is currently ranked as first. The second major contribution of this thesis is an approach to retinal image grading based on the detailed analysis of color fundus images. Both the detected anatomical parts and presence of lesions are considered as features.
