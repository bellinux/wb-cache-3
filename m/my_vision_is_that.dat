40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{has become}} mainstream. Users and companies {{are seeking to}} shift their desktop applications onto the cloud. For example, General Electric recently started using Box for content sharing and collaboration. Amazon provides pre-configured machine images so that users can run Microsoft products like SQL Server directly on Amazon EC 2 instances.

Being able to run unmodified desktop applications on the cloud greatly aids deployment and adoption. Unfortunately, layering desktop applications over the cloud could result in incorrect application behavior. For example, consider a simple database that runs inside a folder on Dropbox.

While the local storage may be updated in this order, Dropbox may sync the files to the cloud in a different order, resulting in incorrect behavior if the local storage fails.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present a novel {{approach}} to space perception. I provide a body-centric computational model, The Hallucination Machine, that integrates bodily knowledge with senses in a common modality which I call "the sphere of embodiment". Understanding the human experience of space is an important inquiry {{not only in the}} context of design and architecture, but in a broad range of scholarly disciplines where humans are the subject of study, whether as biological, social, or cognitive entities. <b>My</b> <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{in order to create a}} knowledge of space shared through different disciplines and to develop tools and methods of scientific inquiry into the "human space," we have to conceptualize a space perception model that connects sensory experience with the actions and bodily knowledge of the actor. Implications for such a model have been proposed by phenomenologists in the philosophical realm and carried into psychology through concepts of embodiment, situated cognition, and enaction. The Hallucination Machine illustrates the inner-spatial relations between different senses and movements, collected through sensory and inertial recording devices of the machine which experiences space situated by its human carrier. Through this inquiry, I argue that all senses, including proprioception and orientation, are collapsed in one medium, a sphere of embodiment, in which they form a multimodal spatial experience and communicate through it. I demonstrate the practical implications of this medium through a set of experiments. by Cagri Hakan Zaman. Thesis: S. M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Architecture, 2014.

40|$|Several European countries, {{including}} the UK, {{are investing in}} large-scale telehealthcare pilots, to thoroughly evaluate the benefits of telehealthcare. Due to {{the high level of}} risk associated with such projects, it becomes desirable to be able to predict the success of telehealthcare systems in potential deployments, in order to inform investment and help save resources. An important factor for the success of any telehealthcare deployment is usability, as it helps to achieve the benefits of the technology through increased productivity, decreased error rates, and better acceptance. In particular, efficiency, one of the characteristics of usability, should be seen as a central measure for success, as the timely care of a high number of patients is one of the important claims of telehealthcare. Despite the recognized importance of usability, it is seen as secondary in the design of telehealthcare systems. The resulting problems are difficult to predict due to the heterogeneity of deployment contexts. This thesis proposes the automation of usability evaluation through the use of modelling and simulation techniques. It describes a generic methodology which can guide a modeller in reusing models for predicting characteristics of usability within different deployment sites. It also describes a modelling approach which can be used together with the methodology, to run in parallel a user model, inspired from a cognitive architecture, and a system model, represented as a basic labelled transition system. The approach simulates a user working with a telehealthcare system, and within her environment, to predict the efficiency of the system and work process surrounding it. The modeller can experiment with different inputs to the models in terms of user profile, workload, ways of working, and system design, to model different potential- real or hypothetical- deployments, and obtain efficiency predictions for each. A comparison of the predictions helps analyse the effects on efficiency of changes in deployments. The work is presented as an experimental investigation, but emphasises the great potential of modelling and simulation for helping to inform investment, help reduce costs, mitigate risks and suggest changes that would be necessary for improving the usability, and therefore success or telehealthcare deployments. <b>My</b> <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> if used commercially, the approaches presented in this thesis could help reduce risks for scaling up telehealthcare deployments...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the perceived {{need for a}} justifiable and coherent values education paradigm in Kenya's Education. It focuses on contrasts in education policy with implications for values education. The first two post colonial education reports: the Ominde Commission (OC) 1964 / 65 and the National Committee on Educational Objectives and Policies (NCEOP) 1976 agree that education should promote socioeconomic and political development. However, they disagree {{over the role of}} religion, particularly, Christianity and African Socialism in underpinning values within this development. This thesis attempts to present an argument that in contemporary Kenya's secondary educational context, {{there is a need for}} a holistic values education paradigm. If a Christian curriculum is to be viable, in order to be relevant both to the lives of young people and to the developing context of Kenya, Christian related values education must connect with the whole human environment to make Christianity meaningful, relevant, implicit and applicable to life. The OC recommends Judeo-Christianity to underpin the values, but later contradicts this stance. It consigns ethics to the 'Hidden Curriculum', doubting whether values education can be part of a formal school curriculum. The NCEOP radically reverses the order, rejecting religion particularly Christianity. It paradoxically recommends African traditional values, which are of course, themselves, implicitly religious. These contrasting views concerning the theory of knowledge in this educational context are problematic. Through documentary, discourse, and theoretical analysis of and commentary on relevant documents and literature together with a supportive descriptive questionnaire, this thesis argues for the possibility of applying contextualisation, a theological construct which involves a number of concepts, to education; a philosophical framework which relates religion to the context of the learner and could provide a coherent values education paradigm. Part one of the thesis establishes the contrasting views and elaborates key points of tension. Part two analyses the philosophical issues involved. Part three presents and analyses research findings. Part four investigates the contextualisation continuum to draw some conclusions at the level of general principles and make some tentative proposals at the level of Curriculum. Part five summarises the study with recommendations and conclusions. <b>My</b> <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a Judeo- Christian based values education paradigm within the contextualisation continuum will coherently underpin the holistic development of Kenyans for their own good and that of the society...|$|E

It is {{my belief}} that Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) {{traditional}} knowledge practices are critical to the retention of new language learners and ultimately to the future direction of Anishinaabemowin (Ojibwe language) revitalization. However, the forced displacement of Anishinaabe peoples from their traditional territories and the contemporary context in which this is reenacted has created a “cultural void” where oral practices, storytelling, and experiential-social learning are often secondary to western pedagogical structures. My research focuses on developing ways that Anishinaabe traditional knowledge practices for language transmission can work in contemporary institutional contexts. Rather than simply providing students with a short repertoire of basic words, this work focuses on creating an environment that will allow students {{to become part of}} a long-term language-learning community, which fosters fluency through an Anishinaabe framework. I have been working with northern First Nations communities, community members, and community organizations to create viable options for prioritizing methods of language transmission that emphasize the spiritual, physical, emotional and mental aspects of our identities and promote foundational Anishinaabe knowledge in language transmission. In a contemporary context, some of theses options include the development of video conferencing networks and video documentaries that can enhance oral teaching practices and create accessible story archives in the language. As well, the work has involved creating a sustainable language learning community locally at the University of Toronto and by internet-based communications across northern Ontario, through social activities, theatre projects and community participation. The goal is to stretch Anishinaabemowin interactions beyond classroom boundaries and to create greater opportunities to retain new learners and allow for more experiential, traditional learning. <b>My</b> <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> when combined, the Anishinaabe methods for transmitting the language (via traditional knowledge practices and philosophies) and technologies that promote oral language transmission could become a powerful tool for recreating healthy, vibrant Anishinaabe communities. *As Anishinaabe (Ojibwe person), I have been taught to introduce myself and state my intentions first in my language; this, according to the Elders I have learned from, is the way that my intentions are heard not just by you, but by the spirits of my ancestors and by creation.

40|$|Abstract. Image {{understanding}} and image semantics processing have recently {{become an issue}} of critical importance in computer vision R&D. Biological vision has always considered them as an enigmatic mixture of perceptual and cognitive processing faculties. In its impetuous and rash development, computer vision without any hesitations has adopted this stance. I will argue that such a segregation of image processing faculties is wrong, both for the biological and the computer <b>vision.</b> <b>My</b> conjecture <b>is</b> <b>that</b> images contain only one sort of information – the perceptual (physical) information, which can be discovered in an image and elicited for further processing. Cognitive (semantic) information is {{not a part of}} image-conveyed information. It belongs to a human observer that acquires and interprets the image. Relying on a new definition of “information”, which can be derived from Kolmogorov’s complexity theory and Chaitin’s notion of algorithmic information, I propose a unifying framework for visual information processing, which explicitly accounts for perceptual and cognitive image processing peculiarities. I believe, it would provide better scaffolding for modeling visual information processing in human brain. ...|$|R

Then I wandered from the fancies of others and formed {{affections}} and intimacies with the aerial creations of my own brain--but still clinging to reality I gave a name to these conceptions and nursed them in the hope of realization.

I bestowed on him all my affections; there was a miniature of him that I gazed on continually; I copied his last letter and read it again and again.

40|$|To {{traverse}} the blinking, Transitar el parpadeo, {{is to consider}} six poetries that seem invisible or at least blurred in current Spanish poetic contexts: José-Miguel Ullán, Carlos Piera, Pedro Provencio, Ildefonso Rodríguez, Olvido García Valdés, Miguel Casado. All of these poets start writing in a period strongly marked by the endings of francoism, and {{the beginnings of the}} democracy. The blinking refers to their apparitions and disappearances in general panoramas of Spanish poetry, but it also refers to something that bothers the eyes of most Spanish critics: their criticism is only able to see generations, replacements, and poetic hegemonies. To {{traverse the}} blinking is, thus, a question about the reason <b>that</b> their <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> so obstructed, and, at the same time, an attempt to really see these poets, which implies finding a new way of reading them. Since these poetics resist any form of closure, and, at the same time, they offer themselves as an invitation to mobility; we need to find theoretical approaches to reading that do not betray those resistances and preserve the trace of <b>that</b> traversing. This <b>is</b> why I have chosen to organize my dissertation in six chapters, each of them dealing with a poet, and I have concluded without properly or formally closing, but formulating some premises on how to keep crossing through those poetic <b>visions.</b> <b>My</b> conclusion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> categories such as strangeness, the foreign, exodus, and the border, would necessarily need to be acknowledged in order to start to make visible the foundations of these writings. I maintain that they reveal a tradition, long repressed during francoism and also during the first stages of a democratic transition based in a pact of forgetting, a tradition that these poets claim as theirs and which considers the avant-garde as a lineage that, not only cannot be waived, but should be reconsidered. Traversing them, thus, offers new insights on theoretical issues such as subjectivity, poetry's relation to thought, its formal limits, and the question about reality, while believing that language, by retaining its restlessness, continues to offer itself as a powerful tool of resistance and memory.

40|$|To {{paraphrase}} Stan Ulam, a Polish mathematician {{who became}} a leading figure in the Manhattan Project, in this dissertation I focus not only on how computer science can help biologists, but also on how biology can inspire computer scientists. On one hand, computer science provides powerful abstraction tools for metabolic networks. Cell metabolism is the set of chemical reactions taking place in a cell, {{with the aim of}} maintaining the living state of the cell. Due to the intrinsic complexity of metabolic networks, predicting the phenotypic traits resulting from a given genotype and metabolic structure is a challenging task. To this end, mathematical models of metabolic networks, called genome-scale metabolic models, contain all known metabolic reactions in an organism and can be analyzed with computational methods. In this dissertation, I propose a set of methods to investigate models of metabolic networks. These include multi-objective optimization, sensitivity, robustness and identifiability analysis, and are applied to a set of genome-scale models. Then, I augment the framework to predict metabolic adaptation to a changing environment. The adaptation of a microorganism to new environmental conditions involves shifts in its biochemical network and in the gene expression level. However, gene expression profiles do not provide a comprehensive understanding of the cellular behavior. Examples are the cases in which similar profiles may cause different phenotypic outcomes, while different profiles may give rise to similar behaviors. In fact, my idea is to study the metabolic response to diverse environmental conditions by predicting and analyzing changes in the internal molecular environment and in the underlying multi-omic networks. I also adapt statistical and mathematical methods (including principal component analysis and hypervolume) to evaluate short term metabolic evolution and perform comparative analysis of metabolic conditions. On the other hand, <b>my</b> <b>vision</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a biomolecular system can be cast as a “biological computer”, therefore providing insights into computational processes. I therefore study how computation can be performed in a biological system by proposing a map between a biological organism and the von Neumann architecture, where metabolism executes reactions mapped to instructions of a Turing machine. A Boolean string represents the genetic knockout strategy and also the executable program stored in the “memory” of the organism. I use this framework to investigate scenarios of communication among cells, gene duplication, and lateral gene transfer. Remarkably, this mapping allows estimating the computational capability of an organism, taking into account also transmission events and communication outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{democratic}} {{theory of}} Claude Lefort, a French philosopher, is established {{on the idea}} of a society in continuous construction. According to Claude Lefort, a society is not determined in advance. The forms that it can take continuously change. From this point of view, Lefort attempts to understand modern democracy as it emerges from the breakdown of the monarchy. The monarchistic mutation of the 18 th century provokes a new perception of power, because of the death of the king, the guarantor and representative of the unity of the kingdom. Because of the fact <b>that</b> power <b>was</b> embodied in the prince, and therefore gave society a body, an effective knowledge of what one meant to the other existed through the social. From this point of view, Lefort draws a revolutionary and unprecedented conclusion concerning democratic society. In democratic society, the locus of power becomes an empty place. That means power belongs to none or to everyone. The point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the institutional apparatus prevents governments from appropriating power for their own ends, from incorporating it into themselves. The exercise of power is subject to the procedures of periodical redistribution. It represents the outcome of a controlled contest with permanent rules. This phenomenon implies an institutionalization of conflict, i. e. of competition. The empty place of power refers to the idea <b>that</b> it cannot <b>be</b> occupied – it <b>is</b> such <b>that</b> no individual and no group can be consubstantial with it – and it cannot be represented. In this sense, then, democracy is a politico-social form in which the “openness” or the “indeterminacy” of the social is institutionally registered. Concretely, the legitimacy of power emanates from popular suffrage, as long as it <b>is</b> recognized <b>that</b> the identity of the People itself changes over time. Through this approach, I try to consider the “Conférence Nationale Souveraine” (CNS) and the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) of the earlier 1990 ’s – in ex-Zaire and in South Africa – as important events in terms of the definition of new social <b>visions.</b> <b>My</b> assumption <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these events <b>are</b> genuine foundations of democratic societies. Through the Constitutions adopted in these two negotiating forums, it seems clear that the break between {{the past and the future}} is established. From the processes of negotiating to the agreed constitutions, all the elements conducive to build a democracy (in Lefort’s terms) are combined...|$|R
