40|$|The {{recently}} reported unusual {{behavior of the}} static and dynamical magnetic susceptibility {{as well as the}} specific heat in Ce$_{ 1 -x}$La$_{x}$Ni$_{ 9 }$Ge$_ 4 $ has raised the question of a possible non-Fermi liquid ground state in this material. We argue that for a consistent physical picture the crystal field splitting of two low lying <b>magnetic</b> <b>doublets</b> of the Ce $ 4 f$-shell must be taken into account. Furthermore, we show that for a splitting of the order of the low temperature scale $T^*$ of the system a crossover behavior between an SU(4) and an SU(2) Kondo effect is found. The screening of the two doublets occurs on different temperature scales leading to a different behavior of the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat at low temperatures.

40|$|Electronic and {{magnetic}} (e-m) properties of FeBr 2 have been surprisingly well described as originating from the Fe 2 + ions and their fine electronic structure. The fine electronic structure {{have been evaluated}} {{taking into account the}} spin-orbit (s-o) coupling, crystal-field and inter-site spin-dependent interactions. The required <b>magnetic</b> <b>doublet</b> ground state with an excited singlet at D= 2. 8 meV results from the trigonal distortion. This effect of the trigonal distortion and a large magnetic moment of iron, of 4. 4 mB, can be theoretically derived provided the s-o coupling is correctly taking into account. The obtained good agreement with experimental data indicates on extremaly strong correlations of the six 3 d electrons in the Fe 2 + ion yielding their full localization and the insulating state. These calculations show that for the meaningful analysis of e-m properties of FeBr 2 the spin-orbit coupling is essentially important and that the orbital moment (0. 74 mB) is largely unquenched (by the off-cubic trigonal distortion {{in the presence of the}} spin-orbit coupling).

40|$|Motivated by {{experimental}} {{observation of}} the Kondo-enhanced Andreev transport [R. S. Deacon et al., PRB 81, 121308 (R) (2010) ] in a hybrid normal metal-quantum dot-superconductor (N-QD-S) device, we theoretically study the Kondo effect in such a device and clarify the different roles played by the normal and superconducting leads. Due to the Andreev reflection in a QD-S system, a pair of Andreev energy levels form in the superconducting gap, which is able to carry the magnetic moment if the ground state of the QD is a <b>magnetic</b> <b>doublet.</b> In this sense, the Andreev energy levels play a role of effective impurity levels. When the normal lead is coupled to the QD-S system, on the one hand, the Andreev energy levels broaden to form the so-called Andreev bound states (ABSs), on the other hand, it can screen the magnetic moment of the ABSs. By tuning the couplings between the QD and the normal (superconducting) leads, the ABSs can simulate the Kondo, mixed-valence, and even empty orbit regimes of the usual single-impurity Anderson model. The above picture is confirmed by the Green's function calculation of the hybrid N-QD-S Anderson model and is also able to explain qualitatively experimental phenomena observed by Deacon et al [...] These results can further stimulate related experimental study in the N-QD-S systems.

40|$|The rate of {{radiation}} of energy from {{a ring of}} electrons revolving in a circular orbit and from various other distributions of moving electric charges and magnetic poles has been calculated by G. A. Schott, [1] who finds that the rate {{of radiation}} of energy is almost invariably positive. This is certainly true {{in the case of a}} single electric pole describing a circular orbit as is indicated by the well known formulae of Larmor and Liénard for the rate of radiation. Thus electromagnetic theory in its present form lends no suport to Bohr's idea of non-radiating orbits. A steady distribution, such as a Parson magneton which consists of a complete ring of electric charges following one another round the ring at a constant speed will evidently give no radiation when the ring is stationary as a whole, but as Schott remarks the ring may be expected to radiate energy when its centre has an acceleration. Schott's results are so important that it is desirable that they should be confirmed by an independent method and an attempt has been made to devise a method by which the rate of radiation from a moving electric pole and <b>magnetic</b> <b>doublet</b> may be readily calculated.

The most generic form of the nearest-neighbor anisotropic superexchange pseudospin- 1 / 2 Hamiltonian is also constructed from the symmetry properties, which is applicable to Kramers ions Nd^{ 3 +}, Sm^{ 3 +}, and Yb^{ 3 +} potentially showing large quantum effects. The effective model is then studied {{by means of a}} classical mean-field theory and the exact diagonalization on a single tetrahedron and on a 16 -site cluster. These calculations reveal appreciable quantum fluctuations leading to quantum phase transitions to a quadrupolar state as a melting of spin ice for the Pr^{ 3 +} case. The model also shows a formation of cooperative quadrupole moment and pseudospin chirality on tetrahedrons. A sign of a singlet quantum spin ice is also found in a finite region in the space of coupling constants. The relevance to the experiments is discussed.

We start with the model that {{consists}} of an Anderson impurity connected to two superconducting (SC) leads with the gaps ∆α = |∆α | e iθα, where α = L, R for the lead at left and right. We show that, {{when one of the}} SC gaps is much larger than the others |∆L | ≫ |∆R|, the starting model can be mapped exactly onto the single-channel model, which consists of the right lead of ∆R and the Anderson impurity with an extra onsite SC gap of ∆d ≡ ΓL e iθL. Here θL and ΓL are defined with respect to the starting model, and ΓL is the level width due to the coupling with the left lead. Based on this simplified model, we study the ground-state properties for the asymmetric gap, |∆L | ≫ |∆R|, using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. The results show that the phase difference of the SC gaps φ ≡ θR − θL, which induces the Josephson current, disturbs the screening of the local moment to destabilize the singlet ground state typical of the Kondo system. It can also drive the quantum phase transition to a <b>magnetic</b> <b>doublet</b> ground state, and at the critical point the Josephson current shows a discontinuous change.

The low temperature structure, which coexists with superconductivity, consists of ferromagnetic sheets of Ho{ 3 + moments in the a-b plane, with the sheets coupled antiferromagnetically along the c-axis. The magnetic state that initially forms on cooling, however, is dominated by an incommensurate spiral antiferromagnetic state along the c-axis, with wave vector qc ~ 0. 054 A- 1, in which these ferromagnetic sheets are canted from their low temperature antiparallel configuration by ~ 17 deg. The intensity for this spiral state reaches a maximum near the reentrant superconducting transition at ~ 5 K; the spiral state then collapses at lower temperature in favor of the commensurate antiferromagnetic state. We have investigated the field dependence of the magnetic order at and above this reentrant superconducting transition.
