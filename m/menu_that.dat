5|$|Like most European {{restaurant}}s, La Caravelle had a <b>menu</b> <b>that</b> changed daily. This {{made the}} restaurant popular with new customers and also {{brought them back}} regularly. Salvador Dalí, John Lindsay, Leland Hayward and Dorothy Kilgallen often dined at the restaurant in its early years. The journalist and broadcaster Walter Cronkite was a regular visitor to La Caravelle and enjoyed eating pike quenelles in lobster cream sauce. Other frequent visitors included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Marlene Dietrich.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} major fast food vendors, BK has a <b>menu</b> <b>that</b> {{specifically}} targets children. The company introduced its child-oriented product line in North America {{during the summer}} of 1990 with an advertising program called the Burger King Kid's Club. In the United States, the meal is called the Kids Club Meal and it is primarily positioned against the popular Happy Meal from McDonald's. The meal includes an entrée, a side order, beverage, and a toy. The toy is usually a product tie-in with a movie or popular television show. The entrée and side offerings differ from market to market, as does portion size.|$|E

5|$|Ya Kun Kaya Toast {{have over}} forty Singaporean outlets, {{about half of}} which are franchised, and over thirty {{overseas}} outlets, all franchised, across seven countries (China, Indonesia, Japan, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines and United Arab Emirates); they plan to expand to Brunei, India, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Thailand in future. The stores have a retro ambience, with wooden tables and stools, Chinese calligraphy of the company name, posters about their history, traditional methods of preparing food and customer service reflecting Chinese family values. Unlike their main competitors, they have a limited <b>menu</b> <b>that</b> revolves around their core product, kaya toast, with cheese, peanut butter and ice cream as alternative spreads for their thin, brown, crispy bread. To appeal to a wider demographic, Ya Kun also sell French toast and Toastwiches (their Asian alternative to sandwiches); set meals combine any type of toast with soft-boiled eggs and a beverage, usually coffee or teh tarik.|$|E

500|$|KFC {{began to}} expand outside of Bangalore in 2004, with a {{localized}} <b>menu</b> <b>that</b> {{was the most}} extensive meat-free menu across the chain's worldwide operations. It introduced a vegetarian <b>menu</b> <b>that</b> included rice meals, wraps and side dishes and, like McDonald's, served eggless mayonnaise and sauces. Unnat Varma, marketing director of KFC India, states [...] "The vegetarian offerings have made the brand more relevant to a larger section of consumers and that is necessary for KFC's growth." [...] KFC also began using Indian spices and cooking techniques to localize its chicken dishes. By 2008–09, KFC operated 34 outlets in India. In 2014, KFC launched the [...] "So Veg, So Good" [...] menu {{as part of an}} India-specific promotional strategy focused on enhancing their vegetarian range. The company has been up to a lot of innovation {{over the past few months}} with the launch of the first-ever no crust, all chicken KFC Chizza in December 2016. [...] More recently, KFC got Mumbai's dabbawalas to deliver its newly launched 5-in-1 Meal Boxes. The city's dabbawalas, famed for their efficient delivery of office lunches, took on the role of KFC delivery men as part of an innovative marketing campaign. They supplied specially created 5-in-1 meal boxes to some office-goers instead of their regular dabbas. The innovation efforts have continued with the launch of the Watt a Box, a practical new take on the 5-in-1 Meal Box, which can also charge phones.|$|E

On Twitter, Carl insults Ramsey for the review, not realizing that his reply is public, and gains a large Twitter following. Carl comes up with an inspirational new <b>menu</b> <b>that</b> his staff loves and invites Ramsey to a [...] "rematch". He quits after confronting Riva, who wants the same old menu again. At home, Carl prepares the menu he wanted to serve to Ramsey. Carl's assistant becomes the interim chef and even the regular dishes do not succeed. Ramsey again starts to tweet negatively about Carl, leading Carl {{to go to the}} restaurant, where he angrily and publicly berates Ramsey.|$|E
500|$|Saints Row: The Third {{introduced}} experience {{levels and}} weapon upgrades to the series. Most {{actions in the}} game come with incentives {{in the form of}} money and respect (reputation). Money buys land, weapons, and other upgrades, and respect is a kind of experience point that can unlock player abilities like [...] "no damage from falling" [...] or [...] "infinite sprint", as well as upgrades to the player's computer-controlled gang member support. In turn, players receive further incentive to nearly miss car collisions, streak naked through the streets, shoot others in the groin, blow up Smart cars, and kill mascots in ambient challenges to earn more respect. Lack of respect does not hinder story progress, as it has in previous games. Player progress and unlocks are managed by an in-game cell phone <b>menu</b> <b>that</b> also lets the player call for vehicle deliveries and non-player character backup. The computer-controlled support will also dialogue with each other.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} set to {{continue}} 10 {{years after the first}} Mother. [...] The player-character, Flint, was a cowboy in the vein of Clint Eastwood with two boys, Lucca and Klaus (later becoming Lucas and Claus), and a dog, Boney. The game was to include over 10 playable characters and span 10 years in its story based around the Pig army, which attempts to use [...] "primitive machinery ... to enslave mankind". At the 1999 Space World, IGN sampled environments including a hovercraft in a desert canyon, a snake dungeon, a cutscene with a bullet train, a town with non-player characters, and a mine cart scene, through themes including fantasy, the medieval, and science fiction. Physical contact with an enemy in the overworld triggered a turn-based battle scene shown in the first-person (similar to EarthBound). The battles had psychedelic backgrounds and a circular <b>menu</b> <b>that</b> included a command to [...] "get up" [...] if the player was knocked down in a real-time sequence. Attacks could be timed with the in-game music for stronger effects. The developers also planned multiple routes for advancing through the game and unforeseen complications from minor actions, such as a monster finding food dropped in the forest. The game {{was set to}} include features such as synching the game's time with the real time, but those features would not have worked without the 64DD. Mother 3 was set to run between 40 and 60 hours in length.|$|E

50|$|To avoid wasting scarce bombe time on <b>menus</b> <b>that</b> {{were likely}} to yield an {{excessive}} number of false stops, Turing performed a lengthy probability analysis (without any electronic aids) of the estimated number of stops per rotor order. It was adopted as standard practice only to use <b>menus</b> <b>that</b> were estimated to produce {{no more than four}} stops per wheel order. This allowed an 8-letter crib for a 3-closure menu, an 11-letter crib for a 2-closure menu and a 14-letter crib for a menu with only one closure. If there was no closure, at least 16 letters were required in the crib. The longer the crib, however, the more likely it was that turn-over of the middle rotor would have occurred.|$|R
500|$|Gravemind (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) {{is one of}} {{the primary}} antagonists in the Halo series. The Gravemind is a large, sentient {{creature}} of Flood origin, created by the parasite to serve as its central intelligence once a critical biomass has been achieved. It was introduced during the events of Halo 2, where the creature saves both the Master Chief and Arbiter from their deaths, bringing the two face to face in the bowels of Delta Halo. Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the [...] "sacred rings" [...] are actually weapons of last resort; a fact the Master Chief confirms. In order to stop Halo from being fired, Gravemind teleports the Master Chief and Arbiter to separate locations, but also uses them as a distraction; Gravemind infests the human ship In Amber Clad, and uses it to invade the Covenant city of High Charity. Capturing Cortana, Gravemind brings High Charity to the Ark in an effort to stop the High Prophet of Truth from activating the Halo network. Although the Master Chief destroys High Charity, Gravemind survives the blast and attempts to rebuild itself on the incomplete Halo. When Halo is activated, Gravemind accepts his fate, but insists that the activation of the ring will only slow, not stop, the Flood. In Halo Wars 2: Awakening the Nightmare, the Gravemind's warning is validated when the Banished inadvertently unleash a number of Flood infection forms that survived Halo's activation. It is also mentioned in the game's <b>menu</b> <b>that</b> while the Gravemind's [...] "most recent physical avatar" [...] was destroyed by the Master Chief, it is [...] "only {{a matter of time before}} it rises again".|$|E
500|$|The full 120-second {{version of}} the {{advertisement}} aired only 10 times in all, and only in the 10 days after the initial screening. The slots were chosen for maximum impact, mostly in high-profile sporting {{events such as the}} UEFA Champion's League football match between Manchester United and Real Madrid. The full version was then put aside in favour of a 60-second and five 30-second variations, which continued to air for a further six weeks. These shortened versions made use of newly introduced interactive options on the Sky Digital television network. Viewers were encouraged to press a button on their remote control, bringing up a <b>menu</b> <b>that</b> allowed the viewer to see the full 120-second {{version of the}} advertisement. Other menu options included placing an order for a free documentary DVD and a brochure for the Honda Accord. The DVD, which was also included as an insert in 1.2million newspapers {{in the first week of}} the commercial's rollout, contained a [...] "making-of" [...] documentary featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage of the production process, a virtual tour of the Accord, the original music video to [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] by the Sugarhill Gang, and an illustrated guide to all the parts shown in [...] "Cog". The interactive 30-second versions of [...] "Cog" [...] proved hugely successful. Over 250,000 people used the menu option, spending an average of two and a half minutes in the dedicated advertising area. A significant number watched the looped 120-second version for up to ten minutes. Of those who opened the menu, 10,000 requested either a DVD or a brochure, and Honda used the data collected from the interactive option to arrange a number of test drives.|$|E
