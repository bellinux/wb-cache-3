40|$|The Smart Grid (SG) is an {{emerging}} modernized {{electrical power system}} with advanced monitoring and control mechanism, and improved faulttolerance. The SG converges traditional power grid with a bidirectional communication and information system into the same infrastructure. Electric Vehicles (EVs), with their energy storage capacity and bidirectional communication capability, are envisioned to be {{an essential component of}} the SG. EVs can play the role of distributed energy resources by storing energy in off-peak hours and providing energy to the grid during peak hours or system contingencies. The energy stored by an EV is equivalent to the average energy drawn by multiple residential houses. As a result, simultaneous charging by a large number of EVs can create sudden energy imbalance in the grid. The mismatch between the energy generation and demand can create cascading faults resulting in load shedding. To prevent such situation, EVs are required to pre-schedule charging events at a Charging Station (CS). To efficiently manage a scheduled event, an EV is required to transmit information such as a valid ID, state-of-charge, distance from a CS, location, speed, etc. However, the data transmitted by an EV can be used to reveal information such as the movement of the vehicle, visits to a hospital, time to arrive at office, etc. The transmitted information can be used to create profiles of the owners of the EVs, breaching their location privacy. In the existing literature, it is recommended to use pseudonyms for different transactions by an EV to achieve location privacy. The majority of the works in the literature are based on anonymous authentication mechanism, where <b>missing</b> a <b>charging</b> event by an EV is considered as malicious and the corresponding EV is penalized (e. g., blacklisted). However, <b>missing</b> a <b>charging</b> event may happen due to many valid reasons and flexibility of scheduling can encourage consumer participation. On the other hand, <b>missing</b> <b>charging</b> events results in monetary loss to the CSs. In this thesis, an authentication method is developed to provide anonymity to EVs. The proposed method also addresses the cost-effectiveness of flexibility in charging events for the EVs and the CSs. A network setup that sub-divides a regional area into smaller zones to achieve better privacy, is proposed. A MATLAB simulation is designed to demonstrate the Degree of Anonymity (DoA) achieved in different stages of the proposed method and the optimal number of <b>missed</b> <b>charging</b> events.

In the first case, an electron (hole) incident on the I-n interface from the n side is retroreflected into an electron (hole) of the same energy E and of the same absolute value of momentum but travelling in the opposite direction to the incoming charge. On the contrary, the reflected from the n-S interface quasiparticle has the same energy E and almost the same momentum is travelling in the opposite direction, and its charge is opposite in sign to that of the incident quasiparticle.

This approach becomes advantageous when the charge capture operation is transparent to the clinician who would otherwise have to review the care documentation, recall the appropriate charging rules, and exercise discretion in capturing charges.

Documented patient care is more difficult to translate into activity-based charges because nursing care can vary in intensity and duration depending on the patient's needs. The problem can be overcome by embedding time or data-driven logic into the charging rules.

40|$|There exist various defect-brane {{backgrounds}} in supergravity theories which arise as the {{low energy}} limit of string theories. These backgrounds typically have non-trivial monodromies, {{and if we}} move a charged probe around {{the center of a}} defect, its charge will be changed by the action of the monodromy. During the process, the charge conservation law seems to be violated. In this paper, to resolve this puzzle, we examine a dynamics of the charge changing process and show that the <b>missing</b> <b>charge</b> of the probe is transferred to the background. We then explicitly construct the resultant background after the charge transfer process by utilizing dualities. This background has the same monodromy as the original defect brane, but has an additional charge which does not have any localized source. In the literature, such a charge without localized source is known to appear in the presence of Alice strings. We argue that defect branes can in fact be regarded as a realization of Alice strings in string theory and examine the charge transfer process from that perspective.

40|$|An Extended Hauser-Feshbach Method (EHFM) is {{developed}} for light heavy-ion fusion reactions {{in order to}} provide a detailed analysis of all the possible decay channels by including explicitly the fusion-fission phase-space in the description of the cascade chain. The mass-asymmetric fission component is considered as a complex-fragment binary-decay which can be treated {{in the same way as}} the light-particle evaporation from the compound nucleus in statistical-model calculations. The method of the phase-space integrations for the binary-decay is an extension of the usual Hauser-Feshbach formalism to be applied to the mass-symmetric fission part. The EHFM calculations include ground-state binding energies and discrete levels in the low excitation-energy regions which are essential for an accurate evaluation of the phase-space integrations of the complex-fragment emission (fission). In the present calculations, EHFM is applied to the first-chance binary-decay by assuming that the second-chance fission decay is negligible. In a similar manner to the description of the fusion-evaporation process, the usual cascade calculation of light-particle emission from the highly excited complex fragments 1 is applied. This complete calculation is then defined as EHFM+CASCADE. Calculated quantities such as charge-, mass- and kinetic-energy distributions are compared with inclusive and/or exclusive data for the 32 S+ 24 Mg and 35 Cl+ 12 C reactions which have been selected as typical examples. Finally, the <b>missing</b> <b>charge</b> distributions extracted from exclusive measurements are also successfully compared with the EHFM+CASCADE predictions...|$|R
