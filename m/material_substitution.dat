50|$|The {{traditional}} way of issuing consumed materials is by using dual issues and returns against work orders. Components are counted when issued to a production order from Stores when the production order is opened. Produced parts and leftover components are counted when returned to stores when the work order is closed. In conjunction with a tightly controlled material Stores with discrete storage places, this can deliver very high inventory accuracy {{without the need for}} additional transactions to report scrap, <b>material</b> <b>substitution,</b> and non-standard usage separately. This obviously requires more transactions than backflushing. But these can be automated in a variety of ways, especially since most transactions take place in a limited area (Stores) and not throughout the plant. Accountability for component usage and operator time/efficiency at the work-order level by operator/shift/cell is greatly increased in this method over backflushing. Work orders also deliver higher lot-control quality measurement potential, substitution management (through a modified work-order BOM) and higher part and customer container bar-coding accuracy. The shop-floor stock in this case uses a discrete storage bin, identical to the number of the production order but no backflushing is required when the produced parts are counted. Leftover components are returned to the store and all the components from the discrete shop-floor storage bin are issued against that production order (postproduction issuing), in a similar way like backflusing, but not based on the bill of materials (BOM) but on the real stock which was consumed (transferred from the stores) for that particular production order.|$|E

40|$|Firms seek {{to create}} a product that are both desired by consumers, and also {{minimize}} costs. These goals come into conflict, as minimizing costs leads firms toward mass production, and meeting consumer needs leads firms toward product differentiation. One strategy to resolve these conflicting goals is to share component parts across distinct product variants allowing firms to maintain differentiated products while obtaining some of the economies of scale. In this way, part sharing reduces the cost burden of maintaining multiple product variants. However, part sharing also reduces product differentiation by resulting in some feature sharing, as the requirements of component parts differ across different product variants. Though some sharing may add desirable features, {{there may also be}} negative impacts, such as unnecessary mass from overdesign, referred to as "scar mass. " In products where low mass is an important feature, this scar mass may deter designers from implementing part sharing. A common way of reducing mass in products is to exchange the material used for a lighter-weight alternative. However, lighter materials may be more expensive to use due to higher unit price or more complicated forming. This research investigates combined part sharing and <b>material</b> <b>substitution</b> strategies and their implications on cost and product weight. Specifically, it seeks to evaluate whether there exist situations in which 1) the cost savings from part sharing outweigh the increased cost from <b>material</b> <b>substitution,</b> while simultaneously 2) the mass savings from <b>material</b> <b>substitution</b> outweigh the scar mass penalty from sharing. To address this problem, this research develops a framework for modeling the implementation of different part sharing and <b>material</b> <b>substitution</b> strategies. In this framework, design changes to products from <b>material</b> <b>substitution</b> and part sharing are estimated using equivalent structural performance. The cost implications of these design changes are then calculated using a Process-Based Cost Modeling approach. This framework is then used to address a case of a hypothetical generic product and finally is applied to a real case. The real case is based on three real vehicle bodies that share a common platform. The research findings identify situations in which <b>material</b> <b>substitution</b> and part sharing strategies can be combined to produce lower mass and lower cost products. Automotive manufacturers may benefit from using these findings to implement cost-effective lightweighting policies to help them meet fuel efficiency standards. by Nathalie Marielle Rivest. Thesis (S.

40|$|A {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} to evaluate {{the environmental impact of}} urban sewage sludge use as alternative fuel or raw material in clinker production was carried out. In order to quantify in detail the overall environmental impact of both scenarios, the sewage sludge treatment process and the transport to cement facilities for both alternatives were considered. The substitution ratio of fuel (petcoke) and raw material (limestone) was fixed between 5 and 15 % according to the cement production plant limitations. Both scenarios show CO 2 savings when compared to the clinker production without substitution. The mid-point and end-point analysis were favourable to the fuel substitution with savings ranging from 3 to 7 % compared to the raw <b>material</b> <b>substitution</b> and also to base case without substitution. The influence of the amount of sewage sludge used for both scenarios indicates that fuel substitution reduced the CO 2 emissions when the amount of substitution is increased, while other mid-point and end-point categories were proportionally favourable to the fuel substitution scenario. Additionally, the influence of the substituted material characteristics showed that low heating value (fuel substitution) and CaO addition in lime stabilized sludge (raw <b>material</b> <b>substitution)</b> are critical parameters in terms of environmental impact in clinker production.
