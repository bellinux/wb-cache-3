5|$|Infection with {{smallpox}} {{is focused}} in small blood vessels {{of the skin}} and in the mouth and throat before disseminating. In the skin it results in a characteristic <b>maculopapular</b> rash and, later, raised fluid-filled blisters. V. major produced a more serious disease and had an overall mortality rate of 30–35 percent. V. minor caused a milder form of disease (also known as alastrim) which killed about 1 percent of those it infects. Long-term complications of V. major infection included characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65–85 percent of survivors. Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis were less common complications, seen in about 2–5 percent of cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} phase occurs next, with resorption of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream. This usually lasts {{two to three}} days. The improvement is often striking, and can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate. Another rash may occur with either a <b>maculopapular</b> or a vasculitic appearance, which is followed by peeling of the skin. During this stage, a fluid overload state may occur; if it affects the brain, it may cause a reduced level of consciousness or seizures. A feeling of fatigue may last for weeks in adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{initial period}} {{following}} the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks post exposure {{while others have}} no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is <b>maculopapular,</b> classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occurs. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a rash may aid diagnosis; associated signs and symptoms are diagnostic of certain diseases. For example, the rash in measles is an erythematous, morbilliform, <b>maculopapular</b> rash that begins {{a few days after}} the fever starts. It classically starts at the head, and spreads downwards.|$|E
25|$|Zika fever, {{also known}} as Zika virus disease or simply Zika, is an {{infectious}} disease caused by the Zika virus. Most cases have no symptoms, but when present they are usually mild and can resemble dengue fever. Symptoms may include fever, red eyes, joint pain, headache, and a <b>maculopapular</b> rash. Symptoms generally last less than seven days. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults {{have been linked to}} Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS).|$|E
25|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} {{can present}} anywhere within the spectrum from asymptomatic to acute or chronic hepatitis to fulminant liver failure. Patients are asymptomatic 25–34% of the time, and {{the diagnosis is}} suspected {{on the basis of}} abnormal liver function tests. Up to 40% of cases present with signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis. As with other autoimmune diseases, autoimmune hepatitis usually affects young women (though it can affect patients of either sex of any age), and patients can exhibit classic signs and symptoms of autoimmunity such as fatigue, anemia, anorexia, amenorrhea, acne, arthritis, pleurisy, thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis, nephritis, and <b>maculopapular</b> rash. Autoimmune hepatitis increases the risk for cirrhosis, and the risk for liver cancer is increased by about 1% for each year of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|The rash is {{described}} as <b>maculopapular</b> or morbilliform (measles-like; therefore, in medical literature, it is called [...] "amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash".). It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash {{is unlikely to be}} a true allergic reaction and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms usually {{begin with}} a sudden influenza-like stage {{characterized}} by feeling tired, fever, weakness, decreased appetite, muscular pain, joint pain, headache, and sore throat. The fever is usually higher than [...] This is often followed by vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Next, shortness of breath and chest pain may occur, along with swelling, headaches and confusion. In {{about half of the}} cases, the skin may develop a <b>maculopapular</b> rash, a flat red area covered with small bumps, 5 to 7 days after symptoms begin.|$|E
2500|$|A rash {{occurs in}} 50% of {{patients}} and is widespread and <b>maculopapular.</b> Lymphadenopathy occurs commonly; sore throat and coryza less frequently. Diarrhea is rare. About 50% of people report needing time off work with the acute illness. If the rash is unnoticed, these symptoms are quite easily mistaken for more common illnesses like influenza or the common cold. Recovery from the flu symptoms is expected within a month, but, because the virus currently cannot be removed once infection has occurred [...] secondary symptoms of joint and muscle inflammation, pain and stiffness can last for many years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characteristic}} measles rash is classically {{described as}} a generalized red <b>maculopapular</b> rash that begins several days after the fever starts. It starts {{on the back of}} the ears and, after a few hours, spreads to the head and neck before spreading to cover most of the body, often causing itching. The measles rash appears two to four days after the initial symptoms and lasts for up to eight days. The rash is said to [...] "stain", changing color from red to dark brown, before disappearing. Overall, the disease from infection with the measles virus usually resolves after about three weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Dengue virus causes dengue fever. Common {{names for}} dengue fever include breakbone fever and dandy fever; dengue hemorrhagic fever ( [...] and dengue shock {{syndrome}} (DSS) are the severe forms. Dengue {{is found in}} tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. People of all ages who are exposed to infected mosquitoes can get dengue fever. The disease occurs most often {{during the rainy season}} in areas with high numbers of infected mosquitoes. Only infected mosquitoes transmit dengue virus. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes. The incubation period is 3 to 14 days. The period of illness is 3–7 days. [...] A person with dengue fever is not contagious. Signs and symptoms may include severe headache; retroorbital pain; muscle, joint, and bone pain; macular or <b>maculopapular</b> rash; and minor hemorrhagic manifestations, including petechiae, ecchymosis, purpura, epistaxis, bleeding gums, hematuria, or a positive tourniquet test result.|$|E

50|$|Delayed type 4 {{allergic}} hypersensitivity reactions including <b>maculopapular</b> exanthema, erythematous rash, urticarial eruption, erythema multiforme, photodermatitis, eczema and Stevens-Johnson syndrome can occasionally {{occur as}} a result of tetrazepam exposure. These hypersensitivity reactions to tetrazepam share no cross-reactivity with other benzodiazepines.|$|E
5000|$|Generalization Phase: Day 1 up to Day 5 from {{onset of}} {{clinical}} symptoms. MHF presents {{with a high}} fever (~40˚C) and a sudden, severe headache, with accompanying chills, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pharyngitis, <b>maculopapular</b> rash, abdominal pain, conjunctivitis, & malaise.|$|E
50|$|All have a <b>maculopapular</b> urticarial {{skin rash}} {{that is often}} present at birth (75% cases). It is {{probably}} more correctly described as an urticarial-like rash. The presence of the rash varies with time, and biopsy of these skin lesions shows a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate including granulocytes.|$|E
50|$|The {{measles virus}} {{is the cause}} of measles, an {{infection}} of the respiratory system. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a generalized, <b>maculopapular,</b> erythematous rash. The virus is highly contagious and is spread by coughing and sneezing via close personal contact or direct contact with secretions.|$|E
50|$|Sarcoidosis {{involves}} the skin in about 25% of patients. The most common lesions are erythema nodosum, plaques, <b>maculopapular</b> eruptions, subcutaneous nodules, and lupus pernio. Treatment is not required, since the lesions usually resolve spontaneously {{in two to}} four weeks. Although it may be disfiguring, cutaneous sarcoidosis rarely causes major problems.|$|E
50|$|After an {{incubation}} period around seven days, the disease manifests abruptly with chills, high fevers, muscular and articular pains, severe headache, and photophobia. The {{location of the}} bite forms a black ulcerous crust (tache noire). Around the fourth day of the illness, a widespread rash appears, first macular and then <b>maculopapular</b> and sometimes petechial.|$|E
5000|$|Post-kala-azar dermal {{leishmaniasis}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Post-kala-azar dermatosis") is a cutaneous condition that {{is characterized by}} depigmented macular, <b>maculopapular</b> and nodular eruptions found mainly on the face, arms, and {{upper part of the}} trunk. It occurs years(in the Indian variation)or a few months(in the African strain) after the successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis ...|$|E
50|$|Acute GvHD of the GI tract {{can result}} in severe {{intestinal}} inflammation, sloughing of the mucosal membrane, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. This is typically diagnosed via intestinal biopsy. Liver GvHD {{is measured by the}} bilirubin level in acute patients. Skin GvHD results in a diffuse red <b>maculopapular</b> rash, sometimes in a lacy pattern.|$|E
50|$|This type of rash {{can also}} be a symptom of Sea bather's eruption. This stinging, pruritic, <b>maculopapular</b> rash affects {{swimmers}} in some Atlantic locales (e.g., Florida, Caribbean, Long Island). It is caused by hypersensitivity to stings from the larvae of the sea anemone (e.g., Edwardsiella lineate) or the thimble jellyfish (Linuche unguiculata). The rash appears where the bathing suit contacts the skin.|$|E
5000|$|This type of rash {{is common}} in several {{diseases}} and medical conditions, including scarlet fever, measles, Ebola virus disease, rubella, secondary syphilis (Congenital syphilis, which is asymptomatic, the newborn may present this type of rash), erythrovirus (parvovirus B19), chikungunya (alphavirus), zika, and heat rash. It is also a common manifestation of a skin reaction to the antibiotic amoxicillin or chemotherapy drugs. [...] Cutaneous infiltration of leukemic cells may also have this appearance. <b>Maculopapular</b> rash is seen in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant), which can be seen within one week or several weeks after the transplant. In the case of GVHD, the <b>maculopapular</b> rash may progress to a condition similar to toxic epidermal necrolysis. In addition, {{this is the type}} of rash that some patients presenting with Ebola virus hemorrhagic (EBO-Z) fever will reveal but can be hard to see on dark skin people. It is also seen in patients with Marburg hemorrhagic fever, a filovirus not unlike Ebola.|$|E
50|$|A small {{minority}} of people spontaneously present a rash, usually on the arms or trunk, which can be macular (morbilliform) or papular. Almost all people given amoxicillin or ampicillin eventually develop a generalized, itchy <b>maculopapular</b> rash, which however {{does not imply that}} the person will have adverse reactions to penicillins again in the future. Occasional cases of erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Rash {{occurs in}} 40-50% of cases, {{generally}} as a <b>maculopapular</b> rash occurring {{two to five}} days after onset of symptoms. Digestive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, may also occur. In {{more than half of}} cases, normal activity is limited by significant fatigue and pain. Infrequently, inflammation of the eyes may occur in the form of iridocyclitis, or uveitis, and retinal lesions may occur.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>maculopapular</b> rash {{is a type}} of rash {{characterized}} by a flat, red area on the skin that is covered with small confluent bumps. It may only appear red in lighter-skinned people. The term [...] "maculopapular" [...] is a compound: macules are small, flat discolored spots {{on the surface of the}} skin; and papules are small, raised bumps. It is also described as erythematous, or red.|$|E
50|$|Alphavirus Polyarthritis Syndrome has an {{incubation}} period of 3-21 days, {{depending on the}} specific virus, with either a gradual or sudden onset of fever, arthralgias, headache, and lymphadenitis and conjunctivitis in some forms. A <b>maculopapular</b> rash may present 4-8 days post symptom onset and may be accompanied {{by an increase in}} fever. Joint pains associated with this condition may recur for many months after initial illness for up to a year.|$|E
50|$|Up to 20% {{of people}} taking {{isoniazid}} experience peripheral neuropathy when taking doses of 6 mg/kg of weight daily or higher. Gastrointestinal reactions include nausea and vomiting. Aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis {{due to lack}} of production of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells by the bone marrow respectively, can also occur. Hypersensitivity reactions are also common and can present with a <b>maculopapular</b> rash and fever.|$|E
5000|$|Symptoms {{are similar}} to other flaviviruses such as dengue fever or the alphavirus that causes chikungunya, but are milder in form and usually last two to seven days. It is {{estimated}} that 80% of cases are asymptomatic. The main clinical symptoms in symptomatic patients are low-grade fever, conjunctivitis, transient joint pain (mainly in the smaller joints of the hands and feet) and <b>maculopapular</b> rash that often starts on the face and then spreads throughout the body.|$|E
50|$|Brill-Zinser {{disease is}} a delayed relapse of {{epidemic}} typhus, caused by Rickettsia prowazekii. After a patient contracts epidemic typhus from the fecal matter of an infected louse (Pediculus humanus), the rickettsia can remain latent and reactivate months or years later, with symptoms similar to or even {{identical to the original}} attack of typhus, including a <b>maculopapular</b> rash. This reactivation event can then be transmitted to other individuals through fecal matter of the louse vector, and form the focus for a new epidemic of typhus.|$|E
50|$|Allergic {{reactions}} to drugs {{are a common}} cause of eosinophilia, with manifestations ranging from diffuse <b>maculopapular</b> rash, to severe life-threatening drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Drugs that {{have been shown to}} cause DRESS are aromatic anticonvulsants and other antiepileptics, sulfonamides, allopurinol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), some antipsychotics such as risperidone, and certain antibiotics. Phenibut, an analogue of the neurotransmitter GABA, has also been implicated in high doses. The reaction which {{has been shown to be}} T-cell mediated may also cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Sarcoidosis {{involves}} the skin in between 9 and 37% of persons {{and is more}} common in African Americans than in European Americans. The skin is the second most commonly affected organ after the lungs. The most common lesions are erythema nodosum, plaques, <b>maculopapular</b> eruptions, subcutaneous nodules, and lupus pernio. Treatment is not required, since the lesions usually resolve spontaneously in two to four weeks. Although it may be disfiguring, cutaneous sarcoidosis rarely causes major problems. Sarcoidosis of the scalp presents with diffuse or patchy hair loss.|$|E
