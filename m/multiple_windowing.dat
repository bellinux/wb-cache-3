40|$|This report {{covers the}} April 2004 -September 2004 time period. Work has been {{performed}} successfully on several tasks 1 through 16. Part {{of this work}} {{has been reported in}} 15418 R 03. Most of portions of these tasks have been executed independently. We progressed steadily and completed some of the sub-tasks, while others are still on going. We achieved the goals that we had set up in the task schedule. Reviewing the results of this work period indicates that our plan is solid and we did not encounter any unforeseen problems. The work plan will continue as scheduled. A midyear review will be presented in November or December 2004. Several independent tasks pursuant the statement of project objectives have been executed simultaneously and are still on-going. Use of real seismic test data is augmented by the creation a 3 D ray tracing synthetic test data. We used the previously constructed 3 D layered model and simulated data acquisition from a set of circular source locations at the surface of the model, while a close to vertical VSP well was used to capture the wave field data. The source pattern was optimized with respect to Fresnel zone width at the target depth. Multi-component particle displacements were recorded every 50 ft down with an array length of 4, 000 ft. P-P as well as P-S reflections were specified in the resulting wave field. We ensured a large enough aperture with enough fine sampling to perform advanced processing, imaging and analysis tests in the future during this project. We constantly improved the interfacing of our software libraries with newly designed 3 C display classes and mechanisms. We used the previously implemented 3 C Work Bench tool as the primary prototyping tool. This work bench allows to load as well as manipulate and display data items in a flexible manner. We continued to demonstrate its basic functionality by loading source maps, horizons, seismic and velocity volumes, well logs into the tool, performing basic QC steps as is necessary in normal processing. We improved functionality by adding <b>multiple</b> <b>windowing</b> options to each of the display items. The windows can be docked or un-docked, which is advantageous in a practical sense, since the display real estate can be spread across multiple display monitors. All windows transparently tie into the same item tree and views get updated dynamically and transparently. Each display item can be associated with a particular display widget as is the case for the multi-component hodogram display widget. All tasks were performed successfully, ensuring the continued progress of this project as outlined in the original proposal. Deliverables generated during this time period consist of reporting details and synthetically modeled seismic data for a 3 D layered geological model. The numerically modeled SEGY data, as well as the model representation data, are ready to be sent out to DOE facilities for archiving. Based on the successful conclusion of work performed during this three month period we continue to occasionally generate synthetically modeled 3 D borehole seismic data, according to Tasks 2 and 3. At the same time we proceed to design, implement and test according to the original plan the basic data classes and the basic framework outlined in Tasks 5 through 11, as well as 16...|$|E

The developed algorithm differs from the previous <b>multiple</b> <b>window</b> algorithms by introducing a reliability test to select the most reliable <b>window</b> among <b>multiple</b> <b>windows</b> of increasing sizes.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{accuracy}} of <b>multiple</b> <b>window</b> spatial resolution characterises {{the performance of}} a gamma camera for dual isotope imaging. In the present study we investigate an alternative method to the standard NEMA procedure for measuring this performance parameter. Methods A long-lived 133 Ba point source with gamma energies close to 67 Ga and a single bore lead collimator were used to measure the <b>multiple</b> <b>window</b> spatial registration error. Calculation of the positions of the point source in the images used the NEMA algorithm. The results were validated against the values obtained by the standard NEMA procedure which uses a liquid 67 Ga source with collimation. Results Of the source-collimator configurations under investigation an optimum collimator geometry, consisting of a 5 mm thick lead disk with a diameter of 46 mm and a 5 mm central bore, was selected. The <b>multiple</b> <b>window</b> spatial registration errors obtained by the 133 Ba method showed excellent reproducibility (standard deviation 133 Ba point source method proved to be much easier to use. A Bland-Altman analysis showed that the 133 Ba and the 67 Ga Method can be used interchangeably. Conclusion The 133 Ba point source method measures the <b>multiple</b> <b>window</b> spatial registration error with essentially the same accuracy as the NEMA-recommended procedure, but is easier and safer to use and has the potential to replace the current standard procedure. </p...|$|R
