This paper first examines the possibilities for smaller <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to influence the development of EU foreign policy.

The paper concludes that four factors determine the extent of a smaller <b>member</b> <b>state’s</b> influence in EU foreign policy: {{the extent to which the}} policy process is characterized by the ‘logic of arguing’, the role of information, the extent of involvement of a <b>member</b> <b>state</b> and the presence of EU actors.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{comparatively}} analyse the roles of foreign origin and citizenship in the labor markets of Eastern and Eestern <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> of the EU. Design/methodology/approach – The EU Survey of Income and Living Conditions is used to evaluate the roles of foreign origin and citizenship on employment and earnings using the standard Probit and OLS econometric models. The native/non-native labor market divide is measured using Fairlie and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition techniques. Findings – The results indicate that, while predominantly foreign origin is of key importance in the Western EU <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> both foreign origin and citizenship matter in the Eastern EU <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> their <b>roles</b> depending on gender. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the effects of citizenship in the EU 8 may be driven by the (predominantly ethnic Russian) non-citizens in Estonia and Latvia.

There are a handful of EU policy measures which have had effects on social policy in the UK.

In consequence, a ‘Leave’ or ‘Remain’ result has relatively limited implications for social policy, except in the case of specific social groups: notably for UK and other EU nationals who have lived and worked in at least one other EU country.

40|$|In {{the midst}} of the {{international}} development agenda, two concepts have recently emerged, transparency and accountability. These concepts represent ideas, which have shaped the current direction in which development has been managed. Recent international agreements and partnerships, including the Paris Declaration for Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action, have mentioned transparency and accountability as principles that may create greater aid effectiveness. In a time of austerity, development aid has come under pressure to create results. Transparency and accountability are concepts that may allow for an efficient use of Overseas Development Assistance (ODA). Large donors of ODA shape the development agenda. Yet, many developed nations face questions from citizens regarding finances. The European Union (EU) has provided an example of integration and coherence within development policies. EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and the EU are large donors of ODA. However, the austerity measures have caused a need to re-examine the way in which development aid is spent.

Previous studies on Europeanization of foreign policy provide for mixed evidences {{with regard to the}} real domestic impact of the EU. The research questions addressed in this paper are: 1) to what extent does Europeanization cause institutional convergence in the new <b>member</b> <b>states?</b> 2) what <b>role</b> does domestic politics play as regard institutional adaptation? 3) what is the extent of internalization of EU’s norms by national officials dealing with European affairs? 4) {{what is the role of}} national representatives dealing with European affairs in disseminating EU’s norms within the political-administrative structures at national level? and e) does the manner in which the elite from the new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> perceives the exercise and distribution of power within the EU alter the outcomes of the Europeanization process? The main argument here is that even if the European integration has been the catalyst for institutional adaptation, the structural domestic changes have been shaped less by the Europeanization pressures than by domestic factors, such as governmental / coalition politics or bureaucratic politics. Three main factors justify the selection of Hungary, Romania and Slovakia as the three case studies. Firstly, they have different integration records.

40|$|Abstract: Taxation has, {{and will}} retain, a central place in {{economic}} policy. This paper sheds {{some light on}} current EU trends, regarding tax structures by type of tax (direct taxes, indirect taxes and social contributions), the level of personal income tax rates which differ very substantially, ranging from 16 % to 59 % {{and the level of}} corporate income tax rates which continue their rapid decline throughout the European Union. The European Union, taken as a whole, is a high-tax area. In 2006, {{the last year for which}} detailed data are available, the overall tax ratio, amounted to 39, 9 % of GDP. This value is about 12 percentage points above those recorded in the United States and Japan. The EU tax-to-GDP ratio is high not only compared with these two countries but in general; amongst the major non-European OECD members, only New Zealand has a ratio that exceeds 35 per cent of GDP. The high general average by no means implies that every EU <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> displays a high tax ratio; on the contrary, ten <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> display ratios below the 35 % mark. On the whole, the differences in taxation levels across the Union are quite marked; the overall tax ratio (which includes social security contributions) ranges over more than twenty points of GDP, from 49, 1 % in Denmark to merely 28, 6 % in Romania, reflecting the significant differences within <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in the <b>role</b> played by the State...|$|R

Through constructivist analysis this thesis attempts to understand the EU's process of norm construction with Russia and domestically and consequently its construction of a nonnative identity. Looking at the period between 2000 and 2008, this thesis presents two main arguments. First, in the EU's attempt to construct its norms of human rights and market liberalization it faced difficulties because as the context shifted, other norms, deemed more important, triumphed over the norms of human rights and market liberalization. This resulted in three identifiable nonnative shifts. Secondly, it focuses on the domestic formation of norms and argues that <b>member</b> <b>states</b> playa significant <b>role</b> in the EU's difficulty to construct norms, in that they have been unable to speak with one voice on human rights and market liberalization...|$|R

This question {{has so far}} not attracted much scholarly attention in political science; most studies focus on {{the legal status of}} the EU in international organisations, in particular in UN bodies.

Theoretical approaches suggest four explanatory factors: issue areas, institutions, interests and identities. The paper argues that the usual focus on issue areas in terms of the distribution of legal competences alone cannot explain the EU's current role as a 'patchwork power'.
