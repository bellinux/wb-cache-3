5|$|In {{order to}} supply U.S. allies, much more {{production}} was required than was possible through the firms producing the M2 (and the larger M3 Half-track). International Harvester (IH) could produce half-tracks, but some differences {{had to be}} accepted due to different <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods</b> and components. This led to IH producing for lend-lease the M5 Half-track and M9 as equivalents for the M3 and M2 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger {{went into}} {{production}} in June 1964, {{little more than}} a year after the completion of the Shelby prototype. Painted and trimmed bodies were supplied by Pressed Steel in Oxfordshire, and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America. Installing the engine required some unusual <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods,</b> including using a sledgehammer to bash in part of the already primed and painted bulkhead to allow the engine to be slid into place. Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month, which were initially offered for sale only in North America. The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg-Warner 4-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox, until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang.|$|E

25|$|Geogrids {{represent}} {{a rapidly growing}} segment within geosynthetics. Rather than being a woven, nonwoven or knitted textile fabric, geogrids are polymers formed into a very open, gridlike configuration, i.e., they have large apertures between individual ribs in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Geogrids are (a) either stretched in one, two or three directions for improved physical properties, (b) made on weaving or knitting machinery by standard textile <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods,</b> or (c) by laser or ultrasonically bonding rods or straps together. There are many specific application areas; however, geogrids function almost exclusively as reinforcement materials.|$|E
25|$|While under Roman rule, the raw {{materials}} and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods</b> of northern Europe were those of the Roman tradition, using the mineral Natron. For several centuries {{after the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, around 450 AD, recycling of Roman glass formed the major part of the local industry and glassmaking skills declined. With the rise of the Carolingian Empire in northwestern Europe approximately 800 AD, increasing demand for glass and problems with supply of traditional {{raw materials}}, together with an imperial desire to emulate the more sophisticated culture of the Islamic Empire (which was producing high quality glass) led to experimentation with new raw materials and the development of a totally new glassmaking technology.|$|E
25|$|Data {{validity}} is {{an ongoing}} concern for life cycle analyses. Due to globalization and the rapid pace of research and development, new materials and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods</b> are continually being introduced to the market. This makes it both very important and very difficult to use up-to-date information when performing an LCA. If an LCA’s conclusions are to be valid, the data must be recent; however, the data-gathering process takes time. If a product and its related processes have not undergone significant revisions since the last LCA data was collected, data validity is not a problem. However, consumer electronics such as cell phones can be redesigned as often as every 9 to 12 months, creating a need for ongoing data collection.|$|E
40|$|Concrete-filled FRP tubes (CFFTs) have {{received}} significant research attention {{over the last}} two decades. However, the experimental studies on the behavior of CFFTs filled with high- and ultra high-strength concretes (HSC and UHSC) remain very limited. This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the compressive behavior of circular HSC- and UHSC-filled fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) tubes (HSCFFTs and UHSCFFTs). A total of 24 aramid fiber made CFFTs were tested under uniaxial compression to investigate the influences of concrete strength, amount of confinement and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>method</b> of FRP tubes. The influence of tube <b>manufacturing</b> <b>method</b> was investigated with specimens manufactured with either automated filament winding or manual wet lay-up techniques.

25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{the biggest}} barrier to local vaccine {{production}} in {{less developed countries}} has not been patents, but the substantial financial, infrastructure, and workforce expertise requirements needed for market entry. Vaccines are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and unlike the case of drugs, there are no true generic vaccines. The vaccine produced by a new facility must undergo complete clinical testing for safety and efficacy similar to that undergone by that produced by the original manufacturer. For most vaccines, specific processes have been patented. These can be circumvented by alternative <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods,</b> but this required R infrastructure and a suitably skilled workforce. In {{the case of a}} few relatively new vaccines such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, the patents may impose an additional barrier.|$|E
25|$|Advancements in {{combustor}} technology {{focused on}} several distinct areas; emissions, operating range, and durability. Early jet engines produced {{large amounts of}} smoke, so early combustor advances, in the 1950s, were aimed at reducing the smoke produced by the engine. Once smoke was essentially eliminated, efforts turned in the 1970s to reducing other emissions, like unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide (for more details, see the Emissions section below). The 1970s also saw improvement in combustor durability, as new <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods</b> improved liner (see Components below) lifetime by nearly 100 times that of early liners. In the 1980s combustors began to improve their efficiency across the whole operating range; combustors tended to be highly efficient (99%+) at full power, but that efficiency dropped off at lower settings. Development over that decade improved efficiencies at lower levels. The 1990s and 2000s saw a renewed focus on reducing emissions, particularly nitrogen oxides. Combustor technology is still being actively researched and advanced, and much modern research focuses on improving the same aspects.|$|E
25|$|The J-11 {{was finally}} born in 1998 as a Chinese {{version of the}} Soviet-designed Sukhoi Su-27SK air superiority fighter after China secured a $US2.5 billion {{production}} agreement which licensed China to build 200 Su-27SK aircraft using Russian-supplied kits. Under {{the terms of the}} agreement, these aircraft would be outfitted with Russian avionics, radars and engines. However, in 2004, Russian media reported that Shenyang co-production of the basic J-11 was halted after around 100 examples were built. The PLAAF later revealed a mock-up of an upgraded multi-role version of the J-11 in mid-2002. The indigenous J-11B variant incorporates various Chinese material modifications and upgrades to the airframe with improved <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods</b> in addition to the inclusion of domestic Chinese technologies such as radar, avionics suites and weaponry, including anti-ship and PL-12 air-to-air missiles presumably for the role of a maritime strike aircraft. The alleged reason for the sudden stop in the production line of the J-11 was because it could no longer satisfy the PLAAF's requirements, due to elements such as the obsolete avionics and radar, which were structured for aerial missions.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} World War the carpets {{started to be}} {{produced}} for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class {{of the twentieth century}} aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred mainly in the Midlands around the towns of Wilton and Kidderminster and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different <b>manufacturing</b> <b>methods</b> and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their décor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original ¾ Wilton looms still exist and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce bespoke (custom-made) luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.|$|E
