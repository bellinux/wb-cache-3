5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist <b>market</b> <b>policy,</b> became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of synthetic fibres and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk.|$|E

25|$|The ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM) is the region's {{aviation}} policy geared {{towards the}} development of a unified and single aviation market in Southeast Asia. The aviation policy was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by the ASEAN Transport Ministers. The ASEAN-SAM is expected to liberalise air travel between member-states in the ASEAN region, allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows between member states. Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of the air between capital cities of member states for air passenger services have been removed, while from 1 January 2009, full liberalisation of air freight services in the region took effect. On 1 January 2011, full liberalisation on fifth freedom traffic rights between all capital cities took effect. The ASEAN Single Aviation <b>Market</b> <b>policy</b> supersedes existing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral air services agreements among member states which are inconsistent with its provisions.|$|E

In the practical part data on unemployment and usage of labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> tools are analysed. Finally, efficiency of the labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> in the Czech republic is evaluated. Labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> in the Czech republic are efficient, because costs on unemployed persons are in comparisom with expenditure on labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> high.

30|$|Active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> play an {{important}} role in this endeavour. There is a long tradition of extensive use of active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> in Denmark, and active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> have been maintained during the Great Recession. With the increase in unemployment this means that there has been a volume increase in active labour <b>market</b> <b>policies.</b> The flipside of this is an expenditure increase, but so far it has been possible to accommodate this since there has been some fiscal space. This points to the importance of creating fiscal space in “good times” to be able to accommodate negative shocks. While it in the current situation may be difficult to find policy measures which significantly can boost job creation, it is important to maintain the active focus of labour <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> to prevent an increase in long-term and thus structural unemployment.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} facing Kosovo today is youth unemployment. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the role of active labor <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> in increasing youth employment. Work data has been collected from various sources. For the theoretical part, data are obtained from academic literature related to active labor <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> that apply in all other countries of the world, while for the practical part the data are obtained from performance reports of the Public Employment Service, Surveys of Power Workers, published by the Kosovo Agency of Statistics, as well as reports from other institutions that promote active labor <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> for the integration of young people into employment. The conclusion of the paper is that active labor <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> are the best mechanism for channeling and streamlining state intervention in the labor market with clear goals; Kosovo has created a few years of practice in implementing active labor <b>market</b> <b>policies,</b> but this practice should be strengthened to further develop...|$|R
40|$|Active labor <b>market</b> <b>policies,</b> {{defined as}} {{programs}} for marginalized workers that improve {{their chances of}} finding stable jobs, have grown in importance since roughly 1980 due {{to high levels of}} unemployment. This paper examines the role of private firms in active labor <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> in three generous welfare states—Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. Whereas the participation of private firms in the implementation of active labor <b>market</b> <b>policies</b> enhances the efficiency of these policies, firms’ increased bargaining power within the national policy-making arena raises questions about their continued willingness to adjust their preferences in order to accommodate public concerns. The results suggest that the state plays a fundamental role in building firm support for active labor <b>market</b> <b>policies,</b> although employer organizations do influence firms’ participation in these programs. ...|$|R
