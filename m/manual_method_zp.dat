40|$|Statement of Problem: One of the {{considerations}} regarding the space analysis in study casts {{is the issue}} of speed and precision in analysis. Purpose: This research aimed to design a software to conduct space analysis and evaluate its accuracy compared to manual space analysis. Materials and Method: This reasearch was conducted in two stages: Exploratory and Cross- Sectional. The subjects were selected randomly from patients between 7 to 11 years of age referring to the orthodontics clinic at the dentistry school of the Islamic Azad University. About 30 study models (15 pairs) were randomly selected. Space analysis with <b>manual</b> <b>method</b> was performed. Space analysis with the aid of Cyber Space Analysis software was also carried out by locating the required landmarks on digital images of dental casts. The accuracy of this software in comparison with the <b>manual</b> <b>method</b> in space analysis for mixed dentition was evaluated using T student test. Results: The average time required for space analysis using the software was 3. 4 minutes as compared to the <b>manual</b> <b>method</b> which took 7. 81 minutes on average. The results from software-assisted space analysis showed no significant difference with that obtained from the <b>manual</b> <b>method</b> (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|To solve {{a problem}} of how to {{evaluate}} computer-produced summaries, a number of automatic and <b>manual</b> <b>methods</b> have been proposed. <b>Manual</b> <b>methods</b> evaluate summaries correctly, because humans evaluate them, but are costly. On the other hand, automatic methods, which use evaluation tools or programs, are low cost, although these methods cannot evaluate summaries as accurately as <b>manual</b> <b>methods.</b> In this paper, we investigate an automatic evaluation method that can reduce the errors of traditional automatic methods by using several evaluation results obtained manually.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the CAD/CAM method with the conventional <b>manual</b> <b>method</b> in fabrication of spinal orthoses for patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Ten subjects were recruited for this study. Efficiency analyses of the two methods were performed from cast filling/digitization process to completion of cast/image rectification. The dimensional changes of the casts/models rectified by the two cast rectification methods were also investigated. The results demonstrated that the CAD/CAM method was faster than the conventional <b>manual</b> <b>method</b> in the studied processes. The mean rectification time of the CAD/CAM method was shorter than that of the conventional <b>manual</b> <b>method</b> by 108. 3 min (63. 5 %). This indicated that the CAD/CAM method took about 1 / 3 of the time of the conventional manual to finish cast rectification. In the comparison of cast/image dimensional differences between the conventional <b>manual</b> <b>method</b> and the CAD/CAM method, five major dimensions in each of the five rectified regions namely the axilla, thoracic, lumbar, abdominal and pelvic regions were involved. There were no significant dimensional differences (p < 0. 05) in 19 out of the 25 studied dimensions.

40|$|AbstractCoconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is a {{perennial}} tree crop, {{which has a}} percapita consumption of 120 nuts/ year/ head in Sri Lanka. Nut {{is the most important}} economical part in a coconut palm. Fruit has to be de-husked before any production process and there is no any mechanical mean, available in Sri Lanka other than manual coconut de-husking with an iron spike. This has become a major problem in coconut industry, as it is laborious, dangerous and expensive. This study was aimed to introduce an efficient and affordable mechanical method for coconut de-husking. Main components of the de-husking machine are; set of blades and blade spreading system, operating lever system and adjustable fruit holder. The most salient feature of this machine is detaching the husk into four pieces while retaining the soft eye covering part. Machine weighs 65 kg and the total cost of production was LKR 13, 200. The performance of the de-husking machine was evaluated separately using a single operator (T 1) and an operator with a helper (T 2) and compared it with most practicing <b>manual</b> de-husking <b>method</b> (de-husking with iron spike). According to the analyzed results by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), there is a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between T 2 and the <b>manual</b> <b>method</b> but no significant difference was observed between T 1 and the <b>manual</b> <b>method.</b> Actual capacities of T 1, T 2 and the <b>manual</b> <b>method</b> were 69, 135 and 78 nuts/ hr, respectively.
