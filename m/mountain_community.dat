Nearly all of its {{citizens}} have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The game's two protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris. Having just arrived in the city, Leon and Claire {{make their way to the}} Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from the mutated population. There, they discover that most of the policemen have been killed already, and that Chris has left town to investigate the Umbrella headquarters in Europe. With no remaining motivation to stay, the two protagonists split up to look for other survivors and flee the city. While searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry, who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.|$|E

2500|$|The {{period of}} Dayi Daoxin (580–651) and Daman Hongren ( [...] 601–674) {{came to be}} called the East Mountain Teaching due to the {{location}} of the residence of Daman Hongren in Huangmei County, modern Anhui. The term was used by Yuquan Shenxiu, the most important successor to Hongren. The East <b>Mountain</b> <b>community</b> was a specialized meditation training centre. Hongren was a plain meditation teacher, who taught students of [...] "various religious interests", including [...] "practitioners of the Lotus Sutra, students of Madhyamaka philosophy, or specialists in the monastic regulations of Buddhist Vinaya". The establishment of a community in one location was a change from the wandering lives of Bodhiharma and Huike and their followers.

[...] The fraternity's National Alumnae Association authorized the school on June 30, and fraternity leaders initiated an extensive study to locate a <b>mountain</b> <b>community</b> that would most benefit from a new school. [...] The U.S. Commissioner of Education suggested they establish such a school in Tennessee, and the Tennessee Department of Education identified Sevier County as having the fewest schools. [...] An East Tennessee teacher, Mabel Moore, pointed the Pi Beta Phis to Gatlinburg then a tiny mountain hamlet {{at the edge of the}} Great Smoky Mountains as the community most in need of a new school. [...] In 1910, Pi Beta Phi Grand President May Lansfield Keller made the [...] trek from Sevierville to Gatlinburg over what she called [...] "the worst road in Tennessee" [...] and verified that Gatlinburg was the best choice for the fraternity's first philanthropy.|$|E

2500|$|Parker has {{described}} himself as [...] "the typical big-dream kid" [...] who envisioned a career in film and music. He made short films on the weekends {{with a group of}} friends, beginning when he was 14. His father had purchased him a video camera and the group continued making films until graduation. He became interested in pursuing music at 17, but only comedy-centered songs; he wrote and recorded a full-length comedy album, Immature: A Collection of Love Ballads For The '80's Man, with friend David Goodman during this time. As a teenager, Parker developed a love for musical theatre, and joined the Evergreen Players, a venerable <b>mountain</b> <b>community</b> theater outside of Denver. At 14, he performed his first role as chorus member in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and Flower Drum Song and went on to also design sets for the community theater's production of Little Shop of Horrors. In high school, he also played piano for the chorus and was president of the choir counsel. As Evergreen was nationally known for its choir program, Parker was a very popular high school student, connected to his position {{as the head of the}} choir. He was typically the lead in school plays and was also prom king. While in school, Parker had a part-time job at a Pizza Hut and was described as a film geek and music buff.|$|E
