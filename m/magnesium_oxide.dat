As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide,</b> a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|E

5|$|ZnO has a {{relatively}} large direct band gap of ~3.3eV at room temperature. Advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation. The bandgap of ZnO can further be tuned to ~3–4eV by its alloying with <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> or cadmium oxide.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>oxide</b> sand {{is probably the most}} effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E
5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide,</b> silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate.

40|$|AbstractTransparent {{conducting}} oxides (TCOs) {{have been}} {{well known in the}} form of undoped single cation oxides such as SnO 2 and In 2 O 3. These are degenerate semiconductors which are simultaneously transparent and highly conductive, useful in many optical and electrical device developments.

Since then new TCOs are being reported with increasing frequency as their technological interest and importance increased in various fields of technological development. In this paper, we have attempted to use <b>magnesium</b> tin <b>oxide</b> as new TCO which possess more than 80 % of transmittance for a 320 nm film. The precursor of magnesium tin alloy was prepared through a new way called “protective flux route” method. <b>Magnesium</b> tin <b>oxide</b> thin films were prepared by electron beam evaporation technique.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name {{manganese}} is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from Magnesia (located within modern Greece) were both called magnes from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male magnes attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female magnes ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine magnes was later called magnesia, known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide. Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called manganesum (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra (the black ore) from magnesia alba (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called magnesia negra manganesa, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese (German: Mangan). The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (<b>magnesium</b> <b>oxide),</b> which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later.|$|E

40|$|Synthesis of <b>magnesium</b> nickel <b>oxide</b> phase such as MgxNi 1 -xO solid {{solutions}} {{has been}} studied in this research article using mechnochmical reaction between <b>magnesium</b> and nickel <b>oxide.</b> Mixtures of <b>magnesium</b> powder and nickel oxide (Mg+NiO) with stoichiometric compositions were milled for different times in a planetary ball mill. Reduction reaction of nickel <b>oxide</b> by <b>magnesium</b> via a mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR) was confirmed in the XRD measurements of the as-milled samples. Formation of nanostructured <b>magnesium</b> nickel <b>oxide</b> phases (such as Mg 0. 4 Ni 0. 6 O or MgNiO 2) was observed after isothermal heating of the 30 minutes milled samples at 1000 °C where nickel phase seems to disappear in XRD patterns. The traces of phases such as Mg 0. 4 Ni 0. 6 O or MgNiO 2  were also observed in the as-milled mixtures. Therefore, the XRD results of the as-milled samples suggested that the formation of <b>magnesium</b> nickel <b>oxide</b> phases could be possible even after prolonged milling. The XRD and SEM results of both as-milled and isothermally heated samples indicated that the crystallite size and particle size of the final products reached to nanoscale after milling. Morphological and compositional evolution of the samples after heat treatment was monitored through SEM imaging and elemental analyses.

In contrast to previous studies of Mg(0001) oxidation and unlike the case of aluminum oxidation we find a rather unanticipated surface oxide structure, consisting of two mixed oxygen-magnesium layers on top of an almost undisturbed Mg(0001) surface.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{comprehensively}} investigate the possibility of partially substituting natural aggregates with Black/Oxidizing Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slag in concrete production. Five recycled and one traditional mixes were produced to identify a convenient substitution ratio for the concrete.

Chemical and durability tests were performed to study the microstructure and analyse the behaviour of the conglomerate exposed to detrimental agents. Results showed that high substitution ratios of coarse natural aggregates are possible without decreasing mechanical properties of concrete. Conversely, replacement of fine natural aggregates with recycled ones seems feasible at lower substitution ratios only.

50|$|Armalcolite {{crystals}} up {{to several}} millimeters in length can be grown by mixing powders of iron, titanium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>oxides</b> in the correct ratio, melting them in a furnace at about 1,400 °C, letting the melt crystallize {{for a few days}} at about 1,200 °C, and then quenching the crystals to the ambient temperature. The quenching step is required both for laboratory and natural synthesis in order to avoid conversion of armalcolite to a mixture of magnesium-rich ilmenite (Mg-) and rutile (TiO2) at temperatures below 1,000 °C. This conversion threshold temperature increases with pressure and eventually crosses the melting point, meaning that the mineral cannot be formed at sufficiently high pressures. Because of this conversion to ilmenite, armalcolite has a relatively low abundance and is associated with ilmenite and rutile. Consequently, the relative amount of ilmenite and armalcolite can be used as an indicator of the cooling rate of a mineral during its formation.|$|R
