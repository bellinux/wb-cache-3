40|$|Current {{commercial}} interferometers reveal excellent measurement performances, {{because of}} its major advantage which enables the displacement measurement with the characterization of the high resolution under the large <b>measuring</b> <b>range.</b> Fabry-Perot interferometer is a compact interferometer with the structure of common optical path. In comparison with the ordinary commercial laser interferometers having non-common optical path, Fabry-Perot interferometer is more insensitive to environmental disturbances. But the disadvantages of Fabry-Perot interferometer are the limited <b>measuring</b> <b>range</b> and the considerable visibility decadence of the interference pattern. To enlarge the <b>measuring</b> <b>range,</b> the folded Fabry-Perot interferometer in which a corner cube reflector severs as the measurement mirror has been proposed in the previous research. However, either the conventional Fabry-Perot interferometer or the folded Fabry-Perot interferometer still have {{the problem of the}} considerable visibility decadence of the interference pattern. When the length of optical cavity is changed, the overlapped state of the laser beams will be varied strongly. Hence, it is indispensible to offer a proper signal interpolation algorithm for various signal distributions during the displacement measurement in the whole <b>measuring</b> <b>range.</b> An advanced signal interpolation algorithm for the above-mentioned Fabry-Perot interferometer has been proposed in this investigation.

Contact stylus {{instrument}} has difficulties in tracing large slope angle (LSA) lens for surface profile measurement {{due to the}} dilation of measured profile image by the shape of stylus tip. This research {{is to develop a}} surface profile reconstruction method for tip profile with LSA lens and then verified the result by estimating the form error. Experimental set-up is configured of a surface profile and roughness analyzer, Panasonic Ultra Accuracy 3 -D Profilometer (UA 3 P), and the feasibility of the developed program is compared with the results of a commercial operation software, UA 3 P software. The figure form error (FFE) is used to evaluate the developed method. Experiments have been performed by measuring the LSA lens of a s 55 ml spherical gage with <b>measuring</b> <b>ranges</b> increasing from ± 30 °, ± 45 ° to ± 60 ° and measuring an aspheric lens with range ± 50 °. Experimental results showed that the FFE of the developed method has smaller FFE values than those obtained by the UA 3 P software as the measuring range of ± 30 ° and ± 45. Similar result of FFE is obtained as 0. 891 µm for the aspheric lens by the developed method than FFE 0. 896 µm by the UA 3 P software. Therefore, the developed method has been verified for estimating the FFE of LSA lens with variant <b>measuring</b> <b>ranges.</b> Future work is to develop related compensation methodology of FFE for LSA lens measurement and also to find appreciated tip profiles for measuring LSA lens of higher order nonlinear terms...|$|E

40|$|Summary Background, {{objectives}} and methods: An accurate, sensitive and precise assay for reliable {{determination of the}} ristocetin cofactor activity of von Willebrand factor (VWF:RCo) in plasma and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) -containing concentrates has been evaluated. The assay {{is based on a}} commercially available automated protocol with modifications including a combination of adding additional ristocetin and the use of two calibration curves for the high and low <b>measuring</b> <b>ranges.</b> Results: Addition of extra ristocetin resulted in improved measurement of VWF recoveries from various VWF-containing concentrates that were underestimated using the standard automated protocol. The modifications resulted in improved assay performance over an extended measuring range (2. 00 - 0. 03 IU/mL). Accuracy was tested using VWF deficiency plasma spiked with 1 (st) international standard for VWF concentrate. Seven dilutions, ranging between 1. 80 and 0. 05 IU/mL, were analyzed and resulted in measured concentrations between 80 % and 100 % of the assigned potency of the standard. Linearity was determined from the regression plot of the same concentrate dilutions and resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0. 998. The repeatability, expressed as coefficient of variation, was 2 % in the normal range (0. 90 IU/mL) and 8 % at the level of 0. 05 IU/mL. The corresponding reproducibility results were 2 % and 15 % at the normal and low <b>measuring</b> <b>ranges,</b> respectively. Conclusions: Analysis of patients with von Willebrand disease indicates that the modified automated BCS((R)) protocol has a superior discrimination power compared with the standard protocol. This is especially true in samples with low VWF, as in patients with type 3 von Willebrand disease...|$|E
