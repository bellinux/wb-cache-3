Despite displaying promising academic ability, both low track students in the United States and poor children in Kenya can be at disadvantages in their educational advancement. For those in the United States, they acquire vocational skills at the sacrifice of reaching their full academic potential and the job security of a college education. The prospects for poor children in Kenya are even worse, having acquired few job skills in their primary school education.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} laser scanner failure on mirrors and windows. Mirrors and glasses are quite common objects that appear in our daily lives. However, while laser scanners {{play an important role}} nowadays in the field of robotics, there are very few literatures that address the related issues such as mirror reflection and glass transparency. We introduce a sensor fusion technique to detect the potential obstacles not seen by laser scanners. A laser-based mirror tracker is also proposed to figure out the mirror locations in the environment. The <b>mirror</b> <b>tracking</b> method is seamlessly integrated with the occupancy grid map representation and the mobile robot localization framework. The proposed approaches have been demonstrated using data from sonar sensors and a laser scanner equipped on the NTU-PAL 5 robot. Mirrors and windows, as potential obstacles, are successfully detected and tracked. I...|$|R

The optical configuration of the tertiary Nasmyth system is such that the focus is always maintained in the same place as the flat Nasmyth <b>mirrors</b> <b>track</b> the movement of the principle axis of the dual reflector to ensure a constant illumination of the receivers.

5000|$|The {{simplest}} and earliest commercial WSS {{were based}} on movable mirrors using Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). [...] A schematic of a MEMS-based WSS is shown in Figure 2 (to be uploaded). The incoming light is broken into a spectrum by a diffraction grating (shown at RHS of Figure) and each wavelength channel then focuses on a separate MEMS mirror. By tilting the mirror in one dimension, the channel can be directed back {{into any of the}} fibers in the array. A second tilting axis allows transient crosstalk to be minimised, otherwise switching (eg) from port 1 to port 3 will always involve passing the beam across port 2. The second axis provides a means to attenuate the signal without increasing the coupling into neighbouring fibers. This technology has the advantage of a single steering surface, not necessarily requiring polarization diversity optics. It works well {{in the presence of a}} continuous signal, allowing the <b>mirror</b> <b>tracking</b> circuits to dither the mirror and maximise coupling.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Australian National University {{has been}} {{undertaking}} {{a review of}} state-of-the-art in heliostat design, {{as part of the}} Australian Solar Thermal Research Initiative (ASTRI). Deep cost reduction is required to ensure solar tower technology becomes competitive, and to achieve the aggressive LCOE targets of ASTRI and other programs like U. S. Sunshot. This paper is a case study for a new heliostat design, and aims to provide directions and identify opportunities for cost reduction. The review examines trends at both a system level and at an individual collector level, to make sense of where the greatest potential for cost reduction lies. At a heliostat system level, we focus in particular on three factors critical to cost reduction: manufacturing and assembly, heliostat size and wind load analysis. A technological review of heliostat componentry highlights those areas we believe have most performance improvement and cost reduction potential, including <b>mirrors,</b> <b>tracking</b> systems, communication systems and structure. The review also identifies cost reducing design features of some recent unconventional heliostat designs, and provides a summary of those features we believe to hold the most promise...|$|R

The audio-articulation method is a fossilized pronunciation mistake breaker, moving raising awareness of a fossilized mistake to perception via listening to oral practice.

40|$|Linear Fresnel {{collectors}} {{have the}} potential to reduce levelized electricity costs (LEC) of solar thermal power plants and thus accelerate sustainable market penetration of solar thermal power plants. It is expected that linear Fresnel collectors will be cheaper than conventional parabolic trough collectors. On the other hand the efficiency of this new collector concept will be lower than that of parabolic troughs. So far no reliable information is available whether the reduced investment in combination with the reduced efficiency causes a final reduction of the LEC. To overcome this lack of information a German consortium was formed and led by MAN-Ferrostaal Power Industries with the Solar Power Group (SPG) aiming at the design, construction, operation and assessment of linear Fresnel collectors. Within the German FRESDEMO project a first prototype with a length of 100 m and a width of 21 m was erected at the Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA) in Spain. The steel structure of the prototype supports a fixed central absorber tube located in the centre of a secondary reflector and 25 rows of slightly curved primary mirrors. The challenge of designing a cost efficient collector system is to guarantee the required optical and mechanical quality of all subsystems such as primary <b>mirrors,</b> <b>tracking</b> system and secondary reflector at minimised costs. These quality aspects have to be considered not only during design phase but also during construction on site...|$|R
