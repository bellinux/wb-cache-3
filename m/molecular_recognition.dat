30|$|In {{biosensor}} studies, proteins such as enzymes, antigens–antibodies, and receptors {{were common}} biosensing elements to bind target molecules and then elicit sensor responses in biochemical detections [10, 11, 12]. The proteins often had binding sites in which multiple interactions can be formed with target molecules by high specific affinities or catalysis activities. However, these complex proteins {{were difficult to}} purify and synthesize, which hindered their biosensing applications. In recent studies, peptides were widely applied as alternative biosensing materials for complex proteins in biosensor designs [13, 14, 15]. Peptides were short chains of amino acids that can be designed based on binding sites of proteins, screened into specific sequences, and finally synthesized with chemical methods. It provided an easy option to design artificial receptors to mimic <b>molecular</b> <b>recognitions</b> between proteins and analytes. The robust structures of peptides also allowed for using in more extreme environment and long-term storage, compared to natural protein molecules.

Conventional mining and modeling approaches aimed at pathway discovery are often effective at achieving either objective, but not both.

The MIPs were prepared with methacrylic acid (MAA) as the monomer, ethylene glycol dimetharylate (EGDMA) as the crosslinker and 2, 2 '-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) as the initiator. The obtained polymer particles (particle size after grinding was about 25 - 35 µm) were packed into a HPLC column (3. 9 mm i. d. × 150 mm). The selectivity and chromatographic characteristics of the MIPs were studied using acetonitrile as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0. 8 mL/min. UV detector wavelength was set at 270 nm. Different single template MIPs showed different <b>molecular</b> <b>recognitions</b> to the templates and the structurally analogues, according to the rigidity and steric hindrance of the compounds.

50|$|A great {{advantage}} of using self-assembling peptides to build nanostructures in a bottom-up {{approach is that}} specific features can be incorporated; the peptides can be modified and functionalized. This approach means that the final structures are built from the self-integration of small, simple building blocks. Essentially this approach is needed for nanoscale structure, as the top-down method of miniaturizing device using sophisticated lithography and etching techniques has reached a physical limit. Moreover, the top-down approach is applicable to mainly only silicon based technology, and is unable {{to be used for}} biological developments.The peptide structure is organized hierarchically into four levels. The primary structure of a peptide is the sequence of the amino acids on the peptide chain. Amino acids are monomer molecules that carries a carboxyl and an amine functional groups; a spectrum of other chemical groups are attached to different amino acids, such as thiols and alcohols. This facilitates the wide range of chemical interactions and therefore <b>molecular</b> <b>recognitions</b> that peptides are capable of. For designer self-assembling peptides both natural and non-natural amino acids are used. They link together in a controlled manner to form short peptides which links to form long polypeptide chains.|$|R

Some advantages of optical imaging include cost-effectiveness, convenience, and non-ionization safety as well as complementation with other imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Over the past decade, considerable advances have been made in tumor optical imaging by targeting integrin receptors in preclinical studies. This review has emphasized the construction and evaluation of diverse integrin targeting agents for optical imaging of tumors in mouse models. They mainly include some near-infrared fluorescent dye-RGD peptide conjugates, their multivalent analogs, and nanoparticle conjugates for targeting integrin &# 945;v&# 946; 3. Some compounds targeting other integrin subtypes such as &# 945; 4 &# 946; 1 and &# 945; 3 for tumor optical imaging have also been included. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed some promising integrin-targeting optical agents which have further enhanced our understanding of integrin expression and targeting in cancer biology as well as related anticancer drug discovery. Especially, some integrin-targeted multifunctional optical agents including nanoparticle-based optical agents can multiplex optical imaging with other imaging modalities and targeted therapy, serving as an attractive type of theranostics for simultaneous imaging and targeted therapy. Continued efforts to discover and develop novel, innovative integrin-based optical agents with improved targeting specificity and imaging sensitivity hold great promises for improving cancer early detection, diagnosis, and targeted therapy in clinic. </p...|$|R

Crystal {{engineering}} primarily {{deals with}} the understanding of intermolecular interactions {{in the context of}} crystal packing and thus utilizes this information for the designing and development of novel crystalline solid for targeted application. Supramolecular chemistry helps understanding these intermolecular interactions in the various medium and thus remains an integral part of crystal engineering. These intermolecular interactions are usually weak and noncovalent in nature. Thus, shape and functionality the components of crystalline material have importance in the understanding crystal engineering. Resorcin[4]arenes and pyrogallol[4]arenes have a unique bowl shape and the upper rim of this bowl is decorated with multiple hydroxyl groups. These structural features led to construction of supramolecular organic frameworks with various architecture and topology. These structures were primarily utilized to understand <b>molecular</b> <b>recognitions</b> and host guest interactions. Thus, in this thesis, we focused on synthesis of novel supramolecular organic frameworks from resorcin[4]arenes and pyrogallol[4]arenes by co-crystallizing these macroccyles with various organic linker molecules such as 4, 4 '-bypyridine. The major part of this thesis project involved screening and characterization of single crystal structure of these cocrystalline frameworks and analyzing the stability of selected framework in solution as well as in solid form. Application of these novel framework materials in gas sorption and separation is evaluated by exposing the stable framework materials to various gases at specific temperature and pressure. The gas sorption capacity of a specific framework material is attributed to its porosity and thermal stability after desolvation.
