At {{the time of the}} first alarm, Sydney Harbour was closed to external traffic, but Muirhead-Gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic to continue, as he believed that having multiple ships travelling around at speed would help force any submarines to remain submerged.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{doctrine}} of karma is central to all Indian religions, {{it is difficult to}} say when and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took place in an era from which the literary documents are not available, since the basics of this doctrine were present and concluded even in the earliest documents of Jains. Acaranga Sutra and Sutrakritanga, contain a general outline of {{the doctrine}}s of karma and reincarnation. The roots of this doctrine in Jainism <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira. The Jain conception of karma—as something material that encumbers the soul—has an archaic nature which justifies the hypothesis that it goes back to 8th or 9th century BCE.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{made with}} the NASA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer have {{discovered}} that the disk around Beta Pictoris contains an extreme overabundance of carbon-rich gas. This helps stabilize the disk against radiation pressure which would otherwise blow the material away into interstellar space. Currently, there are two suggested explanations for {{the origin of the}} carbon overabundance. Beta Pictoris <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of forming exotic carbon-rich planets, in contrast to the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, which are rich in oxygen instead of carbon. Alternatively it may be passing through an unknown phase that might also have occurred early {{in the development of the}} Solar System: in the Solar System there are carbon-rich meteorites known as enstatite chondrites, which may have formed in a carbon-rich environment. It has also been proposed that Jupiter may have formed around a carbon-rich core.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Kaiser Friedrich III and her sisters were brought back to active service and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron. Kaiser Friedrich III was commanded by Käpitan zur See Alfred Begas. The V Squadron was tasked with providing coastal defense in the North Sea. The ships were deployed to the Baltic twice, from 19 to 26 September and 26 to 30 December 1914. For the first operation, the commander of naval forces in the Baltic, Prince Heinrich, initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on Windau, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. Kaiser Friedrich III and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, where the landing force disembarked. The ships then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. For their second deployment to the Baltic, Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward Gotland to attack Russian warships that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December, having failed to locate any Russian vessels.|$|E

Women will look for this by observing if the man comes to the door to pick her up or if he opens doors for her, or compliments her on how she looks, for example. If some of her expectations are not met, mainly the most important ones, she will not want to pursue anything more than a friendship.

25|$|When a team {{is willing}} to sign an {{upcoming}} free agent, but the player's current team wants something in return, it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best interest of both clubs to execute a sign-and-trade deal. This occurs when one team signs one of its free agents and immediately trades that player to another team. A sign-and-trade is beneficial to both the player and the teams; the player receives a bigger contract than he might ordinarily get from a team {{that he would like}} to play for, while the trading club gets something in return for a free agent, and the recipient of the trade gets the player they desire. Sign-and-trades are a reality in the NBA because of the CBA's rules: unlike baseball, where teams losing free agents are compensated with draft picks or cash, NBA teams that lose free agents receive no compensation.|$|E

This manoeuvre coincided with the period during which his ship was out of radar range; Bismarck successfully broke radar contact and circled back behind her pursuers. Suffolks captain assumed that Bismarck had broken off to the west and attempted to find her by also steaming west. After half an hour, he informed Wake-Walker, who ordered the three ships to disperse at daylight to search visually.|$|E

On 25 July, Nürnberg and several destroyers and torpedo boats escorted the damaged battleship Gneisenau, which had been torpedoed by a British submarine, from Trondheim, Norway, to Kiel.

Robert Yates noted that the clause [...] "which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased" [...] was an amendment passed in his absence, and that he did not place much faith in it as he felt unscrupulous politicians would circumvent it by creating new positions for persons who would subsequently place a member of Congress in a vacancy that they and not Congress created. Madison moved that the phrase [...] "or the Emoluments whereof shall have been augmented by the legislature of the United States, during the time they were members thereof, and for one year thereafter." [...] This motion failed 2–8, with one state divided. The clause was limited to [...] "civil" [...] offices so as not to restrict military service. Accordingly, the clause was passed in its current form without an explicit time consideration.|$|E
