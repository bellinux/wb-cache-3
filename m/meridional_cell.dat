It was found that, the seaonal varying direction of EUC (the quatorial Undercurrent) in the Pacific is westwards beginning from the eastern equatorial Pacific in the boreal spring. The <b>meridional</b> <b>cell</b> south of the equator plays important role on this seasonal change of EUC. On the other hand, although the varying directional is westwards, the seasonal variation of temperature in the same region gets its minimum values in the boreal autumn beginning from the eastern equatorial Pacific.

A control experiment is performed with two runs driven by the mean ERA- 40 data during 1958 – 1977 and 1981 – 2000, respectively. The model reproduces the major decadal-scale circulation changes in late spring over East Asia, including a cooling in the upper troposphere and an anomalous <b>meridional</b> <b>cell.</b> Accordingly, the precipitation decrease is also captured in the southeast of the upper-level cooling region. To quantify {{the role of the}} upper-level cooling in the drought mechanism, a sensitivity experiment is further conducted with the cooling imposed in the upper troposphere.

40|$|Fundamental to the {{redistribution}} {{of energy in}} a planetary atmosphere is the general circulation and its meridional structure. We use a general circulation model of the atmosphere in an aquaplanet configuration with prescribed sea surface temperature and investigate {{the influence of the}} gravitational acceleration g on the structure of the circulation. For g=g₀= 9. 81 ms⁻², three <b>meridional</b> <b>cells</b> exist in each hemisphere. Up to about g/g₀= 1. 4 all cells increase in strength. Further increasing this ratio results in a weakening of the thermally indirect cell, such that a two- and finally a one-cell structure of the meridional circulation develops in each hemisphere. This transition is explained by the primary driver of the thermally direct Hadley cell: the diabatic heating at the equator which is proportional to g. The analysis of the energetics of the atmospheric circulation based on the Lorenz energy cycle supports this finding. For Earth-like gravitational accelerations transient eddies are primarily responsible for the meridional heat flux. For large gravitational accelerations, the direct zonal mean conversion of energy dominates the meridional heat flux...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{series of}} horizontal wind measurements by the spaced-antenna real time winds (RTW) method was supplemented by a phase coherent system for two years. Vertical motions are inferred from the complex autocorrelation functions, and an RTW system provides 5 min samples from 60 to 110 km. Comparisons with full interferometric 3 -D velocity measurements confirm {{the validity of}} this approach. Following comparisons and corrections with the horizontal winds, mean summer and winter (24 h) days of vertical motions are shown. Tidal fluctuations are evident. In summer the motions are downward, consistent with data from Poker Flat, and the suggestion of Coy et al. (1986) that these represent Eulerian motions. The expected upward Lagrangian motion then results from adding up upward Stokes' drift.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{state of}} the stratosphere influenced by radiative heating, with no internal sources or sinks of angular momentum, is examined.

This regime consists of a single mean <b>meridional</b> <b>cell,</b> equatorial easterlies, and strong winter westerlies. Outside of the circulation region the flow is in thermal equilibrium. The effect of one-sided friction, acting as a drag on midlatitude westerlies only, is to expand the Hadley cell into the winter hemisphere and increase the magnitude of cross-equatorial flow. This result is possible even in the steady state when the advection of angular momentum in the tropics is made small by reducing the gradient of angular momentum in this region instead of the advecting velocity...|$|E

40|$|The Overturning Circulation of the Southern Ocean {{has been}} {{investigated}} using {{a state of the}} art, eddy resolving ocean-sea ice model. The overturning circulation at constant depth and latitude reveals a 'Deacon Cell', a wind-driven <b>meridional</b> <b>cell</b> which acts to flux light surface waters Northward and downward and dense deep waters Southward and upward. The overturning has been further analysed in density-latitude space. Northward transport of light water and Southward transport of dense water by the Deacon Cell are compensated by the standing meanders of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and other stationary features. The overturning has been finally analysed in depth-density space. Here, the Deacon Cell is compensated by transient eddy fluxes. We thus propose a new paradigm to conceptualize the Southern Ocean Overturning Circulation: the ACC's standing meanders transport light water Southward and dense water Northward with little vertical excursion; transient eddies then act on the resulting zonal gradients of isopycnals, transporting light water upward and dense water downward.

40|$|Poleward energy {{transport}} in {{the atmosphere}} and oceans constitutes an important branch of the global energy budget, {{and its role in}} the climate system {{has been the subject of}} many studies. In the atmosphere, the transport is affected by “eddies” and large scale <b>meridional</b> <b>cells,</b> both with zero net mass transport across latitude circles, but also partly by processes associated with a net transport of mass across latitude circles. The latter must cease to operate in steady state, but they may be significant when time variability of the heat budget is considered. Indeed, examination of reanalysis data on short (daily to monthly) timescales shows that mass variations on these timescales result in surprisingly large fluctuations (in excess of 10 ^ 15 W = 1 PW) in the poleward heat transport. These fluctuations are referred to as “extensive”, for they primarily alter the mass integrated energy of the region considered, but not its averaged value. It is suggested that extensive fluctuations mask more meaningful climate signals present in the heat transport variability on monthly and interannual timescales, and a new formulation is proposed to isolate the latter.

Climate projections show that a warmer northern tropical Atlantic Ocean together with a warmer equatorial Pacific lead to extreme droughts in the Amazonia, considerably reducing the Amazon runoff.

Climate model simulation without Amazon runoff resulted in cooler equatorial Atlantic, weakening the Hadley cell and thereby the atmospheric <b>meridional</b> <b>cells.</b> Consequently, the extratropical westerlies turned weaker, leading to prevalent negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) like climate, similar to the observed anomalies during Amazon drought years.

Winters of northern Europe and eastern Canada turned cooler and drier whereas southern Europe and the eastern United States experienced warmer and wetter winters without Amazon runoff.

40|$|We {{summarize}} {{the changes in}} Titans thermal structure derived from Cassini CIRS and radio-occultation data during the transition from winter to early spring. Titan's surface, and middle atmosphere show noticeable seasonal change, whereas that {{in most of the}} troposphere is mated. This can be understood in terms of the relatively small radiative relaxation time in the middle atmosphere and much larger time scale in the troposphere. The surface exhibits seasonal change because the heat capacity in an annual skin depth is much smaller than that in the lowest scale height of the troposphere. Surface temperatures rise 1 K at raid and high latitudes in the winter northern hemisphere and cool in the southern hemisphere. Changes in in the middle atmosphere are more complicated. Temperatures in the middle stratosphere (approximately 1 mbar) increase by a few kelvin at mid northern latitudes, but those at high latitudes first increase as that region moves out of winter shadow, and then decrease. This probably results from the combined effect of increased solar heating as the suit moves higher in the sky and the decreased adiabatic warming as the sinking motions associated with the cross-equatorial <b>meridional</b> <b>cell</b> weaken. Consistent with this interpretation, the warm temperatures observed higher up at the winter polar stratopause cool significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of the westerlies in the lower troposphere and the easterlies in the upper troposphere in the Indian southwest monsoon is studied by considering the angular momentum balance in the region. The main source term for the zonal angular momentum is the Coriolis or the atransport term. This term contributes enough to maintain the lower tropospheric westerlies against friction. The zonal pressure gradient term and the mountain torque are of a smaller magnitude. The flux divergence at the boundaries is small in the lower troposphere; it is large in the upper troposphere and serves to export the easterly momentum produced in the region. Thus. it is concluded that the mean meridional circulation (which is direct) mainly contributes to the {{maintenance of}} the mean zonal motion. Actually there is divergence of eddy flux of momentum from the region of maximum zonal winds. The mean meridional circulation releases kinetic energy of the same order of magnitude as the release by the mean winter <b>meridional</b> <b>cell</b> over an equal area.

40|$|Near {{the equator}} where the Coriolis force vanishes, the {{momentum}} balance for the axially symmetric circulation is established between {{horizontal and vertical}} diffusion, which, a priori, does not impose constraints on the direction or magnitude of the zonal winds. Solar radiation absorbed at low latitudes is {{a major force in}} driving large scale motions with air rising near the equator and falling at higher latitudes. In the upper leg of the <b>meridional</b> <b>cell,</b> angular momentum is redistributed so that the atmosphere tends to subrotate (or corotate) at low latitudes and superrotate at high latitudes. In the lower leg, however, the process is reversed and produces a tendency for the equatorial region to superrotate. The outcome depends on the energy budget which is closely coupled to the momentum budget through the thermal wind equation; a pressure (temperature) maximum is required to sustain equatorial superrotation. Such a condition arises in regions which are convectively unstable and the temperature lapse rate is superadiabatic. It should arise in the tropospheres of Jupiter and Saturn; planetary energy from the interior is carried to higher altitudes where radiation to space becomes important. Upward equatorial motions in the direct and indirect circulations (Ferrel-Thomson type) imposed by insolation can then trap dynamic energy for equatorial heating which can sustain the superrotation of the equatorial region...|$|E

40|$|The meridional {{circulation}} {{cells of the}} Southern Ocean are investigated using the results from a fine-resolution primitive equation model. Zonal integration along depth levels shows the classical series of meridional cells but integrating along density surfaces shows a number of differences, including the virtual disappearance of the Deacon Cell. To investigate the differences, the meridional transport is calculated {{as a function of}} both density and depth. The results show that the Deacon Cell is associated with systematic changes in the depth of density surfaces between the western boundary current region off South America and the return flow in the interior of the ocean. Water flowing on each density surface produces a <b>meridional</b> <b>cell</b> with a vertical excursion of a few hundred meters. These cells combine, without water crossing density surfaces, to produce a single integrated deacon Cell extending from the surface to below 2000 m. The results also show that, at each altitude, water on each of the density surfaces in the upper layers of the ocean systematically transfers angular momentum from the shallowest depths at which it is found to deeper depths. In this way the torque, due to the wind acting {{on the surface of the}} ocean, is transferred downward, in a series of steps between water masses of increasing density, until it is finally lost as a pressure torque acting on the ocean bottom topography...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{numerical}} model calculations are compared with space laboratory experiments for rotating, thermally driven flow in a hemispherical shell, and various flow regimes are described. A spherically symmetric body force, analogous to gravity, is imposed in the radial direction {{through the use}} of a dielectric fluid and an electrostatic potential difference across the gap. The spherical boundaries are maintained at constant temperature profiles (with the pole and the inner sphere being the warmer surfaces), and the equatorial wall is an insulator. Typical parameter combinations result in highly nonlinear, but laminar, flow. For weak enough buoyant forcing, the flow is axisymmetric. It consists of a single <b>meridional</b> <b>cell,</b> rising in warm latitudes (in this case, near the pole) and sinking in cool latitudes, with prograde flow in the equatorial region and near the inner hemisphere for other latitudes, and retrograde motion elsewhere. For fast rotation, the first transition due to the instability of this simple flow is also axisymmetric, consisting of rings of convection in the polar region, which propagate poleward. The first nonaxisymmetric convection occurs at Rayleigh numbers which increase with rotation rate. The form of the convection near the transition also depends upon the rate of rotation. Selected flow patterns near the transition as well as those beyond it are studied numerically.

40|$|The {{kinetic energy}} {{budget of the}} atmosphere's meridional {{circulation}} cells is analytically assessed. In the upper atmosphere kinetic energy generation grows with increasing surface temperature difference Δ T_s between the cold and warm ends of a circulation cell; in the lower atmosphere it declines. A requirement that kinetic energy generation is positive in the lower atmosphere limits the poleward cell extension L of Hadley cells via a relationship between Δ T_s and surface pressure difference Δ p_s: an upper limit exists when Δ p_s does not grow with increasing Δ T_s. This pattern is demonstrated here using monthly data from MERRA re-analysis. Kinetic energy generation along air streamlines in the boundary layer does not exceed 40 J mol^- 1; it declines with growing L and reaches zero for the largest observed L at 2 km height. The limited <b>meridional</b> <b>cell</b> size necessitates the appearance of heat pumps [...] circulation cells with negative work output where the low-level air moves towards colder areas. These cells consume the positive work output of the heat engines [...] cells where the low-level air moves towards the warmer areas [...] and can in theory drive the global efficiency of atmospheric circulation down to zero. Relative contributions of Δ p_s and Δ T_s to kinetic energy generation are evaluated: Δ T_s dominates in the upper atmosphere, while Δ p_s dominates in the lower.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the meridional overturning of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) are best {{described in terms of}} a residual circulation that sums the transport of the wind-driven Ekman layer to the transport associated with eddies. Here an attempt is made to infer the residual circulation from observations by combining altimetric data and gridded hydrographic data to estimate eddy fluxes and winds to estimate Ekman transport. At the surface, a flow directed equatorward on the poleward flank of the ACC, and directed poleward on the equatorward flank of the ACC, is deduced. This convergence of flow into the axis of the ACC drives the subduction of the Antarctic Intermediate Water. Weak southward residual flow on the equatorward boundary of the ACC indicates that here Ekman transport is offset by eddy fluxes. The sense of the deduced residual circulation suggests that buoyancy is gained by the ocean through air–sea flux poleward of the ACC, in broad agreement with observations. The surface residual circulation is mapped down to depth to yield two counterrotating <b>meridional</b> <b>cells</b> associated with the transformation of North Atlantic Deep Water and Subantarctic Mode Water into Antarctic Intermediate Water.

The results show a rainfall increase in North Africa since the mid- 90 s with significant northward migrations of rainfall amounts, i. e. + 1. 5 ° for the 400 mm July to September isohyets, whereas deep convection has significantly increased and shifted northward. The subsidence branch of the northern meridional overturning has also been reinforced and shifted by 1 ° latitude northward in winter. At larger scale, an unambiguous reorganisation of the circulation with increasing subsidence in high troposphere over the Mediterranean and increasing ascendance in the African Intertropical Convergence Zone in northern summer has been noticed in the <b>meridional</b> <b>cell</b> overturning. After 1993 - 1994, the migration of the Saharan heat low towards northwest has been more marked (+ 1 ° to + 2 ° in latitude; − 1 ° to − 2 ° in longitude), whereas its centre intensified at the peak of the tropical rainy season (+ 10 gpm thickness in the 700 - 925 hPa layer).

40|$|An 18 -vertical level {{primitive}} equation general circulation model was developed from previous {{models of the}} Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in order to study t,he lower stratosphere in detail. The altitude range covered was from the surface to 4 mb. (37. 5 km.), the vertical resolution being optimized in the tropopause region to permit a more accurate calculation of the vertical transport terms. A polar stereographic projection waa used and the model waa limited to a single hemisphere. The model now resolves two distinct jet streams, one in the troposphere {{and the other in}} the middle polar stratosphere. The wind systems produce a %cell meridional structure in the troposphere, which evolves into a 2 -cell structure in the stratosphere. However, the wind structure and associated features of the model in the troposphere had a general equatorward shift compared with observation. A considerable improvement was also obtained in some features of the temperature distribution, in particular the local midlatitude temperature maximum in the lower stratosphere is well defined and shown to be dynamically maintained. The low temperature and sharpness of the equatorial tropopause temperature distribution are closely reproduced by the model, and these features are attributed to the action of the upwards branch of the direct <b>meridional</b> <b>cell</b> in the Tropics, aa is the basic cause of the difference in height of the tropopause at low and high latitudes. The energy balance of the lower stratosphere in the present model agrees better with observation than previous models did, and confirms earlier work that this region is maintained from the troposphere by a vertical flux of energy. A similar flux of energy is also required to maintain the middle stratosphere, even though this region generates kinetic energy internally, and it is concluded that it is only marginally possible that this region may be baroclinically unstable. It appears that forcing from below extends to higher altitudes in winter than previously suspected...|$|E
40|$|Hydrographic {{data from}} a cruise at 24. 5 °N in the {{subtropical}} North Atlantic are used to calculate and examine the fluxes across the section. The components of the fluxes of heat, freshwater, oxygen and nutrients through the section are analysed. After the variables are separated into section average, baroclinic profile and anomalies, the fluxes are separated into an Ekman component and its barotropic compensation, baroclinic and horizontal components. The baroclinic contribution due to the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) {{is responsible for the}} largest amount of heat transport with warmer waters flowing poleward and cooler deep waters flowing equatorward. The Ekman component and its barotropic compensation is the second-most important component of heat transport. The MOC transports about 25 % of the combined meridional heat transport by atmosphere and ocean at 24 °N. The Ekman and baroclinic components are responsible for the northward salt transport. Salt conservation for the Atlantic north of 24. 5 °N suggests that there is a net precipitation between the Bering Strait and the 24. 5 °N section of about 0. 5 Sv. Horizontal transport is the major contribution to the southward oxygen flux, as oxygen-poor water flows northward in the Florida Straits and oxygen-rich water flows southward in mid-ocean. Baroclinic transport is the main factor in the southward transport of all nutrients: low concentration upper water flows northward and higher concentration deep water flows southward. The zonally integrated <b>meridional</b> <b>cell</b> carries a poleward heat flux of 1. 51 ± 0. 39 PW, 0. 14 PW of which is due to seasonal sampling, and equatorward transports of - 2621 ± 705 kmol s- 1 of oxygen, - 254 ± 176 kmol s- 1 of silicate, - 130 ± 95 kmol s- 1 of nitrate and - 12. 6 ± 6. 3 kmol s- 1 of phosphate. Finally we have explored the changes in ocean circulation implied by changes in silicate transport through the section. Strict silicate conservation through the section leads to a great increase in the northward deep circulation in the eastern basin that is not in accord with the present understanding of the circulation. Taking an intermediate silicate transport through the section, according to estimates of silicate sources, produces a reasonable increase in the southward Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) flow and an increase in the deep northward transport in the eastern deep basin, as well as a decrease in silicate and nitrate transports through the section. Fluxes of heat, salt and oxygen are not significantly affected by changes in the conditions of silicate conservation...|$|E

40|$|The 18 -level {{primitive}} equation, {{general circulation}} model described in Part I {{was used to}} study the diffusion of two idealized tracers in the stratosphere. One traccr was designed to simulate broadly {{the behavior of the}} radioactive tungsten which escaped lnto the stratosphere following nuclear tests in the Tropics, the other was taken as a photochemical ozone distribution. Both the meridional circulation and the large-scale eddies were found to be important in the diffusion of the tracers, and for quasisteady state conditions they formed a highly interrelated system in which their actions were mutually canceling. The large-scale eddies were of primary importance for thepolewards transport of the tracers in middle and high latitudes, but the supply of tracer for these eddies was principally maintained from the higher levcls by thz downward branches of the meridional circulation. Two <b>meridional</b> <b>cells</b> were found to occur in the stratosphere, a tropical direct cell and a higher latitude indirect ccll, and these provided a natural explanation for many of the observed features of the tracer distributions in the actual atmosphere. The only major tropospheric-stratospheric exchange took place in the subtropics through the tropopause gap, the vertical eddies and the meridional circulation being of comparable magnitude for this exchange. The synoptic situation in the atmosphere was found to be of fundamental importance for the large-scale diffusion of the tracers in middle lztitudes, and the downgradient transport of tracers in the lower stratosphere was primaril...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of chlorophyll spatial patterns and variability on the tropical Pacific climate is investigated {{by using a}} fully coupled general circulation model (HadOPA) coupled to a state-of-the-art biogeochemical model (PISCES). The simulated chlorophyll concentrations can feedback onto the ocean by modifying the vertical distribution of radiant heating. This fully interactive biological-ocean-atmosphere experiment is compared to a reference experiment that uses a constant chlorophyll concentration (0. 06 mg m− 3). It is shown that introducing an interactive biology acts to warm the surface eastern equatorial Pacific by about 0. 5 °C. Two competing processes are involved in generating this warming: (a) a direct 1 -D biological warming process in the top layers (0 – 30 m) resulting from strong chlorophyll concentrations in the upwelling region and enhanced by positive dynamical feedbacks (weaker trade winds, surface currents and upwelling) and (b) a 2 -D meridional cooling process which brings cold off-equatorial anomalies from the subsurface into the equatorial mixed layer through the <b>meridional</b> <b>cells.</b> Sensitivity experiments show that the climatological horizontal structure of the chlorophyll field in the upper layers is crucial to maintain the eastern Pacific warming. Concerning the variability, introducing an interactive biology slightly reduces {{the strength of the}} seasonal cycle, with stronger SST warming and chlorophyll concentrations during the upwelling season. In addition, ENSO amplitude is slightly increased. Similar experiments performed with another coupled general circulation model (IPSL-CM 4) exhibit the same behaviour as in HadOPA, hence showing the robustness of the results. ...|$|R
