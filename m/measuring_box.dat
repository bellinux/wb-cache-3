5000|$|The {{relevant}} features {{gathered during}} box counting {{depend on the}} subject being investigated {{and the type of}} analysis being done. Two well-studied subjects of box counting, for instance, are binary (meaning having only two colours, usually black and white) and gray-scale digital images (i.e., jpgs, tiffs, etc.). Box counting is generally done on patterns extracted from such still images in which case the raw information recorded is typically based on features of pixels such as a predetermined colour value or range of colours or intensities. When box counting is done to determine a fractal dimension known as the box counting dimension, the information recorded is usually either yes or no {{as to whether or not}} the box contained any pixels of the predetermined colour or range (i.e., the number of boxes containing relevant pixels at each [...] is counted). For other types of analysis, the data sought may be the number of pixels that fall within the <b>measuring</b> <b>box,</b> the range or average values of colours or intensities, the spatial arrangement amongst pixels within each box, or properties such as average speed (e.g., from particle flow).|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{research}} on crop performance or climate control in greenhouses requires accurate measurement of climate conditions. Despite {{the use of}} calibrated sensors, afterwards it may appear that the collected climate data are incorrect. Then the question arises whether we need to repeat the experiment or whether we can reconstruct the correct climate data from the incorrect measurements. In this paper we show how correct data of temperature and air humidity could be reconstructed from incorrect data. In a large research project on Botrytis development and energy use in the greenhouse cut flower gerbera, measuring boxes were installed in 12 commercial greenhouses. The <b>measuring</b> <b>box</b> consisted of a temperature sensor, an air humidity sensor and a CO 2 sensor and on top a PAR sensor. Before {{the start of the}} experiment all sensors were taken out the <b>measuring</b> <b>box</b> for calibration by the supplier of the sensors. Subsequently the <b>measuring</b> <b>box</b> containing the sensors was tested at different temperatures and air humidity¿s in a climate chamber. Nevertheless the temperature and air humidity data gathered in the greenhouses appeared to be erroneously. Temperature was overestimated up to 1 - 2 °C while relative air humidity was underestimated by 10 - 20 %. Detailed analysis afterwards showed that the climate in the <b>measuring</b> <b>box</b> was affected by irradiance, mainly due to insufficient ventilation of the measuring boxes. The measurement error depended on the irradiance and the rate of change in climate conditions. To analyze this error, simultaneous measurements with certified measuring devices and the <b>measuring</b> <b>box</b> were performed in a greenhouse under a wide range of dynamically varying conditions. The measured temperature was determined by a first order effect of the temperature of the greenhouse air as well as a first order effect of irradiance. Similarly measured air humidity showed first order relations to humidity of the greenhouse air and to irradiance. The data with the certified sensors were used to estimate the parameters of the first order relations. Subsequently these relations were used successfully to reconstruct the temperature and air humidity from the incorrect data gathered at the 12 commercial growers. After correction the accuracy of the achieved temperature was approx. +/- 1. 0 °C, the relative humidity approx. +/- 3 % similar to the technical specifications of the sensors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For {{the purpose}} of both {{luminescence}} dosimetry and dating, a new portable mini auto-mated luminescence-measuring system has been developed. The main parts {{of the new system}} consist of the stimulation unit, an irradiation unit and the photon detector. The size of the main <b>measuring</b> <b>box</b> is approximately 300 × 300 × 300 mm. In particular, to keep the electric power as low as possible, a miniature X-ray (Oxford, Eclipse II reflection target) generator and a metal-packaged photomultiplier tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu photonics, H 7421 - 40) were adopted here. 16 blue LEDs were employed for the stimulation of quartz OSL. The same LED holder can be used for pulsed-OSL (P-OSL) measure-ments. The weight of the main part of this system was about 15 kg. In order to check the usefulness of the new system, red thermoluminescence (RTL) glow curves were measured to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio) using a volcanic quartz sample. These re-sults show that the new system improves the S/N ratio in comparison with an existing handmade sys-tem. The estimated RTL equivalent (or paleo) dose using quartz extracted from an archaeological roof tile of Shin-Yakushiji temple by means of the SAR protocol was in good agreement with previous measurements. This proves that the new system is suitable for practical use for RTL-measurements either for dosimetry or for dating with a high S/N ratio...|$|E
