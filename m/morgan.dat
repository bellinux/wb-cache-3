5|$|The <b>Morgan</b> {{trotting}} stallion Shepherd F. Knapp was {{exported to}} England in the 1860s, where his trotting ability influenced the breeding of Hackney horses. During this period, numerous <b>Morgan</b> mares {{may have been}} brought west and integrated into Texan horse herds, which influenced {{the development of the}} American Quarter Horse breed. The <b>Morgan</b> horse also was an ancestor of the Missouri Fox Trotter. By the 1870s, however, longer-legged horses came into fashion, and <b>Morgan</b> horses were crossed with those of other breeds. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the original style <b>Morgan,</b> although a few remained in isolated areas.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>Morgan</b> {{had been}} ordered to {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if <b>Morgan</b> received the dues owed to him. As <b>Morgan</b> was {{no longer able to}} issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and <b>Morgan</b> received a commission for each one signed. <b>Morgan</b> was not entirely friendly to pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and advertising the capture publicly.|$|E

He becomes even more confused when his vampiric sense of smell tells him that <b>Morgan</b> is human. Mick tries to expose <b>Morgan</b> as Coraline, but finally comes {{to believe that she}} is a doppelgänger when he sees that she does not have the fleur de lis tattoo on her shoulder as Coraline did. When alone, <b>Morgan</b> scrubs away the heavy makeup that has been covering the tattoo. Beth snoops through Mick's property, and finds out Mick was the one who protected her as a little girl when she was kidnapped. <b>Morgan</b> goes with Mick to his apartment to clean up after almost getting hit by a car. Mick joins her in the shower and finally sees the tattoo on her shoulder, revealing her identity as Coraline. When Beth learns that <b>Morgan</b> is really Coraline, the lady who kidnapped her as a child, she goes to Mick's apartment and stabs her with a wooden stake, narrowly missing her heart, not realizing that she has become human. Coraline goes to hospital, but recovers and leaves after being revealed to be a vampire again. Beth's boyfriend Josh is kidnapped by a dangerous Los Angeles–based gang. Mick and Beth witness the event and drive after him, but Josh is shot. Beth realizes that Josh is dying, and begs Mick to turn him into a vampire; he refuses and Josh dies.

5|$|Four {{days after}} he left Maracaibo, <b>Morgan</b> returned. He was told that a Spanish defence squadron, the Armada de Barlovento, {{was waiting for him}} at the narrow passage between the Caribbean and Lake Maracaibo, where the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress was sited. The forces, under the command of Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, had 126 cannon with which to attack <b>Morgan,</b> and had re-armed San Carlos de la Barra Fortress. The Spaniards had orders to end piracy in the Caribbean, and {{negotiations}} between <b>Morgan</b> and Espinosa continued for a week. The final offer put by the Spanish commander was for <b>Morgan</b> to leave all their spoils and slave and to return to Jamaica unmolested, but no agreement was reached that would allow <b>Morgan</b> and his men to pass the fleet with their spoils but without attack. <b>Morgan</b> put the Spaniards' offers to his men, who voted instead to fight their way out. As they were heavily outgunned, one privateer suggested that a fire ship aimed at Espinosa's flagship, Magdalen would work.|$|E
