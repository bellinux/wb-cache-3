50|$|Libraries {{began using}} {{microfilm}} in the mid-20th {{century as a}} preservation strategy for deteriorating newspaper collections. Books and newspapers that were deemed in danger of decay could be preserved on film and thus access and use could be increased. Microfilming was also a space-saving measure. In his 1945 book, The Scholar and the Future of the Research Library, Fremont Rider calculated that research libraries were doubling in space every sixteen years. His suggested solution was microfilming, specifically with his invention, the <b>microcard.</b> Once items were put onto film, they could be removed from circulation and additional shelf space would be made available for rapidly expanding collections. The <b>microcard</b> was superseded by microfiche. By the 1960s, microfilming had become standard policy.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is identification of Candida strains isolated from patients with gastro-oesophageal candidiasis in Tehran, Iran. Background: Gastro-oesophageal candidiasis is a rare infection and appears mainly in debilitated or immunocompromised patients. Colonization by Candida spp. may occur in this region and the organism can remain for several months or years {{in the absence of}} inflammation. The main infection symptom is the presence of white plaques in gastro-oesophageal surface. C. albicans remains the most prevalent Candida spp. identified in gastrointestinal candidiasis. Regarding differences in susceptibilities to antifungal drugs among Candida spp., identification of isolates to the species level is significant to quick and appropriate therapy. Patients and methods: A total of 398 patients underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy during February 2012 to October 2014 were included in the present study. Histological sections from all endoscopic gastric and oesophageal biopsies were prepared, stained with Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), and examined for the presence of fungal elements. Part of the biopsy sample was sub-cultured on sabouraud glucose agar. The genomic DNA of each strain was extracted using FTA® Elute <b>MicroCards.</b> Molecular identification of Candida isolates was performed by PCR-RFLP technique with the restriction enzyme HpaII...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ways in which the use of {{microfilm}} served as a precursor to later computerized information systems in business, education, and science. This accessible and inexpensive photographic technology allowed scientists, scholars, and others to experiment with ideas for information storage and retrieval that were not ultimately realized until the 1990 s. In 1926, George McCarthy, vice president of a New York bank, invented a rotary microfilm camera for copying bank checks automatically. This camera paved the way for the microfilm industry to record large volumes of documents very rapidly. Microfilm was quickly adopted by banks in the 1930 s and by other businesses, industries, and government agencies. Libraries, eager to expand access to resources required by a burgeoning research community, also adopted microfilm. Although academic enthusiasts predicted that microfilm would revolutionize scholarship, the limitations of reading machinery precluded an unmitigated success. Users in academia, business, technology, and science also sought to improve on {{the ways in}} which data could be retrieved from microfilm. This paper discusses three specific attempts to overcome output limitations: the struggle for good reading machines; the pursuit of more standardized and sortable formats, i. e., <b>microcards</b> and aperture cards; and finally the use of microfilm as an expendable element in new computerized information systems...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays it is {{difficult}} to imagine, what kind of changes research libraries have gone through during the last 40 years. In the 70 ’s libraries were proud of large collections of printed books and journals. Library automation was mostly in infancy, but some research fields were forerunners in developing library and information services. These fields are those that are economically useful in society. The first and most qualified international databases were in sciences like chemistry and physics, medicine, education and economics. Other sciences – like humanities and most of social sciences – were followers. Databases and different e-services were developed {{in the wake of the}} forerunners. Most milestones in libraries are connected with the development of information technology. These are e. g. international databases and information retrieval by modems, satellites, cd-rom, online, as well as library automation in making printed bibliographies, <b>microcards,</b> library catalogues, local lending services and libraries networking by the Internet. Science, technology and libraries are connected with each other supporting and creating new needs. Technological development gives both possibilities and challenges to libraries. Libraries with all the access to e-materials afford better tools to researchers to produce results and to make innovations. In academic libraries we need a more scientific approach to work. To meet better the needs of researchers, it is useful to know something about the character of research work and research process. When recruiting personnel in research libraries we have to look after having enough information specialists with deep knowledge of those sciences our library is responsible. The best situation is, if academic libraries have information specialists with doctoral education. This gives us better understanding to develop new research support services, like research data management, bibliometric services as well as support for publishing...|$|R

50|$|In 1933 Rider {{returned}} to Middletown {{to take a}} permanent librarianship position at Wesleyan. A year later the university awarded him a Masters ad eundum, Phi Beta Kappa. Subsequently, after becoming director of Wesleyan’s Olin Memorial Library, Rider wrote his most significant work {{on the subject of}} Library Science, The Scholar and The Future of the Research Library (published in 1944). In The Scholar, he laid out the problem of increasing shortage of space in research libraries and described the <b>microcard,</b> a microform of his own invention being a 7 and a half by 12 and a half centimeter opaque card. Upon the catalogue, or front-side, would be the catalogue information. Upon the reverse, Rider wanted to reproduce “as many as 250 pages of an ordinary 12mo book {{on the back of a}} single card.” The idea was inspired by recent developments he had been following in the production and printing of micro-text, especially by the Readex Microprint Corporation. Rider envisioned that these microcards would serve both as the catalogue and collection, thus not only saving shelving space by eliminating books, but also doing away with the need to have a catalogue collection separate from manuscript collection. Researchers would search the catalogue for the entry they wished, and then having selected it would take the card to a reader machine which might be no bigger than a briefcase.|$|E

The ports are also how people read <b>microcards</b> with stored information on them. All people are revealed to have to die on their 80th birthday - in order to make this happen, the Society slowly starts to poison the seniors' food when they are reaching the end of their 79th year. The Society has also decided that their former culture was too [...] "cluttered" [...] and thus eliminated most traces of culture, saving only 100 of everything - the Hundred Poems, Hundred Paintings, Hundred Stories, Hundred Songs, etc. At night, citizens take turn with their family members wearing [...] "data tags", which collect information on their dreams to help predict their behavior. Every citizen must also carry three pills on them - one blue, one green, and one red - although initially it is not revealed what the tablets do. Cassia carries her pills in an 'artifact' - a possession from the past that was given to her by her grandfather - that used to be a powder compact used by her great-grandmother. People's actions are predicted using sophisticated psychological and statistical techniques, referred to as [...] "sorting."

Cassia enjoys it, but notes that she does not want to sort real people - such as sorting them into jobs or Matches.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) E 6 /E 7 type-specific oncogenes {{are required}} for cervical carcinogenesis. Current PCR protocols for genotyping high-risk HPV in cervical screening are not standardized and usually use consensus primers targeting HPV capsid genes, which are often deleted in neoplasia. PCR fragments are detected using specialized equipment and extra steps, including probe hybridization or primer extension. In published papers, analytical sensitivity is typically compared with a different protocol on the same sample set. A single-tube multiplex PCR containing type-specific primers was developed to target the E 6 /E 7 genes of two low-risk and 19 high-risk genotypes (HPV 6, 11 and 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 70, 73 and 82) and the resulting short fragments were directly genotyped by high-resolution fluorescence capillary electrophoresis. Results The method was validated using long oligonucleotide templates, plasmid clones and 207 clinical samples of DNA from liquid-based cytology, fresh and formalin-fixed specimens and FTA <b>Microcards</b> ® imprinted with cut tumor surfaces, swabbed cervical cancers or ejected aspirates from nodal metastases of head and neck carcinomas. Between one and five long oligonucleotide targets per sample were detected without false calls. Each of the 21 genotypes was detected in the clinical sample set with up to five types simultaneously detected in individual specimens. All 101 significant cervical neoplasias (CIN 2 and above), except one adenocarcinoma, contained E 6 /E 7 genes. The resulting genotype distribution accorded with the national pattern with HPV 16 and 18 accounting for 69 % of tumors. Rare HPV types 70 and 73 were present as the sole genotype in one carcinoma each. One cervical SCC contained DNA from HPV 6 and 11 only. Six of twelve oropharyngeal cancer metastases and three neck metastases of unknown origin bore E 6 /E 7 DNA; all but one were HPV 16. One neck aspirate contained atypical squames with HPV 26. Analytical sensitivity in dilute plasmid mixes was variable. Conclusions A primer-rich PCR readily detects the E 6 /E 7 oncogenes of 21 HPV types in cellular and fixed tissue specimens. The method is straightforward, robust and reproducible and avoids post-PCR enzymatic and hybridization steps while detecting HPV with high clinical sensitivity in significant HPV-related neoplasia regardless of specimen type. </p...|$|R
