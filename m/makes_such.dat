5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This <b>makes</b> <b>such</b> a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E

Kids Can Say No! encourages children to report abuse they experience and Beyond the Scare advises teachers about what to do if a child <b>makes</b> <b>such</b> a disclosure.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{diagnosed}} with cancer, Scully is unsure of her future with the FBI. Mulder is convinced that her condition {{is a result of}} her earlier abduction ("Ascension"), and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. He is dissuaded by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who secretly <b>makes</b> <b>such</b> a deal instead. While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide a decoy body. He uses the distraction this offers to infiltrate The Pentagon to find a cure for Scully's cancer, while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Bond {{suggests}} {{that changes in}} the flux of solar energy on a 1,500-year scale may be correlated to the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, and in turn the Heinrich events; however the small magnitude {{of the change in}} energy <b>makes</b> <b>such</b> an exo-terrestrial factor unlikely to have the required large effects, at least without huge positive feedback processes acting within the Earth system. However, rather than the warming itself melting the ice, it is possible that sea-level change associated with the warming destabilised ice shelves. A rise in sea level could begin to corrode the bottom of an ice sheet, undercutting it; when one ice sheet failed and surged, the ice released would further raise sea levels, and further destabilizing other ice sheets. In favour of this theory is the non-simultaneity of ice sheet break-up in H1, H2, H4, and H5, where European breakup preceded European melting by up to 1,500years (Maslin et al. 2001).|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI {{consists of}} four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player <b>makes</b> <b>such</b> decisions as which characters {{will be in the}} traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.|$|E

25|$|Mark Epstein is an American {{psychiatrist}} who practiced Buddhism in Thailand under Ajahn Chah {{and has since}} written several books on psychoanalysis and Buddhism (Thoughts Without a Thinker 1995, Psychotherapy Without the Self, 2008). Epstein relates the Buddhist Four Noble Truths to primary narcissism as described by Donald Winnicott in his theory on the true self and false self. The first truth highlights the inevitability of humiliation in our lives of our narcissistic self-esteem. The second truth speaks of the primal thirst that <b>makes</b> <b>such</b> humiliation inevitable. The third truth promises release by developing a realistic self-image, and the fourth truth spells out the means of accomplishing that.|$|E

25|$|Dr. David C. Lane {{proposes a}} {{checklist}} consisting of seven points to assess gurus in his book, Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical. One of his points is that spiritual teachers should have {{high standards of}} moral conduct and that followers of gurus should interpret {{the behavior of a}} spiritual teacher by following Ockham's razor and by using common sense, and, should not naively use mystical explanations unnecessarily to explain immoral behavior. Another point Lane makes is that the bigger the claim a guru <b>makes,</b> <b>such</b> as the claim to be God, the bigger the chance is that the guru is unreliable. Dr. Lane's fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus {{are likely to be more}} unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage.|$|E
25|$|How {{much of his}} {{seven-year term}} Hardy served is unknown and his {{whereabouts}} {{for most of the}} period from 1901-1909 are a mystery. His account of the period makes the claim that he was attached to the staff of the Duke of Connaught and later traveled to Toronto, Ontario, Canada where he became a high-profile editor at a news agency before being falsely accused of forgery and returning to Britain. The lack of documentation <b>makes</b> <b>such</b> a claim difficult to prove, although it was a claim he maintained from 1910 until at least 1920. Other accounts of his life from his family state that he talked of how he had lived in the United States for some time and had been in San Francisco for the famous 1906 earthquake. The claim is difficult to verify and should be believed with caution, especially given that the 1906 earthquake's destruction of the city's records was commonly used as a convenient explanation by criminals to forget their past. 1910 saw Hardy's second seven-year term of imprisonment. He forged a cheque using a simple confidence trick which assured a fellow passenger on a train that Hardy had money in America and could afford to repay a loan. Once invited into her Croydon home, Hardy located her cheque book and forged her signature whilst she was out of the room. He was tried under his then alias of Hall Frankland and again served his time in Dartmoor Prison.|$|E
500|$|The monastery {{was damaged}} {{as a result}} of the 2011 Van earthquake. According to Ara Sarafian, [...] "parts of the main church collapsed, while other parts were {{significantly}} weakened. Old cracks got bigger, new ones appeared." [...] Turkish engineers reportedly inspected it and announced that they would commence restoration work in the spring of 2012. Sarafian wrote that [...] "such promises have been made in the past and one needs to be a little skeptical. The current state of the church <b>makes</b> <b>such</b> work much harder than at any time in the past." [...] He noted in a 2012 article that the local and provincial governments supported the preservation and restoration of the monastery. In October 2012, the artist Raffi Bedrosyan, who contributed to the restoration of the St. Giragos Church in Diyarbakır, stated that he had hoped to restore Varagavank and added that [...] "Both Ankara and Van agreed to launch the restoration project, but social and natural obstacles delayed the process.". In 2017 it was documented that the remaining stones of the monastery are torn down bu the authorities and local government to build a local mosque and other developments with them.|$|E

500|$|Weird Tales {{included}} a letters column, titled [...] "The Eyrie", {{for most of}} its existence, and during Wright's time as editor it was usually filled with long and detailed letters. [...] When Brundage's nude covers appeared, a lengthy debate over whether they were suitable for the magazine was fought out in the Eyrie, with the two sides divided about equally. [...] For years it was the most discussed topic in the magazine's letter column. [...] Many of the authors Wright published wrote letters too, including Lovecraft, Howard, Kuttner, Bloch, Smith, Quinn, [...] Wellman, Price, and Wandrei. In most cases these letters praised the magazine, but occasionally a critical comment was raised, as when Bloch repeatedly expressed his dislike for Howard's stories of Conan the Barbarian, referring to him as [...] "Conan the Cimmerian Chipmunk". [...] Another debate that was aired in the letter column was the question of how much science fiction the magazine should include. [...] Until Amazing Stories was launched in April 1926, science fiction was popular with Weird Tales readers, but after that point letters began to appear asking Wright to exclude science fiction, and only publish weird fantasy and horror. [...] The pro-science fiction readers were in the majority, and as Wright agreed with them, he continued to include science fiction in Weird Tales. [...] Hugh B. Cave, who sold half-a-dozen stories to Wright in the early 1930s, commented on [...] "The Eyrie" [...] in a letter to a fellow writer: [...] "No other magazine <b>makes</b> <b>such</b> a point of discussing past stories, and letting the authors know how their stuff is received".|$|E
