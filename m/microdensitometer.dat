5000|$|As {{previously}} mentioned the original {{application of the}} N-slit laser interferometer was interferometric imaging. [...] In particular, the one dimensionally expanded laser beam (with a cross section 25-50 mm wide by 10-25 μm high) was used to illuminate imaging surfaces (such as silver-halide films) to measure the microscopic density of the illuminated surface. Hence {{the use of the}} description interferometric <b>microdensitometer.</b> [...] Resolution down to the nano regime can be provided via the use of interinterferometric calculations. [...] When used as a <b>microdensitometer</b> the N-slit interferometer is also known as a laser <b>microdensitometer.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} version to {{the traditional}} point-by-point <b>microdensitometer</b> is the beam expanded laser <b>microdensitometer.</b> [...] This instrument can illuminate simultaneously an area a few centimeters wide with an ultra thin height, in the micrometer regime. [...] Advantages include increased depth of focus, significant increases in data collection speed, and superior signal to noise ratios. [...] In microscopy applications, this type of ultra thin beam-expanded illumination can also be known as light sheet illumination or selective plane illumination.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>microdensitometer</b> is {{an optical}} {{instrument}} {{used to measure}} optical densities in the microscopic domain. [...] A well-known <b>microdensitometer,</b> used in the photographic industry, is a granularity instrument or granularity machine. [...] The granularity measurement {{involves the use of}} an optical aperture, 10-50 micrometers in diameter, and in the recording of thousands of optical density readings. The standard deviation of this series of measurements is known as the granularity of the measured transmission surface, optical film, or photographic film, in particular [...]|$|E
5000|$|Similar {{methods were}} used in the {{production}} of the [...] "Second Generation" [...] DSS, but the <b>microdensitometers</b> have since been modified for dual-channel operation.|$|R
40|$|During {{the next}} 5 - 10 years {{it is likely}} that the bit density {{available}} in digital mass storage systems (magnetic tapes, optical and magnetic disks) will be increased to such an extent that it will greatly exceed that of the conventional photographic emulsions like IIIaJ which are used in astronomy. These developments imply that it will soon be advantageous for astronomers to use <b>microdensitometers</b> to completely digitize all photographic plates soon after they are developed. Distribution of digital copies of sky surveys and the contents of plate vaults will probably become feasible within ten years. Copies of other astronomical archieves (e. g., Space Telescope) could also be distributed with the same techniques. The implications for designers of future <b>microdensitometers</b> are: (1) there will be a continuing need for precision digitization of large-format photographic imagery, and (2) that the need for real-time analysis of the output of <b>microdensitometers</b> will decrease...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} which owes its practicality to {{the capability of}} Schmidt telescopes to record a number of galaxy images on a single plate and {{to the existence of}} high speed computer controlled area-scanning precision <b>microdensitometers</b> such as the Photometric Data Systems model 1010. The method of analysis results in quantitative color-index information which is displayed in a manner that allows any user to effectively study the morphological properties of the distribution of color-index in galaxies...|$|R
50|$|Granularity, or RMS granularity, is a {{numerical}} quantification of film-grain noise, {{equal to the}} root-mean-square (rms) fluctuations in optical density, measured with a <b>microdensitometer</b> with a 0.048 mm (48-micrometre) diameter circular aperture, on a film area that has been exposed and normally developed to a mean density of 1.0 D (that is, it transmits 10% of light incident on it).|$|E
5000|$|Film grain is also {{sometimes}} quantified {{in a way}} that is relative independent of size of the aperture through which the <b>microdensitometer</b> measures it, using R. Selwyn's observation (known as Selwyn's law) that, for a not too small aperture, the product of RMS granularity and the square root of aperture area tends to be independent of the aperture size. The Selwyn granularity is defined as: ...|$|E
5000|$|Kodak {{has defined}} a [...] "Print Grain Index" [...] (PGI) to {{characterize}} film grain (color negative films only), based on perceptual just-noticeable difference of graininess in prints. They also define [...] "granularity", a measurement of grain using an RMS measurement of density fluctuations in uniformly exposed film, {{measured with a}} <b>microdensitometer</b> with 48 micrometre aperture. Granularity varies with exposure — underexposed film looks grainier than overexposed film.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{research}} reported {{is in its}} preliminary stages, results show that: (1) infrared color film is the best single multiband sensor available; (2) {{there is a good}} possibility that forest can be separated from all nonforest land uses by microimage evaluation techniques on IR color film coupled with B/W infrared and panchromatic films; and (3) discrimination of forest and nonforest classes is possible by either of two methods: interpreters with appropriate viewing and mapping instruments, or programmable automatic scanning <b>microdensitometers</b> and automatic data processing...|$|R
40|$|Forest Service {{studies for}} {{integrating}} remotely sensed data into existing information systems highlight a need to: (1) re-examine present methods of collecting and organizing data, (2) develop an {{integrated information system}} for rapidly processing and interpreting data, (3) apply existing technological tools in new ways, and (4) provide accurate and timely information for making right management decisions. The Forest Service developed an integrated information system using remote sensors, <b>microdensitometers,</b> computer hardware and software, and interactive accessories. Their efforts substantially reduce {{the time it takes}} for collecting and processing data...|$|R
40|$|Inexpensive and easy-to-use linear and area-array {{scanners}} {{have frequently}} substituted as colorimeters and densitometers for low-frequency (i. e., large area) hard copy image measurement. Increasingly, scanners {{are also being}} used for high spatial frequency, image microstructure measurements, which were previously reserved for high performance <b>microdensitometers.</b> In this paper we address characteristics of flatbed reflection scanners {{in the evaluation of}} print uniformity, geometric distortion, geometric repeatability and influence of scanner MTF and noise on analytic measurements. Suggestions are made for the specification and evaluation of scanners to be used in print image quality standards that are being developed...|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} at King's College, Loebl met Captain Robert Joyce. In 1951, the two went into {{business}} producing scientific equipment with only £200 of capital. Joyce, Loebl & Co. exported over 70 percent of its products {{and at the time}} of its sale to Technical Operations Inc. (Tech/Ops), an American company, it was one of the major employers in north-eastern England with some 500 workers. It is estimated that the company also spawned 45 other businesses in the region. Some of the most significant products developed by Joyce, Loebl & Co were the optical <b>microdensitometer</b> used to visualise the properties of DNA and other organic compounds, and the MecoLab, a system of routine blood-panel analysis for hospitals.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979 Greek and Latin {{letters were}} {{reported}} as written near the face. These were further studied by André Marion, professor at the École supérieure d'optique and his student Anne Laure Courage, in 1997. Subsequently, after performing computerized analysis and <b>microdensitometer</b> studies, they reported finding additional inscriptions, among them INNECEM (a shortened form of Latin [...] "in necem ibis"—"you will go to death"), NNAZAPE(N)NUS (Nazarene), IHSOY (Jesus) and IC (Iesus Chrestus). The uncertain letters IBE(R?) have been conjectured as [...] "Tiberius". Linguist Mark Guscin disputed the reports of Marion and Courage. He stated that the inscriptions made little grammatical or historical sense and {{that they did not}} appear on the slides that Marion and Courage indicated.|$|E
50|$|The Feulgen {{reaction}} is a semi-quantitative technique. If the only aldehydes {{remaining in the}} cell are those produced from the hydrolysis of DNA, then the technique is quantitative for DNA. It is possible to use an instrument known as a <b>microdensitometer</b> or microspectrophotometer to actually measure {{the intensity of the}} pink Feulgen reaction for a given organelle. Using this procedure, it was early determined that interphase cells were composed of two populations, those with diploid DNA and those with tetraploid DNA (two complete genomes). The nuclei looked identical, but one contained twice as much DNA. This gave rise to the division of the interphase period of the cell cycle to G1, S, and G2 phases based on the synthesis of that extra DNA.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{principal}} advantages of electrography when compared to photography is the nearly linear relationship between source intensity versus resulting image density. This property allows for simplified and more accurate photometric calibration and permits {{a certain degree of}} extrapolation of the calibration to beyond the limits of the faintest photoelectric standard on an exposure. The desires to extract quantitative photometric information from electrographic (or photographic) negatives and to convert this information into a digital format for computer analysis or enhancement led to the widespread use of scanning <b>microdensitometers</b> to perform this A-to-D conversion. Therefore it is of vital importance to understand and, if practical, to avoid any nonlinearities which may be introduced during microdensitometry of electrographic emulsions...|$|R
40|$|Space Telescope can {{generate}} multidimensional image data, very similar in nature to data produced with <b>microdensitometers.</b> An overview is presented of the ST science ground system between {{carrying out the}} observations and the interactive analysis of preprocessed data. The ground system elements used in data archival and retrieval are described and operational procedures are discussed. Emphasis is given to aspects of the ground system {{that are relevant to}} the science user and to general principles of system software development in a production environment. While the system being developed uses relatively conservative concepts for the launch baseline, concepts were developed to enhance the ground system. This includes networking, remote access, and the utilization of alternate data storage technologies...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "First Generation" [...] Digitized Sky Survey was {{produced}} by the Catalogs and Survey Branch (CASB) of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). They scanned plates using one of two Perkin-Elmer PDS 2020G <b>microdensitometers.</b> The pixel size was 25 or 15 micrometres, corresponding to 1.7 or 1.0 arcseconds in the source material. The scanning resulted in images 14,000 x 14,000 or 23,040 x 23,040 pixels in size, or approximately 0.4 and 1.1 gigabytes each. The scanning takes a little under seven hours per plate to complete. Due to the large size of the images, they were compressed using an H-Transform algorithm. This algorithm is lossy, but adaptive, and preserves {{most of the information}} in the original. Most of the First Generation DSS files were shrunk by a factor of seven.|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} for linearity in microdensitometry are discussed. It is shown that under proper conditions a <b>microdensitometer</b> may behave linearly {{regardless of the}} coherence properties of the source.

40|$|A rotary stage <b>microdensitometer</b> was {{interfaced}} to an Apple II {{personal computer}} {{for the purpose}} of making rapid rms granularity measurements. An experimentally determined relationship was found between standard deviation in voltage and rms granularity. By using this relationship the device proved accurate to within 7 percent of the known values of rms granularity on a conventional <b>microdensitometer</b> for the same samples with 95 percent confidence...|$|E
40|$|A total {{reduction}} procedure, {{notable for}} its use of a computer-controlled <b>microdensitometer</b> for semi-automatically tracing curved spectra, is applied to distorted high-dispersion echelle spectra recorded by an image tube. <b>Microdensitometer</b> specifications are presented and the FORTRAN, TRACEN and SPOTS programs are outlined. The intensity spectrum of the photographic or electrographic plate is plotted on a graphic display. The time requirements are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Clustering {{statistics}} are compared in the Automatic Plate Machine (APM) and the Edinburgh/Durham Southern Galaxy Catalogue (EDSGC) angular galaxy surveys. Both surveys were independently constructed from scans {{of the same}} adjacent UK IIIa [...] J Schmidt photographic plates with the APM and COSMOS <b>microdensitometers,</b> respectively. The comparison of these catalogs is a rare practical opportunity to study systematic errors, which cannot be achieved via simulations or theoretical methods. On intermediate scales, 0. 1 ^∘ < θ < 0. 5 ^∘, we find good agreement for the cumulants or reduced moments of counts in cells up to sixth order. On larger scales {{there is a small}} disagreement due to edge effects in the EDSGC, which covers a smaller area. On smaller scales, we find a significant disagreement that can only be attributed to differences {{in the construction of the}} surveys, most likely the dissimilar deblending of crowded fields. The overall agreement of the APM and EDSGC is encouraging, and shows that the results for intermediate scales should be fairly robust. On the other hand, the systematic deviations found at small scales are significant in a regime, where comparison with theory and simulations is possible. This is an important fact to bear in mind when planning the construction of future digitized galaxy catalogs. Comment: 4 pages with 3 figures included. Submitted for MNRAS 'pink pages...|$|R
40|$|The use of neutron radiographs to {{determine}} dimensional changes of heat transfer gaps in cylindrical nuclear fueled capsules is described. A method was developed which involves scanning {{a very fine}} grained neutron radiograph negative with a recording <b>microdensitometer.</b> The output of the densitometer is recorded on graph paper and the heat transfer gap is plotted as a well-defined optical density change. Calibration of the recording <b>microdensitometer</b> ratio arms permits {{measurements to be made}} of the heat transfer optical density change from the <b>microdensitometer</b> trace. Total heat transfer gaps, measured by this method, agree with the physical measurements within plus or minus 0. 005 cm over a range of gaps from 0. 061 to 0. 178 cm...|$|E
40|$|This {{study will}} present a simple, quick, and {{inexpensive}} way to producing sinusoidal test targets, which can then be used in measuring the image quality of a photographic system {{by way of a}} coherent system. The sinusoidal test targets will be produced from a series of bar targets using Fourier Optics, and a comparison study will be made between measuring MTF with a laser and a <b>microdensitometer.</b> A defocused target series will also be produced to note the change in MTF of the photographic system. The results indicate that sinusoidal test targets can be made quickly and inexpensively, and then can be used to provide meaningful data in evaluating a system. It was found that the laser method used in measuring the MTF of a photographic system was found to be superior to the <b>microdensitometer</b> in convenience, in speed, and in noise reduction. However, the <b>microdensitometer</b> can perform tests which the laser cannot, which still makes the <b>microdensitometer</b> an essential and invaluable tool in measuring the image quality of a system...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of performing extensive calculations on <b>microdensitometer</b> data makes entry {{of the data}} into a computer mandatory for many types of investigative situations. The previously available facilities in the Photographic Science department have supported only manual data entry techniques. Such techniques are slow and prone to error, greatly limiting use usefulness of the Ansco Model 4 <b>microdensitometer</b> available for student use.
