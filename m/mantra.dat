5|$|Tantric {{practitioners}} worship Chhinnamasta for acquiring siddhis or supernatural powers. Chhinnamasta's <b>mantra</b> (a sacred chant that {{is repeated}} by a devotee) Srim hrim klim aim Vajravairocaniye hum hum phat svaha {{is to be}} invoked to attract and subjugate women. Her <b>mantra</b> associates her with syllables denoting beauty, light, fire, spiritual self-realization, and destruction of delusion. The Shakta Pramoda and the Rudrayamala recommend the use of her <b>mantra</b> to obtain wealth and auspiciousness.|$|E
5|$|Her <b>mantra</b> may be {{repeated}} ten thousand times, repeated one thousand times while offering flowers and ghee {{in a fire}} sacrifice, or repeated one hundred times while offering water (Arghya) or while offering food to Brahmin priests. Her yantra (sacred geometric diagram), whether physically constructed or mentally envisioned, is used in worship along with the <b>mantra.</b> Offering certain items to a fire sacrifice—particularly those performed at cremation grounds, river banks, forests, or crossroads—while repeating the <b>mantra</b> is said to fulfil specific goals. An offering of Bael leaves is said to result in kingship; salt gives the power to control; turmeric gives the power to paralyse; neem twigs bring wealth; and an offering of sandalwood, camphor and saffron together or a salt and honey mixture grants the power to attract people. A rice-flour bread prepared while repeating her <b>mantra</b> is said to give the power to attract women. It is likewise {{said that it is}} possible to make a person one's slave by feeding him or her the ashes of a crow whose stomach was stuffed with a conch and burnt in a cremation ground while repeating the goddess' <b>mantra.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sahajanand Swami {{was later}} known as Swaminarayan after the <b>mantra</b> he taught at a gathering, in Faneni, a {{fortnight}} {{after the death}} of Ramanand Swami. He gave his followers a new <b>mantra,</b> known as the Swaminarayan <b>mantra,</b> to repeat in their rituals: Swaminarayan. When chanting this <b>mantra,</b> some devotees went into samadhi (a form of meditation) This act is also called maha-samadhi ("great samadhi") and claimed that they could see their personal gods, even though they had no knowledge of Astanga Yoga. Swaminarayan also became known by the names Ghanshyam Maharaj, Shreeji Maharaj, Hari Krishna Maharaj and Shri Hari. As early as 1804, Swaminarayan, who was reported to have performed miracles, was described as a manifestation of God in the first work written by a disciple and paramhansa, Nishkulanand Swami. This work, the Yama Danda, was the first piece of literature written within the Swaminarayan sect.|$|E
50|$|Buhnemann {{notes that}} deity <b>mantras</b> are an {{essential}} part of Tantric compendia. The tantric <b>mantras</b> vary in their structure and length. Mala <b>mantras</b> are those <b>mantras</b> which have an enormous number of syllables. In contrast, bija <b>mantras</b> are one-syllabled, typically ending in anusvara (a simple nasal sound). These are derived from the name of a deity; for example, Durga yields dum and Ganesha yields gam. Bija <b>mantras</b> are prefixed and appended to other <b>mantras,</b> thereby creating complex <b>mantras.</b> In the tantric school, these <b>mantras</b> are believed to have supernatural powers, and they are transmitted by a preceptor to a disciple in an initiation ritual. Tantric <b>mantras</b> found a significant audience and adaptations in medieval India, Hindu Southeast Asia and numerous Asian countries with Buddhism.|$|R
50|$|Staal {{presents}} a non-linguistic view of <b>mantras.</b> He suggests that verse <b>mantras</b> are metered and harmonized to mathematical precision (for example, in the viharanam technique), which resonate, {{but a lot}} of them are a hodgepodge of meaningless constructs such as are found in folk music around the world. Staal cautions that there are many <b>mantras</b> that can be translated and do have spiritual meaning and philosophical themes central to Hinduism, but that does not mean all <b>mantras</b> have a literal meaning. He further notes that even when <b>mantras</b> do not have a literal meaning, they do set a tone and ambiance in the ritual as they are recited, and thus have a straightforward and uncontroversial ritualistic meaning. The sounds may lack literal meaning, but they can have an effect. He compares <b>mantras</b> to bird songs, that have the power to communicate, yet do not have a literal meaning. On that saman category of Hindu <b>mantras,</b> which Staal described as resembling the arias of Bach's oratorios and other European classics, he notes that these <b>mantras</b> have musical structure, but they almost always are completely different from anything in the syntax of natural languages. <b>Mantras</b> are literally meaningless, yet musically meaningful to Staal. The saman chant <b>mantras</b> were transmitted, from one Hindu generation to next, verbally for over 1000 years, but never written, and a feat suggests Staal that was made possible by the strict mathematical principles used in constructing the <b>mantras.</b> These saman chant <b>mantras</b> are also mostly meaningless, cannot be literally translated as Sanskrit or any Indian language, but nevertheless are beautiful in their resonant themes, variations, inversions, and distribution. They draw the devotee in. Staal is not the first person to view Hindu <b>mantras</b> in this manner. The ancient Hindu Vedic ritualist Kautsa was one of the earliest scholars to note that <b>mantras</b> are meaningless; their function is phonetic and syntactic, not semantic.|$|R

This mantra-based method of yoga, asserts Yogatattva, is suited for those with dull wit and incapable of practicing the other three types of yoga.|$|E

5|$|In Tantra, {{the fifty}} or fifty-one letters {{including}} vowels {{as well as}} consonants from A to Ksha, of the Devanagari alphabet itself, the Varnamala of bija, {{have been described as}} being the Matrikas themselves.

These letters combined make up syllables (pada) which are combined to make sentences (vakya) and it is of these elements that <b>mantra</b> is composed. It is believed that the power of <b>mantra</b> derives {{from the fact that the}} letters of the alphabet are in fact forms of the goddess.
