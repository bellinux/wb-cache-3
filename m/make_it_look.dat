It was renovated to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> {{as it was}} in the 1950s when Lennon lived there, and Ono paid a visit before it was opened to the public. Lennon's cousin, Michael Cadwallader, had advised the National Trust on how the house looked when the Smiths lived there.|$|E
5|$|The Wembley Stadium {{scene in}} the film 28 Weeks Later was {{actually}} filmed at the Millennium Stadium. Although the outside is footage of Wembley, the inside is all filmed in Cardiff. The effects team on the film edited the footage to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more like Wembley.|$|E
5|$|The mule, {{especially}} its fur, was intensely textured and detailed to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> visually rough and bristly, and the mule itself weary and worn. The same techniques {{were applied to}} the red and yellow adornments draped and hung over the animal.|$|E

5|$|Around 1800 three folly walls {{had been}} added to the {{existing}} ruined walls {{on the east side of}} the castle to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more impressive from Norton Priory, the home of SirRichard Brooke. One of these walls was demolished around 1906. During the Victorian era a sunken garden and two bowling greens were constructed within the castle enclosure. In 1977 the castle was leased to Halton Borough Council. In 1986–87 the site of the castle was excavated.|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{behaviour}} {{is found}} in cephalopods including the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, squid such as the Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea) and bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana), octopuses including the common octopus Octopus vulgaris and the Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Octopus macropus), and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, {{as a source for}} lighting.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{joined the}} Indian National Congress and was {{introduced}} to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party {{best known for his}} restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> Indian.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky {{and they wanted}} to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the truck}} Monk sees a broken Turkish figurine and remembers the vacuum bag was empty. He deduces that Teresa, while {{cleaning}} Merrigan's office, broke a figurine, which contained heroin. When Merrigan saw the broken figurine {{he realized that}} the vacuum bag was filled with heroin. When he found the drug on the vacuum bag, he killed Teresa. He spread the patient files and later he threw a rock at Dr. Kroger's house to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like the killer was one of Dr. Kroger's patients.|$|E

5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder {{were placed in the}} ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.|$|E
5|$|The boat chase {{was another}} scene that {{required}} very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing {{a few shots}} of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The Man Who Knew Too Much. In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in Quantum of Solace.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E

50|$|Like nearby Inchmickery, its {{profile and}} colour <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> {{like a small}} warship from a distanance. It was armed with coast defence guns from 1901 until 1906, and again from 1908 until the 1930s.|$|R
5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> {{like many of the}} exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.|$|E
5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (and McCain) would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E
5|$|Aside from humans, {{octopuses}} may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, {{and other}} cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behavior. An octopus may spend 40% {{of its time}} hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> as big and threatening as possible.|$|E

5|$|Central Saint Giles {{provides}} 66,090m² {{of floor}} space – almost {{double that of}} the old St Giles Court – split between two separate buildings. The 15-storey west block is for residential use, providing 109 flats of which 53 are designated as affordable. The much larger horseshoe-shaped eastern block, standing 11 storeys high, encircles a publicly accessible courtyard comprising 27% of the site's area. It provides 37,625m² of office space with {{by far the largest}} floor plates of any office block in the West End of London, with 4,000m² on all but the top two floors. At ground level, 2,276m² of space is available for retail outlets and restaurants. The block is irregularly shaped with recesses, projections and roof terraces intended to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> more interesting and to break up its bulk.|$|E
5|$|In the White House, Clinton placed donated {{handicrafts}} {{of contemporary}} American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating {{display in the}} state rooms. She oversaw {{the restoration of the}} Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II. Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> brighter. These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines. Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most. Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration {{at the turn of the}} 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised scene was to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>look</b> as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The scene was polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E
