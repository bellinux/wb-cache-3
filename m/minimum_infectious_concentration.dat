Our data showed that PEDV is infectious in an age-dependent manner with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs. Furthermore, it showed that, once an infection was established in pigs, the initial dose of PEDV administered did not affect the extent of fecal viral shedding, severity of histopathologic lesions, or magnitude of antibody titer subsequently developed. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results, designing a PEDV bioassay model, as well as emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms...|$|R

No vaccine is available, so {{controlling}} an ASF outbreak is highly dependent on zoosanitary measures, such as stamping out infected herds and quarantining of affected areas. Information on ASF transmission parameters could allow for more efficient application of outbreak control measures. Three transmission experiments were carried out to estimate the transmission parameters of two ASF virus isolates: Malta' 78 (in two doses) and Netherlands' 86. Different criteria were used for onset of infectiousness of infected pigs and moment of infection of contact pigs. The transmission rate (ß), estimated by a Generalized Linear Model, ranged from 0. 45 to 3. 63 per day. For the <b>infectious</b> period, a <b>minimum</b> {{as well as a}} maximum infectious period was determined, to account for uncertainties regarding infectiousness of persistently infected pigs. While the <b>minimum</b> <b>infectious</b> period ranged from 6 to 7 days, the average maximum infectious period ranged from approximately 20 to nearly 40 days. Estimates of the reproduction ratio (R) for the first generation of transmission ranged from 4. 9 to 24. 2 for the <b>minimum</b> <b>infectious</b> period and from 9. 8 to 66. 3 for the maximum infectious period, depending on the isolate.

Infectious material rafting on skin cell aerosols is an established means of transmitting other diseases.

While these findings support the hypothesis, this review is insufficient, in and of itself, to prove the hypothesis and specific follow-on experiments are proposed. If this hypothesis is validated, (i) new FMDV detection, management and decontamination approaches could be developed and (ii) the relevance of skin cells to the spread of viral disease may need to be reassessed as skin cells may protect viruses against otherwise adverse environmental conditions...|$|R

The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends influenza vaccination for everyone over 6 months of age. The failure of the flu vaccine in 2014 - 2015 demonstrates the need for a model that allows the rapid development of novel antivirals, universal/intra-seasonal vaccines, immunomodulators, monoclonal antibodies and other novel treatments. To this end we manufactured a new H 3 N 2 influenza virus in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice for use in the Human Viral Challenge Model. We chose an H 3 N 2 influenza subtype, rather than H 1 N 1, given that this strain has the most substantial impact in terms of morbidity or mortality annually as described by the Centre for Disease Control. We first subjected the virus batch to rigorous adventitious agent testing, confirmed the virus to be wild-type by Sanger sequencing and determined the virus titres appropriate for human use via the established ferret model. We built on our previous experience with other H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 1 viruses to develop this unique model. We conducted an initial safety and characterisation study in healthy adult volunteers, utilising our unique clinical quarantine facility in London, UK.

A total of 29, 285 individual midges covering at least 50 species were tested either in pools of maximum 50 females or individually (for Culicoides obsoletus/Culicoides scoticus) using real-time RT-PCR. Nine species were found SBV positive (C. obsoletus, C. scoticus, Culicoides chiopterus, Culicoides dewulfi, Culicoides imicola, Culicoides pulicaris, Culicoides newsteadi, Culicoides lupicaris and Culicoides nubeculosus) with overall MIR ranging from 0. 2 % to 4. 2 %. While the Culicoides nubeculosus laboratory strain is generally considered to have only low vector competence for viruses, interestingly, field-caught C. nubeculosus specimens were found positive twice for SBV. The first SBV-positive pool was recorded in August 2011 in north-eastern France, dating the virus circulation in France 5 months earlier than the first recorded congenital malformations and 2 months earlier than the former recorded date based on retrospective serological data. The MIR were maximum in October 2011, and in July 2012 according to dates of virus arrival in the studied areas.

The objective of the first experiment was to evaluate the <b>minimum</b> <b>infectious</b> dose of PEDV in virus-inoculated feed. Pigs became infected when PEDV concentrations at or above 5. 6 × 10 ¹ 50 % tissue culture infectious dose/g (TCID₅₀/g); corresponding feed cycle threshold (Ct) of 37 or below was utilized. Evaluation of a mitigation strategy for PEDV contaminated diets is also important since cross-contamination during feed manufacturing is possible. Therefore, the objective of the second experiment was to determine the effectiveness of feed batch sequencing as a method to minimize the risk of PEDV cross-contamination. This method was effective to reduce but not eliminate infectious PEDV carryover risk. Furthermore, feed that lacked detectible PEDV RNA as analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR assay (qPCR) was infectious. The third study was an observational study complementary to the previous experiment where the magnitude of virus contamination in the feed manufacturing facility was characterized during feed batch sequencing. Widespread contamination of the facility occurred and surfaces remained contaminated until chemically cleaned. The final experiment was conducted to assess PEDV RNA detection in feed and spray dried porcine plasma (SDPP) when analyzed by qPCR across 5 diagnostic laboratories. Overall, it appears qPCR PEDV RNA detection in feed and SDPP was precise as quantified by low coefficient of variation across laboratories, {{with the exception of one}} %CV from SDPP inoculated with low virus load from one laboratory. Although the magnitude of the Ct value difference was large in only 1 of 5 laboratories, comparisons of Ct values across laboratories should be interpreted cautiously. Finally, qPCR can be a useful surveillance tool for detection of PEDV RNA in non-clinical samples such as feed and SDPP...|$|R

Subinhibitory <b>concentrations</b> of antibiotics affect the adherence properties of microorganisms in various ways.

40|$|AbstractAnin vitromodel was {{developed}} to replicate hepatitis E virus (HEV) in normal primary cynomolgus macaque hepatocytes using a hormonally defined, serum-free medium formulation. Primary hepatocytes were infected in tissue culture following isolation by collagenase treatment of liver wedge biopsy material. Viral replication was monitored by a highly strand-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, which could detect the positive- and negative-strands of HEV RNA independently in a sensitive and specific manner. Several infectious HEV (Burma strain) inocula were titered by this RT-PCR assay, and a <b>minimum</b> effective <b>infectious</b> dose was determined. Appearance of newly replicated virus was demonstrated by detection of both strands of HEV RNA in experimentally infected hepatocytes {{as well as the}} genomic positive-strand viral RNA in the culture medium. Infectivity of the virus particles present in the media was confirmed by serial passage and replication of the virus in culture. Using thisin vitroinfection system, a neutralization assay {{was developed}} to assess the ability of anti-HEV antibodies to block virus infection of liver cells. Results presented in this report represent the firstin vitrodemonstration of a neutralizing anti-HEV antibody directed against the ORF 2 -encoded putative capsid protein...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibilities}} of the Reperen’s polymer implant use for a plasty of {{the base of the}} skull and dura mater defects are investigated. It is established, that a material fully responses to modern requirements to implants: biocompatibility, plasticity, possibility of sterilization, compatibility with the neurovisualization methods, stability to mechanical loads, a low level of thermo- and electro-conduction, an available cost, a <b>minimum</b> risk of <b>infectious</b> complications. The implants from Reperen permit to close a defect of dura mater and the base of the skull in majority of cases, encountered in neurosurgical practice. The peculiarities of the cranioplasty operation methods and the dura mater plasty, the indications and contraindications to their use are presented. The CT-tomograms, demonstrating the proximate results, are demonstrated. The complications in postoperative period are described and analyzed.

40|$|A {{membrane}} bioreactor (MBR) -based {{wastewater treatment plant}} in Saudi Arabia was assessed over a nine-month period for virus removal efficiency. Viral diversity was detected using omics-based approaches. Log reduction values (LRV) of Adenoviruses (AdV) and Enteroviruses (EV) were enumerated using digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) and assessed for infectivity using fluorescence-based infection assays. MBR treatment was successful in reducing viral diversity. Plant viruses remained abundant in the treated effluent. Human enteric viruses were present in lower abundance than plant viruses, and were reduced by MBR at varying LRV. AdV copy numbers were reduced by 3. 7 -log. Infectious AdV was not detected in the effluent. EV copy numbers were reduced by 1. 7 -log post MBR and infectious EV decreased {{by an average of}} 2. 0 -log. Infectious EV was detected in the chlorinated effluent, occasionally in concentrations that approximate to its 50 % infectious dose. Overall, results indicated that a MBR-based wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effectively reduces viral diversity, viral load, and infectious capacity by up to 4 -logs. These findings suggest potential concerns associated with plant and human enteric viruses for reuse events in this country. Local guidelines for assessment of treated water quality should take into consideration both <b>infectious</b> viral <b>concentration</b> and LRV...|$|R
40|$|For in vivo {{studies of}} {{influenza}} dynamics where within-host measurements are fit with a mathematical model, infectivity assays (e. g. 50 % tissue culture infectious dose; TCID 50) {{are often used}} to estimate the <b>infectious</b> virion <b>concentration</b> over time. Less frequently, measurements of the total (infectious and non-infectious) viral particle concentration (obtained using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; rRT-PCR) {{have been used as}} an alternative to infectivity assays. We investigated the degree to which measuring both infectious (via TCID 50) and total (via rRT-PCR) viral load allows within-host model parameters to be estimated with greater consistency and reduced uncertainty, compared with fitting to TCID 50 data alone. We applied our models to viral load data from an experimental ferret infection study. Best-fit parameter estimates for the "dual-measurement" model are similar to those from the TCID 50 -only model, with greater consistency in best-fit estimates across different experiments, as well as reduced uncertainty in some parameter estimates. Our results also highlight how variation in TCID 50 assay sensitivity and calibration may hinder model interpretation, as some parameter estimates systematically vary with known uncontrolled variations in the assay. Our techniques may aid in drawing stronger quantitative inferences from in vivo studies of influenza virus dynamics. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|Despite many sensational and intimidating {{reports in}} the mass media, {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases) are not contagious in the usual sense. Successful transmission requires both specific material (an affected individual's tissue, from or adjacent to CNS) and specific modes (mainly penetrating contact with the recipient). Nevertheless, specific safety precautions are mandatory to avoid accidental transmission and to decontaminate any infectivity. The autopsy is essential for definite diagnosis of these disorders. Recommendations are given here for safe performance of the autopsy, for neuropathology service and appropriate decontamination; {{they are based on}} the current literature and on precautions taken in most laboratories experienced in handling tissue from transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In essence, special care must be taken to avoid penetrating wounds, possible contamination should be kept to a <b>minimum,</b> and potentially <b>infectious</b> material must be adequately decontaminated by specific means.

40|$|Increasing {{efforts are}} made to {{establish}} mammalian cell culture as host system for the propagation of influenza viruses instead of embryonated hen’s eggs. Especially, considering the seasonal production of different virus subtypes and {{in case of a}} pandemic the flexibility of mammalian cell culture is advantageous. For process optimization comprehensive knowledge of physiological changes during cell growth and virus production is crucial. Therefore, cultivations of different adherent cell lines, in different bioreactors and process variations were investigated and compared. Pivotal parameters are the cell growth physiology, metabolism, viral infection and the release of viral particles. Cell growth physiology, represented by the cell cycle phase distributions was determined via DNA content measurements using flow cytometry. Influenza infection in the cultivated host cells was detected via fluorocrome-labelled monoclonal antibodies against intracellularly accumulated viral components and quantified cytometrically. Extracellular metabolic educts and products were quantified using a multiparametric enzyme sensor (Bioprofile). The tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50) for <b>infectious</b> virus <b>concentrations</b> was determined via immunotitration whereas the total virus particle concentration was measured with a hemagglutination assay. Results for the investigation of bioreactors, cell lines and process variations indicate differences in both cell cycle and virus propagation behaviour compared to a standard cultivation process. Based on insights on cell physiology inoculum preparation strategies could be optimized. The results obtained from cell cycle and infection studies were also used for the formulation of mathematical models, which supports process analysis and directed optimization...|$|R
