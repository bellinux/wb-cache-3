5|$|More than 586 {{species of}} {{resident}} and <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> have been categorised, including the crested serpent eagle, blossom-headed parakeet {{and the red}} junglefowl — ancestor of all domestic fowl. 33 species of reptiles, seven species of amphibians, seven species of fish and 36 species of dragonflies have also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|In general, ticks are to {{be found}} {{wherever}} their host species occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with them on their journeys; a study of <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> passing through Egypt found more than half the bird species examined were carrying ticks. The species of tick often differed between the autumn and spring migrations, probably because of the seasonal periodicities of the different species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Migratory</b> <b>birds</b> of the {{subspecies}} P. d. bactrianus in the P. d. indicus {{group were}} recorded overlapping with P. d. domesticus birds without hybridising in the 1970s, so the Soviet scientists Edward I. Gavrilov and M. N. Korelov proposed {{the separation of}} the P. d. indicus group as a separate species. However, P. d. indicus-group and P. d. domesticus-group birds intergrade in a large part of Iran, so this split is rarely recognised.|$|E
40|$|<b>Migratory</b> <b>bird</b> hunting {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in the Mediterranean, but remains a highly controversial issue.

We interviewed key informants and carried out participant observation on both legal and illegal <b>migratory</b> <b>bird</b> hunting and <b>migratory</b> <b>bird</b> protection, in four key <b>migratory</b> <b>bird</b> hunting sites in Italy. In many cases, both <b>migratory</b> <b>bird</b> hunters and bird protection activists consider themselves as the stewards of nature. Environmentalists accuse hunters of illegal practices, while hunters believe anti-poaching activists aim to threaten the existence of hunting itself. Yet surprisingly, the legality of specific hunting practices emerges as peripheral to the concerns of both groups.

5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{can be held}} in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act only allows this {{in the case of}} animals which are injured or unable to return to the wild. It {{receives}} special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States, by the Convention for the Protection of <b>Migratory</b> <b>Birds</b> in Canada, and by the Convention for the Protection of <b>Migratory</b> <b>Birds</b> and Game Mammals in Mexico. In the United States it is illegal to take, kill, or possess black vultures and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US$15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations.|$|E
5|$|The river {{system has}} also long {{been home to}} bird life. The {{negative}} effects of human development have not as significantly affected birds as fish due to the more limited changes to bird habitat (which includes the forests which still remain on surrounding mountains). There are more than 130 species of birds which frequent the river system, these include starlings and ducks as well as <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> such as cranes and ibis.|$|E
5|$|Though exotic birds such as parrots and parakeets {{are also}} found in the Everglades, their impact is negligible. Conversely, perhaps the animal that causes the most damage to native {{wildlife}} is the domestic or feral cat. Across the U.S., cats are responsible for approximately a billion bird deaths annually. They are estimated to number 640 per square mile; cats living in suburban areas have devastating effects on <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> and marsh rabbits.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{protected}} parks and bird sanctuaries in the ISR. There are five parks: Aulavik National Park, Herschel Island Territorial Park, Ivvavik National Park, Pingo National Landmark, and Tuktut Nogait National Park. There are also four bird sanctuaries: Anderson River Delta <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Sanctuary, Banks Island No. 1 Bird Sanctuary, Cape Perry <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Sanctuary, and Kendall Island <b>Migratory</b> <b>Bird</b> Sanctuary ...|$|R
5|$|Wildlife in {{this park}} include the pronghorn, black bear, coyote, muskrat, six species of lizard, cougar, raccoon, beaver, elk, river otter, bobcat, and mule deer. In addition, the canyon {{is the home}} of a number of {{resident}} birds including the American dipper, two species of eagle, eight species of hawk, six species of owl, and Steller's jay as well as <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> such as the mountain bluebird, peregrine falcon, magpie, white-throated swift and canyon wren.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{migration}} {{has been}} recorded as much as 3,000 years ago by Ancient Greek authors including Homer and Aristotle, and in the Book of Job, for species such as storks, turtle doves, and swallows. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and scientific studies have used techniques including bird ringing and satellite tracking. Threats to <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.|$|E
5|$|More than 330 {{species of}} birds were {{recorded}} in the Bahrain archipelago, 26 species of which breed in the country. Millions of <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> pass through the Persian Gulf region {{in the winter and}} autumn months. One globally endangered species, Chlamydotis undulata, is a regular migrant in the autumn. The many islands and shallow seas of Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the Socotra cormorant; up to 100,000 pairs of these birds were recorded over the Hawar islands.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the network}} of National Wildlife Refuges (NWR), the Tualatin River refuge {{is one of only}} ten urban refuges in the United States. Habitats in the refuge include forested areas, wetlands, oak and pine grassland, and meadows, with mixed {{deciduous}} and coniferous forests common to Western Oregon. The refuge was established as an urban refuge to provide wetland, riparian, and upland habitats for a variety of <b>migratory</b> <b>birds,</b> threatened and endangered species, fish and other resident wildlife. The refuge is home to nearly 200 bird species and more than 70 other animal species.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian {{paralysis}} tick, are also intrinsically venomous {{and can cause}} tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> may act as reservoirs and vectors of infectious diseases. Over twenty strains of pathogenic virus were found in the autumn in the Egyptian migratory bird study.|$|E
5|$|The mallard usually feeds by dabbling {{for plant}} food or grazing; {{there are reports}} of it eating frogs. However, in 2017 a flock of mallards in Romania were {{observed}} hunting small <b>migratory</b> <b>birds,</b> including grey wagtail and black redstart, the first documented occasion they had been seen attacking and consuming large vertebrates. It usually nests on a river bank, but not always near water. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks, which are known as sords.|$|E

5|$|Triglycerides, {{stored in}} adipose tissue, {{are a major}} form of energy storage both in animals and plants. The adipocyte, or fat cell, is {{designed}} for continuous synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in animals, with breakdown controlled mainly by the activation of hormone-sensitive enzyme lipase. The complete oxidation of fatty acids provides high caloric content, about 9kcal/g, compared with 4kcal/g for the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. <b>Migratory</b> <b>birds</b> that must fly long distances without eating use stored energy of triglycerides to fuel their flights.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{were among}} the wild animals hunted for food before the Neolithic {{revolution}} {{and the development of}} agriculture. For example, in the Epipaleolithic of the Levant, between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both waterfowl and <b>migratory</b> <b>birds</b> were eaten. Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.|$|E
