50|$|The Post & Telegraph Department {{erected a}} {{telegraph}} line between Woodville and Wellington via Masterton in 1897 {{for the use}} of the Railways Department. It was intended to install <b>Morse</b> <b>telegraphy</b> equipment in existing Railways Department offices along the line, but in the case of Mauriceville it was noted that there was insufficient space to do so. Additional space was requested for the new equipment, as well as the construction of a sound-proof telephone box to provide privacy for the transmission of telegrams.|$|E

He has been a licensed amateur radio operator (call sign K4CQA) since 1955, and has contacted thousands of fellow 'hams' in 100 countries using <b>Morse</b> code <b>telegraphy.</b> Also since 1955 {{he has been a}} licensed commercial broadcast radio operator, and worked in broadcast radio as announcer and engineer.|$|R
50|$|Between July and September 1935, he {{undertook}} training near Kladow, near Berlin in <b>Morse</b> <b>Telegraphy</b> (Wireless telegraphy), German cryptographic {{procedures and}} radio communications. In October 1935, he posted to a fixed intercept station of the Army at Stuttgart until January 1936. During his time there, he translated plain-language radio messages from French Army and Air Force. In addition, he was employed on evaluation and traffic analysis. Between March and April 1936, {{he was ordered}} to a two months maneuver employed as an airborne radio operators with KG254 in Kitzingen. His grade during this time was Officer candidate.|$|E
5000|$|Facilities {{provided}} at Mauriceville included a small station building, measuring 11.5 by 9.5 ft, a platform, goods shed, and loading bank. Just 11 years after opening, it was remarked that [...] "the office is not {{large enough to}} properly conduct the work already transacted", a problem that was only exacerbated that year when <b>Morse</b> <b>telegraphy</b> equipment was installed. Extensions to the building were called for in 1898 when the installation of a telephone booth was requested, and again in 1900 when additional accommodation for parcels was required. Further alterations were required in 1907 when tablet instruments were installed. The loading bank was reconstructed in 1925.|$|E
5000|$|By 1920, the {{technology}} had evolved {{to the point}} where voice and music could be transmitted as well as <b>Morse</b> <b>telegraphy,</b> and several radio stations began to broadcast regular programs of music and news. In 1920, Eunice Randall (1898-1982), an employee of The American Radio and Research Company, or AMRAD, became an engineer and announcer for the AMRAD radio station, 1XE. Her interest in radio had begun at the age of nineteen, when she built her own amateur radio equipment and operated with the call sign 1CDP. In addition to her technical duties at 1XE, which included repairing equipment and occasionally climbing the transmitting tower, she read stories for children as [...] "The Story Lady," [...] and gave the police report over the air.|$|E

5000|$|In 1888, Dodge {{restructured}} {{the school}} as the Dodge School of Telegraphy, retaining the link to the Normal School. In 1891, Dodge and F. R. Lunbeck reorganized the school. It began to gain students and became the largest telegraph and railway instruction institution in the United States and later became known as [...] "The Dodge Institute of Telegraphy". George A. Dodge managed the school until 1891, when his son, George M. Dodge assumed active control. Like his father, George M {{had served as a}} telegraph operator for the Pennsylvania railroad. In 1888, George A. became the Valparaiso manager for the Western Union Telegraph Company, serving for more than forty years The Dodge school has always taught <b>Morse</b> <b>telegraphy</b> and has enjoyed the distinction of being the foremost Morse telegraph training school. In December 1909, wireless instruction was added (the term [...] "radio" [...] was not in use), the growth of the radio (wireless) department since then has been almost miraculous.|$|E
50|$|For these reasons, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations agency {{specializing in}} safety of {{shipping}} and preventing ships from polluting the seas, began looking at ways of improving maritime distress and safety communications. In 1979, {{a group of}} experts drafted the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, which called for development of a global search and rescue plan. This group also passed a resolution calling for development by IMO of a Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) to provide the communication support needed to implement the search and rescue plan. This new system, which the world's maritime nations are implementing, is based upon a combination of satellite and terrestrial radio services, and has changed international distress communications from being primarily ship-to-ship based to ship-to-shore (Rescue Coordination Center) based. It spelled the end of Morse code communications for {{all but a few}} users, such as amateur radio operators. The GMDSS provides for automatic distress alerting and locating in cases where a radio operator doesn't have time to send an SOS or MAYDAY call, and, for the first time, requires ships to receive broadcasts of maritime safety information which could prevent a distress from happening in the first place. In 1988, IMO amended the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, requiring ships subject to it fit GMDSS equipment. Such ships were required to carry NAVTEX and satellite EPIRBs by August 1, 1993, and had to fit all other GMDSS equipment by February 1, 1999. US ships were allowed to fit GMDSS in lieu of <b>Morse</b> <b>telegraphy</b> equipment by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.|$|E
5000|$|The R {{stands for}} [...] "Readability". Readability is a {{qualitative}} {{assessment of how}} easy or {{difficult it is to}} correctly copy the information being sent during the transmission. In a <b>Morse</b> code <b>telegraphy</b> transmission, readability refers to how easy or difficult it is to distinguish each of the characters in the text of the message being sent; in a voice transmission, readability refers to how easy or difficult it is for each spoken word to be understood correctly. Readability is measured on a scale of 1 to 5.|$|R
50|$|Packet {{radio is}} a digital radio {{communications}} mode. Earlier digital modes were <b>telegraphy</b> (<b>Morse</b> code), teleprinter (Baudot code) and facsimile.

50|$|The initial {{training}} centres of the SOE were at country houses such as Wanborough Manor, Guildford. Agents destined {{to serve in}} the field underwent commando training at Arisaig in Scotland, where they were taught armed and unarmed combat skills by William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes, former Inspectors in the Shanghai Municipal Police. They then attended courses in security and Tradecraft at Group B schools around Beaulieu in Hampshire. Finally, they received specialist training in skills such as demolition techniques or <b>Morse</b> code <b>telegraphy</b> at various country houses in England and parachute training (if necessary) by STS 51 and 51a situated near Altrincham, Cheshire with the assistance of No.1 Parachute Training School RAF, at RAF Ringway (which later became Manchester Airport).|$|R
50|$|In March 1939, Florence Violet McKenzie {{set up the}} Women's Emergency Signalling Corps (WESC) as {{wireless}} telegraphy organisation for female volunteers. McKenzie established the WESC because {{of the threat of}} war, and her belief that training women in wireless <b>telegraphy,</b> <b>morse</b> code, and related skills meant they could free up men for military service. By August 1940, there was a waiting list of 600 women for the small school, and WESC-trained telegraphists were teaching men from the armed forces and merchant navy.|$|R
2500|$|Alan Turing's work preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it {{is unknown}} whether Stibitz knew {{of the work of}} Turing. Turing's biographer {{believed}} that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: [...] "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'". Given the prevalence of <b>Morse</b> code and <b>telegraphy,</b> ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we might conjecture that all were influences.|$|R
5000|$|A male amateur radio {{operator}} can {{be referred to}} as an OM, an abbreviation used in <b>Morse</b> code <b>telegraphy</b> for [...] "old man", regardless of the operator's age. A female amateur {{radio operator}} {{can be referred to}} as a YL, from the abbreviation used for [...] "young lady", regardless of the operator's age. XYL was once used by amateur radio operators to refer to an unlicensed woman, usually the wife of a male amateur radio operator; today, the term has come to mean any female spouse of an amateur radio operator, licensed or not. Sometimes the wife of a ham operator is called a YF (wife). Although these codes are derived from English language abbreviations, their use is common among amateur radio operators worldwide. Incidentally, the most common language heard in the HF amateur bands (the bands below 30 MHz that support worldwide communications) is English.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{intelligence}} disciplines, especially technical ones, {{will analyze}} the same raw data {{in different ways}} for complementary purposes. For example, a signals intelligence collection platform will record all the electromagnetic signals it received from an antenna pointed to a particular target at a particular time. Assuming the target was radar, the ELINT analysts would {{be focused on the}} purpose and coverage of the radar. The MASINT analysts, however, would be looking for patterns not in the intentional signals of the radar or side frequencies that were inadvertently generated. In the same manner, if the target was a voice communication, the COMINT specialists would concentrate on the content of the message, but acoustic MASINT technicians might [...] "voice print" [...] the spoken words to validate that it was really from the supposed source. While <b>Morse</b> code <b>telegraphy</b> is largely obsolete, each operator has a distinct rhythm known as a [...] "fist". Experienced telegraph intercept operators can recognize radio deception when the fist failed to match the purported operator identity.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedGREED is a three-movement tone poem {{inspired}} by the events {{that led up to}} and triggered the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009. The overarching form of the piece, the durations of each movement, and subsequent sections of each movement were created according to the Fibonacci Series and the Golden Mean. Each movement describes the three major events of the financial crisis: BOOM, BUBBLE, and COLLAPSE. Each movement musically depicts the causes and consequences of the financial crisis. The causes depicted in the work are: the rise of the shadowbanks, easy access to credit, deregulation, speculation, incorrect pricing of risk, predatory lending, credit default swaps, credit default obligations, subprime loans, speculation, debt and mortgage backed securities.; In addition to the causes, the names of the major players in the crisis have been incorporated, including Alan Greenspan, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, AIG, HUD, Bank of America, Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac, the SEC, the FED, and Congress.; All of the above listed elements were created through an extensive use of motivic and melodic materials developed by using a musical alphabet created especially for this work.

5000|$|When {{developed}} in the mid-1800s, <b>Morse</b> code <b>telegraphy</b> was first used for signaling over wires and underwater cables. With the introduction of wireless (radio) by Guglielmo Marconi in the early 1900s Morse code was quickly adapted to the new radio technology giving rise to radiotelegraphy. Morse code's channel code, known as on-off keying or OOK modulation, is also known in modern channel code parlance as unipolar encoding. Unipolar encoding is the simplest form of amplitude modulation (AM) composed of only two amplitudes; the two amplitudes known generically as [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off". The [...] "off" [...] state is simply a no-signal silent period the [...] "on" [...] state is simply a full power signal. Signaling using OOK by keying a single frequency radio carrier, as opposed to using damped transient oscillations triggered by spark gaps as originally developed by Marconi, historically then became known as continuous wave or simply CW signaling instead of spark; the nomenclature CW being inappropriate as it happens, since the keyed radio carrier is certainly not continuous because of the ubiquitous silent periods present in the OOK modulation generated by the Morse code! Historically CW has also been known as wireless telegraphy (W/T), or simply as radiotelegraphy. Modern era radio amateurs (hams) usually refer {{to the use of}} keyed carrier Morse code simply as [...] "CW". It is the presence of the ubiquitous silent (off) periods in CW that is {{the most important aspect of}} the Morse code OOK modulation code that provides the [...] "listen while sending" [...] support for so-called QSK operation.|$|R
