5|$|Seattle in {{this period}} {{attracted}} widespread attention as home to these many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993, {{as well as through}} the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that had developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention—hosting the World Trade Organization <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Conference</b> of 1999—garnered visibility, but not in the way its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself. The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots in 2001, and then literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually earthquake.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ministerial</b> <b>Conferences</b> are {{the core}} of the FOREST EUROPE process. At these meetings, the ministers in charge of forest related issues in the pan-European region commit {{themselves}} and endorse decisions on forests a forestry related issues. Between <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Conferences</b> the FOREST EUROPE process works through different follow up mechanisms (see following points).|$|R
50|$|The {{process is}} based on the <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Conferences</b> that have been convened with an {{interval}} of 3 to 5 years. These Conferences represent the highest decision-making body of the process, as well as its most important event. At <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Conferences,</b> the ministers responsible for forests in Europe take decisions on issues of highest political and social relevance regarding forests and forestry through decisions and resolutions. Between <b>ministerial</b> <b>conferences,</b> the Expert Level Meeting (ELM) is a decision-making body of FOREST EUROPE. On top of that, ad hoc Round Table Meetings, Working Groups, Seminars and Workshops are being established to work on specific subjects of scientific, technical or political nature.|$|R

5|$|A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the {{organization}} had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets {{appeared to be}} oversupplied by at least 2 {{million barrels per day}} despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next <b>ministerial</b> <b>conference</b> in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{little was}} agreed upon and the {{agreement}} was later interpreted differently by its signatories, the Brioni Agreement established the EC's interest {{in the region and}} the first EC <b>Ministerial</b> <b>Conference</b> on Yugoslavia was held in The Hague on 10 July.

In Croatia, armed combat continued and the JNA shelled the city of Osijek the same evening {{the agreement was}} signed. The federal presidency ordered the complete withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia on 18 July in response to Slovene actions in breach of the Brioni Agreement. The ECMM's scope of work was expanded to include Croatia on 1 September. By mid-September, the war had escalated as the Croatian National Guard and police blockaded the JNA barracks and the JNA embarked on a campaign against Croatian forces.|$|E
