5|$|Some {{opposition}} parties supported the protests' plans, while {{others did not}} explicitly call for demonstration. However, they demanded deep reforms and changes similar to those by the youth. Before the start of protests, the government introduced a number {{of economic and political}} concessions. The protests started with a sit-in in solidarity with the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 {{in the vicinity of the}} Egyptian embassy in the capital, <b>Manama</b> ten days before the 'Day of Rage'. On the eve of 14 February, security forces dispersed hundreds of protesters south of <b>Manama.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Bahrain Thirteen {{played an}} {{important}} role in mobilizing the public opinion against the government, organizing protests and shaping political demands. Some of the group were already in detention when the uprising began, having been arrested in the <b>Manama</b> incident the previous August, and were released on 22 February 2011. Abdulwahab Hussain and Hassan Mushaima, leaders of opposition parties Al Wafa' and Haq Movement respectively, were among the leaders of the 1990s uprising in Bahrain.|$|E

On 9 March, thousands protested near <b>Manama's</b> immigration office against naturalizing foreigners and recruiting them in security forces.|$|R
5|$|Troops {{withdrew from}} the Pearl Roundabout on 19 February, and protesters {{reestablished}} their camps there. The crown prince assured protesters {{that they would be}} allowed to camp at the roundabout and that he would lead a national dialogue. Protests involving up to one-fifth of the population continued over the next month until the government called in Gulf Cooperation Council troops and police and declared a three-month state of emergency. Despite the police crackdown that followed, smaller-scale protests and clashes continued, mostly outside <b>Manama's</b> business districts.

5|$|Tamarod and Al Wefaq {{opposition}} society {{praised the}} protests {{and said they}} were successful. The government of Bahrain however said protests did not affect everyday life. The United States said it supported freedom of expression and assembly, and voiced its concern at the chances of violence. Analysts were divided between those who expected protests to be huge and those that did not see them having any chance. They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in <b>Manama,</b> some blaming it on the security forces, others on protest organizers.|$|E
5|$|Tamarod is {{reported}} to have gained popularity among the opposition since mid-July, prompting the United States Embassy in <b>Manama</b> to eventually issue a warning for U.S. citizens to avoid certain areas in Bahrain on 14 August. The selected areas were mostly opposition strongholds. For weeks, the government was reported to have intensified its house raids and arrests against over five hundred wanted activists, many of them sleeping outside their homes for months in anticipation of such raids.|$|E

Amnesty International designated her a prisoner of conscience [...] "detained solely for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and assembly", and called for her immediate release. She was released from detention on 21 February. She stated {{she had not been}} mistreated while in detention, attributing it to the government's fear of [...] "bad media" [...] rather than respect of prisoners' rights.|$|R
5000|$|The 1990s saw growing {{criticism}} {{of the lack of}} democratic reforms. The unrest resulted in approximately forty deaths and ended after Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa became the Emir in 1999. The emir appointed a 30-member Consultative Council for a four-year term in December 1992. Demonstrations followed the arrest of Shia cleric, Sheikh Ali Salman, on 5 December 1994 after he called for the restoration of the National Assembly and criticised the ruling family. A group of youths clashed with police after throwing stones at female runners during an international marathon for running bare-legged. In January 1995, Sheikh Ali Salman was deported and sought asylum in Britain. A cabinet reshuffle in June 1995, brought five Shia ministers into the government. Shia cleric, Sheikh Abdul Amir al-Jamri, arrested in April 1995, was released five months later. After bomb explosions in <b>Manama's</b> business quarter, Al-Jamri was arrested again on 18 January 1996. A Sunni lawyer and poet, Ahmad al-Shamlan, was also detained on 8 February, but released in April. In June 1996, the government claimed it had uncovered another Iranian-backed coup plot by a group called [...] "Hezbollah-Bahrain". Bahrain recalled its ambassador to Iran and downgraded its representation to chargé d'affaires level. In September 1996 the Consultative Council was increased from 30 to 40 members.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Qur'anic schools (Kuttab) were the only form of education in Bahrain. They were traditional schools aimed at teaching children and youth the reading of the Qur'an. After World War I, Bahrain became open to western influences, and a demand for modern educational institutions appeared. 1919 marked {{the beginning}} of modern public school system in Bahrain when the Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia School for boys opened in Muharraq. In 1926, the Education Committee opened the second public school for boys in <b>Manama,</b> and in 1928 the first public school for girls was opened in Muharraq. , there are a total of 126,981 students studying in public schools.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 20 March 2011, a group of 20 to 25 masked men, some armed with rifles and {{accompanied}} by dozens of uniformed Bahraini security forces, broke into Rajab's house. Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him {{into the back of a}} vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of <b>Manama.</b> After being briefly questioned about someone he did not know, he was released.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} days protests intensified, {{moving to the}} Royal Court in Riffa, a royal palace in Safiriyya and finally blocking roads leading to the financial district in <b>Manama.</b> Security forces clashed with protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets, but police were overwhelmed by protesters. The government then requested help from neighbor countries, which sent about 1,500 security forces to assist the government. A state of emergency was declared and the government launched a crackdown campaign to put down protests by force. The Pearl Roundabout, now cleared of protesters, was torn down by government and protesters found themselves pushed back into their villages. The government arrested over 1,000 protesters including leading opposition and rights activists (known as the Bahrain Thirteen) as well as sportsmen, academics, businessmen, doctors, engineers, journalists and teachers.|$|E
5|$|On 18 February, over 50,000 {{participated in}} the {{funerals}} of crackdown victims. One was held in Al Daih, another in Karzakan. The largest however, was in Sitra. At about 4:46 in the afternoon, about a thousand protesters, most of them young men who participated in Al Daih funeral of Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima marched toward <b>Manama,</b> defying the government ban on gatherings. By 5:18 they had reached a road junction; to the right was Salmaniya hospital {{and to the left}} Pearl Roundabout. They turned left after a short pause. On their way, they clashed with riot police who withdrew from the site. Protesters continued their march removing barriers set by police a day ago.|$|E
5|$|The day of 14 August {{witnessed}} heavy {{deployment of}} security forces, which used {{tear gas and}} birdshot against hundreds-to-thousands of protesters who gathered in several locations throughout the country. Many shops were closed in response to Tamarod's call for a general strike. Opposition activists and media reported over 60 demonstrations throughout the country. The opposition and several citizens accused authorities of cutting Internet connections. The government blocked a website covering the protests, but activists and citizen journalists provided live coverage on social media websites, and Anonymous targeted a government website. At least twenty protesters were arrested and ten injured, two critically, activists said. The tightened security measures have succeeded in preventing large-scale protests in <b>Manama.</b> On 15 and 16 August, smaller protests occurred in several locations which police dispersed without injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern art}} {{movement}} in the country officially emerged in the 1950s, culminating {{in the establishment of}} an art society. Expressionism and surrealism, as well as calligraphic art are the popular forms of art in the country. Abstract expressionism has gained popularity in recent decades. Pottery-making and textile weaving are also popular products that were widely made in Bahraini villages. Arabic calligraphy grew in popularity as the Bahraini government was an active patron in Islamic art, culminating in the establishment of an Islamic museum, Beit Al Quran. The Bahrain national museum houses a permanent contemporary art exhibition. The architecture of Bahrain {{is similar to that of}} its neighbours in the Persian Gulf. The wind tower, which generates natural ventilation in a house, is a common sight on old buildings, particularly in the old districts of <b>Manama</b> and Muharraq.|$|E
