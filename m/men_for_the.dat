5|$|Based on this information, Frost {{decided to}} divide the company into five groups of forty <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> raid, each named after a famous Royal Navy admiral: 'Nelson', 'Jellicoe', 'Hardy', 'Drake' and 'Rodney'. 'Nelson' would clear and secure German {{positions}} defending the evacuation beach, whilst 'Jellicoe', 'Hardy' and 'Drake' would capture the radar site, villa and the enclosure. 'Rodney' was the reserve formation, placed between the radar site and the main likely enemy approach to block any counterattack.|$|E
5|$|Berger {{had been}} remarkably successful, despite the {{obstacles}} placed {{in his path}} by the Wehrmacht, having recruited nearly 60,000 <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Waffen-SS between mid-January {{and the end of}} June. These fresh troops were more than sufficient to replace those released when Himmler demobilised several categories of SS reservists in late July. But Himmler knew that the future of the Waffen-SS was assured; Hitler was already considering invading the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Both {{forces were}} {{composed}} of troops from several states and lands, including numerous mercenaries; for example, Bohemian mercenaries fought on each side. The knights also invited guest crusaders. Twenty-two different peoples, mostly Germanic, joined them. Teutonic recruits included soldiers from Westphalia, Frisia, Austria, Swabia and Stettin (Szczecin). Two Hungarian nobles, Nicholas II Garay and Stibor of Stiboricz, brought 200 <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Knights, but support from Sigismund of Hungary was disappointing.|$|E

5|$|Endecott's warrant was {{followed}} by an order issued by King Charles in March and received by Endecott in May 1661 containing a direct order to apprehend the two fugitives and ship them back to England. Endecott dutifully obeyed, but he appointed two recently arrived Royalists to track them down. Somewhat predictably, their search came up empty, and Whalley and Goffe thus escaped. Biographer Lawrence Mayo suggests Endecott would have appointed different <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> search had he been serious about catching them.|$|E
5|$|Fiorentina had {{chances to}} equalise {{in the second}} half, with a long shot from {{substitute}} Matías Fernández tipped over the crossbar by Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina, and Iličić missing a one-on-one. The team also brought on Rossi in place of Joaquín after 72 minutes, his first action since his injury in January. Despite being reduced to ten <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last ten minutes after a second booking for Gökhan Inler after he fouled Iličić, Napoli extended their lead in injury time when substitute Mertens scored a third after being set up by Callejón.|$|E

Las Casas arrived off Triunfo de la Cruz as Olid was making preparations to attack Gil González Dávila, who was in the Naco valley.|$|E

5|$|In June 1864, Brandon was {{promoted}} to brigadier general and sent to Mississippi where, on 23 July, he was given command of the Reserve Corps of Mississippi. He was later placed {{in charge of the}} Confederate Bureau of Conscription on 8 October 1864, where he worked to recruit <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Confederate army. After the war, Brandon returned to his Arcole Plantation in Wilkinson County, where despite his age and physical disability, he worked until his death on October 8, 1890. Brandon was buried at his plantation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{congregation}} {{could still be}} assured of the required quorum of ten <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> minyan during the week, as local businessmen attended the morning and evening prayers before opening and after closing their shops. By 1996, however, the membership was down to around two dozen, and Spiegel began holding services in the small social hall in the basement, as the main sanctuary had become too expensive to maintain.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not clear}} how the fight started, with reports of it either being started by Leeds fans {{throwing}} beer glasses and insulting the Turkish flag, or being started by Galatasaray fans throwing chairs. Police arrested Ali Umit Demir and three other <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stabbings. Demir was later found guilty of murder {{and was sentenced to}} 15 years imprisonment. As a result of the stabbings, Leeds United banned Galatasaray fans from attending the second leg at Elland Road, claiming that the safety of fans could not be guaranteed. The ban was supported by UEFA and only 80 tickets were issued to Galatasaray for officials and representatives of the Turkish government.|$|E

5|$|The French army {{of around}} 69,000 {{consisted}} of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns. Napoleon had used conscription {{to fill the}} ranks of the French army throughout his rule, but he did not conscript <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1815 campaign. His troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their Emperor. The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured heavy cavalry, and seven of highly versatile lancers who were armed with lances, sabres and firearms.|$|E
5|$|The man {{selected}} {{to lead the}} Commando force was Lieutenant Colonel Charles Newman; his No. 2 Commando would provide the largest Commandos contingent, 173 <b>men,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> raid. The Special Service Brigade headquarters used the raid to provide experience for their other units and 92 men were drawn from Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 12 Commandos.|$|E

5|$|As {{the players}} took {{the field for}} the second half, D.C. coach Tom Soehn decided to replace Fred, who had been a non-factor in the first half, with Santino Quaranta. In the 60th minute, Gomez, Pontius and Luciano Emilio {{combined}} inside Seattle's 18-yard box for a United opportunity, but Pontius mishit the shot, which resulted in an easy save for Seattle's goalkeeper, Kasey Keller. Seven minutes later, another failed D.C. United opportunity resulted in a Sounders FC counterattack, where Freddie Ljungberg's shot was saved by Wicks. The rebound rolled in front of Fredy Montero, who dove feet first and kicked the ball into the goal, giving Sounders FC a 1–0 lead. Following the goal, frustrated D.C. United goalkeeper Josh Wicks stomped on Montero's leg while he was still on the ground. After consulting with the fourth official, referee Alex Prus showed Wicks a red card for his behavior, dismissing him from the match. United's backup goalkeeper, Milos Kocic, was substituted for Christian Gomez after the incident, and D.C. played with 10 <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the match.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui dynasty, Yang, the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane. The main reason was the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. Coupled with natural disasters, the conscription of more and more <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> war and the hoarding of scarce grain reserves for the army's needs increased provincial discontent. As a result, from 611 on, rural revolts broke out across the empire, and with the Emperor's prestige and legitimacy diminished by military failure, ambitious provincial magnates were encouraged to challenge his rule. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, and only as unrest spread within the empire and the powerful Eastern Turks turned hostile, did he realize {{the gravity of the}} situation: in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E
5|$|In July 1095, Urban {{turned to}} his {{homeland}} of France to recruit <b>men</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. There are five versions of the speech recorded by {{people who may have}} been at the council (Baldric of Dol, Guibert of Nogent, Robert the Monk, and Fulcher of Chartres) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the Gesta Francorum), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus {{it is difficult to know}} what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.|$|E
