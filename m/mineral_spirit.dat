50|$|Safety: Sansodor is odorless {{but should}} be used in a well {{ventilated}} areas at all times. Sansodor as an Odorless <b>Mineral</b> <b>Spirit</b> (OMS) is just as toxic as regular <b>Mineral</b> <b>Spirit</b> even though the aromatic components has been removed. OMS is a hydrocarbon that evaporates entirely and always produces toxic fumes. Sansodor also has a higher personal exposure limit (OSHA TLV of 300 ppm) compared to turpentine (a TLV of 100 ppm), or three times less hazardous than turpentine. Sansodor also has a slower evaporation rate than turpentine which makes it safer than turpentine in terms of inhalation risks. Sansodor because it is a form of petroleum hydrocarbon is volatile in high temperatures (it has a flash point of 174 degrees fahrenheit) so care should be taken to store it in a cool place.|$|E

5000|$|Application: Sansodor is {{a highly}} refined odorless <b>mineral</b> <b>spirit</b> {{that is used to}} dilute (thin) artists' oil paints and is also used to dilute oil media (linseed oils, alkyd media, etc.). To conform to the [...] "fat over lean" [...] rule in oil painting, Sansodor should be {{considered}} a [...] "lean" [...] medium (although, technically it is a thinner) and, therefore, used mostly in the initial layers of a painting. The addition of [...] "fat" [...] media like alkyd (faster drying) and linseed (slower drying) are progressively added into the subsequent layers of the painting in conformance to the [...] "fat over lean" [...] rule. Another guideline to follow is to use faster drying media (like alkyd) in the lower layers of the painting and use slower drying media (like linseed) in the later layers to ensure the bottom layers dry first. Although Sansodor can be used to reduce the viscosity of these media (thick media like stand oil and alkyds) to increase their flow, it should never exceed 50% of any oil paint medium mixture to ensure proper pigment bonding.|$|E
5000|$|Once major {{structural}} treatments {{have been}} performed and the gesso layer stabilized, {{it is necessary to}} assess the bole layer of the frame. Bole is a mixture of colored clay, glue size, and fat, which is applied on the frame as a base coat for the gilding [...] Typically, the bole layer, which is either red or gray, is revealed in the points of contact of the frame where the gilding has worn off. The color of the bole layer must be closely matched to that of the original bole, as the bole affects the overall tone of the frame.It is essential to determine which gilding process was used before proceeding with the in-gilding process. The two common gilding processes are water gilding and oil gilding. The difference in the two processes is in adhesive coating base. Water gilding is the traditional, more difficult method, which must be cleaned using a <b>mineral</b> <b>spirit</b> or denatured alcohol. Oil gilding can be cleaned with a mild water based soap solution.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} three customized gels on a 19 th century panel painting {{for the removal of}} its degraded natural resin varnish from a water-gilded surface and a complex solvent-sensitive stratigraphic construction over the gilded substrate. At first, the varnish was unsoiled with a typical hydrogel that was composed of an aqueous phase buffered at pH 5. 5 with sodium acetate, poly(ethylene glycol) p-(1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethylbutyl) -phenyl ether surfactant and hydroxy-prorylmethyl cellulose. The removal of the entire aged varnish was facilitated with a microemulsion of an aqueous phase buffered at pH 8. 5 with triethanolaminate, a fatty phase of a <b>mineral</b> <b>spirit</b> - benzyl alcohol solution and a polyoxy-ethylene(23) lauryl ether surfactant, altogether incorporated in a viscous gel generated from the dissolution of a polyacrylic acid in poly(oxy- 1, 2 -ethanediyl) cocoalkylamine surfactant. The third gel, which was based on a polyacrylic acid of higher viscosity and incorporating a microemulsion of the same aqueous phase (pH 8. 5) as in the second gel, and a fatty phase made of benzyl alcohol and a polyoxyethylene(23) lauryl ether surfactant, enabled the selective removal of the degraded varnish over the elaborate gilded area with a composite stratigraphy over the golden leaf. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and UV fluorescence imaging were employed for the analysis of the aged varnish and the monitoring of the cleaning procedure, respectively. The conservation procedure determined the effectiveness of the customized gels employed for this special implementation. The fine preservation of the water-gildings and of the complex solvent-sensitive stratigraphic construction of the painted surface was a satisfactory outcome...|$|E
50|$|<b>Mineral</b> <b>spirits</b> are an {{inexpensive}} petroleum-based {{replacement for the}} vegetable-based turpentine. It is commonly used as a paint thinner for oil-based paint and cleaning brushes, and as an organic solvent in other applications. Mineral turpentine is chemically very different from turpentine, which mainly consists of pinene, and it has inferior solvent properties. Artists use <b>mineral</b> <b>spirits</b> {{as an alternative to}} turpentine since it is less flammable and less toxic. Because of interactions with pigments in oil paints, artists require a higher grade of <b>mineral</b> <b>spirits</b> than many industrial users, including the complete absence of residual sulfur.|$|R
