50|$|Malaga is a sweet {{fortified}} wine {{originating in the}} Spanish city of Málaga made from Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel grapes. The center of Malaga production is Sierra de Almijara, along with Antequera, Archidona, San Pedro Alcantara, Velez Malaga and Competa. The winemaking history in Malaga and the nearby mountains {{is one of the}} oldest in Europe. However, like many of the world’s great dessert wines, demand fell dramatically in the 20th century and it was feared that this wine would soon become extinct. There has been a recent surge in interest in sweet wines, and <b>Malaga</b> <b>wines</b> are finding their place on the world stage. The main wine villages of this appellation include Frigiliana and Vélez. There are many red and white varietals grown, but the only ones used for dessert wines are the Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel.|$|E
50|$|In 1791, Mr Gálves, the Spanish {{ambassador}} in Moscow, presented the Tsarina and Empress of Russia, Catherine II, with some cases of <b>Málaga</b> <b>wine,</b> and {{such was the}} pleasure she experienced that she exempted all shipments of wine controlled by the Fraternity of Vintners from Russian taxes.|$|R
5000|$|Typical Andalucian dishes include pescaito frito (fried fish), gazpacho, Cordoban salmorejo, pringá, oxtail, jamón ibérico (Iberian ham), {{prepared}} olives, alboronía, poleá, anise, {{and various}} kinds of wine, including sherries (fino, manzanilla, oloroso, Pedro Ximénez, amontillado) which are undoubtedly the most exported and most widely available of all Spanish wines, as well as <b>Málaga</b> <b>wine.</b> The wine from Montilla, while similar to sherry, is not technically a sherry, but gives its name to amontillado, meaning [...] "in the style of Montilla".|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} baba {{was introduced}} into France in the 18th century via Lorraine. This {{is attributed to}} Stanislaus I, the exiled king of Poland. The Larousse Gastronomique has reported that Stanislaus had the idea of soaking a dried Gugelhupf (a cake roughly similar to the baba and common in Alsace-Lorraine when he arrived there) or a baba with alcoholic spirit. Another version is that when Stanislaus brought back a baba {{from one of his}} voyages it had dried up. Nicolas Stohrer, one of his pâtissiers (or possibly just apprentice pâtissiers at the time), solved the problem by adding <b>Malaga</b> <b>wine,</b> saffron, dried and fresh raisin and crême pâtissière. The writer Courchamps stated in 1839 that the descendants of Stanislaus served the baba with a saucière containing sweet <b>Malaga</b> <b>wine</b> mixed with one sixth of Tanaisie liqueur.|$|R

50|$|Although {{bottling}} of Yellow Spot {{had ceased}} in the 1950s, by using information in original company journals and ledgers, Mitchell & Son's {{were able to}} determine that the original Yellow Spot was a blend of 12-year old pot still whiskeys which had been matured in a combination of <b>Malaga</b> <b>wine</b> casks (which impart a slightly sweet taste), bourbon barrels and sherry butts.|$|R
50|$|On 1 July 1900 the {{regulations}} of the Associated Guild of Producers and Exporters of <b>Málaga</b> <b>Wine</b> were published (Asociación Gremial de Criadores Exportadores de Vino de Málaga), whose {{purpose was to}} watch over the general interests of the wine trade, by issuing certificates, nominating arbitrers and experts, and above all by guaranteeing the legitimate origin of the exported wines by means of official seals.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{the sweet}} <b>Málaga</b> <b>wine</b> is {{produced}} by drying the grapes in the sun on mats before pressing them; in areas where raisin drying beds (paseros) are used: they consist of earth rectangles built on south or southwest facing slopes, with low white walls built around them. The grapes are commonly placed directly on the soil. Afterwards, the fermentation is stopped {{in order to obtain}} a wine of between 15% and 22%.|$|R

50|$|The Moorish city of Mālaqa was {{the second}} city in the emirate after Granada itself, a major trading port on the Mediterranean.The city was prosperous, with elegant architecture, gardens and fountains. The city was {{surrounded}} by fortifications, which were in good condition. Above it was the citadel, the Alcazaba of Málaga, connected via a covered way with the impregnable fortress of Gibralfaro. A land-side suburb was also ringed by a strong wall. Towards the sea were orchards of olives, oranges and pomegranates, and vineyards from whose grapes the sweet fortified <b>Malaga</b> <b>wine,</b> an important export, was made.|$|R
5000|$|This {{inconsistency}} {{puts the}} pedigree of Ives noir in question. In other writings, Henry Ives {{claimed that he}} cultivated the grape from a seedling of a Vitis vinifera variety called either [...] "Malaga" [...] or [...] "Madeira" [...] but ampelographers {{as early as the}} late 19th century found little evidence to support any vinifera pedigree or relationship to the <b>Malaga</b> <b>wine</b> grapes Pedro Ximénez and Moscatel or the traditional Madeira wine grapes of Malvasia, Bual, Verdelho, Sercial, Terrantez and Bastardo. While DNA analysis of Ives noir has not yet taken place, today ampelographers believe that the grape is likely derived from unknown Vitis labrusca and Vitis aestivalis vines.|$|R
500|$|Food critic John Hess {{and food}} {{historian}} Karen Hess have {{commented that the}} [...] "quality and richness" [...] of the dishes [...] "should surprise {{those who believe that}} Americans of those days ate only Spartan frontier food", giving as examples the glass of <b>Malaga</b> <b>wine,</b> seven eggs and half a pound of butter in the pumpkin pie. They argue that while the elaborate bills of fare given for each month of the year in American editions were conspicuously wasteful, they were less so than the [...] "interminable" [...] menus [...] "stuffed down" [...] in the Victorian era, as guests were not expected to eat everything, but to choose which dishes they wanted, and [...] "the cooking was demonstrably better in the eighteenth century." ...|$|R
5000|$|In France, quinine is an {{ingredient}} of an apéritif known as quinquina or [...] "Cap Corse". In Spain, quinine ("Peruvian bark") is sometimes blended into sweet <b>Malaga</b> <b>wine,</b> {{which is then}} called [...] "Malaga Quina". In Italy, the traditional flavoured wine Barolo Chinato is infused with quinine and local herbs and is served as a digestif. In Canada and Italy, quinine is {{an ingredient}} in the carbonated chinotto beverages Brio and San Pellegrino. In Scotland, the company A.G. Barr uses quinine as an ingredient in the carbonated and caffeinated beverage Irn-Bru. In Uruguay and Argentina, quinine is an ingredient of a PepsiCo tonic water named Paso de los Toros. In Denmark, it is used as an ingredient in the carbonated sports drink Faxe Kondi made by Royal Unibrew.|$|R

50|$|On the 15th October 1694 Admiral Edward Russell, then {{commanding}} the Mediterranean fleet, gave a grand entertainment at Alicante. The tables were laid under {{the shade of}} orange-trees, in four garden-walks meeting in a common centre, at a marble fountain, which last, for the occasion, was converted into a Titanic punch-bowl. Four hogsheads of brandy, one pipe of <b>Malaga</b> <b>wine,</b> twenty gallons of lime-juice, twenty-five hundred lemons, thirteen hundredweight of fine white sugar, five pounds' weight of grated nutmegs, three hundred toasted biscuits, and eight hogsheads of water, formed the ingredients of this monster-brewage. An elegant canopy placed over the potent liquor, prevented waste by evaporation, or dilution by rain; while, in a boat, built expressly for the purpose, a ship-boy rowed round the fountain, to assist in filling cups for the six thousand persons who partook of it.|$|R
50|$|Native cuisine on the Costa del Sol, as in {{the rest}} of Andalusia, has been {{influenced}} historically by Spanish, Jewish and Arabic traditions, and emphasises seafood. Pescaíto frito, small fish breaded without egg and fried in olive oil, then served with fresh lemon, is a universally popular dish. Gazpacho is a famous refreshing cold soup made of raw tomatoes, cucumber, onions, green peppers, garlic, bread, oil and vinegar. Tortillas, Spanish omelettes made with potatoes and served cold, are typical, and a plate of thin-sliced jamón serrano, or dry-cured ham, with a glass of sherry or <b>Málaga</b> <b>wine</b> is a traditional combination. The Ir de Tapas (tapas tour), a Spanish expression meaning to make the rounds of bars drinking and eating snacks, is an important social activity for Spaniards. Some bars will serve a tapa for free when one orders a drink. Churros, fried-dough pastries served hot and dipped in café con leche or hot chocolate are a typical breakfast food.|$|R
50|$|Wine has {{a privileged}} {{place at the}} Andalusian table. Andalusian wines are known worldwide, {{especially}} fortified wines such as sherry (jerez), aged in soleras. These are enormously varied; for example, dry sherry may be the very distinct fino, manzanilla, amontillado, oloroso, or Palo Cortado and each of these varieties can each be sweetened with Pedro Ximénez or Moscatel to produce a different variety of sweet sherry. Besides sherry, Andalucía has five other Denominaciones de Origen for wine: D.O. Condado de Huelva, D.O. Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda, D.O. Málaga, D.O. Montilla-Moriles, and D.O. Sierras de <b>Málaga.</b> Most Andalusian <b>wine</b> comes from one of these regions, {{but there are other}} historic wines without a Protected Geographical Status, for example Tintilla de Rota, Pajarete, Moscatel de Chipiona and Mosto de Umbrete.|$|R
2500|$|The 17th & 18th centuries saw {{periods of}} {{popularity}} for various Spanish wines-namely Sherry (known in Britain as [...] "sack"), <b>Malaga</b> and Rioja <b>wine</b> but the Spanish wine industry was falling behind other European countries which were embracing the {{developments of the}} early Industrial Age. A major turning point occurred in the mid 19th century when the phylloxera epidemic ravaged European vineyards-most notably those of France. With the sudden shortage of French wine, many countries turned to Spain, with French winemakers crossing the Pyrenees to Rioja, Navarre and Catalonia-bringing with them their expertise and winemaking methods. One of these developments was {{the introduction of the}} 59gallon (225liter) oak barrica. Phylloxera eventually reached Spain, devastating regions like Malaga in 1878 and reaching Rioja in 1901. Its slow progress was {{due in part to the}} wide tracts of land, including the Meseta Central, that separated the major Spanish wine regions from each other. By the time the Spanish wine industry felt the full force of phylloxera, the remedy of grafting American rootstock to the European vines had already been discovered and widely utilized.|$|R
