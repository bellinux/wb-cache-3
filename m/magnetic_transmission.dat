5000|$|Outside {{the scope}} of this article is the use of {{coupling}} coils for inductive (<b>magnetic)</b> <b>transmission</b> systems including LF and HF (rather than UHF) RFID tags and readers. Although these do operate at radio frequencies, and involve the use of small loops (loosely described as [...] "antennas" [...] in the trade) which may be physically indistinguishable from the small loop antennas discussed here, such systems are not designed to transmit radio waves (electromagnetic waves). They are near field systems involving alternating magnetic fields only, and may be analyzed as poorly coupled transformer windings; their performance criteria are dissimilar to radio antennas as discussed here.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} Long Wavelength <b>magnetic</b> <b>transmissions</b> (below 1 MHz) is not blocked or {{reflected by}} steel so nulls do not occur. The loop antennas may be detuned by the steel, just like higher frequencies. But, unlike higher frequencies, magnetic loop antennas may be re-tuned with external capacitors, and, in many cases, circuits {{can be created}} that dynamically pick the optimal external capacitor for the antenna. Thus the de-tuning issue can vanish in a RuBee network. But the tuning has to be set to the right frequency by adjusting the capacitor to match the tuning curve with steel in place.|$|R
