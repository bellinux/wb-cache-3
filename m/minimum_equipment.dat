25|$|Before the flight, {{the crew}} {{found that one}} of the two main power {{generators}} was defective since 6 September, and the mechanic who inspected the aircraft was unable to repair it. In the Norwegian jurisdiction an aircraft is only allowed to take off if it has two operable sources of power. Also the aircraft's <b>Minimum</b> <b>Equipment</b> List required two operating generators. The first officer decided that he would run the auxiliary power unit (APU) throughout the flight so that the flight would have two sources of power and therefore be allowed to leave.|$|E
25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the thrust {{reverser}} for engine #3 (treated as a <b>minimum</b> <b>equipment</b> list item) because of technical {{problems with the}} thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the total air temperature sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's <b>Minimum</b> <b>Equipment</b> List allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Three {{different}} laboratory {{methods for}} diagnosing malarial in-fections, especially with Plasmodium falciparum, were evaluated {{in this study}} using thirty infected samples (22 samples contained Plasmodium falciparum, 8 samples contained P. vivax.). These methods included stained thick blood films, Quantitative Buffy Coat system, and Dipstrip (ParaSight-F) im-munoassay. Comparison among the three methods was done regarding the specificity to detect malaria parasites, {{the time required to}} perform the ex-amination, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each method. ParaSight-F gave cross reactions with samples that contained high levels of rheumatoid factor (R. F.) and did not detect P. vivax.
