40|$|The limited solubility, and {{therefore}} bioavailability, of the antimycotic drug,itraconazole, {{used for the}} treatment of intestinal Candidiasis in immunocompromisedindividuals, has been well documented. Therapeutic regimen in these patients mayinclude daily administration of multiple doses of various drugs. Hence, improving theresidence time of therapeutic agents, would ensure a high continuous concentration inthe body and help decrease the dosing frequency. In our current study, we haveinvestigated a novel method of drug delivery, developed by utilizing the concept ofmucoadhesiveness, for the sustained release of the drug, itraconazole. Mucoadhesivebeads were prepared using two natural polymers, isabghula husk and alginate. Theminimum inhibitory concentration of itraconazole for Candida was found to be 1. 5 <b>milligram</b> <b>per</b> <b>millilitre.</b> Accordingly, beads were prepared by ionic gelation methodusing calcium chloride as a crosslinking agent. Marked improvement in solubility of thedrug was noted after entrapment. Prepared beads were subjected to various evaluationsincluding particle size, swelling behaviour and mucoadhesivity. At pH 7. 4, goodmucoadhesive property was exhibited up to 7 hours. Maximum swelling of beads wasobserved at 4 hours in phosphate buffer after which the beads showed slight erosion. Fresh cock intestinal mucosa was used to assess the sustained release of itraconazolefrom the drug loaded beads and the reduction in candidal cells adhering to the mucosawas verified by the viable count technique. The results of our present study indicate thatmucoadhesive intestinal retentive isabghula- alginate beads could represent a promisingvehicle for drug delivery and help improve therapeutic efficacy and patient compliancein the future...|$|E

Howes was quoted as saying, [...] "There would be every indication of mental and physical drunkenness in the average person. The average person would be nearly unconscious.

40|$|Group A streptococci (GAS) {{are able}} to invade cultured {{epithelial}} and endothelial cells without evidence of intracellular replication. GAS, like other facultative intracellular bacterial pathogens, evolved such ability to enter and to survive within host cells avoiding the host defences, and bacterial intracellular survival could explain the recurrence of infections. We report here that 1 mg bovine lactoferrin (bLf) /mL significantly hindered the in vitro invasion of cultured epithelial cells by GAS isolated from patients suffering from pharyngitis and completely inhibited the invasiveness of GAS pretreated with subinhibiting concentrations of erythromycin or ampicillin. One <b>milligram</b> of bLf <b>per</b> <b>millilitre</b> was also able {{to increase the number}} of epithelial cells undergoing apoptosis following GAS invasion, although the number of intracellular GAS in the presence of bLf decreased by about 10 -fold. The ability of bLf to decrease GAS invasion was confirmed by an in vivo trial carried out on 12 children suffering from pharyngitis and already scheduled for tonsillectomy. In tonsil specimens from children treated for 15 days before tonsillectomy with both oral erythromycin (500 mg t. i. d. (three times daily)) and bLf gargles (100 mg t. i. d.), a lower number of intracellular GAS was found in comparison with that retrieved in tonsil specimens from children treated with erythromycin alone (500 mg t. i. d.) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the mechanism of cis platin nephrotoxicity and to examine the responses of rat and human proximal tubular cell cultures to platinum analogues for potential early markers of toxicity. 1   Nephrotoxicity was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats (N = 4 ± standard deviation) and male C 57 BL/ 6 mice (N = 6 ± standard deviation) with doses of 6 <b>milligrams</b> <b>per</b> kilogram and 10 <b>milligrams</b> <b>per</b> kilogram cis platin administered by intraperitoneal injection respectively. These doses increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine significantly. Male Spraque Dawley rats and C 57 BL/ 6 mice had control blood urea nitrogen day 5 and day 4 values of 8 ± 1 micromoles <b>per</b> <b>millilitre</b> and 7 ± 0. 7 micromoles <b>per</b> <b>millilitre</b> respectively compared with values post cis platin treatment of 36 ± 4 micromoles <b>per</b> <b>millilitre</b> and 31 ± 11. 6 micromoles <b>per</b> <b>millilitre.</b>   Histological analysis revealed significant damage to the proximal tubules, including loss of brush border membrane, cellular vacuolation and loss of cell-cell adhesion. 2   The inhibition of aminopeptidase N and renal dipeptidase in vivo in male Sprague Dawley rats (N = 4 ± standard deviation) or in rat and human proximal tubule cell cultures did not alter the toxicity of cis platin (N = 5 ± standard deviation). These data show that the dipeptidase enzymes are not implicated in the nephrotoxicity of cis platin and contradict the publications of Hanigan and Townsend (2002) and Townsend et al (2003 b), which hypothesise that dipeptidase activity {{is an integral part}} of a cis platin biotransformation, pathway that is responsible for cis platin nephrotoxicity. 3   The inhibition of cysteine S-conjugate b-lyase activity in male Sprague Dawley rats (N = 4 ± standard deviation) and C 57 BL/ 6 mice (N = 6 ± standard deviation) did not affect the level of cis platin toxicity. The inhibition of cysteine S-conjugate b-lyase in vitro significantly increased cis platin toxicity in rat and human proximal tubule cell cultures at 24 hours (N = 5 ± standard deviation). These data contradict the published data of Hanigan and Townsend (2002) and Townsend et al (2003 b) in which cysteine S-conjugate b-lyase inhibition prevented cis platin nepthrotoxicity in C 57 BL/ 6 mice and reduced toxicity in LLC-PK 1 cell cultures.
