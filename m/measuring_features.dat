40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{introduction}} of coordinate measuring machines (CMMs), their measuring accuracy has been studied.

40|$|In plant phenotyping, {{there is}} a demand for high-throughput, {{non-destructive}} systems that can accurately analyse various plant traits by <b>measuring</b> <b>features</b> such as plant volume, leaf area, and stem length. Existing vision-based systems either focus on speed using 2 D imaging, which is consequently inaccurate, or on accuracy using time-consuming 3 D methods. In this paper, we present a computer-vision system for seedling phenotyping that combines best of both approaches by utilizing a fast three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction method. We developed image processing methods for the identification and segmentation of plant organs (stem and leaf) from the 3 D plant model. Various measurements of plant features such as plant volume, leaf area, and stem length are estimated based on these plant segments. We evaluate the accuracy of our system by comparing the measurements of our methods with ground truth measurements obtained destructively by hand. The {{results indicate that the}} proposed system is very promising. </p...|$|E
40|$|We aim to {{investigate}} advancing {{the state of}} the art of detection, classification and localization (DCL) in the field of bioacoustics. The two primary goals are to develop transferable technologies for detection and classification in: (1) the area of advanced algorithms, such as deep learning and other methods; and (2) advanced systems, capable of real-time and archival and processing. This project will focus on long-term, continuous datasets to provide automatic recognition, minimizing human time to annotate the signals. Effort will begin by focusing on several years of multi-channel acoustic data collected in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (SBNMS) between 2006 and 2010.

40|$|Protos is {{a popular}} tool for {{business}} process modelling used in more than 1, 500 organizations. It has a built-in Petri-net-based simulation engine which shows key performance indicators for the modelled processes. Reference process models offered for Protos reduce modelling efforts by providing generic solutions which only need to be adapted to individual requirements. However, the user can neither inspect or interact with simulations running in Protos, nor does Protos provide any explicit support for the adaptation of reference models. Hence, we aim at a more open and configurable simulation solution. To realize this we provide two transformations from Protos models to colored Petri nets (CPNs), which can be executed by CPN Tools. The first transformation enables the usage of the extensive simulation and <b>measuring</b> <b>features</b> of CPN Tools for the simulation of Protos models. The second transformation creates colored Petri nets with dedicated features for process configuration. Such configurable process models can be restricted directly within the process model without changing the model’s structure and provide therefore dedicated adaptation features for Protos’ reference process models...|$|E
40|$|The theory {{underlying}} {{line transect}} and variable circular plot surveys-distance sampling-begins with an assumed detectability function, giving the probabilities of detecting animals at different distances from the observer's path. The {{nature of these}} probabilities is unspecified in the general development, leaving users to question whether the actual probability structure matters. In particular, may one use the methodology in surveys where animals at the same distance have different probabilities of detection? This paper presents three examples where probabilities come from different assumptions: from the random placement of transects; from the uniform distribution of animals over the study region; and from cues randomly detected by the observer. These exemplify situations where detectability {{may not be a}} function of distance alone. Horvitz-Thompson estimators are displayed which can be used in each example, but some estimators require <b>measuring</b> <b>features</b> other than distance. A result concerning optimally weighted Horvitz-Thompson estimators shows that all three can be brought under the same umbrella if detection areas are measured instead of detection distances and if animals are uniformly distributed...|$|E
40|$|One way of {{recovering}} {{information about the}} initial conditions of the Universe is by <b>measuring</b> <b>features</b> of the cosmological density field which are preserved during gravitational evolution and galaxy formation. In this paper we study the total number density of peaks in a (galaxy) point distribution smoothed with a filter, evaluating its usefulness {{as a means of}} inferring the shape of the initial (matter) power spectrum. We find that in numerical simulations which start from Gaussian initial conditions, the peak density follows well that predicted by the theory of Gaussian density fields, even on scales where the clustering is mildly non-linear. For smaller filter scales, r ∼ < 4 − 6 h − 1 Mpc, we see evidence of merging as the peak density decreases with time. On larger scales, the peak density is independent of time. One might also expect it to be fairly robust with respect to variations in biasing, i. e. the way galaxies trace mass fluctuations. We find that this is the case when we apply various biasing prescriptions to the matter distribution in simulations. If the initial conditions are Gaussian, i...|$|E

40|$|Researchers {{often have}} data <b>measuring</b> <b>features</b> $x_{ij}$ of samples, such as test scores of students. In factor {{analysis}} and PCA, these features {{are thought to}} be influenced by unobserved factors, such as skills. Can we determine how many factors affect the data? Many approaches have been developed for this factor selection problem. The popular Parallel Analysis method randomly permutes each feature of the data. It selects factors if their singular values are larger than those of the permuted data. It is used by leading applied statisticians, including T Hastie, M Stephens, J Storey, R Tibshirani and WH Wong. Despite empirical evidence for its accuracy, there is currently no theoretical justification. This prevents us from knowing when it will work in the future. In this paper, we show that parallel analysis consistently selects the significant factors in certain high-dimensional factor models. The intuition is that permutations keep the noise invariant, while "destroying" the low-rank signal. This provides justification for permutation methods in PCA and factor models under some conditions. A key requirement is that the factors must load on several variables. Our work points to improvements of permutation methods. Comment: Feedback is welcom...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} faceted morphology in laser dressed grinding wheels. Design/methodology/approach: The approach used in the paper is based on locally melting a vitrified grinding wheel and <b>measuring</b> <b>features</b> such as grain size, cooling rate and melt depth {{as a function of}} laser fluence and relating these measures to the morphology shown in the microstructures presented in the paper. Findings: The findings of this course of research lead the authors to believe that a specific morphology is dependent upon cooling rate and laser fluence. Research limitations/implications: The findings show that further research is required to fully understand how certain morphologies form as a function of cooling rate and laser fluence. It should be noted that morphologies observed in laser processed grinding wheels include cellular and fully dendritic morphologies in addition to faceted vertices. Practical implications: The results imply that laser dressed grinding wheels can be used for machining different materials at different grinding speeds. The paper also shows that much development is needed to identify laser processing conditions that are appropriate for different workpiece materials. Originality/value: The paper shows that different morphologies can be used to machine workpiece materials under different conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Vanderbilt Classification System is a {{quantitative}} method of <b>measuring</b> <b>features</b> detected in diabetic retinopathy photographs. It {{does not require}} comparisons to preexisting standard photographs. This is the first report of the application of this system to a large-scale, multiple-medical-center drug trial. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study that involved 74 medical centers. There were 3, 679 out-patients followed for more that 4 years, with some observed for over 9 years. The Vanderbilt Classification System generated patient data for the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) and the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) scales. The deterioration rate was one variable used to assess drug effect. A comprehensive Quality Assurance Program evaluated intergrader and intragrader reliability. RESULTS: Target values for reliability and reproducibility were met or exceeded on all measures of agreement between photo readers and over time. Kappa statistics were 0. 610 or greater, with most weighted kappa values greater than 0. 810. This represents "almost perfect agreement" and compares favorably with previous reports from the ETDRS and DCCT. CONCLUSION: Diabetic retinopathy can be evaluated in a reliable and reproducible manner with the VCS. The VCS is unique in that it produces {{a quantitative}} analysis of retinal lesions. Subtle variations that might be influenced by systemic medications can be measured accurately with this technique...|$|E
