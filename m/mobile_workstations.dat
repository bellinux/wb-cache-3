40|$|In a multidatabase {{environment}} with mobile computers involved, {{the nature of}} computing is such that the user may not wait for the submitted global transaction to complete before disconnecting from the network. In this paper, a basic architectural framework to support transaction management in multidatabase systems is proposed and discussed. A simple Message and Queuing Facility is suggested which provides a common communication and data exchange protocol to effectively manage global transactions submitted by <b>mobile</b> <b>workstations</b> (MWS). The state of global transactions is modelled {{through the use of}} transaction sub-queues. The proposed strategy allows an MWS to submit global transactions and then disconnect itself from the network to perform some other tasks thereby increasing processing parallelism and independence. 1 Introduction With the decentralisation of business enterprises, there is a shift in the processing requirements: from online processing environment accessing a centralise [...] ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET), routing {{protocols}} rely on asymmetric links so the received information for one connection is not useful {{at all for}} the other one. In this paper there are two approaches; the first approach is a simulation of MANET with many nodes in one network based FTP traffic. The second approach is a simulation of the combination between WiFi and WiMax wireless technologies in one network based on the IEEE 802. 11 and IEEE 802. 16 standards respectively. For these two approaches, the simulation considers the situation that the MANET receives traffic from another network via a common gateway. In addition, the mobile nodes are randomly placed in the network that will provide the possibility of multi-hop routes from a node to another. Several scenarios ' simulations using WLAN technology were tested to investigate {{the behavior of the}} network performance for logical and office applications with fixed and <b>mobile</b> <b>workstations.</b> we considered to operate on a single-hop or multi-hop basis where nodes in the network are able to act as intermediaries (routers) for communications of other nodes.
