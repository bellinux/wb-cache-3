60|$|So {{completely}} did I {{break with}} my parsimonious past that I sent word {{home to my}} mother to call in the boys of the neighbourhood and give to them all <b>my</b> <b>collections.</b> I never even cared to learn what boys got what collections.

60|$|Thanks to Dr. Falconer's indefatigable exertions, such of <b>my</b> <b>collections</b> as reached Calcutta were {{forwarded}} to England in excellent order; {{and they were}} temporarily deposited in Kew Gardens until their destination should be determined. On my return home, my scientific friends interested themselves in procuring from the Government such aid as might enable me to devote the necessary time to the arrangement, naming, and distributing of <b>my</b> <b>collections,</b> the publication of my manuscripts, etc. I am in this most deeply indebted to the disinterested and generous exertions of Mr. L. Horner, Sir Charles Lyell, Dr. Lindley, Professor E. Forbes, and many others; and most especially to the Presidents of the Royal Society (the Earl of Rosse), of the Linnean (Mr. R. Brown), and Geological (Mr. Hopkins), who in their official capacities memorialized in person the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests on this subject; Sir William Hooker {{at the same time}} bringing it under the notice of the First Lord of the Treasury. The result was a grant of £400 annually for three years.|$|R
