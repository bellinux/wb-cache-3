My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>is</b> still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>is</b> not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E

Artist and Mushroom Records art director Ian McCausland also designed The Rolling Stones' 1973 Australian tour poster. The album cover illustrates a central principle of Aboriginal spirituality: the deep connection between the land and the Aboriginal peoples. In an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission publication, [...] "Our Land Our Life", S. Knight described the Aboriginal position: [...] "We don't own the land, the land owns us.

[...] According to the Australian government webpage, The Dreaming: [...] "Once the ancestor spirits had created the world, they changed into trees, the stars, rocks, watering holes or other objects.

He has said in an 2012 interview with PSG that: [...] "My father is Muslim, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>is</b> Catholic, but none of that has anything to do with football.

2500|$|The film {{revisited}} Almodóvar's familiar {{themes of}} the power of sisterhood and of family. Almodóvar shot parts of the film in Barcelona and used lush colors to emphasise the richness of the city. Dedicated to Bette Davis, Romy Schneider and Gena Rowlands, All About <b>My</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>is</b> steeped in theatricality, from its backstage setting to its plot, modeled on the works of Federico García Lorca and Tennessee Williams, to the characters' preoccupation with modes of performance. Almodóvar inserts a number of references to American cinema. One of the film's key scenes, where Manuela watches her son die, was inspired by John Cassavetes' 1977 film Opening Night. The film's title is also a nod to All About Eve, which Manuela and her son are shown watching in the film. The comic relief of the film centers on Agrado, a pre-operative transsexual. In one scene, she tells the story of her body and its relationship to plastic surgery and silicone, culminating with a statement of her own philosophy: [...] "you get to be more authentic the more you become like what you have dreamed of yourself".|$|E
2500|$|Nicolae Iorga was {{a native}} of Botoșani, and is {{generally}} believed to have been born on January 17, 1871 (although his birth certificate has June 6). His father Nicu Iorga (a practicing lawyer) and mother Zulnia (née Arghiropol) belonged to the Romanian Orthodox Church. Details on the family's more distant origins remain uncertain: Iorga was widely reputed to be of partial Greek-Romanian descent; the rumor, still credited by some commentators, was rejected by the historian. In his own account: [...] "My father was from a family of Romanian traders from Botoșani, who were later received into the boyar class, while <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>is</b> the daughter of Romanian writer Elena Drăghici, the niece of chronicler Manolache Drăghici... The [...] name Arghiropol notwithstanding, my maternal grandfather [...] from a family that moved in... from Bessarabia". Elsewhere, however, he acknowledged that the Arghiropols were possibly Byzantine Greeks. Iorga credited the five-generation-boyar status, received from his father's side, and the [...] "old boyar" [...] roots of his mother (the Miclescu family), with having turned him into a political man. His parallel claim of being related to noble families such as the Cantacuzinos and the Craiovești is questioned by other researchers.|$|E
