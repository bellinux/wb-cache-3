5|$|Contrasted {{with the}} flourishing {{state of trade}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century is the rapid and {{sustained}} decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, all that remained of the major industries of the town was the <b>malthouse</b> of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely.|$|E
5|$|Merrick {{is portrayed}} in two episodes in 2013 (the second season) of the BBC {{historical}} crime drama Ripper Street, portrayed by actor Joseph Drake. In 2017, the <b>Malthouse</b> Theatre, Melbourne commissioned playwright Tom Wright {{to write a}} play about Merrick's life. The Real and Imagined History of the Elephant Man premiered on August 4, and starred Daniel Monks in the title role. The cast also featured Paula Arundell, Julie Forsyth, Emma J Hawkins, and Sophie Ross.|$|E
5|$|Ned Manning {{was born}} in 1950 and {{grew up on a}} {{property}} in Coonabarabran, New South Wales. He married Bronwyn Bancroft, an Indigenous Australian artist, with whom he had two children, including New South Wales Young Australian of the Year for 2010, Jack Manning Bancroft. Manning remarried to theatre director Marion Potts, with whom he had two children.

50|$|The station {{building}} was very ornate, if somewhat {{dwarfed by the}} adjacent <b>malthouses,</b> with attractive coupled chimneys and unusual windows with the frame and arch of stone.|$|R
5|$|Various causes {{contributed to}} this decline. The {{abolition}} of the Corn Laws in 1846 allowed the free importation of grain into these islands. Unable to compete with foreigners, the Irish farmer turned his land to pasture and grew only sufficient grain for his own use. The Banagher corn trade rapidly declined, and would have completely vanished were it not that barley growing was kept alive by Waller's <b>malthouse.</b> The clearances in East Galway {{in the years immediately}} succeeding the Great Irish Famine adversely affected the trade of the town while the smaller industries were unable to compete against the highly organised industries of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{arrived at}} Shannon Harbour in 1804, {{and the water}} {{transport}} facilities stimulated the growth of existing industries and encouraged the establishment of new ones. Neat two and three-storey houses were built {{on each side of}} the road in Banagher to provide shops and dwellings for the merchants and other people who came to live there for the canal business. In 1834, there was a distillery, a brewery, two tanyards, a <b>malthouse</b> and corn mills in full operation in the town. Several craftsmen carried on industries in smaller workshops and in their homes. With the increase in trade and manufactures went a corresponding increase in population. In 1800, the population was estimated at 1500; in 1841, it was 2836, and in 1846, it was estimated at 3000.|$|E
5|$|With the {{off-season}} acquisition of Mitch Clark in the 2011 trade period, who was {{projected to be}} the number one forward in the team, the forward load {{was expected to be}} relieved off of Watts, who new coach, Mark Neeld, stated would play primarily as a forward alongside Clark, rather than as both a forward and back as was the case the previous season. He struggled for form during the 2012 NAB Cup where he had just three combined possessions in the first two matches against Brisbane and Gold Coast, before he was substituted out of the match against Collingwood the next week where he managed just seven disposals, which drew the ire of former Collingwood coach, Mick <b>Malthouse,</b> who said he lacked ambition when playing. He was subsequently omitted for the final pre-season match against Port Adelaide.|$|E

25|$|The club's on-field {{performances}} deteriorated drastically in {{the early}} part of 2015, and after eight weeks it was bottom of the ladder. The relationship between <b>Malthouse</b> and the club's new board began to deteriorate publicly; and on 26 May, after giving a radio interview critical of the board, <b>Malthouse</b> was sacked; the club went on to finish last.|$|E

5000|$|Before the First World War, {{the most}} {{commercial}} and brewing <b>malthouses</b> in the Austro-Hungarian Empire were concentrated in Moravia and Bohemia. The Moravian <b>malthouses</b> used {{services of the}} Vienna laboratory Institut für Gärungsindustrie of prof. E. Jalowetz (1862 - 1936). After the First World War, the Czechoslovak Malting Commission in Brno was founded; the Commission initiated {{the establishment of the}} Institute of the Malting Industry. The task of setting up the institute was assumed by Vladimír Vavřin Žila (1889-1953), the graduate from the Wiener Akademie für Brau-Industrie. V. V. Žila managed the Institute of the Malting Industry from its establishment, at first as a head of the laboratory and lately, to his death, as a director.|$|R

25|$|A <b>malthouse</b> is a {{building}} in which brewers create malt by starting the germination process of barley or other grains. The malt is then used as a key ingredient {{in the making of}} beer, ale and malt liquor. This <b>malthouse</b> was one of several attempted commercial ventures undertaken by Sir William Keith during his term as governor of Colonial Pennsylvania. His other businesses included a copper mine located west of the Susquehanna River in disputed territory and a foundry on the Christiana River near New Castle, Delaware. The <b>malthouse</b> was constructed during a time of financial complications between Great Britain and her American colonies. Trade was slowed tremendously and supplies of grain were rotting on the idled ships in the colonial ports in cities like Philadelphia. Keith took advantage of the need to have the grain processed and malting the grain was a good way to preserve it for a time.|$|E
25|$|The Congregational Church, Pickwick Road, {{originally}} {{met in a}} <b>malthouse,</b> and a {{new building}} was commenced in 1790. In 1971 it closed and is now used as offices.|$|E
5|$|The maltings were {{constructed}} to designs by Herbert A. Couchman, Bass & Co.'s chief engineer. Built in red brick with Welsh slate roofing, the complex follows a rectangular plan along an east-west orientation: a central four-storey water tower {{is flanked by}} four <b>malthouses.</b> Behind the tower is a tall, octagonal chimney. The <b>malthouses</b> are identical in design and layout; barley was fed into a granary section, before being moved onto the germination floors and eventually transported {{to one of the}} twin kilns, where malting took place. Their southern fronts consisted of a six-storey building of five bays with a gable spanning three windows that faces the other ranges. Projecting northwards is a ten-bay section of four-storeys which formed the germination floors.|$|R
50|$|By 1838 the Pooleys {{were living}} in the more {{pleasant}} surroundings of Kingston-upon-Thames, also known at that time as Kingston-on-Thames. Thomas ran three <b>malthouses</b> and his son Alexander ran another. In addition to his malting operations, Thomas owned three cargo vessels, the Agnes, the Elizabeth and the Mahon Castle.|$|R
50|$|Since 1998, “Barley Year Book” {{has been}} {{published}} in the RIBM’s Brno workplace each year. It brings information on barley varieties, statistical data on barley and malt, <b>malthouses</b> directory etc. In 2005-2006, the Brno workplace was completely reconstructed and modernized. In 2015, the “Library of Barley and Malt“ was set up.|$|R
25|$|Hadlow had working breweries {{between the}} early eighteenth {{century and the}} late 1940s. The {{earliest}} reference to a brewery in Hadlow is in 1710 when John Barton, Yeoman of Hadlow is mentioned {{in connection with a}} newly erected <b>malthouse</b> in Hadlow Street. In 1840 there was a complaint that the drain leading from the Close Brewery was a nuisance.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{record of}} a legal {{distillery}} {{on the island of}} Islay refers to Bowmore in 1779 and at one time there were up to 23 distilleries in operation. For example, Port Charlotte distillery operated from 1829 to 1929 and Port Ellen is also closed although it remains in business as a <b>malthouse</b> that supplies many of the Islay distilleries.|$|E
25|$|Peter Carey's 2003 novel My Life as a Fake draws {{some of its}} {{inspiration}} from the Ern Malley affair. Elliot Perlman recounts {{the tale of the}} Ern Malley hoax in his 2003 novel Seven Types of Ambiguity. In 2005, The Black Swan of Trespass, a surrealist play about the real life of a fictional Ern Malley by Lally Katz and Chris Kohn, premiered at the Melbourne <b>Malthouse</b> Theatre.|$|E
50|$|Under Bass's leadership, company {{production}} and sales had grown enormously. Production of ale {{had grown to}} 340,000 barrels in 1860 and to almost a million barrels in the late 1870s. By 1881, the company had three breweries and 26 <b>malthouses</b> covering 145 acre in Burton upon Trent. The company was Britain's biggest brewery {{and was one of}} its best known companies.|$|R
50|$|It {{all came}} to a {{grinding}} halt in round six when reigning premiers brought the kids back to earth with a shudder, giving them an old fashioned football lesson. The rot set in again, albeit somewhat more accepted by the Collingwood faithful than it would previously have been, for they knew <b>Malthouse’s</b> plan, and how pain would be endured before they were rewarded with the promised pleasure.|$|R
5000|$|Twelve {{months later}} however, the Eagles {{were back in}} the finals, {{finishing}} 4th {{at the end of the}} home and away season and losing a preliminary final against eventual premiers [...] After the club's top-four finish, Worsfold signed a two-year extension to his contract in October 2011. At the conclusion of round nine of the 2012 season, Worsfold passed Mick <b>Malthouse’s</b> record for the most games coached at West Coast.|$|R
25|$|Several pubs {{serve the}} village, {{mostly in the}} village centre, and include The Star, The Cross Keys, and The Three Horse Shoes. 'The Swan' in Eastbrook closed {{permanently}} in 2007. Across {{the other side of}} the railway lines is The Castle Oak (until 2006 known as The <b>Malthouse)</b> located on the Murch estate near a small parade of shops. The Castle Oak closed during 2011. The site is now operated by Tesco. Dinas Powys is also noted for its sports clubs which are documented below.|$|E
25|$|The school grew {{steadily}} and to such {{an extent}} that in 1837 a new schoolroom was built that could hold 300 boys. This was completed in 1838, and the original school in the converted <b>malthouse</b> then included an infants school as well as the girls'. HM Inspector of Schools Matthew Arnold visited the school in 1852 and reinforced the 1849 recommendation of inspector J D Morrell that the boys' school would benefit from a new classroom. A new Gallery classroom for 110 pupils was completed in February 1854.|$|E
25|$|Several {{professional}} theatre companies {{operate in}} Melbourne, {{of which the}} Melbourne Theatre Company, the oldest professional theatre company in Australia, has the most institutional support of any in Australia. There is also a range of smaller professional theatre companies in Melbourne, including the <b>Malthouse,</b> La Mama in Carlton, Cariad Productions, the Red Stitch Actors Theatre and Theatreworks in St Kilda. An array of amateur companies also exist, such as OXAGEN Productions, the Malvern Theatre Company, CLOC, Catchment Players of Darebin, Altona City Theatre, Windmill Theatre Company and Dandenong Theatre Company.|$|E

50|$|Johnson {{enjoyed a}} strong 2010 season, {{culminating}} {{in becoming a}} member of Collingwood's 15th VFL/AFL Premiership. His finals series was particularly memorable, slotting the Magpies' seventh goal on the run, sidestepping Cameron Ling {{late in the first}} quarter of the 2010 Preliminary Final victory. He managed to nullify long-standing rival Stephen Milne in both the Grand Final and the Grand Final Replay. Johnson booted Collingwood's second goal of the Replay, and was the only remaining player from Mick <b>Malthouse's</b> first match as coach of Collingwood (round one, 2000, against Hawthorn).|$|R
5000|$|George I. Brown, a local merchant, {{bought the}} brewery at the auction on July 14, 1813. He was an {{acquaintance}} of Mary Pickersgill, who had been commissioned by Colonel George Armistead in 1813 to make a large flag (30 by 42 feet) to fly over Fort McHenry. Pickersgill did not have adequate space in her house to assemble a flag of that size and lived only {{a block away from}} Brown's Brewery. Brown permitted her to assemble {{what became known as the}} Star Spangled Banner Flag on the floor of one of his <b>malthouses.</b>|$|R
