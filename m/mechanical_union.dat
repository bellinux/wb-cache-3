60|$|The lowest {{animal and}} vegetal forms--Protozoa and Protophyta--are chiefly {{inhabitants}} of the water. They are minute bodies, {{most of which are}} made individually visible only by the microscope. All of them are extremely simple in structure, and some of them, as the Rhizopods, almost structureless. Multiplying, as they ordinarily do, by the spontaneous division of their bodies, they produce halves which may either become quite separate and move away in different directions, or may continue attached. By the repetition of this process of fission, aggregations of various sizes and kinds are formed. Among the Protophyta we have some classes, as the Diatomaceæ and the Yeast-plant, in which the individuals may be either separate or attached in groups of two, three, four, or more; other classes in which a considerable number of cells are united into a thread (Conferva, Monilia); others in which they form a network (Hydrodictyon); others in which they form plates (Ulva); and others in which they form masses (Laminaria, Agaricus): all which vegetal forms, having no distinction of root, stem, or leaf, are called Thallogens. Among the Protozoa we find parallel facts. Immense numbers of Amoeba-like creatures, massed together in a framework of horny fibres, constitute Sponge. In the Foraminifera we see smaller groups of such creatures arranged into more definite shapes. Not only do these almost structureless Protozoa unite into regular or irregular aggregations of various sizes, but among some of the more organized ones, as the Vorticellæ, there are also produced clusters of individuals united to a common stem. But these little societies of monads, or cells, or whatever else we may call them, are societies only in the lowest sense: there is no subordination of parts among them--no organization. Each of the component units lives by and for itself; neither giving nor receiving aid. The only mutual dependence is that consequent on <b>mechanical</b> <b>union.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{suture materials}} {{have been evaluated}} for their suitability for use in flexor tendon repairs: 4 /O gauge monofilament and multifilament stainless steel, mono-filament nylon, monofilament polypropylene, monofilament polybutestor, braided polyester, braided polyglycolic acid and a monofilament polyglyconate. These were investigated for their tensile strength (both knotted and unknotted), their extension to failure and knot-holding properties. Stainless steel and monofilament polyglyconate {{appeared to be the}} most suitable in that they had high tensile strengths, both knotted and unknotted, and had good knot-holding security. The only disadvantages are that stainless steel is difficult to use and monofilament polyglyconate is absorbable. Polypropylene and braided polyester, although having lower tensile strengths, are reasonable alternatives.

40|$|As the {{cylindrical}} sp 2 -bonded carbon allotrope, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{have been}} widely used to reinforce bulk materials such as polymers, ceramics, and metals. However, both the concept demonstration and the fundamental understanding on how 1 D CNTs reinforce atomically thin 2 D layered materials, such as graphene, are still absent. Here, we demonstrate the successful synthesis of CNT-toughened graphene by simply annealing functionalized CNTs on Cu foils without needing to introduce extraneous carbon sources. The CNTs act as reinforcing bar (rebar), toughening the graphene through both π–π stacking domains and covalent bonding where the CNTs partially unzip and form a seamless 2 D conjoined hybrid as revealed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis. This is termed rebar graphene. Rebar graphene can be free-standing on water and transferred onto target substrates without needing a polymer-coating due to the rebar effects of the CNTs. The utility of rebar graphene sheets as flexible all-carbon transparent electrodes is demonstrated. The in-plane marriage of 1 D nanotubes and 2 D layered materials might herald an electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>union</b> that extends beyond carbon chemistry...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the union {{effects on the}} wage gap and dispersion in two pooled samples of construction craftworkers (CPS 1983 - 88 and 2000 - 05) using decomposition analysis and kernel density estimation. It shows that despite {{the decline in the}} adjusted union wage gap declined over time, the unadjusted union wage premium remained high due to the divergence of returns to workforce characteristics in favor of union workers. This pattern was more marked in the basic trades in comparison with the <b>mechanical</b> trades. <b>Unions</b> also contributed to a wider wage dispersion because they created a union wage gap and this wage gap increased across the competitive 9 ̆ 4 wage distribution. Unions raised the wages of workers who were located {{in the middle of the}} wage density but did not have an effect on the lower wage workers...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceSutton F. StephensArchitectural {{engineers}} face {{many challenges}} {{in the design and}} implementation of mechanical, electrical, lighting, plumbing, and fire protection systems in buildings. Space and aesthetic coordination must be managed between the architects, engineers, contractors, and building owners. Further design issues are involved when renovating or preserving historic properties. Historic buildings often contain additional design limitations and character defining features that must be preserved. A building's character defining features often represent past history, culture, and architecture. To better understand the design coordination and other issues faced in historic renovation, three case studies located in Kansas City, Missouri, are presented to investigate the application of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) system design into historic buildings. The three case studies include: the Stowers Institute for Medical Research, as a <b>mechanical</b> design; the <b>Union</b> Station, as an electrical and lighting design; and the Webster House, as a plumbing and fire protection design. The renovation projects' architects, engineers, and contractors were personally interviewed to obtain the most accurate information and account of the design and construction process. Additional information was gathered, and a tour of each building allowed for the pictorial documentation of each site. Preserving the historic character of buildings during renovations has many advantages and disadvantages for both the owners and the designers. The additional design parameters in historic renovation projects foster creative thinking and problem solving during the design and construction process. In order to implement a successful design, the architects, engineers, and contractors must work together and understand the value of a building's historic character during the design stage when adapting to a new usage...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe {{treatment}} of periprosthetic femoral fractures by conventional plating {{is associated with}} problems related to fracture union and eventual refracture. Additionally, locking nailing cannot be used in all cases {{because of the risk}} of malunion. To resolve these issues, locking plates have been proposed to combine the advantages of closed reduction and internal fixation while achieving a higher quality reduction with plate fixation. HypothesisLocking plates put into place by a mini-invasive surgical approach result in fixation without substantial misalignment or non-union. Patients and methodsFrom June 2002 to December 2007 we prospectively treated 35 patients (one bilateral), 28 women and seven men with a fracture around the hip implant (21), around the knee (8), between the hip implant and the knee (2), between a trochanteric internal fixation device and the knee implant (5). The mean age was 76, (39 – 93). Internal fixation was always attempted by mini-invasive surgery using locking plate system with locking screws (Synthès™). Rehabilitation included immediate weight bearing with as much weight as the patient would tolerate. The preoperative Parker score was 5. 25 (0 – 9). ResultsThere was one patient lost to follow-up, one early failure, and seven deaths (four of whom were included in the study group since their follow-up was at least 24 months) for a total of 31 fractures (30 patients), the mean follow-up for the series was 26 months (6 – 67). Twenty-six fixations were performed by mini-invasive approach and 10 through a conventional open surgery. Patients applied full weight (n= 20), partial weight (n= 3) or no weight for 6 weeks (n= 13). Infections developed in two patients and there were three cases of <b>mechanical</b> failure. Fracture <b>union</b> was achieved in 35 out of 36 cases. More than 5 ° of misalignment was observed in five patients. Loosening of the implant did not occur in any patients during follow-up. The Parker score in patients seen at follow up was 4. 3 (0 – 9). Discussion-conclusionLocking compression plates associated with a mini-invasive surgical approach result in a high rate of union (35 / 36) with no significant misalignment (only 5 / 36 cases of misalignment of more than 5 °), no refractures (n= 0) and a low rate of mechanical failure (3 / 36) while allowing full weight bearing in most cases (20 / 36). Locking plates for periprosthetic femoral fractures allow patients to begin walking again, with stable intermediate term results. Level of scientific evidenceLevel IV.
