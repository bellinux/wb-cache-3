40|$|Abstract- The {{infrastructure}} in Korea was built after the significant {{growth in the}} economy after 1960. Today, this aged infrastructure has been inappropriately maintained and managed without awareness of <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters.</b> Even though the Korean government established complementary laws and regulations to prevent <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters,</b> these disasters have occurred in various locations and have been presented as social problems, they have also resulted in large social and economic losses. This paper examines both historical reviews and damage assessments and provides improvement to plans for typical <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> including fire, collapse, explosion, traffic accidents, and environmental pollution. The problems caused by <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> showed that disaster responses were not properly carried out {{because of the lack}} of prevention systems or appropriate equipment and facilities and there were no regular safety inspections or appropriate maintenance or repairs of the infrastructure. It is found that the laws related to <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> are very broad, and they overlap across different government organizations. This paper proposes improvement plans to prevent or minimize damages against <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{level of}} insured losses from natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> {{occurred}} in the world from 2012 to 2016 did not exceed 30 - 45 %. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} study another perspective source of financing losses refunding from natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters.</b> The objective of this research is to consider financing losses from natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> by use of crowdfunding, especially in emerging countries. It was defined that the most appropriate model of crowdfunding for financing losses from natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> is donation model with reward-based and donation-based business models. Stimulus for individuals to take part in crowdfunding for financing losses from natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> can be different depending on their location and business model. Sets of assessments based on four categories of questions and method of results visualization were used to examine a country’s readiness for crowdfunding on the example of Ukraine. Complete level of Ukraine’s readiness for crowdfunding was defined. It shows that reward-based crowdfunding is the first stage towards crowdfunding implementation and development. Further research should be done to investigate the mechanism of using a tax discount in case of implementation of the reward-based crowdfunding for financing losses from natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{failure of}} the dam is now {{believed}} to have begun with the eastern abutment of the dam giving way, possibly due to a landslide. This scenario, having {{its roots in the}} works of Willis and Grunsky, was expanded upon by the author Charles Outland in his book <b>Man-Made</b> <b>Disaster</b> : The Story of St. Francis Dam which was first published in 1966. The material on which the eastern abutment of the dam had been built may itself have been part of an ancient landslide, but this would have been impossible for almost any geologists of the 1920s to detect. Indeed, the site had been inspected twice, at different times, by two of the leading geologists and civil engineers of the day, John C. Branner of Stanford University and Carl E. Grunsky; neither found fault with the San Francisquito rock.|$|E

While he had initially gone to discuss with local musicians how to merge politics and music, {{he was able to}} visit several areas affected by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flood, such as the Lower Ninth Ward. As McIlrath had felt that news outlets were quick to discuss less important stories following the disaster, he compiled his thoughts and wrote the song's lyrics. McIlrath also noted that his criticism of the United States government's handling of various disasters influenced the lyrics; he called Hurricane Katrina [...] "as much a <b>man-made</b> <b>disaster</b> as it was a natural disaster", and lambasted the fact that no legislation was passed to prevent another oil spill following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept was}} widely popularized in {{anthropology}} through the book, [...] "The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia" [...] by James C. Scott (1976). The book {{begins with a}} telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live {{so close to the}} subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were [...] "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a [...] "safety first" [...] principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as [...] "traditionalist" [...] when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides [...] "subsistence insurance" [...] for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or <b>man-made</b> <b>disaster</b> strikes. Although fieldwork has not supported many of Scott's conclusions, the book encouraged a generation of researchers.|$|E

40|$|A {{quantitative}} comparison* by In recent decades, {{the world}} has faced {{an increasing number of}} natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters.</b> Such disasters include tsunamis, earthquakes, the current ongoing financial crisis, terrorism, riots, and wars. These disasters generate tremendous social and economic costs, especially for the poor in low income economies. This paper assesses and compares the impacts of various natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> quantitatively. We carefully construct cross-country panel data of 189 countries within the range between 1968 to 2001 {{on a wide variety of}} natural disasters such as hydro-meteorological, geophysical, climatological, technological and biological disasters as well as <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> such as economic crises, civil conflicts and wars. The paper employs this unique panel dataset to estimate econometric models which enable us to quantify and compare the impacts of different natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>disasters</b> on welfare as captured by per capita consumption. According to our estimation results, in the short term, natural disasters generate the largest negative welfare impacts which are followed by wars and economic disasters. Intriguingly, in the long term, natural disasters and wars have positive impacts on per capita GDP growth. Wars affect large economies more than small economies while natural disasters affect small economies disproportionately...|$|R
