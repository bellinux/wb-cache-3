40|$|This {{research}} examined 230 {{reports in}} NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System's (ASRS) database {{to develop a}} better understanding of factors that can affect flight crew performance when crew are faced with inflight aircraft malfunctions. Each report was placed into one of two categories, based on severity of the <b>malfunction.</b> <b>Report</b> analysis was then conducted to extract information regarding crew procedural issues, crew communications and situational awareness. A comparison of these crew factors across malfunction type was then performed. This comparison revealed a significant difference in ways that crews dealt with serious malfunctions compared to less serious malfunctions. The authors offer recommendations toward improving crew performance when faced with inflight aircraft malfunctions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract–The {{existing}} oil-pumping unit (OPU) {{system has}} a high power consuming process. It has the incapability of OPU’s structural health monitoring. A sensor network based intelligent control is proposed for power economy and efficient oilwell health monitoring using wireless sensor network. The proposed system consists of three-level sensors: First level sensors (FLS) – designed with a temperature sensor, a voltage sensor, a current sensor, level sensor, gas sensor and a pressure sensor used for oilwell data sensing. Intelligent sensors (IS) -designed mainly for an oilwell’s data elementary processing, main fault alarm indication, typical storage/indication, data/status transmission up to the third level sensor (TLS), data/status transmission between IS, and command transmission down to the OPU motor. Third level sensors (TLS) - Software-defined (SD) control centres with an embedded database. The TLS are designed for hundreds of oilwell’s data storage/management, data processing malfunction detection, malfunction alarm/indication; stroke-adjustment command transmission down to a specific IS for power economy and the <b>malfunction</b> <b>report</b> to the maintenance staff. Timer, Keyboard, A/D, communication interruptions are controlled by intelligent sensor.

40|$|Abstract: Most oil {{pumping units}} (OPUs) {{have been using}} manual control in the oilfield. This {{existing}} oil-pumping system, a high power-consuming process, has the incapability of OPU’s structural health monitoring. In this paper, a sensor network based intelligent control is proposed for power economy and efficient oil well health monitoring. The proposed sensor network consists of three-level sensors: 1) several types of basic sensors, such as load sensor, angular sensor, voltage sensor, current sensor and oil pressure sensor, which are the first level sensors (FLS), are used for oil well data sensing; 2) our developed intelligent sensors (IS), which belong to the second level sensor, are designed mainly for an oil well’s data elementary processing, main fault alarm/indication, typical data storage/indication, data/status transmission up to the third level sensor (TLS), data/status transmission between IS, and command transmission down to the OPU motor; and 3) our developed software-defined (SD) control centers with an embedded database, i. e., the TLS, are designed for hundreds of oil wells data storage/management, data processing, malfunction detection, malfunction alarm/indication, stroke-adjustment command transmission down to a specific IS for power economy and the <b>malfunction</b> <b>report</b> to the maintenance staff via global system for mobile communications (GSM) short message service (SMS) ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{the case in}} PRA applications that reported plant-specific failure data are, in fact, only estimates which are uncertain.

40|$|Studies on Schizophrenia so far {{reveal a}} complex picture of {{neurological}} <b>malfunctioning</b> <b>reported</b> to be {{strongly associated with}} DAOA. Detailed sequence analyses proved DAOA as a primate specific gene having conserved gene desert region on both upstream and downstream region. The analyses of 10 [*]MB chromosomal region of primates, birds, rodents, and reptiles having DAOA evidenced the conserved part in primates and {{in the rest of}} species, while DAOA is only present in primates. DAOA has four isoforms having one interaction partner DAO. Protein-protein analyses of four DAOA isoforms with DAO were performed individually and find potential interacting residues computationally. It was observed that molecular docking of approved FDA drugs revealed efficient results but there was no common drug with effective binding to all DAOA isoforms. Library of compounds was constructed by virtual screening of 2 D similarity search against recommended SZ drugs in conjunction with their physiochemical properties. Molecular docking resulted in six novel compounds exhibiting maximum binding affinity with selected four DAOA isoforms. However not the entire schizophrenic population responds to the single drug and interestingly in this study six novel compounds having promising results and same binding site to that DAOA that may be used to interact with DAO against four DAOA isoforms were observed...|$|R

40|$|Correctness is {{paramount}} for safety-critical software control systems. Critical software failures in medical radiation treatment, communications, and defense {{are familiar to}} the public. The significant quantity of software <b>malfunctions</b> regularly <b>reported</b> to the software engineering community, the laws concerning liability, and a recent NRC Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board report additionally motivate the use of error-reducing and defect detection software development techniques.

40|$|Abstract—There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{in the field of}} bio-mimetic robots that resemble the shape of an insect or an aquatic animal, among many others. One bio-mimetic robot serves the purpose of exploring pipelines, spotting any troubled areas or <b>malfunctions</b> and <b>reporting</b> its data. Moreover, the robot is able to prepare for and react to any abnormal routes in the pipeline. In order to move effectively inside a pipeline, the robot’s movement will resemble that of a lizard. When situated in massive pipelines with complex routes, the robot places fixed sensors in several important spots in order to complete its monitoring. This monitoring task is to prevent a major system failure by preemptively recognizing any minor or partial malfunctions. Areas uncovered by fixed sensors are usually impossible to provide real-time observation and examination, and thus are dependant on periodical offline monitoring. This paper provides the Monitoring System that is able to monitor the entire area of pipelines—with and without fixed sensors—by using the bio-mimetic robot.
