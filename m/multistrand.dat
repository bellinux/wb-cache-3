40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{mechanical}} properties (force deflection) of five different types of archwires used in initial stage of orthodontic treatment. Materials and methods: A modified three-point bending test was performed on the sample of 75 wires of conventional stainless steel, <b>multistranded</b> stainless steel, superelastic NiTi, thermal NiTi and <b>multistranded</b> coaxial NiTi (15 each). The load exerted by each of the wire was measured at the deflections of 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 mm during loading and subsequent unloading process at 37 °C temperature. Results: Force-deflection diagrams were determined from the passive position to an activation of 2 mm and then during deactivation forces on deactivation (unloading) at a deflection of 0. 5, 1, 1. 5 and 2 mm were compared by post hoc Tukey′s analysis of variance. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) in deactivation forces were observed among wires. The <b>multistranded</b> stainless steel wire had the lowest mean deactivation force (0. 82 N), while the conventional stainless steel group had the highest mean value (3. 56 N). Conclusion: The <b>multistranded</b> coaxial NiTi wires exhibited lighter and more continuous forces hence should be the first choice of wire during the initial stages of treatment followed by thermal NiTi and superelastic NiTi. <b>Multistranded</b> stainless steel wires can also be considered as an economical alternative to more expensive NiTi wires...|$|R

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) -specific {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA) was {{analyzed}} by electrophoresis on 0. 5 % agarose gels. Four classes of RNA were resolved {{as a function}} of mobility in agarose: two classes of slowly migrating <b>multistranded</b> RNA, the infectious viral RNA with intermediate mobility, and a minor fast-moving class of lower-molecular-weight single-stranded RNA. The major RNA species were infectious viral RNA and the slowest migrating class of <b>multistranded</b> RNA. The latter RNA was polydisperse when analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation, it was partially ribonuclease resistant, and it was the predominant RNA species labeled during the initial period of 3 H-uridine triphosphate incorporation in the cell-free system. Heat treatment studies indicated that part of the slowest-moving RNA was degraded at 60 C and almost complete degradation was detected at 100 C. It was concluded that this RNA is the replicative intermediate in viral RNA synthesis. The second class of <b>multistranded</b> RNA contained both a ribonuclease-resistant RNA and a second RNA peak which was detected only after heat treatment at temperatures above 75 C. Fractions of FMDV-specific RNA isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis. Infectious viral RNA was detected only in the 37 S zone and was the major species of RNA {{in this part of the}} gradient. The ribonuclease-resistant RNA (the 20 S zone) contained about equal amounts of <b>multistranded</b> RNA (both classes) and the low-molecular-weight single-stranded RNA.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this {{longitudinal}} prospective randomized study was to evaluate the clinical reliability of {{two different types of}} postorthodontic treatment retainers: a silanised-treated glass fibers-reinforced resin composite (FRC) and a directly bonded <b>multistranded</b> stainless steel wire. The hypothesis {{of the study was to}} assess if significant differences are present between failure rates of the two retainers. Study Design: This prospective study was based on an assessment of 87 patients (35 men and 52 women),with an average age of 24 years who required a lower arch fixed retainer after orthodontic treatment. Patients were divided in two groups. Assignment was carried out with random tables. A follow-up examination was carried out once a month. The number, cause, and date of single bond adhesive failures were recorded for both retainers over 12 months. Teeth that were rebonded after failure were not included in the success analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by means of a Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, and log rank test. Results: Bond failure rate was significantly higher (P= 0. 0392) for <b>multistranded</b> metallic wire than for FRC.

40|$|The sublaminar wiring {{procedure}} {{has been}} commonly used for stabilizing the atlantoaxial complex. <b>Multistrand</b> braided cables {{were introduced in}} the early 1990 s. In previous biomechanical studies these cables were demonstrated to be superior to monofilament wires {{in terms of their}} flexibility, mechanical strength, and fatigue-related characteristics. To the authors' knowledge, they are the first to describe clinically the occurrence of delayed spinal cord compression resulting from <b>multistrand</b> cables after the completion of rigid spinal arthrodesis in the upper cervical spine. Three patients underwent posterior atlantoaxial fusion in which two sublaminar <b>multistrand</b> cables were placed. Between 15 and 48 months postoperatively, they suffered from upper- and lower-extremity numbness as well as gait disturbance. Plain radiography and computerized tomography myelography revealed spinal cord compression caused by the sublaminar cables, although fusion was complete and physiological alignment was maintained at the fused segment. The radiographs obtained immediately after surgery demonstrated that the initial cable placement had been properly performed. The shape of the cable at the initial surgery was oval and then gradually became circular. The anterior arc of the circular shape of the cable in fact led to the spinal cord compression. Considering the mechanism of this late complication, a cable tends to spring open because of its high flexibility and becomes circular shaped even after the complete arthrodesis. When applying <b>multistrand</b> cables for intersegmental fixation at the atlantoaxial complex, delayed complications related to bowing of the cables is possible...|$|E

40|$|Background. Relapse {{following}} {{orthodontic treatment}} {{is a constant}} concern of orthodontists. Fixed retention is preferred especially for the lower arch by most orthodontists. Objectives. This review focuses on in vivo studies. The main objective {{is to determine the}} survival rates of different types of retainer: glass-fiber reinforced composite resin, polyethylene or <b>multistrand</b> stainless steel wire bonded to each tooth from canine to canine in the mandibular arch. A second objective is to assess which of these types is less likely to cause additional problems and the third objective is to evaluate the factors that may influence retainer survival. Results and conclusions. There were 8 studies identified that matched the objectives stated. Current in vivo studies on survival rate take little notice {{of the role of the}} material used for bonding of the fixed retainer. It is not possible to draw a conclusion on reliability of new types of retainers glass fiber reinforced composite resin or polyethylene compared to <b>multistrand</b> stainless steel wire. The <b>multistrand</b> wire remains the gold standard for fixed retention.
