5|$|During the Gorbachev Era, Brezhnev's {{rule was}} {{considered}} less successful {{than that of}} Joseph Stalin; in an opinion measurement poll only 7 percent chose the Brezhnev Era as good, while 10 percent picked the Stalin Era as good. Following {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union and Boris Yeltsin's subsequent market reforms, <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> viewed the Brezhnev era with nostalgia; they missed the stability of that era which had subsequently been lost during the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras.|$|E
5|$|Glinka's anthem was {{replaced}} soon after Yeltsin's successor as President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, first took office on 7 May 2000. The federal legislature established and approved {{the music of}} the National Anthem of the Soviet Union, with newly written lyrics, in December 2000, and became the second anthem used by Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The government sponsored a contest to find lyrics, eventually settling upon a new composition by Mikhalkov; according to the government, the lyrics were selected to evoke and eulogize the history and traditions of Russia. Yeltsin criticized Putin for supporting the reintroduction of the Soviet-era national anthem even though opinion polls showed that <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> favored this decision.|$|E

25|$|Amid {{the social}} and {{economic}} turmoil of the post-Soviet period, <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> viewed Stalin as having overseen an era of order, predictability, and pride. He remains a revered figure among many Russian nationalists, who feel nostalgic about the Soviet victory in World War II, and he is regularly invoked approvingly within both Russia's far-left and far-right.|$|E
25|$|After reestablishing {{independence}} in 1991, Latvia did not automatically grant citizenship to anyone whose forebears arrived after June 1940, {{a policy that}} mainly affected ethnic Russians. Knowledge of Latvian language and history was set {{as a condition for}} obtaining citizenship; these initial conditions have been relaxed thereafter. However, <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> in Latvia still have alien status. As of January 2007, the majority of Latvia's ethnic Russians, 56.5% or 363,988 persons, had citizenship.|$|E

25|$|In July, {{following}} {{a series of}} crises that undermined their authority with the public, {{the head of the}} Provisional Government resigned and was succeeded by Alexander Kerensky, who was more progressive than his predecessor but not radical enough for the Bolsheviks or <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> discontented with the deepening economic crisis and the continuation of the war. While Kerensky's government marked time, the socialist-led soviet in Petrograd joined with soviets that formed throughout the country to create a national movement.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, at {{the urging}} of the Moscow Patriarchate, the Ecumenical Patriarch {{declared}} the charter (tomos) of the Church, as granted in 1923, inoperative. The church ceased to exist until the breakup of the Soviet Union, when divisions within the Orthodox community in Estonia arose between those who claimed that the Moscow Patriarchate has no jurisdiction in Estonia and those who wished to return to the jurisdiction of Moscow. The dispute often took place along ethnic lines, as <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> had immigrated to Estonia during the Soviet occupation. Lengthy negotiations between the two patriarchates failed to produce any agreement.|$|E
25|$|After {{failing to}} force {{its way to}} Étoges, Olsufiev's main body veered to the north {{in an attempt to}} escape. Near La Caure, while {{maneuvering}} to enter a swampy forest, he exposed one of his flanks. Spotting the tactical error, Marmont ordered a brigade of Bordesoulle's cuirassiers to charge. The heavy cavalrymen crashed into the Russian formation, cutting it in two parts. The Russian foot soldiers were completely routed, some of them throwing away their muskets and packs as they scattered into the woods. Marmont ordered the exits blocked and <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> were captured. Udom and his fellow division commander Peter Yakovlevich Kornilov managed to get away with 1,500–2,000 men. That night they reached Port-à-Binson on the Marne after going cross-country. A 19-year old French conscript with fewer than six months of service made Olsufiev a prisoner.|$|E

50|$|The {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union caused a very large immigration wave of Jews from Soviet states. Due to demand from the new immigrants, <b>many</b> <b>Russian</b> language newspapers appeared, and {{with the development of}} the multichannel television in Israel during the 1990s, <b>many</b> <b>Russian</b> channels started being rebroadcast in Israel. In November 2002, a new Israeli-Russian channel, Israel Plus, emerged.|$|R
25|$|While {{most experts}} agreed that a torpedo had exploded, they {{differed}} on {{what caused the}} explosion. <b>Many</b> <b>Russians</b> {{did not believe that}} Kursk could be so easily sunk. The tragedy spawned a number of wild conspiracy theories to explain the disaster. One theory offered was an explosion located in the high-pressure air tanks used to blow the ballast tanks, located near the torpedo tubes. Mainstream publications like Der Spiegel, Berliner Zeitung, and the Sunday Times claimed to possess documentation proving that the submarine was struck by a missile fired by Pyotr Velikiy. This was the largest naval exercise that the Russian navy had conducted in more than a decade, which increased the chances of a friendly fire incident. Other theories included Chechen espionage, human error, sabotage, and that Kursk was testing a new top-secret torpedo, Shkval (Squall), capable of speeds in excess of , for which the Western navies have no defence. Another theory was that USS Memphis had fired a torpedo at Kursk.|$|E
25|$|State {{symbols of}} Russia include the Byzantine double-headed eagle, {{combined}} with St. George of Moscow in the Russian coat of arms; these symbols {{date from the}} time of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The Russian flag appeared in the late Tsardom of Russia period and became widely used during the era of the Russian Empire. The current Russian national anthem shares its music with the Soviet Anthem, though not the lyrics (<b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> of older generations don't know the new lyrics and sing the old ones). The Russian imperial motto God is with us and the Soviet motto Proletarians of all countries, unite! are now obsolete and no new motto has been officially introduced to replace them. The Hammer and sickle and the full Soviet coat of arms are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. Soviet Red Stars are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The Soviet Red Banner is still honored, especially the Banner of Victory of 1945.|$|E
25|$|After her divorce, Maria Pavlovna {{continued}} to work in Paris, but she moved to Boulogne, the south west suburb of Paris, where <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> had taken residence. She began an affair with the famous fashion designer Jean Patou, who was {{ten years older than}} her and with a large fortune. They lived with great luxury appearing together in Parisian society events and spending time in Biarritz, Deauville and on the French Riviera. Rumors of a possible marriage between them spread in 1925, but Patou, a consummated bachelor, was reluctant to change his lifestyle. In 1926, Kitmirs business began to decline. In 1928, as embroidery began to be out of fashion, Maria Pavlovva sold her workshop. Having suffered a defeat, but not surrendering, the grand duchess moved to London in the spring 1928 where she started selling her own perfume, Prince Igor, {{following in the footsteps of}} Chanel No. 5 and Patou's perfume Joy. Failings in advertising and distribution made that Prince Igor was not a success. Undeterred, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna emigrated to the United States hoping for a new start. On 8 December 1928, she set sail for America from Le Havre.|$|E

25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>Russians</b> {{believed}} that tsars and tsarevichs bore special marks {{on their bodies}} symbolising their royal status, which became known as royal marks. Four of the pretenders claiming to be Peter III showed royal marks to legitimise their claims. The first fake Peter to have royal marks was Gavrila Kremnev who Lev Evdokimov recognised because of a cross on Kremnev's foot. Lev Evdokimov claimed that he {{had worked as a}} chorister at the royal palace and had held the real Peter III in his arms as a child therefore giving credibility to Kremnev's claims. Despite Kremnev's marking, he never gained many supporters and was flogged and branded with the words, “deserter and pretender”. The next fake Peter III to show a royal mark of some sort was Fedot Kazin-Bogomolov in 1772. He showed a guard where he was imprisoned a cross on his chest and claimed he had two more on his arm and head allowing him to gain many supporters. The government branded Kazin-Bogomolov despite his markings. The third Peter III with royal marks was the most famous of the four and the most successful pretender of the time, Pugachev. In 1773 Pugachev staged a revealing of his royal identity to a cossack, Eremina Kuritsa, leading other cossacks to challenge Pugachev at dinner, which resulted in him showing scars on his chest and head to the cossacks. Pugachev claimed the scars on his chest were caused from the coup against him and that the scars on his forehead were from smallpox. Pugachev's rational reasoning for his markings caused him to continually gain supporters throughout his stand as a pretender. Unlike the first two pretenders to show royal marks, Pugachev's efforts cost him his life since his punishment was execution. The final pretender during Catherine's reign to reveal royal marks was Makar Mosiakin in 1774. Mosiakin entered a peasant hut claiming to be Peter III and then showed the peasants crosses on his arms, claiming they represented royal inheritance. According to the official report of the Mosiakin he had made the cross marks himself to convince people that he was Peter III and he actually had some success as he managed to gain followers from various villages as he went from house to house.|$|E
500|$|When the USSR's {{economic}} growth stalled in the 1970s, government focus shifted onto improving {{the standard of}} living and housing quality. [...] The standard of living in Russia had fallen behind that of Georgia and Estonia under Brezhnev; this led <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> to believe that the policies of the Soviet Government were hurting the Russian population. To regain support, instead of paying more attention to the stagnant economy, the Soviet leadership under Brezhnev extended social benefits to boost {{the standard of living}}. This did indeed lead to an increase, albeit a minor one, in public support for the regime.|$|E
500|$|Surova {{explains}} to Black that Yaponchik {{has come to}} be regarded by Russians as a sort of evil folkloric figure. Meanwhile, Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) determines that the [...] "V"-like symbol found earlier is actually a fragment of the Chi Rho, a Christian symbol. Watts also informs Black that <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> believe Yaponchik to have directly responsible for the Chernobyl disaster, a Soviet nuclear meltdown tied by some to Biblical prophecies of the apocalypse. Black researches the disaster, finding a picture of both Medikov and Surova at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and realizes that both men have been tracking Yaponchik for revenge.|$|E

500|$|Mark Gevisser {{writes that}} the Kremlin's backing of the law was {{reflective}} of a [...] "dramatic tilt toward homophobia" [...] in Russia {{that began in the}} years preceding the law's passage.

[...] He writes: [...] "Many Russians feel they can steady themselves against this cultural tsunami by laying claim to 'traditional values,' of which rejection of homosexuality is the easiest shorthand. This message plays particularly well for a government wishing to mobilize against demographic decline (childless homosexuals are evil) and cozy up to the Russian Orthodox Church (homosexuals with children are evil)." ...|$|E
500|$|When the USSR's {{economic}} growth stalled in the 1970s, {{the standard of}} living and housing quality improved significantly. Instead of paying more attention to the economy, the Soviet leadership under Brezhnev tried to improve the living standard in the Soviet Union by extending social benefits. This led to an increase, though a minor one, in public support. The standard of living in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) had fallen behind that of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (GSSR) and the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ESSR) under Brezhnev; this led <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> to believe that the policies of the Soviet Government were hurting the Russian population. The state usually moved workers from one job to another, which ultimately became an ineradicable feature in Soviet industry. Government industries such as factories, mines and offices were staffed by undisciplined personnel who put a great effort into not doing their jobs; this ultimately led, according to Robert Service, to a [...] "work-shy workforce". The Soviet Government had no effective counter-measure; it was extremely difficult, if not impossible to replace ineffective workers because of the country's lack of unemployment.|$|E
500|$|The song, {{which they}} {{described}} as a punk moleben (supplicatory prayer), borrowed its opening melody and refrain from Sergei Rachmaninoff's [...] "Bogoroditse Devo, Raduisya" [...] (Ave Maria), from the All Night Vigil. In the song, they invoked {{the name of the}} Virgin Mary, urging her to get rid of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and to [...] "become a feminist", claiming that she would support them in their protests. They alluded to close ties between the church and the KGB ("Black robes, golden epaulettes"), criticized the subservience of <b>many</b> <b>Russians</b> to the church ("Parishioners crawl bowing") and attacked the church's traditionalist views on women ("So as not to offend His Holiness, women must bear children and love"). They used the crude epithet [...] "Sran Gospodnya", which has been used to translate [...] "holy shit" [...] in Hollywood movies, but is rarely used in idiomatic Russian; it literally translates as [...] "shit of the Lord". They later explained [...] "It is an idiomatic expression, related to the previous verse – about the fusion of Moscow patriarchy and the government. 'Holy shit' is our evaluation of the situation in the country." [...] They referred to Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill I, as a [...] "suka" [...] (bitch) and accused him of believing more in Putin than in God.|$|E
