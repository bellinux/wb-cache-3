5|$|Although court {{entertainments}} {{were few}} after the Prince Consort's death, Beatrice and the Queen enjoyed tableau vivant photography, which was often {{performed at the}} royal residences. Henry, increasingly bored {{by the lack of}} activity at court, longed for employment, and in response, the Queen made him Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889. However, he yearned for military adventure and pleaded with his mother-in-law to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the Anglo-Asante war. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and Beatrice parted on 6 December 1895; they would not <b>meet</b> <b>again.</b> Henry contracted malaria and was sent home. On 22 January 1896, Beatrice, who was waiting for her husband at Madeira, received a telegram informing her of Henry's death two days earlier.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin {{spent the}} summer of 1851 abroad, {{including}} a visit to Paris to see Natalie and Ninette. He was still away in October 1851, when the Whigs nominated him for the state Senate. Despite his absence, he was easily elected. When the new legislature met in January 1852, Benjamin {{emerged as one of}} the leading Whig candidates for election to the U.S. Senate seat that would become vacant on March 4, 1853. As the Louisiana legislature, responsible for electing the state's senators, met once in two years under the 1845 constitution, it was not scheduled to <b>meet</b> <b>again</b> before the seat became vacant. Some Whig newspapers thought Benjamin too young and inexperienced at forty, despite his undoubted talent, but the Whig legislative caucus selected him on the second ballot, and he was elected by the two houses over Democrat Solomon W. Downs.|$|E

The final 387 Virginia Tech victory was the biggest win in Virginia Tech bowl game history, and Moore was named the game's most valuable player. The two teams did not <b>meet</b> <b>again</b> until the 2009 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game on September 5, 2009.|$|E
