He could not care for her so much as she cared for him! He was a man; men soon forget! Ah! {{but he was not}} like most men. One could not look at his eyes without feeling that he could suffer terribly! In all this her own reputation concerned her not at all. Life, and her clear way of looking at things, had rooted in her the conviction that to a woman the preciousness of her reputation was a fiction invented by men entirely for man's benefit; a second-hand fetish insidiously, inevitably set-up by men for worship, in novels, plays, and law-courts. Her instinct told her that men could not feel secure in the possession of their women unless they could believe that women set tremendous store by sexual reputation. What they wanted to believe, that they did believe! But she knew otherwise. Such great-minded women as she had met or read of had always left on her the impression that reputation for them was a matter of the spirit, having little to do with sex. From her own feelings she knew that reputation, for a simple woman, meant to stand well in the eyes of him or her whom she loved best. For worldly women--and there were so many kinds of those, besides the merely fashionable--she had always noted that its value was not intrinsic, but commercial; not a crown of dignity, but just a <b>marketable</b> <b>asset.</b> She did not dread in the least what people might say of her friendship with Miltoun; nor did she feel at all that her indissoluble marriage forbade her loving him. She had secretly felt free as soon as she had discovered that she had never really loved her husband; she had only gone on dutifully until the separation, from sheer passivity, and because it was against her nature to cause pain to anyone. The man who was still her husband was now as dead to her as if he had never been born. She could not marry again, it was true; but she could and did love. If that love was to be starved and die away, it would not be because of any moral scruples.|$|E
40|$|Although FDI {{have been}} at the {{forefront}} of economic debate since a long time, economists have not yet developed a unified framework for their investigation. In this article, we put forward the idea that an essential point to analyze FDI concerns their underpinning motives. Motives are at the core of FDI and FDI are only but one of different alternative means for firms to grasp an opportunity in a foreign country. We discuss the factors that shape the set of available alternatives and analyze those affecting the decision to engage in FDI (internalisation determinants), along with those influencing their localisation (localisation determinants). Starting from Dunning (1993) we put forward a revised taxonomy of FDI motives consistent with this framework – resource seeking, market seeking and non- <b>marketable</b> <b>asset</b> seeking. In order to show its practical implications, we survey common empirical issues on FDI showing how our analysis can shed light on seemingly contradictory empirical results...|$|E

The ship operator's decision is framed as an option to exchange the risky income stream of one strategy (asset) for the maximum of several alternatives as uncertainty is resolved over time. Copeland's and Antikarov's <b>Marketable</b> <b>Asset</b> Disclaimer is invoked; the intrinsic values of the underlying assets and their volatilities and correlations are modelled using traditional discounted cash flow techniques. The option is valued numerically in a multinomial tree.

A sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the value of the flexible strategy as both the levels of uncertain factors and their volatilities change.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 These three papers address {{uncertainty}} in the management and valuation of renewable natural resources. The first paper develops a model to integrate both stock and price uncertainty to obtain optimal resource levels. The model {{is an extension of}} Reed (1974) and shows by proof and by example that when prices can fall below costs, considering stochastic prices is an important element of resource management. The second paper considers the valuation of a United States Forest Service timber harvest contract. The tools and methods of mathematical finance are applied to a timber contract auction to obtain an arbitrage free minimum bid. These methods provide managers with an objective measure to integrate the effects of interest rates, costs, price volatility and contract duration into the contract bid. The third paper fine tunes the exploration of arbitrage-free valuation of natural resource contracts. The paper shows that traditional market-based instruments are not sufficient to hedge contracts on undeveloped resources, such as standing trees {{in the case of the}} Forest Service. Rather, a market-based valuation proxy for the undeveloped resource must be obtained. The contribution of this approach is that it shows the consistency of financial theory for use with nonmarket assets. Also, the results provide a framework within which convenience yield measures for holding the developed, or <b>marketable</b> <b>asset,</b> may be determined. This is important because failure to account for convenience yields results in arbitrage opportunities leaving the contract writer exposed to risk from price fluctuations. These papers offer resource managers the rationale and tools for integrating price {{uncertainty in}}to management plans. They suggest that under uncertainty, harvest levels should be more conservative when prices can fall below harvest costs, and that contract values should be adjusted to accommodate the writer's exposure to lost revenue...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to clarify}} that {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) {{has come a long}} way by the prevailing business case approach, but increasingly hits a glass ceiling. The glass ceiling metaphor refers to the inherent limitations created by a business case approach towards CSR. Design/methodology/approach – The main findings are based on an analysis of existing literature on strategies for CSR. The findings are illustrated with a case from the Dutch National Research Program on CSR. Findings – The very term corporate social responsibility suggests that the debate about CSR is all about responsibilities of corporations. Maybe it once was, but nowadays it is much more about new market opportunities and a business-wise approach to ecological and social problems. CSR has evolved into a <b>marketable</b> <b>asset</b> of companies, in which profit-oriented managers and entrepreneurs are willing to invest. This ‘‘commodification’’ of CSR has helped to make it acceptable in the business world, but this comes at a considerable price from the perspective of the social responsibility of business. It is especially argued in the paper that a business case approach results in opportunism, leaves institutional blockades intact and drives out the intrinsic motivation for engaging in CSR. Research limitations/implications – Because of the chosen conceptual research approach, the propositions put forward in the paper need further grounding in empirical research. Practical implications – In order to shatter this glass ceiling, managers have to deal with a paradoxical situation. They should maintain their appreciation of economic constraints and at the same time combine this with a sincere recognition of moral values. This at least requires that managers should show commitment to certain social values, be able to defend it in good and bad times and prepare all employees to deal with the inherent dilemmas of bearing different responsibilities. Originality/value – Although the paper builds on earlier articles on limitations of a business case approach, it is the first paper to argue for a glass ceiling of CSR created by the inherent limitations of such an approach...|$|E
40|$|The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that, in the {{foreseeable}} future, climate change will exacerbate water problems worldwide. In the United States, {{we are likely to}} see more severe flooding, more frequent droughts, and a rush to secure legal rights to water supplies. Sustainable management of water resources for present and future generations will become all the more imperative as we face increasing pressure on limited supplies. The quest for sustainable management has stimulated a movement for greater recognition of private property rights to attain efficient use and allocation of water. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have encouraged nations in the developing world to conform to a market paradigm by privatizing their water supplies. Affected communities are often less than enthusiastic. Throughout the world, attempts to privatize water resources have triggered a "morality play of rights versus markets, human need versus corporate greed. " The controversy, however, is not limited to developing countries. One of the most divisive issues in contemporary natural resources law in the United States is whether interests in water are property. Absent legally recognized property rights, water markets are unlikely to thrive. According to the Restatement of Property, the term "property" describes "legal relations between persons with respect to a thing. " Of course, not all economic relationships give rise to property rights. Judicial treatment of water is all over the map. The Court of Federal Claims awarded California irrigators millions of dollars as compensation for a regulatory taking of their water rights when flows were curtailed to protect endangered salmon, but a different panel of the same court subsequently took that opinion to task for failing to consider whether interests in water are property. Other federal and state courts have reached contradictory results as well. To unbundle the concept of property in water, this Article uses a web of interests as a strong yet flexible metaphor for property, complemented by a patterning definition representing elemental strands of the web. If the interest in question is not an irrevocable interest in the exclusive possession and use of a discrete, <b>marketable</b> <b>asset,</b> it is not property for purposes of regulatory takings under the Fifth Amendment. Viewed through this lens, interests in water in most jurisdictions are not takings property, although they may be a form of property for purposes of due process or common law claim...|$|E

We endogenize the profits of the intermediary and derive distinct liquidity and solvency conditions that determine whether a run can be prevented. We first characterize these conditions for an isolated intermediary and then generalize them to the case where the intermediary can sell assets to prevent runs. The sale of assets can eliminate runs if the intermediary is solvent but illiquid. However, because of cash-in-the-market pricing, this becomes less likely the more intermediaries are facing problems. In the limit, in case of a general market run, no intermediary can sell assets to forestall a run, and our original solvency and liquidity constraints are again relevant for the stability of financial institutions. ...|$|R

Such “supervisory discrimination ” in terms of risk weights gives rise to the moral hazard problem in that the regulator fails to reduce the risk-taking incentives of institutions. The internal model approach does not necessarily provide the capital savings to encourage the institutions to develop internal models. Since the capital savings will occur only in the case of low-risk institutions, the high-risk institutions, which need to introduce an internal model to improve their risk management, will choose the standardized method as their tool for calculating capital requirements.

Heretofore, low-income and distressed communities attracted resources on the basis of their deficits and lack of <b>marketable</b> <b>assets.</b> Today, however, with new immigration and the opening of inner-city areas to new flows of private capital, community-based institutions must find ways to find value in previously un-valued or undervalued assets. Arbitrage is one of the principle capital market value formation tools.

He contributes the $1,000,000 in cash, and then gives his son the 50% Limited Partner interest. The fair market value is not 50% of the $1,000,000 although at first it might seem this is the case.

2500|$|Although Social Security is {{sometimes}} compared to private pensions, {{the two systems}} are different {{in a number of}} respects. It has been argued that Social Security is an insurance plan as opposed to a retirement plan. Unlike a pension, for example, Social Security pays disability benefits. A private pension fund accumulates the money paid into it, eventually using those reserves to pay pensions to the workers who contributed to the fund; and a private system is not universal. Social Security cannot [...] "prefund" [...] by investing in <b>marketable</b> <b>assets</b> such as equities, because federal law prohibits it from investing in assets other than those backed by the U.S. government. As a result, its investments to date have been limited to special non-negotiable securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, although some argue that debt issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association and other quasi-governmental organizations could meet legal standards. Social Security cannot by law invest in private equities, although some other countries (such as Canada) and some states permit their pension funds to invest in private equities. As a universal system, Social Security generally operates as a pipeline, through which current tax receipts from workers are used to pay current benefits to retirees, survivors, and the disabled. When there is an excess of taxes withheld over benefits paid, by law this excess is invested in Treasury securities (not in private equities) as described above.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{three primary}} aspects: {{an analysis of}} the actual inflation-interest rate relationship in the American economy for the 1953 - 1979 and 1953 - 1983 periods in both the short-run and the long-run, a description and analysis of the failure of other real interest rate models to adequately account for the apparent failure of a "full" Fisher effect to operate, and empirical tests of a model (with some variations of it as well) which sheds light on the phenomenon of the underadjustment of nominal rates to inflation even when the longest of runs is taken into account. The essential notion underlying the model is that highly <b>marketable</b> financial <b>assets</b> yield liquidity services {{in the sense that the}} holding of them allows an agent to reduce his transactions costs of exchange. Given that the real return on money, which possesses ultimate liquidity, is the negative of the inflation rate then it follows that the real returns on assets which are relatively close to money in terms of liquidity services yielded by them should also fall in the face of increased inflation. The degree to which the real return on any particular asset declines is positively related to its 'moneyness'. Thus the returns on the longer term, relatively illiquid financial assets should be more subject to a full Fisher effect than those on the more <b>marketable</b> <b>assets.</b> The first chapter reviews some of the theoretical and empirical work on the Fisher effect and offers a detailed explanation of the basic model. An appendix deals with a transactions cost model of underadjustment which has a more explicit role for trading costs. Chapter 2 presents the empirical evidence on underadjustment in the short and long runs and critically reviews some work of others attempting to account for a less than complete Fisher effect. Chapter 3 deals with direct tests of the model's more important implications concerning the degree of adjustment of nominal rates to inflation with respect to an asset's liquidity. In Chapter 4 the hypothesis is entertained and empirically tested that some unexplained 'excess returns' found by researchers of the asset pricing model of security returns represent liquidity premia of the type dealt with in the model. Finally, Chapter 5 summarizes some of the thesis' more important conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many {{governments and}} health care {{providers}} worldwide are enthusiastic to develop medical tourism as a service export. Despite the popularity of this policy uptake, there is relatively little known about the specific local factors prospectively motivating and informing development of this sector. Objective: To identify common social, economic, and health system factors shaping the development of medical tourism in three Central American and Caribbean countries and their health equity implications. Design: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in Mexico, Guatemala, and Barbados with 150 health system stakeholders. Participants were recruited from private and public sectors working in various fields: trade and economic development, health services delivery, training and administration, and civil society. Transcribed interviews were coded using qualitative data management software, and thematic {{analysis was used to}} identify cross-cutting issues regarding the drivers and inhibitors of medical tourism development. Results: Four common drivers of medical tourism development were identified: 1) unused capacity in existing private hospitals, 2) international portability of health insurance, vis-a-vis international hospital accreditation, 3) internationally trained physicians as both <b>marketable</b> <b>assets</b> and industry entrepreneurs, and 4) promotion of medical tourism by public export development corporations. Three common inhibitors {{for the development of the}} sector were also identified: 1) the high expense of market entry, 2) poor sector-wide planning, and 3) structural socio-economic issues such as insecurity or relatively high business costs and financial risks. Conclusion: There are shared factors shaping the development of medical tourism in Central America and the Caribbean that help explain why it is being pursued by many hospitals and governments in the region. Development of the sector is primarily being driven by public investment promotion agencies and the private health sector seeking economic benefits with limited consideration and planning for the health equity concerns medical tourism raises...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. economy's nonfinancial {{debt ratio}} has risen since 1980 {{to a level}} that is {{extraordinary}} in comparison with prior historical experience. Approximately one-half of this rise has consisted of increased indebtedness (relative to income) of borrowers in the economy's private sector, including both individuals and businesses, and it therefore at least potentially represents {{an increase in the}} economy-wide exposure to debt default. The U. S. household sector as a whole has increased its holdings of liquid and other readily <b>marketable</b> <b>assets,</b> so that in the aggregate its balance sheet is no less sound than before, but available data make it doubtful that the distribution of the additional assets matches the distribution of the additional debt closely enough to avoid debt service problems {{in the event of a}} general economic contraction. By contrast, in the case of businesses, including especially the corporate sector, there are no additional assets to match the additional liabilities, so that balance sheets as well as incomes have become more leveraged. The chief implication of this increased exposure to the threat of financial instability is not only that the U. S. economy is likely to be more prone to financial instability in the event of a major business contraction, but also [...] and perhaps more importantly [...] that, as a result, U. S. economic policymakers are likely to be more reluctant either to seek or to tolerate a business recession in the first place. Experience suggests that it will be difficult 'to balance the desire to avoid economic downturns with the ability to avoid occasional periods of aggregate excess demand, so that this increased reluctance to tolerate recessions probably implies a more expansionary monetary policy on average than would otherwise be the case. Experience also suggests that a plausible result of such a no-recession monetary policy, sustained over time, is price inflation. This process is self-limiting, however, in that over time inflation reduces the real value of the private sector's outstanding nominal indebtedness, hence reducing the risk of financial instability, and thereby removing the source of policymakers' increased reluctance to tolerate recessions. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether {{distance}} education activities at two community colleges have followed the revenue-generating pattern of research institutions under the Bayh-Dole Act (1980). The study relied on the academic capitalism framework described by Slaughter and Rhoades (2004) to examine whether the incentives under the Copyright Act (1976), as amended in 1998 and 2002, resulted in institutional policies, networks, and shifts in academy practices that could transform distance education goods and services into <b>marketable</b> <b>assets.</b> My study also sought to identify and examine the economic, political, and social forces that positioned distance education activities at each campus in service of either the public good regime or academic capitalism regime. The evidence suggested that the convergence of these forces in approximately 2008 resulted in record student enrollment that continued through 2012 before appearing to stabilize in 2013. During this period, increased distance education opportunities contributed to higher tuition revenues. In contrast, the predominant attitude shared among faculty and staff was the desire to increase access to instruction through distance education to help prepare a diverse student population for employment in the new economy. As predicted by Slaughter and Rhoades (2004), distance education was an area in higher education where the competing interests represented by the academic capitalist regime and the public good regime would intersect. However, the forces that gave rise to record enrollment did not provide sufficient impetus at either campus to position distance education as an entrepreneurial activity. Although the intersection of the competing interests of the respective regimes seemed to contribute to distance education’s reputation as a quality instructional option, ensuring its permanent role within the entire university system, steps towards institutionally owned distance education assets have only recently been undertaken. First, the National Science Foundation awarded Campus 1 a $ 5 million grant in 2014 to develop an online pre-engineering curriculum that would be shared with two other community colleges. Second, Campus 2 has begun providing online course design and development services to other community colleges under a revenue sharing arrangement, and has fielded inquires by private sector employers to develop customized instructional modules for their employees. Given the potential for institutional ownership or control of the distance education assets or services outside of existing policies, networks, and shifts in academy practices, a future study might track the progress of these independent activities to ascertain whether the academic capitalism regime had emerged...|$|R
