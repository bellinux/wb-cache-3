The US Air Force commissioned the SADT developers to develop a function model method for analyzing and communicating the functional perspective of a system. IDEF0 should assist in organizing system analysis and promote effective communication between the analyst and the customer through simplified graphical devices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Primary {{children}} in Singapore {{are taught to}} use the <b>model</b> <b>method</b> to solve word problems. With the <b>model</b> <b>method</b> children are required to interpret information presented in three modes – text, structural and procedural. This paper discusses how 151 eleven year old primary children used the <b>model</b> <b>method</b> to help them solve a series of increasingly complex word problems. These children from five primary schools were asked to use the <b>model</b> <b>method</b> to solve word problems in a one-hour long pencil and paper mathematics test. Children’s responses to these items were analysed according to how they used the <b>model</b> <b>method</b> to solve word problems. The findings showed that those children who successfully used the <b>model</b> <b>method</b> to solve word problems had to be competent at five levels – reading, comprehending and transforming, processing and relating. Also these children carried out many mental processes which were not recorded. The paper concludes that the <b>model</b> <b>method</b> did help children solve word problems. Because of its very visual nature, models constructed by children provided evidence into the types of difficulties children had solving word problems. Therefore these models provide teachers with visual clues as to {{what are some of}} the conceptual difficulties faced by {{children in}} solving word problems and hence offer possibilities how to help children with such difficulties...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of service-oriented architectures (SOA) in the enterprise context promises many advantages. For example, by composing existing services new capabilities {{can be provided}} quickly allowing a fast and agile reaction to changing market conditions. In order to support companies in a successful adoption of SOA, service-orientation must be integrated in their enterprise architecture. Many companies made high investments in the past modelling their enterprise architecture based on different <b>modelling</b> <b>methods.</b> The {{introduction of}} SOA is fostered if existing models can be reused and investments are preserved.

In order to circumvent this problem, a novel entropy-based criterion is proposed as the objective function of several commonly used <b>modeling</b> <b>methods,</b> i. e. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network, Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system, for fermentation process model in this study.
