40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of signal {{parameter}} estimation from measurements acquired by a low-complexity analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with 1 -bit output resolution and an unknown quantization threshold is considered. Single-comparator ADCs are energy-efficient and can be operated at ultra-high sampling rates. For analysis of such hard-limiting systems, a fixed and known quantization threshold is usually assumed. In the symmetric case, i. e., zero hard-limiting offset, it is well-understood that in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime the signal processing performance <b>degrades</b> <b>moderately</b> by 2 /π (- 1. 96 dB) when comparing to an ideal ∞-bit converter. Due to hardware imperfections, low-complexity 1 -bit ADCs will in practice exhibit an unknown threshold different from zero. Therefore, the offset has to be estimated jointly with the signal parameters. Here we study the estimation accuracy which can be obtained with receive data preprocessed by a hard-limiter with unknown quantization level. In order to characterize the achievable performance, we employ analytic error expressions for different setups while modeling the offset as a nuisance parameter. In the low SNR regime we establish the necessary condition for a vanishing loss due to missing offset knowledge at a receiver with 1 -bit ADC. We then validate our analysis by visualizing the quantization loss under an unknown 1 -bit threshold when wireless intersymbol interference (ISI) channel estimation is performed. Finally, we verify the results by Monte-Carlo simulations of asymptotically optimal estimation algorithms...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} signal {{parameter}} estimation and tracking with measurement data of low resolution is considered. In comparison to an ideal receiver with infinite receive resolution, the performance {{loss of a}} simplistic receiver with 1 -bit resolution is investigated. For the case where the measurement data is preprocessed by a symmetric hard-limiting device with 1 -bit output, it is well-understood that the performance for low SNR channel parameter estimation <b>degrades</b> <b>moderately</b> by 2 /pi (- 1. 96 dB). Here we show that the 1 -bit quantization loss can be significantly smaller if information about the temporal evolution of the channel parameters is {{taken into account in}} the form of a state-space model. By the analysis of a Bayesian bound for the achievable tracking performance, we attain the result that the quantization loss in dB is in general smaller by a factor of two if the channel evolution is slow. For the low SNR regime, this is equivalent to a reduced loss of sqrt(2 /pi) (- 0. 98 dB). By simulating non-linear filtering algorithms for a satellite-based ranging application (GPS) and a UWB channel estimation problem, both with low-complexity 1 -bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver, we verify that the analytical characterization of the tracking error is accurate. This shows that the performance loss due to observations with low amplitude resolution can, in practice, be much less pronounced than indicated by classical results. Finally, we discuss the implication of the result for medium SNR applications like channel estimation in the context of mobile wireless communications...|$|R

The Xilingol steppe grassland in Inner Mongolia, China, {{which has been a}} sink area for dust for centuries, is strongly affected by the negative effects of overgrazing and wind erosion. The aim of this study is the provision of a wind erosion risk map with a spatial high resolution of 25 m to identify actual source and sink areas. In an integrative approach, field measurements of vegetation features and surface roughness length z 0 were combined with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image data for a land use classification. To determine the characteristics of the different land use classes, a field observation (ground truth) was performed in April 2009. The correlation of vegetation height and z 0 (R 2 = 0. 8, n = 55) provided the basis for a separation of three main classes, “grassland”, “non-vegetation” and “other”. The integration of the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and the spectral information from the atmospheric corrected ASTER bands 1, 2 and 3 (visible to near-infrared) led to a classification of the overall accuracy (OA) of 0. 79 with a kappa () statistic of 0. 74, respectively. Additionally, a digital elevation model (DEM) was used to identify topographical effects in relation to the main wind direction, which enabled a qualitative estimation of potential dust deposition areas.

40|$|When {{listening}} to speech under adverse conditions, expectancies resulting from semantic context {{can have a}} strong impact on comprehension. Here we ask how minimal variations in semantic context (cloze probability) affect the unfolding comprehension of acoustically degraded speech. Three main results are observed in the brain electric response. First, auditory evoked responses to a degraded sentence's onset (N 100) correlate with participants' comprehension scores, but are generally more vigorous for more degraded sentences. Second, a pronounced N 400 in response to low-cloze sentence-final words, reflecting the integration effort of words into context, increases linearly with improving speech intelligibility. Conversely, transient enhancement in Gamma band power (γ, ~ 40 – 70 Hz) during high-cloze sentence-final words (~ 600 ms) reflects top-down-facilitated integration. This γ-band effect also varies parametrically with signal quality. Third, a negative correlation of N 100 amplitude at sentence onset and the later γ-band response is found in <b>moderately</b> <b>degraded</b> speech. This reflects two partly distinct neural strategies when dealing with <b>moderately</b> <b>degraded</b> speech; a more “bottom-up,” resource-allocating, and effortful versus a more “top-down,” associative and facilitatory strategy.

40|$|The {{importance}} of accurately monitoring rangeland degradation dynamics over decades is increasing in Linxia rangeland, {{the birthplace of}} the Yellow River in China. Since 2000, the Chinese government has implemented the “Grain for Green” program and enforced a grazing ban in Gansu province, one of the most degraded provinces, to mitigate the problem of rangeland degradation. The effects of these policies are controversial and have become a topic of public concern. In this study, a grading system was established for the estimation of Linxia rangeland degradation. Degrees of rangeland degradation were interpreted and the spatio-temporal dynamics of the degraded rangeland through several study periods were mapped and monitored using the Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis method on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) /ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) images for the years of 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011. The results demonstrated that the time around the year 2001 appeared to be a turning point of the rangeland degradation reversion course, as the rangeland degradation reversed significantly since 2001. From 1996 to 2001, the total degraded area in Linxia rangeland increased from 2922. 01 km 2 to 3048. 48 km 2 (+ 4. 33 %), and decreased by 4. 54 % to 2909. 97 km 2 in 2011; the non-degraded rangeland gradually increased from 602. 74 km 2 to 710. 01 km 2, an increase of 17. 80 %.

40|$|Croplands in {{smallholder}} farming {{areas of}} Southern Africa {{are in a}} degraded state, with most cereal and legume crops yielding less than 1 t ha- 1 of grain. Restoring productivity of these degraded croplands is therefore key to intensifying crop production to meet household food and nutritional security needs. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate sequences of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technology components for rehabilitation of degraded sandy soils and intensification of maize (Zea mays L.) -based cropping systems in Hwedza and Makoni smallholder farming areas in Eastern Zimbabwe. Farmer participatory research approaches, laboratory characterization, remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems were first employed to formulate criteria for assessing degradation of croplands. Second, field experiments were conducted to evaluate alternate sequences of ISFM options based on nitrogen (N) -fixing green manure and grain legumes, low quality organic resources and mineral N and phosphorus (P) fertilizers for rehabilitating the degraded croplands. Third, biophysical data generated from field experimentation were combined with simulation modelling to best-fit the ISFM sequences to different resource categories of farmers. Farmers delineated croplands as productive, <b>moderately</b> productive, <b>degraded</b> and severely degraded based on common indicator weeds, crop performance and soil physical attributes. Overall, laboratory-based soil chemical and biological properties, and most of the weed species closely matched farmer categorization. Spatially, forty percent of the arable land was classified as degraded to severely degraded. Over a 3 -year period, rehabilitation of the degraded sandy soils was positively influenced by high quality organic resource application and P fertilization. Indigenous legumes and sunnhemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) planted on otherwise degraded soils, with addition of mineral P fertilizer, led to higher biomass C and N production than under natural fallow. A combination of biomass generated under indigenous legume fallow (indifallow) and sunnhemp fallow, and cattle manure increased soil basal respiration and microbial biomass. Maize grain yields averaged 2. 5 t ha- 1 under the legume-based sequences compared with 1 t ha- 1 under continuous fertilized maize and natural fallow-based options. Over a 4 -year period, ISFM sequences based on cattle manure/woodland litter-, NP fertilizer- and legume-based rotations accumulated the highest maize and soyabean grain yields. This was largely explained by a significant accumulation of soil P. These sequences were more productive than farmersâ€™ designated most-and least-productive fields. Cattle manure-based sequences gave the highest cumulative crop yields, while sunnhemp-based sequences attained the highest increase in soil P. Based on costs of seed, fertilizers and labour, the ISFM sequences gave better financial returns than the farmersâ€™ most-and least-productive fields. When assessed over a 49 -year period (1962 - 2011) using Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) under agronomic management of different resource categories of farmers, simulated maize yields of the ISFM sequencing options averaged 3. 8, 2. 4 and 1. 8 t ha- 1 for resource-endowed, resource-intermediate and resource-constrained households, respectively. The major conclusions from this study were as follows: (i) ethnopedological approaches could aid assessment of soil degradation on smallholder farms to inform decision-making, (ii) degraded croplands are not beyond remedy, and ISFM sequences based on herbaceous legumes are potential entry points to rehabilitate them and (iii) ISFM sequences are a suitable option for intensifying smallholder cropping systems in Southern Africa through increasing crop yields to meet energy and protein requirements of households, and allowing for systematic allocation of the often limited and variable nutrient, seed and labour resources in space and time., 1.

40|$|Aims Overgrazing is a {{key factor}} driving {{grassland}} degradation in arid and semiarid regions. In this study, we explored how spatial and temporal patterns of grassland degradation were linked to vegetation sensitivity and socioeconomic drivers in the Xilin River Basin, Inner Mongolia, China. Methods We categorized grassland degradation by species composition and community characteristics by comparing a 1980 ’s vegetation map with data from field surveys done in 1984 and 2004 across the Xilin River Basin. Five types of grasslands were distinguished: non-degraded, slightly degraded, <b>moderately</b> <b>degraded,</b> heavily degraded,and extremely degraded. We also classified two additional types of grasslands based on their conditions 20 years ago: salinized and restored grasslands. Important findings The distribution of degraded grasslands exhibited an obvious spatial pattern across the Xilin River Basin. In general, the degree of grassland degradation increased from upstream in the southeast to downstream in the northwest of the basin. <b>Moderately</b> <b>degraded</b> grasslands were distributed mostly in the southeast, andheavily degraded and salinized grasslands were located in areas close {{to the river and}} over much of the Hunshandak sandland. Extremely degraded grasslands were distributed throughout {{the northern part of the}} basin where ecosystems were more vulnerable to over grazing. Non-degraded and slightly degraded grasslands were scattered patchily across the basin. In contrast, some abandoned farmlands and fenced pastures rested from grazing showed restoration over the past two decades. Grassland degradation in the basin also showed vegetation-type specific characteristics. About 43 % of the shrubland was slightly degraded. More than 50 % of Festuca ovina and Ulmus pumila dominated grasslands were <b>moderately</b> <b>degraded,</b> and half of the Stipa baicalensis and Bromus inermis dominated grasslands were heavily degraded. For both Stipa krylovii and Caragana microphylla dominated grasslands, more than 50 % of the total areas were extremely degraded. For Leymus chinensis grassland, only small part of the total area had been degraded. Based on our analysis, overgrazing is the most important socioeconomic factor driving grassland degradation in the Xilin River Basin. The grassland degradation was positively correlated with increasing stocking rate from the 1970 ’s to 2004. Other factors, such as shifts in the density of villages and network of roads, were also attributed to the widespread grassland degradation in the Xilin River Basin...|$|E

This study was applied on scots pine wood (Pinus sylvestris L.) degraded by fungi after treatment with a biocidal product followed by consolidation with a polymeric product. This solution avoids substitutions of wood <b>moderately</b> <b>degraded</b> by fungi, improving its physical and mechanical characteristics. The consolidation efficiency was assessed on site by methods of drill resistance and penetration resistance. The SDT methods used showed good sensitivity to the conservation process and could evaluate their effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (1) to determine if there is any soil degradation as indicated by soil fertility declines and soil erosion; (2) to understand soil P dynamics under different land uses; and (3) to determine if pasture degradation can be evaluated by plant cover, plant species changes, and soil erosion. This study, conducted on sub-alpine grasslands in Gansu, China, deals with the impacts of land use on soil fertility, P dynamics, soil erosion, and above ground vegetation. Land uses include three magnitudes of pasture degradation, lightly (LDGP), moderately (MDGP), and heavily degraded pasture (HDGP), and cultivated fields varying 1 to 50 years of cultivation. Soil samples were collected from 18 sites at seven locations, from either Chemozemic or Castanozemic (Chestnut) soils lying between 2, 600 to 3, 000 in above sea level (ASL). To determine if there were any influences of pasture degradation and cultivation on soil fertility and soil erosion, nutrients-associated with macro-organic matter,total N, P, K, CEC, pH and EC were analyzed. The activity of 137 Cs was determined to estimate soil erosion as well. In HDGP, soil CEC, total C and total N dropped by 18 %, 33 %, and 28 %, respectively, on a regional scale compared to LDGP. Furthermore, cultivating grasslands significantly decreased soil CEC, organic C and total N by 21 %, 59 % and 52 %, respectively, after 30 to 50 years' cultivation. Soil pH also significantly increased with longer cultivation. With soil degradation, soil EC increased in previously saline soils, but decreased in non-saline soil. Cultivation also increased the proportion of water-soluble Na from 7 % in LDGP to 22 % of total soluble cations after 41 years' cultivation at Tianzhu-A/B. Soil erosion and mineralization of organic matter were responsible for lower soil CEC, organic C, total N, and soil macro-organic matter. The concentration of 137 CS was significantly reduced when pasture was heavily degraded, or was put into crop production. More than half of 137 Cs activity in soil was lost with 30 to 50 years' cultivation compared to LDGP. Topography and climatic differences had a great influence on soil erosion. Pasture degradation, cultivation and erosion also caused changes in soil P dynamics. Phosphorus fractionation showed that more labile P was found in LDGP compared to HDGP. Cultivation and fertilization significantly raised labile P and Ca-Pi levels. Mineralization of organic P, incorporation of sub-soil by tillage following erosion, and fertilization were major sources of Ca-Pi in cultivated fields. In general, Fe- and Al-associated Pi was higher after pasture was cultivated. Soil organic P, especially the moderately labile fraction extracted by NaOH, declined with pasture degradation and cultivation. Once pasture became heavily degraded, changes in plant species composition and plant cover were observed. A 99 % plant cover was found in LDGP, while the lowest plant cover of 62 % was observed in HDGP. The plant palatability index (PI) was developed in this study based on numbers of individual plants inside of the quadrat and their assigned numerical values. Results showed that the PI decreased from 205 in LDGP to 173 in MDGP, and then to 151 in HDGP, implying that the abundance of more palatable plants may decrease with pasture degradation, while plants with lower forage value tended to increase. Research results were extrapolated to the whole area between 2, 600 to 3, 000 m ASL in Gansu based on area estimation and land use patterns. Grassland was the major land use, accounting for 85 % of the total. Cultivated land occupied only 3. 5 % of the total, but the latter was vital to local farmers for food and feed production. Lands between 2, 600 to 3, 000 m ASL had a great potential for soil degradation. About half of the 1. 9 million ha grassland had been either <b>moderately</b> or heavily <b>degraded,</b> resulting in 22. 7 and 1. 8 million tons of C and N losses, respectively. Potentially available P loss reached 25. 8 thousand tons on grassland. Cultivating 80, 000 ha of grasslands resulted in 3. 8 million tons of C, 0. 31 million tons of N and 11. 6 thousand tons of P losses in the region...|$|R

40|$|The {{forms and}} {{dynamics}} of soil phosphorus can be greatly affected by land use changes, which often involve changes in vegetation cover, biomass production and nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. Present research evaluates {{the impact of}} land use change {{on the amount of}} total organic and inorganic P, labile, moderately labile and nonlabile P pools in semiarid soils of central Zagros. Samples were collected from surface soils (0 - 10 cm) of i) of <b>moderately</b> <b>degraded</b> pasture (20 - 25 % plant cover), ii) highly degraded pasture (5 - 10 % plant cover), and iii) cultivated field (10 years) in Soolegan sub watershed and i) <b>moderately</b> <b>degraded</b> pasture (25 - 30 % plant cover) and ii) highly degraded pasture (5 - 10 % plant cover) in Sadat Abad sub-watershed. Significantly (P&lt; 0. 05) low amounts of total organic P were found following cultivation (23. 9 %) and overgrazing (18. 2 and 40. 8 %) in Soolegan and Sadat Abad, respectively. The largest depletion of labile organic P (NaHCO 3 -Po) (72. 3 %) and moderately labile organic P (H 2 SO 4 -Po plus NaOH-Pi) (24. 3 %) were observed in cultivated rainfed land in Soolegan. Overgrazing led to decrease in labile organic P (42. 1 and 64. 4 %), moderately labile organic P (13. 9 and 35. 7 %) and nonlabile organic P (NaOH-Po) including moderately resistant and resistant organic P (12. 9 and 44. 4 %) in Soolegan and Sadat Abad, respectively. Our results showed that degradation of natural plant cover cause to depletion in the soil P pools.
