50|$|Adobe {{walls are}} load bearing, i.e. they carry their own weight into the {{foundation}} {{rather than by}} another structure, hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength. In the United States, most building codes call for a minimum compressive strength of 300 lbf/in2 (2.07 newton/mm2) for the adobe block. Adobe construction should be designed {{so as to avoid}} lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads. The building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load. Such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls, resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses.

40|$|Abstract. Despite {{their low}} {{performance}} quality and aesthetics, non-standard bricks {{are commonly used}} {{in the construction of}} low-rise buildings and rural houses in Indonesia. These bricks are produced traditionnally in home run plants with little adherance to appropriate mix designs. These unfired soil lime bricks enter the market within 2 weeks of production, which inflicts potential loss to the buyers due to their low performance quality. The paper discusses strength improvements of these early age bricks through 2 methods. The first method is by adding the optimal amount of mixing water to the soil and lime mix. The second method is by adding untreated coconut fibers with a 2. 5 cm fiber length as additional reinforcements. The effect of 3 %, 5 % and 7 % fiber addition to the mechanical properties of bricks were investigated. Laboratory tests showed that higher compressive strengths, compared to that of traditional unfired soil lime bricks, could be achieved through the 2 proposed methods. The bricks reinforced with higher percentage of untreated coconut fibers have better <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>ruptures...</b>|$|R

Northern Minnesota's iron mines are {{the starting point}} {{for the majority of the}} steel that gets produced in the United States. Their taconite processing plants use heat in furnaces to oxidize and indurate iron in the final stage of making a taconite pellet. Facilities can increase efficiencies when refractory service life is maintained. Efficiencies gained include: less fuel used, better quality control, better furnace control, and less mechanical component maintenance. Furnace refractory linings fail when the cracks that develop in them are uncontrolled or too large. These failures allow heat and gases retained by the lining to reach structural or mechanical components. Furnace control and efficiencies are also compromised when heat and gases are allowed to short circuit or escape the system. These failures are primarily the result of thermal of shock and expansion. It is common place to add stainless steel needle reinforcement to a monolithic refractory in an effort to counteract these effects. This study used several standard ASTM testing procedures to test 65 % alumina mullite based refractory samples with 304 and 406 grade stainless steel needles. Mechanical property data gathered was used to analyze performance. The study found that adding reinforcement does not increase initial Compression and Cold <b>Modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ruptures</b> strengths, however, after prolonged heat and thermal shock exposure, needles help maintain integrity and mechanical properties of samples.

30|$|The <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> is {{not well}} {{represented}} by the standard relationship with compressive strength. Tavakoli and Soroushian (1996) described that the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> tests of RCA concrete gave more varied results. The RCA concrete performed better {{in terms of the}} <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> than conventional concrete at the higher water-cement ratio, but it performed worse at the lower water-cement ratio. Since the current model relating compressive and flexural strengths is inadequate, there should be more research on the impact of RCA on concrete flexural strength so that a new, more representative, relationship can be developed. Yang et al. (2008) examined how water absorption of RCA and the strength of RCA source concrete influence how well compressive strength predicts <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture.</b> This paper concluded that RCA concrete made with RCA from high strength source concrete with low water absorption perform like conventional concrete, while low strength source RCA with high water absorption yields a <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> less than predicted, likely due to the weak residual mortar layer (Yang et al. 2008). Since both compressive and tensile strengths generally decrease under the same conditions that cause reduced flexural strength, this conclusion is reasonable. While in flexure the top of the specimen experiences compression while the lower portion experiences tension. If either the compressive or tensile capacity of the specimen is compromised, the flexural strength will also be affected. Tensile strength was also greater than the predicted value for concrete with RCA from a high strength source with low water absorption. Since concrete is weaker in tension than in compression, it is reasonable that <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> would follow a similar pattern to tensile strength, the weaker chord resistance. Recent tests by Kang et al. (2012) proved that the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> is moderately affected by the replacement of RCA.
