By means of bioinformatics analysis and quantum mechanics calculations we show here that such a geometry is <b>moderately</b> more <b>stable</b> than an alternative bifurcated trans geometry, involving the guanine Watson–Crick face and the cytosine keto group, which we have also found in known RNA structures.

One of the few strong metal binding sites characterized for cytosolic tRNAs is localized on G 15, and a domain-specific complex modification known as archaeosine is widespread at position 15 in archaeal tRNAs. We have found that both the bound Mg 2 + ion and the archaeosine modification induce an analogous electron density redistribution, which results in an effective stabilization of the RWC geometry. Metal binding and chemical modification thus play an interchangeable role in stabilizing the G 15 –C 48 correct geometry.

The structures and reactivity of these bis(ketenes) have been studied, including the prepamtion of tetra(ketenes). The study of ketene chemistry has continued to blossom, including {{the examination of the}} effect of substituents on ketene structure and reactivity (1). The extraordinary stabilizing effect of silyl substituents on ketenes has long been known (2), and the origin of this stabilization has been elucidated by ab initio molecular orbital calculations (3). From the MP 2 / 6 - 31 G*//MP 2 / 6 - 31 G * calculated energies of substituted ketenes 1 and alkenes 2, ketene stabilization energies SE were calculated by the isodesmic reaction of eq. 1, and these are correlated with the group electronegativities XBE (3 c) by eq. 2, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (3 a,b).

50|$|The first {{synthesis}} of thiosulfinates {{was reported in}} 1947 by Cavallito and coworkers by oxidation of the corresponding disulfides. One example of a <b>moderately</b> <b>stable</b> thiosulfinate is the tert-butyl derivative, (CH3)3CS(O)SC(CH3)3. This thiosulfinate can be obtained in optical purity by catalytic asymmetric oxidation of di-tert-butyl disulfide with hydrogen peroxide. Upon heating, (CH3)3CS(O)SC(CH3)3 decomposes into tert-butanethiosulfoxylic acid (CH3)3CSSOH) as shown by trapping studies. In a similar manner racemic methyl methanethiosulfinate (CH3S(O)SCH3) {{can be obtained by}} peracetic acid oxidation of dimethyl disulfide. Methyl methanethiosulfinate decomposes thermally giving methanesulfenic acid (CH3SOH), the simplest sulfenic acid, as well as thioformaldehyde (CH2=S). Methyl methanethiosulfinate can also disproportionate to a 1:1 mixture of dimethyl disulfide and methyl methanethiosulfonate (CH3SO2SCH3) and rearrange via a Pummerer rearrangement to CH3S(O)CH2SSCH3). An unusual three-membered ring thiosulfinate (a dithiirane 1-oxide) has been prepared through rearrangement of a 1,3-dithietane. A related compound, 3-(9-triptycyl)dithiirane 1-oxide, was prepared by the reaction of (9-triptycyl)diazomethane and S8O. The X-ray structure of the dithiirane 1-oxide reveals a significantly lengthened sulfur-sulfur bond (2.119(3)Å).

Recombinant EfcIBP can resist freezing without any conformational damage and is <b>moderately</b> heat <b>stable,</b> with a midpoint temperature of 66. 4 °C. Tested for its effects on ice, EfcIBP shows an unusual combination of properties not reported in other bacterial IBPs. First, {{it is one of}} the best-performing IBPs described to date in the inhibition of ice recrystallization, with effective concentrations in the nanomolar range. Moreover, EfcIBP has thermal hysteresis activity (0. 53 °C at 50 μm) and it can stop a crystal from growing when held at a constant temperature within the thermal hysteresis gap. EfcIBP protects purified proteins and bacterial cells from freezing damage when exposed to challenging temperatures. EfcIBP also possesses a potential N-terminal signal sequence for protein transport and a DUF 3494 domain that is common to secreted IBPs. These features lead us to hypothesize that the protein is either anchored at the outer cell surface or concentrated around cells to provide survival advantage to the whole cell consortium. © 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societie...|$|R
40|$|Objective Preschool internalizing {{problems}} (INT) {{are highly}} heritable and <b>moderately</b> genetically <b>stable</b> from childhood into adulthood. Gene-finding studies are scarce. In this study, {{the influence of}} genome-wide measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was investigated in 3 cohorts (total N = 4, 596 children) in which INT was assessed with the same instrument, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Method First, genome-wide association (GWA) results were used for density estimation and genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) to calculate the variance explained by all SNPs. Next, a fixed-effect inverse variance meta-analysis of the 3 GWA analyses was carried out. Finally, the overlap in results with prior GWA studies of childhood and adulthood psychiatric disorders and treatment responses was tested by examining whether SNPs associated with these traits jointly showed a significant signal for INT. Results Genome-wide SNPs explained 13 % to 43 % of the total variance. This indicates that the genetic architecture of INT mirrors the polygenic model underlying adult psychiatric traits. The meta-analysis did not yield a genome-wide significant signal but was suggestive for the PCSK 2 gene located on chromosome 20 p 12. 1. SNPs associated with other psychiatric disorders appeared to be enriched for signals with INT (λ = 1. 26, p <. 03). Conclusion Our study provides evidence that INT is influenced by many common genetic variants, each with a very small effect, and that, even as early as age 3, genetic variants influencing INT overlap with variants that {{play a role in}} childhood and adulthood psychiatric disorders...|$|R

The aim of this study is to model the melt and mineral evolution of the collected basaltic sample series by utilizing major and trace element data. The sample set consists of separated glass shards and plagioclase, olivine and clinopyroxene macrocrystals (d> 500 µm). In addition, the glass shards contain microcrystals (d 1 in specific minerals. Incompatible elements are enriched in evolved glasses and in general show higher concentrations in microcrystals than in earlier crystallized macrocrystals. Partitioning of V between olivine microcrystals and adjacent glass were used to determine the oxygen fugacity at 0 – 1 log units above the NNO buffer. This together with the appearance of titanomagnetite suggests the melts of the sample series were <b>moderately</b> oxidized. <b>Stable</b> ratios of incompatible element pairs analyzed from glass shards suggest that no remarkable contamination or magma mixing have disturbed the ratios between the most primitive and evolved samples.

Methods: Single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were used to interfere transiently with neuronal processing in the contralateral (M 1 CONTRA) or ipsilateral (M 1 IPSI) primary motor cortex or ipsilateral dorsal premotor cortex (PMdIPSI) during a simple reaction time (RT) task in 26 right-handed {{patients with}} <b>moderately</b> severe <b>stable</b> MS and matched healthy controls. Subjects responded to an auditorily presented Go signal as quickly as possible by performing isometric right thumb abductions. TMS was applied 100 msec after the Go signal.

Recently, it was shown that engineering two structural features of the pseudoknots derived from tobacco yellow mosaic virus (a specifically placed loop 2 adenosine), TYMV, and mouse mammary tumor virus (an unpaired adenosine at the stem 1 - stem 2 junction), MMTV could restore efficient frameshifting to a functionally inactive pseudoknot. Thermodynamic analysis presented here shows that a mutant pseudoknot lacking the loop 2 adenosine forms a pseudoknot structure which is stabilized by 1. 4 ? 0. 5 kcal mol??. In contrast, two other pseudoknots, in which the junction adenosine residue was substituted with guanosine and the and the other one in which the loop 2 adenosine was replaced with guanosine, both formed <b>moderately</b> less <b>stable</b> structures. All three RNAs display frameshifting efficiencies greatly reduced relative to the wild type RNA. Although these findings suggest that there is no clear correlation between pseudoknot stability and frameshifting efficiency, our data does suggest that a specific interaction between a loop 2 adenosine and helical stem 1 makes a measurable contribution to pseudoknot stability...|$|R
