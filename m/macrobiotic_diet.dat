Veloso was the first to be arrested; the police moved to Gil's home soon afterward. Veloso had directed his then-wife Andréa Gadelha to warn Gil about the possibility of arrest, but Gil was eventually brought into the police van along with Veloso. They were given no reason or charge for their arrest. Gil believes that the government felt his actions [...] "represent a threat , something new, something that can't quite be understood, something that doesn't fit into any of the clear compartments of existing cultural practices, and that won't do. That is dangerous." [...] During his prison sentence, Gil began to meditate, follow a <b>macrobiotic</b> <b>diet,</b> and read about Eastern philosophy. He composed four songs during his imprisonment, among them [...] "Cérebro Electrônico" [...] (Electronic Brain), which first appeared on his 1969 album Gilberto Gil 1969, and later on his 2006 album Gil Luminoso. Thereafter, Gil and Veloso were exiled to London, England after being offered to leave Brazil. The two played a last Brazilian concert together in Salvador in July 1969, then travelled to Portugal, Paris, and finally London. He and Veloso took a house in Chelsea, sharing it with their manager and wives. Gil was involved in the organisation of the 1971 Glastonbury Free Festival and was exposed to reggae while living in London; he recalls listening to Bob Marley (whose songs he later covered), Jimmy Cliff, and Burning Spear. He was heavily influenced by and involved with the city's rock scene as well, performing with Yes, Pink Floyd, and the Incredible String Band. However, he also performed solo, recording Gilberto Gil (Nêga) while in London. In addition to involvement in the reggae and rock scenes, Gil attended performances by jazz artists, including Miles Davis and Sun Ra.|$|E

40|$|Mental {{development}} of 4 – 5 -year old children on <b>macrobiotic</b> <b>diets</b> (almost devoid of animal foods and fat) with long-term growth deficits, was studied using the Snijders-Oomen Non-verbal Intelligence (SON) scale. In addition, food consumption and behavioural {{style of the}} children, and family and parent characteristics were assessed. Parents were highly educated: 69 % of the fathers and 47 % of the mothers had completed college or university education. The children's energy intake was only 70 % and calcium intake 40 % of that reported for children of similar age on conventional diets. Fifteen out of 44 children (33 %) did not complete the SON-test, mainly due to difficulties in concentration. The non-completers tended to score lower on parts of the SON-test and the educational level of their fathers was slightly lower: no other differences were observed. Intelligence quotients (IQ) {{of the children who}} completed the test were high (IQ= 126) compared to the reference population (IQ= 100 by definition). No significant relationship between IQ's and educational level of parents was observed, possibly due to lack of varation in educational level within the study population. Family size was inversely related with IQ. It was concluded that long-standing mild to moderate malnutrition may not affect mental development in pre-school children if the children grow up in a stimulating social environment...|$|R
