40|$|Schizophrenia is a {{debilitating}} disease that affects about 1 % of the population. Current therapeutic interventions mostly target dopaminergic neurotransmission {{but are not}} effective in treating all symptoms. There is growing evidence to support involvement of glutamatergic neurotransmission, which may better account for the symptomatology of schizophrenia. Glutamate concentrations {{can be measured in}} vivo using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<b>MRS).</b> <b>Stronger</b> MRIs provide benefits for MRS, but they also present challenges. Simulations were designed to examine how MRI field strength influences metabolite quantification. Glutamate and its metabolic precursor, glutamine, were more reliably and independently quantified with higher MRI field strengths, showing a clear benefit for MRS. Using a 7 T MRI, voxels were placed within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and thalamus of volunteers with schizophrenia, a psychiatric control group of volunteers with major depressive disorder (MDD), and healthy controls. Glutamine and glycine, both involved in glutamate neurotransmission, were lower in the thalamus in schizophrenia relative to healthy controls, whereas dACC glutamate concentrations were higher, demonstrating glutamatergic abnormalities in schizophrenia at rest. Prior MRS studies of schizophrenia have been in resting conditions. In a proof of concept study with healthy controls, it was shown that the Stroop Task was able elicit a significant glutamate increase in the dACC when in a functional state (glutamate fMRS) relative to resting conditions using the 7 T MRI. This was then explored in the same schizophrenic and MDD subjects as the resting MRS study. Healthy controls significantly increased glutamate concentrations, but the schizophrenic and MDD groups did not significantly. The schizophrenic group had a slower glutamatergic response followed by a slower recovery, and, was the only group to demonstrate significant glutamine increases when activated, indicating potential abnormalities in glutamate dynamics. Using a 7 T MRI, glutamate was explored in resting and activated conditions in schizophrenia. Glycine was demonstrated to be lower in schizophrenia using MRS for the first time, and the first functional MRS study was performed in a psychiatric population. The studies were made stronger by inclusion of a psychiatric control group. Future studies of schizophrenia with glutamate fMRS should focus on the delayed glutamatergic response to functional activation and abnormal recovery...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} indicates that spatial skills, such as Mental Rotation Skills (<b>MRS),</b> are a <b>strong</b> predictor for mathematics achievement. Other {{studies have shown that}} MRS can be instilled through training and that they are a good predictor of another spatial skill: route learning and wayfinding skills. This paper explores these assumptions and reports an experiment with 43 undergraduate psychology students from a university in the south of England. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions. Both groups were given pre- and post-tests on wayfinding in a maze. The intervention group trained with a MRS tool, based on a standardised MRS task. The control group did filler tasks by completing crossword puzzles. Collectively, the 43 students made 43 × 48 = 2064 assessment items for MRS, and 2 × 43 = 86 mazes. Although the intervention group showed a decrease in time needed to do the maze task, while the control group saw an increase, these changes were not significant...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to explore the {{relationship}} between triglyceride (TG) and water in steatotic rat livers and to accordingly test the validity of the currently used steatosis calculation methods from magnetic resonance spectra. The approximations commonly used to derive steatosis degrees from magnetic resonance spectra include the generic types TG/water and TG/(TG + water). Hepatic fat and water content was quantitated by histology, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), gas chromatography, and dry/wet weight ratio analysis in increasingly (0 %- 95 %) steatotic rats. Correlation analysis was performed to assess the statistical relationships among the steatosis quantification techniques. Subsequently, data were fitted with linear and nonlinear functions to determine the relationship between hepatic water fraction versus hepatic TG content and TG/water ratio versus macrovesicular steatosis degree to test the validity of commonly used steatosis calculation methods. Histologic analysis of macrovesicular steatosis correlated very strongly with TG content determined by gas chromatography and <b>MRS.</b> A <b>strong</b> positive correlation was also found between gas chromatography-derived and MRS-derived TG content. Biochemical analysis revealed a linear converse relationship between hepatic fat and water content. This relationship was nonlinear when determined by MRS. The MRS-based TG/(TG + water) -type approximations reflected the linear water-fat relationship better than the TG/water-type approximations, particularly when the calculations were performed with a maximum number of TG resonances. Hepatic fat approximations of the type TG/water overestimate hepatic steatosis degree because hepatic fat accumulation concurs with hepatic water exudation. Consequently, MRS-based approximations should be of the type TG/(TG + water) and contain a maximum number of TG resonances in the denominato...|$|R
40|$|A {{large amount}} of cheese is lost every year due to mold contamination. Biopreservation, which {{is the use of}} {{biological}} entities (microbes) and their metabolites to suppress microbial spoilage instead of chemical preservatives has lately gained increasing interest. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have the potential for use in biopreservation, because they are safe to consume and naturally exist in many foods. In this study, fifteen strains of lactobacilli isolated from dairy products, vegetables, and fermented pickles were tested by agar overlay assay for their anti-mold activity. Six strains grown on <b>MRS</b> agar showed <b>strong</b> inhibitory activity against a target mold (Penicillium sp. at 105 spores/ml) isolated from the surface of Cheddar cheese. The isolates were identified by biochemical tests using API CHL 50 strips. Five strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, and one strain as Pediococcus pentasaceus. Well-diffusion method was used to demonstrate anti-mold activity in concentrated cell-free supernatants. Supernatants from all strains showed inhibition of the target mold (indicator). The anti-mold compound(s) produced by all the strains was heat-resistant (100 o C for 15 min). Supernatants from 5 strains retained the anti-mold activity when the pH was adjusted to 6. 8 ± 0. 2, while one strain DC 2 isolated from cheese lost its anti-mold activity at that pH. Temperature of incubation of cultures affected anti-mold activity. The optimum was 37 o C. Very little or no inhibition was noted when cultures were incubated at either 10 or 55 °C. A preliminary study of applying anti-mold lactobacilli in Cheddar cheese was completed. Anti-mold LAB was added to the cheese milk as an adjunct to give 105 cfu/ml. After 1 -week and 1 -month ripening, mold (10 ~ 20 spores) was added on to the surface, and the cheese was wrapped loosely. The appearance of the mold on cheese surface was monitored. Mold was not present on the 1 -week old cheese “NB in milk” until the 6 th day after the control cheese (made without strain NB) showed signs of mold. The 1 -month old cheese “NB in milk ” extended the shelf life 17 days longer than the control cheese...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we perform a {{statistical}} analysis of the ionospheric echo response observed by six radars of the SuperDARN network in the Northern Hemisphere, over 236 Sudden Impulses (SI) of solar wind dynamic pressure events (from 1997 through 2000). For that purpose, we make use of MRS, the Mean Rate of Scattering, {{as a function of}} time during the SI event. We classify the events in sudden increases (I events, 144 cases) and decreases (D events, 92 cases) of the solar wind dynamic pressure. Moreover, we make use of the AE index to define two distinct conditions of the ionosphere under which each event may take place: Quiet and Disturbed. Regarding Quiet conditions, for both I and D events, we find that MRS displays an increase related to the SI time. On the contrary, for Disturbed conditions, D events display an increase in MRS, while I events show a clear dip. The similarity of response for I and D events under Quiet conditions is briefly discussed, but the smaller number of D events does not allow one to further analyse them. As for the I events, a latitudinal analysis shows that the MRS increase for Quiet conditions is seen both at low latitudes (60 °– 70 ° ?) and at high latitudes (70 °– 80 ° ?); for Disturbed Is the <b>MRS</b> decrease is <b>stronger</b> at high latitudes. We suggest that the MRS increase for Quiet Is can be due to two different mechanisms: 1) a soft electron precipitation induced by Field Line Resonances (FLR) or loss cone instability at lower latitudes; 2) an enlargement of the cusp at higher latitudes, which in turn may induce enhanced particle precipitation. For what concerns Disturbed Is, the MRS decrease can be produced by a higher energy electron precipitation (> 1 keV), that enhances the electron density in the E and D regions. This provokes a strong absorbtion of the radio waves in the D region and a higher refraction in the E region, leading to a decrease in MRS, especially at higher latitudes. For I events a further classification has been {{made on the basis of}} IMF orientation: this suggests that the effects summarized above are due to the SI itself. Keywords.

60|$|I {{need not}} dwell upon the further {{events of that}} evening, inasmuch as they were almost a {{repetition}} of those of the previous night. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Strong</b> received me kindly in her faded fashion, and, after a few inquiries about the trial, sought refuge in her favourite topic of the lost Tribes.

60|$|Three {{years and}} more had gone by since that night on which I sat {{opposite}} to a wine-glass full of poison and was the prey of visions, when once again I {{received a call from}} Stephen Strong.

60|$|I saw a {{good deal}} of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Strong,</b> both because she had taken a liking for me on the morning of my {{introduction}} to the Doctor, and was always afterwards kind to me, and interested in me; and because she was very fond of Agnes, and was often backwards and forwards at our house. There was a curious constraint between her and Mr. Wickfield, I thought (of whom she seemed to be afraid), that never wore off. When she came there of an evening, she always shrunk from accepting his escort home, and ran away with me instead. And sometimes, as we were running gaily across the Cathedral yard together, expecting to meet nobody, we would meet Mr. Jack Maldon, who was always surprised to see us.|$|E

Almost all of this was devised to his widow absolutely, so that she could dispose of it in whatever fashion pleased her. Indeed, there was but one other bequest, that of the balance of the 10,000 pounds which the testator had deposited {{in the hands of a}} trustee for my benefit. This was now left to me absolutely.
