5|$|Pepsiman is {{an action}} game that {{consists}} of four stages, each divided into smaller segments, and each involving the superhero Pepsiman saving {{a person who is}} in need of a drink, such as a military <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a desert, by giving them a can of Pepsi. The stages are all based on real locations, such as San Francisco and New York City. The game is played from a third-person perspective, with Pepsiman automatically running forwards through the stage, sometimes running through people's living rooms. The player aims to dodge obstacles, such as cars, construction cranes, and people, as well as Pepsi-branded obstacles, including a Pepsi truck. The player does this by using four different moves: running, dashing, jumping, and super-jumping. The player gains points by collecting Pepsi cans.|$|E

25|$|Nathan Shefferman {{published}} The <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle,</b> a 292-page {{account of}} his union busting activities, in 1961. Shefferman described {{a long list of}} practices which he viewed as tangential to union avoidance activities but which his detractors have labeled as support operations for these activities. Among these were the administration of opinion surveys, supervisor training, employee roundtables, incentive pay procedures, wage surveys, employee complaint procedures, personnel records, application procedures, job evaluations, and legal services. As part of his union busting strategies, all of these activities were performed with the goal of maintaining complete control of the work force by top management. Shefferman's book not only provided the concepts that animated all future union busting techniques, he also provided language that pro-labor supporters believe mask the intent of the policies.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} the 2nd {{generation}} of Argentine rock solo artists formerly members of great bands of their era: Gustavo Cerati, Indio Solari, Vicentico, Fidel Nadal, etc. Ex-Soda Stereo member Cerati {{spent most of the}} early part of the decade in the electronic side of music. In 2006 he returned with his first album of all new music since 2002 (Ahi Vamos) where rock was front and center, albeit a more mature rock of a <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> age of his life. Ex-Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota Solari's debut album El tesoro de los Inocentes was seen as the best of 2004.

Skay Beillinson, also ex-Redonditos, also did well with his fourth solo efforts.|$|E

The studio still wasn't satisfied so the Raimi brothers wrote drafts six through twelve before they had a shooting script.
