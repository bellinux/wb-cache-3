40|$|With the {{institution}} of the Moroccan Protectorate by the French in 1912, the military command had as its primary intention that of restoring law and order. Under the strong personality of the "resident general", Lyautey, a new era of "soft" political colonization was introduced in Morocco; brutish military conquests were followed by a certain cooptation process of the Moroccan elite. This association policy allowed the perception of real cooperation between the French and the Moroccans but was actually aimed at the tight regulation of the population. The efficiency of this regulation was achieved through its technocratic approach; it showed respect for the <b>Moroccan</b> <b>Islamic</b> traditions and its institutions. This study analyses the French colonial policy in Morocco between 1912 and 1925 through the means of reforms introduced into the judicial Islamic system. The author compares the system's organization, its jurisdictions and its procedures before 1912, and their reforms throughout the 1912 to 1925 period, when Lyautey was in command...|$|R
