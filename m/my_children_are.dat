500|$|Stating {{that such}} a {{conservative}} criticism of his film's [...] "strong environmental anti-war themes" [...] was not unexpected, Cameron stressed that he was [...] "interested in saving the world that <b>my</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> going to inhabit", encouraged everyone to be a [...] "tree hugger", and urged that we [...] "make a fairly rapid transition to alternate energy." [...] The film and Cameron's environmental activism {{caught the attention of}} the 8,000-strong Dongria Kondh tribe from Orissa, eastern India. [...] They appealed to him to help them stop a mining company from opening a bauxite open-cast mine, on their sacred Niyamgiri mountain, in an advertisement in Variety that read: [...] "Avatar is fantasy... and real. [...] The Dongria Kondh... are struggling to defend their land against a mining company hell-bent on destroying their sacred mountain. Please help...." [...] Similarly, a coalition of over fifty environmental and aboriginal organizations of Canada ran a full-page ad in the special Oscar edition of Variety likening their fight against Canada's Alberta oilsands to the Na'vi insurgence, —a comparison the mining and oil companies objected to. [...] Cameron was awarded the inaugural Temecula Environment Award for Outstanding Social Responsibility in Media by three environmentalist groups for portrayal of environmental struggles that they compared with their own.|$|E

2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and <b>my</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E
