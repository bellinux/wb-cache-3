40|$|In this work, {{we develop}} a new {{algorithm}} for nonequilibrium molecular dynamics of fluids under planar <b>mixed</b> <b>flow,</b> a linear combination of planar elongational flow and planar Couette flow. To date, {{the only way of}} simulating <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics techniques was to impose onto the simulation box irreversible transformations. This would bring the simulation to an end as soon as the minimum lattice space requirements were violated. In practical terms, this meant repeating the short simulations to improve statistics and extending the box dimensions to increase the total simulation time. Our method, similar to what has already been done for pure elongational flow, allows a cuboid box to deform in time following the streamlines of the <b>mixed</b> <b>flow</b> and, after a period of time determined by the elongational field, to be mapped back and recover its initial shape. No discontinuity in physical properties is present during the mapping and the simulation can, in this way, be extended indefinitely.

Finally numerical experiments versus laboratory experiments are presented and the scheme produces results that are in a very good agreement.

40|$|Hydraulic models {{available}} in literature are unsuccessful in simulating accurately and efficiently environmental flows {{characterized by the}} presence of both air–water interactions and free-surface/pressurized transitions (aka <b>mixed</b> <b>flows).</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} thus to fill this knowledge gap by developing a unified one-dimensional mathematical model describing free-surface, pressurized and <b>mixed</b> <b>flows</b> with air–water interactions. This work is part of a general research project which aims at establishing a unified mathematical model suitable to describe the vast majority of flows likely to appear in civil and environmental engineering (pure water flows, sediment transport, pollutant transport, aerated flows...). In order to tackle this problem, our original methodology consists in both time- and spaceaveraging the Local Instant Formulation, which includes field equations for each phase taken separately and jump conditions, over a flow cross-section involving a free-surface. Subsequently, applicability of the model is extended to pressurized flows as well. The first key result is an original 1 D homogeneous Equilibrium Model which describes two-phase free-surface flows. It is proven to be fundamentally multiphase, to take into account scale heterogeneities of environmental flow and to be very easy to solve. Next, applicability of this free-surface model is extended to pressurized flows by using the classical Preissmann slot concept. A second key result here is the introduction of an original negative Preissmann slot to simulate sub-atmospheric pressurized flows. The model is then closed by using constitutive equations suitable for air–water flows. Finally, this mathematical model is discretised by means of a finite volume scheme and validated by comparison with experimental results from a physical model in the case of a steady flow in a large scale gallery.
