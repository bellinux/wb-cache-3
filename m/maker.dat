40|$|Three {{experimental}} studies are reported, {{the first two}} of which explore differences in advisors’ and decision makers’ preferences, and differences in personal decisions in the near and the distant future. It was expected that preferences of advisors would be more {{similar to those of}} distant future decision <b>makers</b> than of near future decision <b>makers.</b> This prediction was supported. In Experiment 1, advisors (both pure advisors and decision <b>makers</b> for others) and distant future decision <b>makers</b> made more action choices than near future decision <b>makers,</b> thus only for low life-impact situations. In Experiment 2 advisors and distant future decision <b>makers</b> made more desirability choices than near future decision <b>makers.</b> These results indicate some similarities in representation of the decision problem due to a psychological distance to the event, which construal level theory could account for. Experiment 3 explores decision makers’ and advisors’ responsibility from the perspective of both decision <b>makers</b> and advisors. Responsibilities are explored both without knowledge of decision outcomes, and with two levels of outcome (moderately and severely negative. Decision <b>makers</b> are generally perceived as being much more responsible for a decision than advisors, both by the decision <b>makers</b> themselves and by the advisors. Advisors, on the other hand, perceived themselves as more responsible than did decision <b>makers.</b> Decision outcomes are found {{to have an impact on}} perception of responsibility. Decision <b>makers</b> perceived their own responsibility to increase with knowledge of negative decision outcomes, while they perceived advisors' responsibility to decrease. Advisors, on the other hand, perceived their own responsibility to decrease with knowledge of moderate outcomes, and to increase with knowledge of severely negative outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} responsibility attributions for {{outcomes of}} collective decision making processes. In particular, we ask if decision <b>makers</b> are blamed for being pivotal if they implement an unpopular outcome in a sequential voting process. We conduct an experimental voting {{game in which}} decision <b>makers</b> vote about the allocation of money between themselves and recipients without voting rights. We measure responsibility attributions for voting decisions by eliciting the monetary punishment that recipients assign to individual decision <b>makers.</b> We find that pivotal decision <b>makers</b> are punished significantly more for an unpopular voting outcome than non&#x 0081;]pivotal decision <b>makers.</b> Our data also suggest that some voters avoid being pivotal by voting strategically in order to delegate the pivotal vote to subsequent decision <b>makers...</b>|$|R
