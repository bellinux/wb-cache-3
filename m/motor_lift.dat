25|$|A closed {{collection}} system has a barrier or diaphragm {{that separates the}} pump tubing from the horn. In this design, the suction of the pump <b>motor</b> <b>lifts</b> the diaphragm to create a vacuum within the collection system to extract milk. An open system allows for the free passage of air/suction. Bacteria and viral filters may be present to prevent any contamination or overflow into pump motor. The pump mechanism motor's suction is directly passed to the mothers breast versus indirectly with closed diaphragm systems.|$|R
50|$|Elevator: In {{traction}} (non-hydraulic) elevators, a heavy counterweight counterbalances {{the load}} {{of the elevator}} carriage, so the <b>motor</b> <b>lifts</b> much less of the carriage's weight (specifically, the counterweight is {{the weight of the}} carriage plus 40-50% of its rated capacity). The counterweight also increases the ascending acceleration force and decreases the descending acceleration force {{to reduce the amount of}} power needed by the motor. The elevator carriage and the counterweights both have wheel roller guides attached to them to prevent irregular movement and provide a smoother ride for the passengers.|$|R
50|$|In the past, repulsion-start wound-rotor motors {{provided}} high starting torque, {{but with}} added complexity. Their rotors {{were similar to}} those of universal motors, but their brushes were connected only to each other. Transformer action induced current into the rotor. Brush position relative to field poles meant that starting torque was developed by rotor repulsion from the field poles. A centrifugal mechanism, when close to running speed, connected all commutator bars together to create the equivalent of a squirrel-cage rotor. As well, when close to operating speed, better <b>motors</b> <b>lifted</b> the brushes out of contact.|$|R

The lift system is either {{wall-mounted}} or supported {{by an independent}} structure, [...] and is powered by either a conventional <b>lift</b> <b>motor</b> (mounted in a separate <b>lift</b> <b>motor</b> room), a hydraulic drive system or a traction motor.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lift</b> <b>motor</b> was {{installed}} on the park's Demon roller coaster, also by Arrow.|$|R
50|$|Bryan Roberts, a {{professor}} of engineering at the University of Technology, in Sydney, Australia, has proposed a helicopter-like craft which flies to 15000 ft altitude and stays there, held aloft by wings that generate lift from the wind, and {{held in place by}} a cable to a ground anchor. According to its designers, while some of the energy in the wind would be 'lost' on lift, the constant and potent winds would allow it to generate constant electricity. Since the winds usually blow horizontally, the turbines would be at an angle from the horizontal, catching winds while still generating lift. Deployment could be done by feeding electricity to the turbines, which would turn them into electric <b>motors,</b> <b>lifting</b> the structure into the sky.|$|R
50|$|Examples {{of energy}} {{transformation}} include generating electric energy from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane <b>motor.</b> <b>Lifting</b> against gravity performs mechanical {{work on the}} object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object. If the object falls to the ground, gravity does mechanical work on the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground. Our Sun transforms nuclear potential energy {{to other forms of}} energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself (since it still contains the same total energy even if in different forms), but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as radiant energy.|$|R

A 21-inch arm with pitch control rod and the spindle that transfers {{the power to}} helicopter via drive springs and drive rod, is connected from the central base to the helicopter.|$|R
50|$|The former Washtenaw County is {{undergoing}} restoration at Astoria, Oregon, by volunteers of the Amphibious Forces Memorial Museum/LST-1166 Partners. She {{would become the}} centerpiece of their museum collection if completed. Since 2003, the ship has been moored in a backwater of the Columbia River near Rainier, Oregon. Since 2005, several cases of metal theft from her {{have been reported to}} local authorities. In 2007, it was determined that more than 100,000 USD in materials have been stolen, including brass coverings over generators and <b>motors,</b> <b>lift</b> boats, and plumbing. It also has been reported that thieves ripped asbestos up to get to wire and piping on the ship, and that the thieves caused extensive flooding damage. Her future is currently in doubt due to the amount of damage and environmental problems, and a lack of funding to fix them.|$|R

25|$|Let's {{take the}} example of a robotic arm, that can be moved and {{positioned}} by a control loop. An electric <b>motor</b> may <b>lift</b> or lower the arm, depending on forward or reverse power applied, but power cannot be a simple function of position because of the inertial mass of the arm, forces due to gravity, external forces on the arm such as a load to lift or work to be done on an external object.|$|R
50|$|Two LIMs were used, one {{on either}} side of the vehicle, {{arranged}} in a unique fashion that acted as both the <b>motors</b> and <b>lift</b> systems. The contact-less suspension would be smooth riding and silent, major considerations for operations close to houses in an urban environment. As the system did not depend on physical contact for traction, it would operate with equal effectiveness when covered with rain or snow, and could climb steeper grades and turn sharper corners.|$|R

50|$|Historically, metal {{was shaped}} by hand using a hammer. Later, larger hammers were {{constructed}} to press more metal at once, or to press thicker materials. Often a smith would employ a helper or apprentice to swing the sledgehammer while the smith concentrated on positioning the workpiece. Adding windmill or steam power yielded still larger hammers such as steam hammers. Drop hammers utilize an electric <b>motor</b> to <b>lift</b> the hammer, which then falls by gravity onto the work. Most modern machine presses {{use a combination of}} electric motors and hydraulics to achieve the necessary pressure. Along with the evolution of presses came the evolution of the dies used within them.|$|R
50|$|The {{prime mover}} runs {{a set of}} pulleys to the transmission, often a double-reduction gearbox, which drives a pair of cranks, {{generally}} with counterweights installed on them to assist the <b>motor</b> in <b>lifting</b> the heavy rod assembly. The cranks raise and lower one end of an I-beam which is free to move on an A-frame. On {{the other end of}} the beam is a curved metal box called a horse head or donkey head, so named due to its appearance. A cable made of steelâ€”occasionally, fibreglassâ€”called a bridle, connects the horse head to the polished rod, a piston that passes through the stuffing box.|$|R
40|$|<b>Motor</b> {{strategies}} in <b>lifting</b> movements: A comparison of adult and children performance GACHOUD, Jean-Pierre, et al. The experiment compares {{the performances of}} children six to nine years old and adults in a simple, monoarticular lifting task. Overt behaviors, as described by the kinematic features of the movement, do not differ qualitatively in the two groups. The patterns of motor commands, as expressed by the electromyographic recordings, are however strikingly different. Adults plan the movement with a careful balance between agonist muscle activity and passive viscoelastic forces, whereas children use both agonist and antagonist active forces. It is argued that the motor strategy adopted by adults depends upon an internal representation of {{the properties of the}} motor system and of the size/weight covariation in natural objects, and that this representation is not yet fully developed at nine years of age.

40|$|Normally, {{humans are}} {{sensitive}} to the effort required of them as they perform a <b>motor</b> task; <b>lifting</b> heavy weights requires more effort than does lifting light ones, and heavy weights exert more pressure on the lifting organ (fingers, hand, etc.) than do light ones. The motor system prepares for the expected difference in required motor ef-fort by evaluating the probable weight of an object and appropriately adjusting grip force and load force (propor-tional to the initial innervation strength of lifting muscles) before the physical lifting begins (Johansson & Westling, 1984, 1988). Nonvisual sources of sensory information for making estimates of the weight of an object include (1) proprioception from the muscles; (2) comparisons of muscle efference required to execute a lifting motion with the speed, acceleration, and amplitude of the result...|$|R
