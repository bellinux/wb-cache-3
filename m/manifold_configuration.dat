Its {{characteristic}} 30° inclination of cylinder block {{gives it a}} lower height overall engine package. This enabled vehicle stylists to lower hoodlines, and also made room for the water pump to be mounted with a lateral offset, significantly shortening the engine's overall length.

Three-dimensional model of the manifolds and the cylinder is created and meshed using the pre-processor GAMBIT. The flow characteristics of these engine manifolds are examined under transient conditions using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code STAR-CD. The predicted CFD results of mean swirl velocity of the engine at different locations inside the combustion chamber at the end of compression stroke are compared with experimental results available in the literature. We also compared the volumetric efficiency of the modeled helical manifold. The results obtained showed reasonably good agreement with the measured data given in the literature. Further, this paper discusses the predicted flow structure, swirl velocity and variation of turbulent energy inside the cylinder with different manifold. Comparisons of volumetric efficiency with different <b>manifold</b> <b>configuration</b> at 3000 rpm speed are also presented. The turbulence is modeled using RNG k-ε model.

This research thesis focused on improving and mapping fuel fraction delivery profiles for a valveless pulse detonation engine.

40|$|During {{development}} of the gas generator for the liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen propellant J- 2 X rocket engine, combustion instabilities were observed near {{the frequency of the}} first longitudinal acoustic mode of the hot gas combustion chamber duct. These instabilities were similar to intermediate-frequency or buzz-type instabilities as described in historical programs, except for several aspects: 1) the frequencies were low, in the realm of chug; 2) at times the instability oscillation amplitudes were quite large, with peak-to-peak amplitudes exceeding 50 % of the mean chamber pressure along with the appearance of harmonics; 3) the chamber excitation was related to but not exactly at the first longitudinal combustion chamber acoustic mode; and 4) the injector provided mass flow rate oscillations induced by capacitance and inertance effects in the injector rather than by organ pipe resonances of the coaxial oxidizer posts. This type of combustion instability is referred to as "injection coupling" because one critical driving source of the instability is mass flow rate oscillations from the injector. However, the type of injection coupling observed here is different than observed in previous instances of buzz instability with coaxial injectors, because of the lower frequencies and lack of influence from the oxidizer post organ pipe resonances. Test data and preliminary analyses of the initial combustion instabilities were presented in several papers at the 5 th Liquid Propulsion Subcommittee meeting. Since that time, additional hot-fire tests with several new hardware configurations have been conducted, and additional analyses have been completed.

40|$|The present work investigates {{critical}} {{issues associated with}} a multicyclic operation of the valveless PDC. The first experimental investigation studied internal flow behavior associated with the fill and purge processes through combustion diagnostics outside of a detonation tube during a multicyclic PDC operation. Leakage of the combustible mixture was observed due to flow stratification created during the fill and purge processes. The flow stratification also {{has an impact on}} the local equivalence ratio leaving some combustion products from the previous cycle in the detonation tube which could affect the multicyclic operation of the PDC. The second experimental investigation was conducted to design and develop a PDC with the total absence of mechanical valves. The suggested configuration was based on a fluid-diode concept and flame stabilization analysis which provide an innovative scheme to operate in valveless mode. There are two critical waves generated initially to operate the PDC in valveless mode. After initiation of the spark plugs, there is a compression wave propagating towards the thrust surface which makes the inlet section pressurized while a deflagration wave propagates toward the detonation tube exit initiating the DDT process. The first reflected characteristic appears after the detonation wave front reaches the product-air interface which starts to depressurize the inlet section making the gasdynamic valve start to open. Operating frequency of valveless PDC is dependent on the size of combustor and the <b>manifold</b> <b>configuration.</b> In order to obtain a detailed understanding of flame the acceleration process leading to detonation initiation, flow visualization experiments were conducted in a rectangular detonation tube equipped with two dimensional obstacles. The flow visualizations were conducted via schlieren photography showing that the flame accelerator provides 1) production of various scale of turbulence, 2) enhancement of shock-flame interaction and 3) forced ignition by reflected shock over the obstacle and the detonation tube. These mechanisms of the flame acceleration process could provide how to optimize the flame accelerator minimizing pressure loss which deteriorates the overall performance of the PDC based system...|$|E

Moreover, in the context of machining, the system has to interact closely with its physical environment. When the contour following task is represented by a velocity field on the <b>configuration</b> <b>manifold</b> of the system, the coordination aspect of the problem is made explicit. The passive velocity field control (PVFC) scheme developed in the Part I companion paper [7] can then be applied to track the defined velocity field so that the desired contour is followed, and to ensure that the interaction of the closed-loop system with the physical environment is passive to enhance safety and stability. Unfortunately, for some contours, an encoding velocity field on the <b>configuration</b> <b>manifold</b> does not exist or is difficult to define and, as a consequence, the PVFC cannot be directly applied.
