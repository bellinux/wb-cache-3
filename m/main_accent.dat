5000|$|Many {{scholars}} {{hold that}} the Hebrew poet considered only the syllables receiving the <b>main</b> <b>accent,</b> {{and did not}} count the intervening ones. Examples contrary to this are not found in passages where forms of the so-called dialectus poetica are used, as Ley holds; and Israel Davidson has proved that the choice of [...] "lamo" [...] instead of [...] "lahem" [...] favors {{in only a few}} passages the opinion that the poet intended to cause an accented syllable to be followed by an unaccented one.|$|E

30|$|The {{experimental}} results present {{the phenomenon of}} moving lines on electron spectra which are linked spatially and {{in time with the}} localization and durability of the processes of new surface producing in folds and grain boundaries. This effect was also realized for a thin-layer composite “organic on metal films on dielectric substrate” in modeling non-equilibrium conditions which are created by the intensive electron beam pulse impact. It was found that the nature of the inceptive adsorption layer, in addition to the metal film, determines the initial positions of moving lines on the spectra. The <b>main</b> <b>accents</b> in these investigations were in observations of appearance of the moving lines, dynamics of their displacements on the spectra, final stages when these lines vanished, and finding the general regularities between the spontaneous and induced events.|$|R

2500|$|British {{descriptions}} of English intonation {{can be traced}} back to the 16th century. Early in the 20th century the dominant approach in the description of English and French intonation was based on a small number of basic [...] "tunes" [...] associated with intonation units: in a typical description, Tune 1 is falling, with final fall, while Tune 2 has a final rise. Phoneticians such as H.E. Palmer broke up the intonation of such units into smaller components, the most important of which was the nucleus, which corresponds to the <b>main</b> <b>accented</b> syllable of the intonation unit, usually in the last lexical word of the intonation unit. Each nucleus carries one of a small number of nuclear tones, usually including fall, rise, fall-rise, rise-fall, and possibly others. The nucleus may be preceded by a head containing stressed syllables preceding the nucleus, and a tail consisting of syllables following the nucleus within the tone unit. Unstressed syllables preceding the head (if present) or nucleus (if there is no head) constitute a pre-head. This approach was further developed by Halliday and by O'Connor and Arnold, though with considerable variation in terminology. This [...] "Standard British" [...] treatment of intonation in its present-day form is explained in detail by Wells and in a simplified version by Roach. Halliday saw the functions of intonation as depending on choices in three main variables: Tonality (division of speech into intonation units), Tonicity (the placement of the tonic syllable or nucleus) and Tone (choice of nuclear tone); these terms (sometimes referred to as [...] "the three T's") have been used more recently.|$|R
