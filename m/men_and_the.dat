5|$|According to {{government}} regulations concerning seagoing ships, the larger ones can carry several hundred <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> smaller ones {{may have more}} than a hundred men on board. One of the most important merchants is chosen to be Leader (Gang Shou), another is Deputy Leader (Fu Gang Shou), and a third is Business Manager (Za Shi). The Superintendent of Merchant Shipping gives them an unofficially sealed red certificate permitting them to use the light bamboo for punishing their company when necessary. Should anyone die at sea, his property becomes forfeit to the government...The ship's pilots are acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by the stars, and in the day-time by the sun. In dark weather they look at the south-pointing needle (i.e. the magnetic compass). They also use a line a hundred feet long with a hook at the end which they let down to take samples of mud from the sea-bottom; by its (appearance and) smell they can determine their whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|After {{disembarking}} in Sydney, {{the troops}} received {{three weeks of}} leave during which time {{they were allowed to}} return to their homes. The 9th Division then carried out welcome home marches across Australia, with the 2/15th taking part in the march through Brisbane. After this, the division was transported to Kairi on the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland where it was converted to the jungle establishment and began training for operations against the Japanese. The reorganisation saw the battalion establishment drop to around 800 <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> loss of many vehicles and heavy equipment. Lieutenant Colonel Colin Henry Grace was appointed to command the battalion in May 1943 and would do so {{for the rest of the}} war.

5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity.

The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|Due to lost {{communications}} with Battalion and then Regimental headquarters, and the unit's subsequent capture, its disposition and success at delaying {{the advance of}} the 6th Panzer Army that day was unknown to U.S. commanders.

On October 26, 1981, after considerable lobbying, a Congressional hearing, and letter-writing by Bouck, every member of the unit were finally recognized for their valor that day, making the platoon most decorated American unit of its size of World War II.|$|E

At Samos, however, a similar coup instigated by the conspirators did not go forward so smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians: the generals Leon and Diomedon, the trierarch Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a hoplite in the ranks. With the support of these <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Athenian soldiers in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the 300 Samian oligarchs who attempted to seize power there. Further, the Athenian troops at Samos formed themselves into a political assembly, deposed their generals, and elected new ones, including Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The army, stating that they had not revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.|$|E
