5000|$|Ringdown {{is used in}} manual operation, as {{distinguished}} from automatic signaling by dialing a number. The signal consists of a continuous or pulsed alternating current (AC) signal transmitted over the line. It may be used {{with or without a}} telephone switchboard. The term originated in <b>magneto</b> <b>telephone</b> signaling in which cranking the magneto generator, either integrated into the <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> or housed in a connected ringer box, would not only ring its bell but also cause a drop to fall down at the telephone exchange switchboard, marked with the number of the line to which the <b>magneto</b> <b>telephone</b> instrument was connected.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>telephone</b> <b>magneto</b> is a hand-cranked {{electrical}} generator that uses permanent magnets to produce alternating current from the rotating armature. In early telegraphy, magnetos {{were used to}} power instruments, while in telephony {{they were used to}} generate electrical current to drive electromechanical ringers in <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> and on operator consoles.|$|R

50|$|After World War II, {{rebuilding}} the devastated communications infrastructure was {{ordered by the}} General Headquarters of the Allied Forces (GHQ) {{and became one of}} the country's top priorities. Iwatsu took full advantage of the situation and focused on developing and manufacturing telephones. Iwatsu's production facilities made significant advancements with the introduction of quality control and belt conveyors. The foundation for increasing production was laid. Iwatsu established its position as a telephone manufacturer. Iwatsu delivered <b>magneto</b> <b>telephones</b> and dial telephones to the Ministry of Telecommunications, and aircraft radio communications accessories to the Japanese Ministry of Defense. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Public Corporation, founded by the Japanese government in 1952, opened a big market for subscriber telephones and became Iwatsu's biggest client. NTT also allowed <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> and PBX systems to be commercially available in Japan. Iwatsu opened one branch office after another across Japan over four years to build a nationwide sales network.|$|R

40|$|In a 4 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>set,</b> echo {{may arise}} both by {{electrical}} crosstalk in the cord and by acoustical coupling between earpiece and mouthpiece in the handset. The echo loss for these paths {{has been determined}} for two analogue 2 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b> This data is used to derive the echo loss of a hypothetical 4 -wire set having SLR + RLR = 3 dB, and acoustical and electrical properties {{the same as the}} 2 -wire <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b> I. 1 Introduction It has been pointed out in several contributions that the choice of LRs for digital <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> has to be made considering aspects of loudness and echo in a complete 4 -wire connection. To enable a study of the risk of objectionable echo, Study Group XVI has asked Study Group XII to present information on the subjective effect of talker echo as a function of delay, overall LR and echo path loss.

50|$|Initially, the {{operating}} telephone companies {{wanted to have}} the caller ID function performed by the central office as a voice announcement and charged on a per-call basis. John Harris, an employee of Northern Telecom's <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> manufacturing division in London, Ontario promoted {{the idea of having}} caller ID as a <b>telephone</b> <b>set</b> display. The <b>telephone</b> was coded ECCS for Enhanced Custom Calling Services. A video of his prototype was used to leverage the feature from the central office to the <b>telephone</b> <b>set.</b>|$|R

25|$|Rural areas, {{as well as}} the {{smallest}} towns, had manual service and signaling was accomplished with <b>magneto</b> <b>telephones,</b> which had a crank for the signaling generator. To alert the operator, or another subscriber on the same line, the subscriber turned the crank to generate ringing current. The switchboard responded by interrupting the circuit, which dropped a metal tab above the subscriber's line jack and sounded a buzzer. Dry cell batteries, normally two large NÂ°. 6 cells in the subscriber's telephone, provided the direct current for the transmitter. Such magneto systems were in use in the US as late as 1983, as in the small town, Bryant Pond, Woodstock, Maine.|$|R

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> for the 1A2 systems were modifications of the Bell System standard 500-series telephones for rotary dial systems, and the 2500-series Touch-Tone desk sets. For key system operation these sets were equipped {{with a set of}} push-buttons (keys) and additional internal contact springs to control the additional operational features, resulting in a large variety of specialty telephones. Specifically, such <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> were the types 565 (up to 5 lines), 630 (17 lines), 631 (29 lines), 830 (9 lines), and 831 (19 lines). <b>Telephone</b> <b>sets</b> could be either rotary dial models, or be equipped with Touch-Tone keypads.|$|R
50|$|LSI {{also allowed}} smaller systems to {{distribute}} the control (and features) into individual <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that don't require any single shared control unit. Generally, these systems are used with a relatively few <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> and it is often more difficult to keep the feature set (such as speed-dialing numbers) in synchrony between the various sets.|$|R

50|$|Historically {{telephones}} {{were typically}} {{owned by the}} telephone company and were usually permanently wired to the telephone line. However, for many installations it was necessary or convenient to provide portable <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that could be moved to a different location within the customer's premises. For this purpose telephone companies developed jacks and plugs with a varying number of contacts. Before ca. 1930, concentric connectors with three contacts were sufficient, but the upgrade of <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> to anti-sidetone circuitry required four conductors between the desk set and the subscriber set. For this purpose, Bell System engineers developed a cube-shaped four-prong plug (type No. 238) with uneven prong spacings to avoid improper insertion into the jack (type No. 404). This jack and plug combination later became the standard line connection for portable <b>telephone</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R

Mr. Miller liked to say he was taking McClure from the horse and buggy era, directly to the jet age. In November, 1975, McClure residents at last gave up their hand-cranked <b>magneto</b> <b>telephones,</b> and the friendly operators working above the local store. The operators served as a personal answering service for the residents, and would volunteer before ringing the number if someone was at home, and if they weren't, where they were, or when they'd be home. For the first time, subscribers heard a dial tone upon lifting the receiver, instead of the familiar question: [...] "number please." ...|$|R
50|$|A PBX {{differs from}} a key {{telephone}} system (KTS) in that users {{of a key}} system manually select their own outgoing lines on special <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> that control buttons for this purpose, while PBXs select the outgoing line automatically, or formerly, by an operator. The <b>telephone</b> <b>sets</b> connected to a PBX do not normally have special keys for central-office line control, {{but it is not}} uncommon for key systems to be connected to a PBX to extend its services.|$|R
