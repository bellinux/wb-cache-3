5|$|The {{mesosphere}} of Venus can {{be divided}} into two layers: the lower one between 62–73km and the upper one between 73–95km. In the first layer the temperature is nearly constant at 230K (−43°C). This layer coincides with the upper cloud deck. In the second layer temperature starts to decrease again reaching about 165K (−108°C) at the altitude of 95km, where <b>mesopause</b> begins. It is the coldest part of the Venusian dayside atmosphere. In the dayside <b>mesopause,</b> which serves as a boundary between the mesophere and thermosphere and is located between 95–120km, temperature increases to a constant—about 300–400K (27–127°C)—value prevalent in the thermosphere. In contrast, the nightside Venusian thermosphere is the coldest place on Venus with temperature as low as 100K (−173°C). It is even called a cryosphere.|$|E

By analyzing the reflected laser beam for Doppler shifts, wind speeds and wind directions in the target region may be calculated. The thermal structure, diurnal/semi-diurnal tides, and seasonal variations in the <b>mesopause</b> region may thus be studied. This is a valuable faculty for meteorologists and climatologists, as these properties can be significant.|$|E
2500|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} {{the highest in the}} {{atmosphere}} and form {{near the top of the}} mesosphere at about ten times the altitude of tropospheric high clouds. From ground level, they can occasionally be seen illuminated by the sun during deep twilight. Ongoing research indicates that convective lift in the mesosphere is strong enough during the polar summer to cause adiabatic cooling of small amount of water vapour to the point of saturation. This tends to produce the coldest temperatures in the entire atmosphere just below the <b>mesopause.</b> These conditions result in the best environment for the formation of polar mesospheric clouds. [...] There is also evidence that smoke particles from burnt-up meteors provide much of the condensation nuclei required for the formation of noctilucent cloud.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{publication}} of [...] "Twilight at Noon" [...] in 1982, the TTAPS team {{have said that they}} began the process of doing a 1-dimensional computational modeling study of the atmospheric consequences of nuclear war/soot in the stratosphere, though they would not publish a paper in Science magazine until late December 1983. The phrase [...] "nuclear winter" [...] had been coined by Turco just prior to publication. In this early paper, TTAPS used assumption based estimates on the total smoke and dust emissions that would result from a major nuclear exchange, and with that, began analyzing the subsequent effects on the atmospheric radiation balance and temperature structure {{as a result of this}} quantity of assumed smoke. To compute dust and smoke effects, they employed a one-dimensional microphysics/radiative-transfer model of the Earth's lower atmosphere (up to the <b>mesopause),</b> which defined only the vertical characteristics of the global climate perturbation.|$|E
50|$|Another {{feature is}} that the summer <b>mesopause</b> is cooler than the winter (sometimes {{referred}} to as the <b>mesopause</b> anomaly). It is due to a summer-to-winter circulation giving rise to upwelling at the summer pole and downwelling at the winter pole. Air rising will expand and cool resulting in a cold summer <b>mesopause</b> and conversely downwelling air results in compression and associated increase in temperature at the winter <b>mesopause.</b> In the mesosphere the summer-to-winter circulation is due to gravity wave dissipation, which deposits momentum against the mean east-west flow, resulting in a small north-south circulation.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} the <b>mesopause</b> has also {{been the focus of}} studies on global climate change {{associated}} with increases in CO2. Unlike the troposphere, where greenhouse gases result in the atmosphere heating up, increased CO2 in the mesosphere acts to cool the atmosphere due to increased radiative emission. This results in a measurable effect - the <b>mesopause</b> should become cooler with increased CO2. Observations do show a decrease of temperature of the <b>mesopause,</b> though the magnitude of this decrease varies and is subject to further study. Modeling studies of this phenomenon have also been carried out.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>mesopause</b> is the {{temperature}} minimum at {{the boundary between}} the mesosphere and the thermosphere atmospheric regions. Due to the lack of solar heating and very strong radiative cooling from carbon dioxide, the mesosphere is the coldest region on Earth with temperatures as low as -100 °C (-148 °F or 173 K). The altitude of the <b>mesopause</b> for many years was assumed to be at around 85 km (53 mi.), but observations to higher altitudes and modeling studies in the last 10 years have shown that in fact the <b>mesopause</b> consists of two minima - one at about 85 km and a stronger minimum at about 100 km. (62 mi.) ...|$|E
50|$|Polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) are a diffuse {{scattering}} {{layer of}} water ice crystals near the summer polar <b>mesopause.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{mesosphere}} ( [...] ; from Greek mesos [...] "middle" [...] and sphaira [...] "sphere") is {{the layer}} of the Earth's atmosphere that is directly above the stratosphere and directly below the <b>mesopause.</b> In the mesosphere, temperature decreases as the altitude increases. The upper boundary of the mesosphere is the <b>mesopause,</b> which can be the coldest naturally occurring place on Earth with temperatures below -143 C. The exact upper and lower boundaries of the mesosphere vary with latitude and with season, but the lower boundary of the mesosphere is usually located at heights of about 50 km above the Earth's surface and the <b>mesopause</b> is usually at heights near 100 km, except at middle and high latitudes in summer where it descends to heights of about 85 km.|$|E
50|$|The {{turbopause}} lies {{near the}} <b>mesopause,</b> {{at the intersection}} of the mesosphere and the thermosphere, at an altitude of roughly 100 km.|$|E
50|$|Temperatures drop with {{increasing}} altitude to the <b>mesopause</b> {{that marks the}} top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around -85 C.|$|E
50|$|The {{mesosphere}} is {{the third}} highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause {{at an altitude of}} about 50 km to the <b>mesopause</b> at 80 - 85 km above sea level.|$|E
50|$|Within the mesosphere, {{temperature}} decreases {{with increasing}} height, due to decreasing solar heating and increasing cooling by CO2 radiative emission. The {{top of the}} mesosphere, called the <b>mesopause,</b> is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere. Temperatures in the upper mesosphere fall as low as -101 C, varying according to latitude and season.|$|E
50|$|The {{mesosphere}} of Venus can {{be divided}} into two layers: the lower one between 62-73 km and the upper one between 73-95 km.

In contrast, the nightside Venusian thermosphere is the coldest place on Venus with temperature as low as 100 K (−173 °C). It is even called a cryosphere.|$|E
50|$|In the Earth's atmosphere, {{temperature}} varies greatly {{at different}} heights {{relative to the}} Earth's surface. The coldest temperatures lie near the <b>mesopause,</b> an area approximately 85 km to 100 km above the surface. In contrast, some of the warmest temperatures {{can be found in}} the thermosphere, which receives strong ionizing radiation at the level of the Van Allen radiation belt.|$|E
50|$|LIDAR {{comprises}} firing lasers at relevant {{portions of}} the atmosphere where light is backscattered. By analyzing the reflected laser beam for Doppler shifts, wind speeds and wind directions in the target region may be calculated.

50|$|It is {{convenient}} {{to separate the}} atmospheric regions according to the two temperature minima at about 12 km altitude (the tropopause) and at about 85 km (the <b>mesopause)</b> (Figure 1). The thermosphere (or the upper atmosphere) is the height region above 85 km, while the region between the tropopause and the <b>mesopause</b> is the middle atmosphere (stratosphere and mesosphere) where absorption of solar UV radiation generates the temperature maximum near 45 km altitude and causes the ozone layer. The density of the Earth's atmosphere decreases nearly exponentially with altitude. The total mass of the atmosphere is M = ρA H ≃ 1 kg/cm2 within a column of one square centimeter above the ground (with ρA = 1.29 kg/m3 the atmospheric density {{on the ground at}} z = 0 m altitude, and H ≃ 8 km the average atmospheric scale height). 80% of that mass is concentrated within the troposphere. The mass of the thermosphere above about 85 km is only 0.002% of the total mass. Therefore, no significant energetic feedback from the thermosphere to the lower atmospheric regions can be expected.|$|E
50|$|The sodium {{emissions}} {{come from}} a thin sodium layer approximately 10 km thick {{at an altitude of}} 90 - 100 km, above the <b>mesopause</b> and in the D-layer of the ionosphere. The red oxygen lines originate at altitudes of about 300 km, in the F-layer. The green oxygen emissions are more spatially distributed. How sodium gets to mesospheric heights is not yet well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of upward transport of sea salt and meteoritic dust.|$|E
5000|$|The {{homosphere}} and heterosphere {{are defined}} by whether the atmospheric gases are well mixed. The surface-based homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and the lowest part of the thermosphere, where the chemical composition of the atmosphere {{does not depend on}} molecular weight because the gases are mixed by turbulence. This relatively homogeneous layer ends at the turbopause found at about 100 km, the very edge of space itself as accepted by the FAI, which places it about 20 km above the <b>mesopause.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{thermosphere}} is {{the second-highest}} layer of Earth's atmosphere. It {{extends from the}} <b>mesopause</b> (which separates it from the mesosphere) {{at an altitude of}} about 80 km up to the thermopause at an altitude range of 500 - 1000 km. The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity. Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 km above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.|$|E
5000|$|The stratosphere, {{mesosphere}} {{and lowest}} {{part of the}} thermosphere are collectively {{referred to as the}} [...] "middle atmosphere", which spans heights from approximately 10 km to 100 km. The <b>mesopause,</b> at an altitude of 80 - 90 km, separates the mesosphere from the thermosphere - the second-outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere. This is also around the same altitude as the turbopause, below which different chemical species are well mixed due to turbulent eddies. Above this level the atmosphere becomes non-uniform; the scale heights of different chemical species differ by their molecular masses.|$|E
50|$|Lidars take {{advantage}} of resonance scattering in the upper atmosphere to detect metallic atoms. In such systems, the emitted laser light has to be precisely tuned in the resonance frequency of the studied species. The first such measurements were the detection of atomic layers of metallic Sodium (Na) in the <b>mesopause.</b> The same technique is now applied to detect metallic Potassium (K), Lithium (Li), Calcium (Ca), and Calcium ion (Ca ion), and Iron (Fe). These measurements provide important information in an under-studied region of the atmosphere and have helped increase the knowledge on species concentration, origin, and the complex atmospheric dynamics at these altitudes.|$|E
50|$|The line {{is named}} after Theodore von Kármán (1881-1963), a Hungarian-American {{engineer}} and physicist, who was active primarily in aeronautics and astronautics. He {{was the first person}} to calculate that the atmosphere around this altitude becomes too thin to support aeronautical flight, since a vehicle at this altitude would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift to support itself. The line is approximately at the turbopause, above which atmospheric gasses are not well-mixed. The <b>mesopause</b> atmospheric temperature minimum has been measured to vary from 85 to 100 km, which places the line at or near the bottom of the thermosphere.|$|E
5000|$|Generally PMSE {{exhibits}} dramatic {{variations in}} height and intensity {{as well as}} large variations in Doppler shift. PMSE exhibit strong signal power enhancements of scattering cross section at VHF radar frequencies in the range 50 MHz to 250 MHz, at times even to over 1 GHz, that occur in summer at high latitudes. The peak PMSE height is slightly below the summer <b>mesopause</b> temperature minimum at 88 km, and above the noctilucent cloud (NLC) and/or polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) layer at 83-84 km. The usual instrument for observing PMSE is the a VHF Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) radar, although LIDARs and sounding rockets have also been used.|$|E
50|$|Blamont is {{credited}} {{with the discovery of}} Turbopause in 1959, the Interstellar wind in 1970, the Hydrogen envelope of comets in 1971 and the polar Noctilucent clouds in 1973. He is known to have made the measurement of the temperature of the neutral atmosphere from 100 to 500 km, the dynamic paramters of the <b>Mesopause</b> region, and Einstein's general relativity Redshift on the Sun for the first time. He {{was the head of the}} group which introduced scientific ballooning and Lidar technology for atmospheric probing in Europe. The image compression device developed by Blamont is in use with various space agencies for planetary missions around the Moon, Mars and Titan. He has also contributed to the establishment of a shooting range, in Kourou, French Guyana.|$|E
50|$|The general {{seasonal}} {{characteristics of}} polar mesospheric clouds are well established from the fiveyears of continuous SME data. Over that period, data for four cloud ‘seasons’ in the north, and five‘seasons’ {{in the south}} were recorded. In both hemispheres, the season begins about one monthbefore summer solstice and ends about two months afterwards. Since there are no biases due tosuch factors as changing number of hours of visibility, weather conditions, etc. this is a ‘true’behaviour. It {{is believed to be}} a result of the fact that summertime <b>mesopause</b> region becomescoldest during this period causing water-ice to form, in contrast to most other regions of theatmosphere which are warmest in summer. Temperatures at latitudes equatorward of the boundaryof detection never get low enough for water-ice to form.|$|E

50|$|The {{specific}} objectives of ISAMS were: (i) To obtain measurements of atmospheric temperature {{as a function}} of pressure, from the tropopause to the <b>mesopause,</b> with good accuracy and spatial resolution, and hence to study the structure and dynamics of the region, (ii) To investigate the distribution and variability of water vapour in the middle atmosphere, to determine its role in the atmospheric general circulation, and its sources and sinks in the middle atmosphere, (iii) To measure the global distribution of oxides of nitrogen and hence to investigate their origins and their roles in catalytic cycles which control the amount of ozone in the stratospheric ozone layer. It also made extensive observations of volcanic aerosols and polar stratospheric clouds in the middle atmosphere. The instrument operated from September 1991-July 1992.|$|E
50|$|Just {{below the}} <b>mesopause,</b> {{the air is}} so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this {{altitude}} can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric noctilucent clouds. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be {{visible to the naked}} eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. A type of lightning referred to as either sprites or ELVES occasionally forms far above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Two {{kinds of}} {{large-scale}} atmospheric waves within the lower atmosphere exist: internal waves with finite vertical wavelengths which can transport wave energy upward; and external waves with infinitely large wavelengths which cannot transport wave energy. Atmospheric gravity waves {{and most of}} the atmospheric tides generated within the troposphere belong to the internal waves. Their density amplitudes increase exponentially with height, so that at the <b>mesopause</b> these waves become turbulent and their energy is dissipated (similar to breaking of ocean waves at the coast), thus contributing to the heating of the thermosphere by about 250 K in eq.(2). On the other hand, the fundamental diurnal tide labelled (1, −2) which is most efficiently excited by solar irradiance is an external wave and plays only a marginal role within lower and middle atmosphere. However, at thermospheric altitudes, it becomes the predominant wave. It drives the electric Sq-current within the ionospheric dynamo region between about 100 and 200 km height.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHF {{sounding}} of the mesosphere {{was first}} {{carried out at}} SURA in summer 1994 at frequencies in the range 8 ? 9 MHz {{using one of the}} sub-arrays of the SURA heating facility. The observations had a range resolution of 3 km. Almost all measurements indicated the presence of strong radar returns from altitudes between 83 and 90 km with features very similar to VHF measurements of <b>mesopause</b> summer echoes at mid-latitudes and polar <b>mesopause</b> summer echoes. In contrast to VHF observations, HF <b>mesopause</b> echoes are almost always present...|$|E
40|$|We present direct {{observations}} of zonal wave numbers 1 and 2 planetary wave {{activity in the}} <b>mesopause</b> region derived from a longitudinal chain of high-latitude Northern Hemisphere (51 - 66 ^∘N) Super Dual Auroral Radar Network radars. Over a 9 year period (2000 - 2008), the planetary wave activity observed shows a consistent increase around the fall equinox. This is shown to be coincident with a minimum in {{the magnitude of the}} stratospheric winds and consequently a minimum in the stratospheric gravity wave filtering and the subsequent momentum deposition in the <b>mesopause</b> region. Despite this, the observed meridional winds are shown to be perturbed poleward and <b>mesopause</b> temperatures rise temporarily, suggesting that westward momentum deposition from planetary waves temporarily becomes the dominant forcing on the <b>mesopause</b> region each fall equinox...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{transition}} regions in thermal structure viz. Tropopause, stratopause and <b>mesopause</b> {{play a vital}} role in the vertical coupling of the Earth’s atmosphere. For the first time, interhemispheric characteristics of the {{transition regions}} over two subtropical regions are studied using temperature observations from the SABER onboard TIMED satellite and the ERA Interim reanalysis during year 2002 to 2015. Results show that tropopause height is higher over Reunion Island (21. 11 S, 55. 53 E) in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) as compared to Mt. Abu region (24. 59 °N, 72. 70 °E) in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Temporal variation of tropopause temperature reveals a decreasing (* 4 K) trend from year 2002 to 2008 and beyond this, an increasing (* 1. 5 K) trend is found in tropopause temperature. These features are reinforcing for <b>Mesopause</b> as compared to tropopause temperature. The SH shows stronger variations in <b>Mesopause</b> temperature (* 7 K) compared to NH during year 2002 to 2008. The occurrence frequency of <b>mesopause</b> and stratopause height shows that the maximum occurrence frequency (* 60 %) of <b>mesopause</b> at * 100 km in NH, while frequency is found to be * 55 % in the SH. Results show that stratopause (<b>mesopause)</b> is cooler (warmer) in NH as compared SH. Moreover, Lomb Scargle Periodogram and wavelet transform techniques are used to investigate the periodicity of <b>mesopause,</b> stratopause and tropopause temperatures and heights. Investigations revealed prominent annual oscillations in the tropopause and stratopause temperatures in both hemispheres. These findings will be of immense use for the vertical and inter-hemispheric atmospheric coupling studies...|$|E
30|$|Yuan et al. (2012) {{studied the}} {{response}} of the middle-latitude <b>mesopause</b> region to the 2009 major SSW, using a sodium Doppler wind–temperature lidar. They have discovered anomalous behavior of the mean temperature and zonal winds around the <b>mesopause</b> during the warming and concluded that it was due to a direct impact of the major warming on the middle-latitude <b>mesopause.</b> The 2009 SSW {{has been one of the}} strongest warming events that has been recorded. The features around the <b>mesopause</b> during SSWs can be largely characterized in terms of an “elevated stratopause”, which forms around 75 – 80 km after the SSW occurrence and then descends (Maney et al. 2009). The role of GWs and planetary-scale waves in the time evolution of the elevated stratopause have been investigated by a number of authors (e.g., Chandran et al. 2011; Limpasuvan et al. 2012; Siskind et al. 2010).|$|E
