40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of {{pidotimod}} combined with ribavirin treatment on serum indexes of children with hand-foot-mouth disease. Methods: A total of 78 children with handfoot-mouth disease who received pidotimod combined with ribavirin treatment in our hospital from May 2013 to December 2015 were selected as the experimental group of the research, 84 children with hand-foot-mouth disease who received ribavirin monotherapy in our hospital from January 2012 to April 2013 were selected as the control group of the research. Serum inflammatory response indexes and biochemical indexes and immune function indexes of two groups were compared. Results: During the treatment, the <b>maculopapule</b> and herpes progression of experimental group were significantly better than those of control group; 7 day after treatment, CD 3 +CD 4 +CD 8 -T cell, CD 3 +CD 4 -CD 8 +T cell, CD 19 +B cell, CD 14 highCD 16 + monocyte and CD 14 lowCD 16 + monocyte content in peripheral blood of experimental group {{were significantly higher than}} those of control group, serum CRP, IL- 6 and IL- 10 levels were significantly lower than those of control group, and blood insulin, blood glucose, lactic acid, D-dimer and procalcitonin levels were significantly lower than those of control group. Conclusions: Pidotimod combined with ribavirin treatment can improve <b>maculopapule</b> and herpes, enhance immune function and reduce inflammatory reaction, and it is an ideal treatment for the treatment of children with hand-foot-mouth disease...|$|E

Of 1028 patients with GAS pharyngitis, which was principally treated with amoxicillin, we evaluated those who developed a late-onset rash and excluded those with scarlet fever alone. Twenty-one patients developed a rash (2. 0 %, 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 - 3. 1 %), 7 to 20 days (median, 8 days) after GAS pharyngitis onset. The rashes were characterized by <b>maculopapules,</b> which increased in size with coalescence and some developing into plaques, with a symmetrical distribution with a propensity for the extremities, including the palms and soles. The clinical courses of the patients were good, and the rashes subsided within 14 days.

Objective: To describe a case of minocycline-induced drug hypersensitivity syndrome in a 20 -year-old Japanese woman. Methods and Results: Following 2 months of minocycline treatment, the patient developed skin lesions composed of exudative <b>maculopapules,</b> purpuratous macules, and target-like, erythema multiforme-like plaques over most of her body. In addition, she had fever, abnormal liver function tests, eosinophilia, and atypical lymphocytosis. Laboratory tests indicated no elevation of antibody titers against cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus 6. Her ongoing exposure to minocycline was stopped, and treatment with oral prednisolone was begun. Her signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities then began to resolve. Sub-sequently, the syndrome was observed to return briefly in response to an oral challenge with minocycline. Conclusions: Minocycline is able to elicit a drug hypersensitivity syndrome that can resemble infectious mononucleosis.

40|$|Background. Vascularized {{composite}} tissue allografts (VCA) can undergo rejection, manifesting pathologically {{with skin}} changes {{that form the}} basis of the Banff 2007 classification of VCA rejection. Methods. We have followed 10 human VCA recipients (7 with hand allografts, 3 with face allografts) for pathological signs of rejection. All of them developed episodes of acute rejection. Two patients with hand allografts presented in some of their skin biopsies an as yet unreported pathological finding in human VCA, consisting of capillary thromboses (CT) in the upper dermis. Results. Capillary thrombosis was associated with other typical changes of grade II to III VCA rejection, namely, perivascular T cell infiltrates, but not with vascular C 4 d deposits (in formalin-fixed tissue). Clinically, the lesions presented as red or violaceous (lichenoid) cutaneous <b>maculopapules.</b> The first patient had several episodes of acute rejection during the 7 -year follow-up. The second patient developed donor-specific antibodies; some months after CTwere first observed, he developed chronic rejection leading to partial amputation of the allograft. Pathological examination of the skin showed graft vasculopathy and occasional C 4 d deposits in cutaneous capillaries. Conclusions. Capillary thrombosis seems to be a novel pathologic finding associated with human VCA rejection. Although its mechanism (immunologic vs nonimmunologic) remains unclear, this finding could carry an unfavorable prognostic significance, prompting close monitoring of the patients for severe/chronic rejection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Sweet’s {{syndrome}} is an acute neutrophilic dermatosis {{characterized by a}} diffuse dermal infiltrate of mature neutrophils. In most cases, it occurs as an isolated phenomenon (idiopathic Sweet’s syndrome) {{but it can be}} drug induced or associated with a variety of underlying diseases such as infections, neoplasms, and chronic inflammatory diseases. The association between Sweet’s syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis is rare. Only a few cases {{have been reported in the}} literature. We report a new case in which we describe an outbreak of acute neutrophilic dermatosis revealing ankylosing spondylitis. Case presentation A 33 -year-old Moroccan man presented with large-joint polyarthralgia, inflammatory pain in his buttocks and lower lumbar spine, fever and skin lesions. On examination, the patient had a low-grade fever, six tender but not swollen joints, limitation of motion of the lumbar spine, and painful erythematous <b>maculopapules</b> over his face, neck, and hands. Laboratory tests showed hyperleukocytosis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. The immunological tests and infectious disease markers were negative. Investigations for an underlying neoplastic disease remained negative. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a bilateral sacroiliitis. Skin biopsy findings were consistent with Sweet’s syndrome. The diagnosis of Sweet’s syndrome associated with ankylosing spondylitis was established. Nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs were started and the patient showed rapid clinical and biological improvement. Conclusion Three observations of the association between Sweet’s syndrome and spondylarthropathy have been reported in the literature. The cause of this association remains unclear. Some hypotheses have been developed, but further studies are needed to confirm or refute them. </p...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} {{assessment of the}} role of rubella virus in the pathogenesis of the rubella exanthem, virus was consistently isolated from cell cultures of skin biopsy specimens of the rash, and it was concluded that presence of virus in the skin was essential to evolution of the rash. For determination of whether virus is present in the skin only in association with rash, punch biopsies were performed concurrently on areas of skin with and without rash. Among paired skin specimens of 16 patients, virus was isolated from sites of rash in 12 and from the uninvolved skin in 10. In another pa-tient, shown by serologic response and recovery of virus from the pharynx to have rubella without a rash, virus was also isolated from the skin. It is concluded that rubel-la virus is widely disseminated in the skin of patients with rubella irrespective of the presence or distribution of the rash, and that the presence of virus in the skin, al-though a constant feature of the disease, {{is only one of the}} factors involved in the pathogenesis of the exanthem. Rubella virus has been shown to be present in the skin at sites of the rubella exanthem [I], but whether the distribution of virus in the skin cor-responds to and accounts for the pattern of rash in this disease has not been determined. To de-lineate the distribution of rubella virus in the skin, specimens from punch biopsies of rubella <b>maculopapules,</b> skin interjacent to maculopap-ules, and areas of skin entirely free of rash were tested for rubella virus.

40|$|By the intratracheal {{injection}} into monkeys of unfiltered nasopharyngeal washings from {{cases of}} measles in the preeruptive and early eruptive {{stages of the}} disease a relatively constant group of symptoms was induced which closely resemble those of measles in man. Of seven monkeys inoculated intratracheally with unfiltered nasopharyngeal washings from seven cases of measles, five developed the symptoms. The same group of symptoms was induced in one monkey by inoculation of the mucous membrane of the nose and mouth with unfiltered nasopharyngeal washings from a case of measles. In these experiments a variety of organisms, largely saprophytic inhabitants of the nasopharynx and mouth, {{were present in the}} material inoculated. There is sufficient evidence, however, that these organisms were in no way responsible for the reaction, since the same group of symptoms was induced in two monkeys by the intratracheal injection of nasopharyngeal washings from three cases of measles after the washings had been freed from ordinary organisms of the mouth flora by filtration through Berkefeld N filters. The characteristic group of symptoms which follows the inoculation of monkeys with the nasopharyngeal washings from patients with measles has been. successfully carried through six passages by intratracheal injection of saline emulsions of the skin and buccal mucous membranes of monkeys killed from 2 to 6 days after the onset of the reaction. From the fourth passage monkey the reaction was also successfully induced in three monkeys by means of citrated whole blood injected intravenously. This experiment showed the blood to be capable of inciting the reaction from at least the 7 th to 13 th days after intratracheal inoculation of the donor monkey, but incapable of inducing it from the 2 nd to 4 th days. Cultures of the blood showed no growth. The group of symptoms induced has been constant and definite in character. After an incubation period of 6 to 10 days the animal becomes listless and drowsy, the conjunctivæ become injected, and small, discrete, hyperemic macules appear on the labial mucous membrane. These spots increase in number and may eventually coalesce in the course of 2 to 4 days to form a diffuse, red, granular rash. This rash is usually limited to the labial mucous membrane but may extend {{to the inside of the}} cheeks. The individual macules may or may not show the minute bluish white center characteristic of Koplik spots. From one to several days after onset an eruption of small, discrete, red <b>maculopapules</b> appears on the skin, usually coming out first on the face. The rash progressively increases in the number and size of the individual lesions and may in the course of 2 to 3 days extend to the skin of the neck, shoulders, upper arms, chest, abdomen, and thighs. It is constant in character but varies considerably in extent in different animals. By the time the exanthem is fully developed, the rash on the mucous membranes has begun to fade and soon disappears. The exanthem in turn progressively fades, sometimes with a branny desquamation, sometimes without. There may be moderate pigmentation. By the 6 th to the 10 th day after onset all symptoms have disappeared and the animal again appears well. Coincident with this group of symptoms there is a constant and definite reduction in the total leucocyte count, frequently constituting a true leucopenia. Other symptoms of irregular occurrence are photophobia, diarrhea, and fever. Symptoms of rhinitis and bronchitis have not been noted. Histological sections of the lesions of the skin show an exudative and proliferative lesion about the capillaries of the corium in which endothelial leucocytes are the predominating cells. Mitotic cells are not infrequently present in these areas. The endothelial leucocytes may be seen migrating toward and occasionally invading the epithelial layers of the hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and epidermis. In places the epithelial cells appear edematous and vacuolated, and there is evidence of minute vesicle formation. The lesions of the labial mucous membrane are similar in character. Minute vesicle formation in the epithelium is more frequent and the vesicles occasionally assume a more pustular appearance. Similar lesions are found in histological sections of the tongue. Cultures of the blood made both during the incubation period and during the course of the reaction in a variety of media, aerobic and anaerobic, have consistently shown no growth. The close similarity of the symptoms and pathological lesions of the reaction to the symptoms and pathological lesions of measles, the successful transmission of the reaction from monkey to monkey, and the elimination of ordinary bacteria as a possible source of error in the interpretation of the results, warrant the belief that the reaction is caused by the inciting organism of measles...|$|R
