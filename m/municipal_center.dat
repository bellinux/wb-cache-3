5|$|Proposals for {{the line}} {{have been made}} since the {{extension}} to Østerås. The current municipal master plan calls for the line to be extended to Bekkestua Station, where it would again intersect with the Kolsås Line. One possibility is also that the service be continued along the Kolsås Line and a new branch be built to Sandvika, the <b>municipal</b> <b>center</b> of Bærum. However, an extension {{has not been a}} priority for the municipal politicians, although the right-of-way has been secured, which will simplify construction.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, 8,000 people {{commuted}} between Sotra and Bergen, and {{the bridge}} {{had an average}} daily traffic of 22,000 vehicles. On National Road 555 between Straume, the <b>municipal</b> <b>center</b> of Fjell, and Storavatnet, where National Road 555 becomes a motorway, there are long queues during rush hour. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has proposed a four-lane motorway along National Road 555 from Stoavatnet to Straume. This will require a new crossing across Knarreviksundet. Such a motorway extension is estimated to cost between NOK3 and 4 billion, {{and the government has}} allocated NOK400 million in National Transport Plan 2010–2019 for the project. It is presumed that most of the project will be financed as a toll road.|$|E
5|$|Tel Aviv {{gained in}} status, while Haifa {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} the role as regional capital. The opening of Ashdod as a port exacerbated this. Tourism shrank when the Israeli Ministry of Tourism placed emphasis on developing Tiberias as a tourist centre. Nevertheless, Haifa's population had reached 200,000 by the early 1970s, and mass immigration from the former Soviet Union boosted the population by a further 35,000. Many of Wadi Salib's historic Ottoman buildings have now been demolished, and in the 1990s a major section of the Old City was razed {{to make way for a}} new <b>municipal</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{initiative}} for a cross-fjord ferry services {{was taken by}} Arthur Selvig, leader of the merchants' association in Levanger. In January 1955, he invited members of the municipal councils {{on both sides of}} the fjord to establish a company. The meeting was held in Levanger, and the representatives from Mosvik took two days to get to the meeting. An interim committee was appointed, which was to cooperate with Innherreds Aktie Dampskibsselskab to persuade them not purchase a new ship, and also to consider purchase of a combined car- and cargo-ferry, or alternatively a conventional vessel. At the time, National Road 755 between Mosvik and Leksvik was being constructed and would be competed by the end of the decade; however, it would take longer before Mosvik would be connected to Venneshamn. The committee suggested the route Venneshamn–Kjerringvik–Vangshylla–Ytterøy–Levanger be established. The municipal council of Ytterøy voted to place the ferry quay at Hokstad, which was serving as the <b>municipal</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
