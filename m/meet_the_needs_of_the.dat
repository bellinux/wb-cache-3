5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of law}} is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{demobilisation}} began {{during the}} final years of the war. In order to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war economy 20,000 soldiers were released from the Australian Army in October 1943. Further reductions took place in August 1944 when another 30,000 soldiers and 15,000 personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were discharged. In mid-1945 the Government implemented a policy in which service men and women who had completed five years of service, including at least two years outside Australia, could volunteer for discharge.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} 1997 Master Plan for the area, {{plans for the}} Fort Canning Tunnel remained unchanged {{and it was not}} explicitly stated in the report that the National Library building would be demolished. In April 1997, the Library was closed for a S$2.6 million upgrading and renovation programme to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IT age. It was planned to reopen on 1 Oct, with its facilities upgraded, with new computers, and its collection updated with 80,000 volumes added. Actual renovations took nine months and the library was officially reopened on 16 January 1998.|$|E

5|$|The Irish Literary Theatre project {{lasted until}} 1901, when it {{collapsed}} owing {{to lack of}} funding.

The first performances staged by the society {{took place in a}} building called the Molesworth Hall. When the Hibernian Theatre of Varieties in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in Marlborough Street became available, Horniman and William Fay agreed to their purchase and refitting to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society.|$|E
5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. The filmmakers {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able {{to jump out of}} the train at full speed. The scene took precise execution. The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't beat out enough blood to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure {{can also lead to}} right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's low output, Schindler bought finished goods {{on the black market}} and resold them as his own. The rations provided by the SS were insufficient to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workers, so Schindler {{spent most of his time}} in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs. Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E

5|$|Section 201 amended {{legislation}} {{regarding the}} San Francisco Assay Office to allow coins to be minted there (as they previously were {{when it was}} the San Francisco Mint) {{until such time as}} the secretary certified that the mints of the United States were able to strike sufficient coins to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. It also repealed a provision of law not allowing gold or silver to be refined at the San Francisco facility. Section 202 increased the amount appropriated to expand Mint facilities (including the construction of the new Philadelphia Mint) from $30 million to $45 million. Section 9 of the Gold Standard Act of 1900 had required the Treasury Secretary to melt silver coins that were worn or no longer current, and restrike them into new ones; this was repealed by section 203 and the secretary was given authority to withdraw and melt all worn or uncurrent coins without needing to reuse the metal in coinage.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E
