Peale was made <b>Melter</b> and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint that year, and Chief Coiner three years later upon the retirement of the incumbent, Adam Eckfeldt, who continued in his work without pay. [...] Eckfeldt's labor allowed Peale to run a medal business using Mint property. This sideline eventually caused Peale's downfall: conflicts with Engraver James B.

[...] Lange, in his history of the Mint, notes that though Peale ended his career by being fired amid accusations of impropriety, upon his return from Europe, [...] "he was the bearer of many {{innovations}} devised in the mints of Europe and now {{made available to the}} United States Mint at Philadelphia".|$|E
500|$|While the {{legislation}} was being considered, Mint <b>Melter</b> and Refiner James Curtis Booth was conducting experiments on alloys {{that might be}} appropriate for the new cent. In July 1856, Snowden wrote to Guthrie, proposing an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel as ideal and suggesting amendments to the pending bill that would accomplish this.

[...] But in 1846, McClintock resigned and was replaced by Richard Sears McCulloh. [...] At first, McCulloh gave Peale whatever gold and silver he needed without question, but came to object to doing so. [...] Peale and McCulloh made a deal whereby the struck medal would remain in McCulloh's custody until Peale had replaced the bullion, but Peale objected that the procedure was [...] "inconvenient". [...] Beginning in August 1849, McCulloh refused further requests from Peale for bullion, and Peale instead gained it from the Mint's Treasurer.|$|E

500|$|Many {{interesting}} characters {{served at}} the Mint {{during the early years}} of operation. One was John Leonard Riddell, who served as <b>melter</b> and refiner at the Mint from 1839 to 1848, and, outside of his job, pursued interests in botany, medicine, chemistry, geology, and physics. He invented the binocular microscope. He also wrote on numismatics, publishing in 1845 a book entitled Monograph of the Silver Dollar, Good and Bad, Illustrated With Facsimile Figures, and two years later an article by him appeared in DeBow's Review called [...] "The Mint at New Orleans—Processes Pursued of Working the Precious Metals—Statistics of Coinage, etc." [...] Riddell was not held in high esteem by everyone, however: his conflicts with other Mint employees were well-documented, and at one point he was accused of being unable to properly conduct a gold melt.|$|E
500|$|The assay {{offices were}} {{regulated}} by sections 54 through 60, {{under the control}} of the Director of the Mint. [...] Each office would be governed in a manner similar to the mints, with a superintendent in charge and two subordinate officers: an Assayer and a <b>Melter</b> and Refiner. Sections 61 to 64 forbade counterfeiting, intentional lightening of coins to secure metal, and other offenses, and prescribed the punishments for them. Section 65 is a transition provision, setting an April 1, 1873 effective date, as well as providing that the current Director of the Mint (Pollock) would become superintendent at Philadelphia, and the occupants of the office of Treasurer at each mint (abolished by the legislation) would become Assistant Treasurers of the United States. [...] Section 66 names each mint and assay office, and Section 67 names the legislation as the [...] "Coinage Act of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three".|$|E
500|$|In 1835, Congress had {{authorized}} branch mints at Charlotte, North Carolina, Dahlonega, Georgia, and New Orleans, Louisiana, {{to strike}} into American coin the gold being mined in or {{entering the country}} through the South. [...] Despite the rich gold deposits nearby, both Charlotte and Dahlonega were in areas lacking men with technical training; accordingly trained personnel {{would have to be}} sent from Philadelphia. [...] New buildings were to be constructed. In August 1837, Mint Director Patterson received word of problems at both sites, including a partial collapse of the Dahlonega building. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury, proposing [...] "to send, to both the Gold mints, a confidential & skillful person, who may... give instructions as to correcting the errors, that have been committed... I know of no one competent to this task, except our <b>Melter</b> & Refiner, Mr. Peale." [...] Woodbury agreed, informing Patterson, [...] "you are authorized to send Mr. Peak." ...|$|E

500|$|One of the {{innovations}} that Peale introduced as <b>Melter</b> and Refiner {{was the use}} of salt in parting, using it to recover the silver dissolved in nitric acid when gold bullion was being purified. [...] Previously, this could only be done by using copper, a process that generated dangerous and offensive fumes. Table salt (sodium chloride), dissolved in nitric acid, caused silver chloride to precipitate, which could be recovered as metallic silver through the use of zinc and sulfuric acid. This was a further refinement of the parting process; the director of the Monnaie de Paris, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, had first used a salt solution as an easy, accurate means of assaying silver. A Senate report in 1873 stated that Peale's advancement of this process [...] "attests to his genius, enterprise, and high attainments". When there were calls in Congress in 1836 for a two-cent piece to be made of debased silver, or billon, Patterson had Peale, working with Second Engraver Christian Gobrecht, strike pattern coins to show that the coins would be easily counterfeited using base metals.|$|E
500|$|A two-cent piece {{had been}} {{proposed}} in 1806 by Connecticut Senator Uriah Tracy, {{along with a}} twenty-cent piece or [...] "double dime". Reflecting the then-prevalent view that coins should contain their value in metal, Tracy's bill provided that the two-cent piece be made of billon, or debased silver. [...] The bill was opposed by Mint Director Robert Patterson, {{as it would be}} difficult to refine the silver from melted-down pieces. [...] Although Tracy's legislation passed the Senate twice, in 1806 and 1807, it failed in the House of Representatives. Patterson sent a brass button with two of the billon planchets that would have been used for the coin to Tracy, showing how hard it would be to prevent counterfeiting. The Mint considered a two-cent piece in 1836, and experiments were conducted by Second Engraver Christian Gobrecht and <b>Melter</b> and Refiner Franklin Peale. The piece was to be again of billon, and provision for the coin was included in early drafts of the Mint Act of 1837, but the proposal was dropped when Peale was able to show that the coin could be easily counterfeited.|$|E
500|$|Little {{change was}} made to the {{officers}} of the mints, other than adding a superintendent for Philadelphia (Pollock {{would be the first}} incumbent), and abolishing the office of Treasurer at each facility. [...] In addition to the superintendent, each mint had as officers the Assayer, the <b>Melter</b> and Refiner, and the Coiner; each was required to post a bond to indemnify the government against losses during their tenure of office, and each was responsible for part of the coining process. [...] Philadelphia also had an Engraver (sometimes Chief Engraver), responsible for preparing coinage dies and designs, though the Director of the Mint could, with the agreement of the Treasury Secretary, hire outside artists to design coins. [...] The provision allowing for the hiring of outside artists was inserted at the suggestion of former director Patterson. The act set the salaries and bonding requirements for the officers, and required them to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, as was the case under both the 1792 and 1837 acts. [...] It also set forth the procedures for appointment of an acting officer or Director of the Mint, {{in the case of the}} incumbent's temporary absence.|$|E

Liquid dynamics predicts that for a class of elements called “normal <b>melters,</b> ” including all 29 of these materials, the two estimates should closely match, and we find that they agree to within a few percent. We also perform the same calculations for 4 “anomalous <b>melters,</b> ” for which we expect the two estimates to differ markedly; we find that they disagree by factors almost up to three. From this we conclude that the liquid entropy estimates of the logarithmic moment, applicable both to normal and anomalous <b>melters,</b> are trustworthy to a few percent, which makes them reliable for use in estimates of various liquid transport coefficients. ...|$|R

500|$|On {{taking office}} as <b>Melter</b> and Refiner, Peale {{implemented}} the changes he had recommended {{based on what}} he had seen in Europe. [...] He also wanted additional mechanization in the mint's Coining Department, headed by Chief Coiner Adam Eckfeldt, whose son Jacob was the Philadelphia Mint's Assayer. Adam Eckfeldt had helped strike some of the first federal coins in 1792 and had been in his office since 1814. [...] Eckfeldt was reluctant to adopt all [...] Peale's recommendations, telling Peale's nephew, engineer George Sellers, [...] "If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down... he wants something better and no doubt he would have it if we were starting anew." [...] As improvements crept in despite Eckfeldt's caution, the Chief Coiner saw their value and became more enthusiastic, noting the savings in working time afforded by the Contamin lathe, which had been imported from France after being seen by Peale there. To help deal with the increased output from the Philadelphia Mint, Peale invented a piling-box, allowing planchets or coins to be quickly stacked, and a counting board, speeding the work of the clerks. The counting board remained in use until the mints installed mechanical counters in 1934.|$|E
500|$|Sellers, in his memoirs, {{described}} Eckfeldt as [...] "a man of staunch integrity, a cautious, careful, {{orderly and}} painstaking man; {{he was not}} one of the dashing, pushing, inventive mechanics, though under his care many apparently slight improvements were gradually adopted that in the aggregate amounted to a great deal in the economy of working. He was by no means deficient in inventive ability." [...] Nevertheless, as Eckfeldt aged {{in the service of the}} Mint in the late 1820s and into the 1830s, he was reluctant to adopt the innovations being proposed by his fellow Mint officer, <b>Melter</b> and Refiner Franklin Peale. [...] Peale, like Eckfeldt of a mechanical bent, had many suggestions for improvements to the coinage machinery, some of which Eckfeldt adopted. Eckfeldt stated to Sellers, [...] "If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down". According to Sellers, [...] "the giving up of almost life-long pets that had been Mr. Eckfeldt's constant care would naturally go hard, and still harder coming from another department, but as improvements gradually crept in and proved their efficiency Mr. Eckfeldt gave full credit where it belonged, and I remember him becoming quite enthusiastic over the labor saving [...] in duplicating working dies".|$|E
