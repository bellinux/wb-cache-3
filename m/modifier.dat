5|$|Non-nucleoside phosphoramidites are the phosphoramidite {{reagents}} {{designed to}} introduce various functionalities at the termini of synthetic oligonucleotides or between nucleotide residues {{in the middle}} of the sequence. In order to be introduced inside the sequence, a non-nucleosidic <b>modifier</b> has to possess at least two hydroxy groups, one of which is often protected with the DMT group while the other bears the reactive phosphoramidite moiety.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses use serpins {{to disrupt}} {{protease}} functions in their host. The cowpox viral serpin CrmA (cytokine response <b>modifier</b> A) {{is used in}} order to avoid inflammatory and apoptotic responses of infected host cells. CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host's inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-1 and L-18 processing by the cysteine protease caspase-1. In eukaryotes, a plant serpin inhibits both metacaspases and a papain-like cysteine protease.|$|E
5|$|Treatment was {{initially}} limited to aspirin and warfarin, but the 1990s saw {{the introduction of}} a number of agents that could provide anticoagulation without a risk of recurrent HIT. Older terminology distinguishes between two forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: type 1 (mild, non-immune mediated and self-limiting fall in platelet count) and type 2, the form described above. Currently, the term HIT is used without a <b>modifier</b> to describe the immune-mediated severe form.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a class-based approach to ordering prenominal <b>modifiers.</b> <b>Modifiers</b> are grouped into broad classes based {{on where they}} tend to occur prenominally, and a framework is developed to order sets of <b>modifiers</b> based on their classes. This system is developed to generate several orderings for <b>modifiers</b> with more flexible positional constraints, and lends itself to bootstrapping for the classification of previously unseen <b>modifiers.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Battle Rules are <b>modifiers</b> {{that affect}} a Battle. There {{are two types}} of <b>modifiers</b> : the {{positive}} and negative.

5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression <b>modifier,</b> although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Double Dare 2000 {{introduced}} the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed {{a team to}} make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize at stake. Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual <b>modifier</b> was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in <b>modifier</b> genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence that suggests that a few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene {{for the development of}} butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics. The Batesian mimicry in Papilio polytes is controlled by the doublesex gene.|$|E

5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a <b>modifier</b> or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Leaf-related {{adhesion}} {{problems have}} been present in many railway networks {{all over the world}} in the last few decades. Since the early 1970 s many measures have been undertaken in order to mitigate the problem. One of the measures adopted by many railway networks is the use of friction <b>modifiers.</b> However, the low adhesion problem still persists. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these friction <b>modifiers</b> has not well proven yet {{due to the lack of}} research in controlled conditions. Consequently, the rolling stock operators and infrastructure managers do not clearly understand the performance and side effects of the friction <b>modifiers</b> used on their networks. In this paper, an investigation of the performance of two existent friction <b>modifiers</b> in controlled laboratory conditions is presented. These friction <b>modifiers</b> have been used or tested in several railway networks. A twin-disk roller rig has been used to study their performance in leaf contaminated contacts. The adhesion characteristics of both friction <b>modifiers</b> are examined for different slip ratios. The constituents of the friction <b>modifiers</b> are identified and the solid components are analyzed.

40|$|Abstract We {{argue that}} the superlative <b>modifiers</b> at least and at most quan-tify over a scale of answers to the current {{question}} under discussion (and in this sense, resolve issues), and that they {{draw attention to the}} individual pos-sibilities along the scale (and in this sense, raise issues for discussion). The point of departure is a simple analysis on which at least denotes what only presupposes, and at most denotes what only contributes as its ordinary at-issue content. This analysis captures the truth conditions, focus-sensitivity, and distribution of superlative <b>modifiers</b> but leaves some pragmatic facts unexplained. We enrich the simple account with unrestricted inquisitive semantics in order to explain the fact that superlative <b>modifiers</b> give rise to ignorance implicatures while comparative <b>modifiers</b> like more and less do not, the fact that superlative <b>modifiers</b> do not give rise to scalar impli-catures, and two puzzles concerning the interaction between superlative <b>modifiers</b> and deontic modals.
