5|$|The game {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a 19inch CRT monitor. The initial concept was conceived by John Kotlarik, who aimed {{to create a}} non-violent game. Inspired by Pac-Man, he envisioned similar gameplay in an open playing field {{rather than in a}} maze. Python Anghelo furthered the concept by creating artwork and a scenario. Kotlarik designed the protagonist to have fluid movement like it was traveling on a slick surface. The control scheme allows the digital input to operate similar to an analogue one. He programmed the bubble to accelerate in the direction the joystick is held. Once the joystick returns to its neutral position, the bubble will coast as the velocity slowly decreases. Anghelo designed the artwork for the wooden cabinets as well as a new cylindrical, plastic cabinet. Gary Berge, a mechanical engineer, created the new cabinets with a rotational <b>molding</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bakelite's <b>molding</b> <b>process</b> had {{a number}} of advantages. Bakelite resin could be {{provided}} either as powder, or as preformed partially cured slugs, increasing the speed of the casting. Thermosetting resins such as Bakelite required heat and pressure during the molding cycle, but could be removed from the <b>molding</b> <b>process</b> without being cooled, again making the <b>molding</b> <b>process</b> faster. Also, because of the smooth polished surface that resulted, Bakelite objects required less finishing. Millions of parts could be duplicated quickly and relatively cheaply.|$|E
25|$|The {{first patent}} {{for this type}} of <b>molding</b> <b>process</b> was taken out in 1968, however it was rarely used until the 1980s. That is when the {{automotive}} industry took interest in it to develop intake manifolds.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} {{lies in the}} molds themselves. Since {{they require}} less tooling, they can be manufactured and put into production {{much more quickly than}} other <b>molding</b> <b>processes.</b> This is especially true for complex parts, which may require large amounts of tooling for other <b>molding</b> <b>processes.</b> Rotational <b>molding</b> is also the process of choice for short runs and rush deliveries. The molds can be swapped quickly or different colors can be used without purging the <b>mold.</b> With other <b>processes,</b> purging may be required to swap colors.|$|R
40|$|Ancient {{casting process}} for {{production}} of brass or bronze utensils and icons {{were made in}} hot molds using clay molded investment casting or piece <b>mold</b> <b>process,</b> as presumed by archaeologists. Piece <b>mold</b> <b>process</b> is still traditionally practiced {{in many parts of}} Eastern India and Bangladesh along with investment casting process. Incidentally, Bengal artisans are more accustomed to piece <b>mold</b> <b>process</b> unlike tribal artisans who practiced investment casting <b>process.</b> This piece <b>mold</b> casting <b>process</b> has been reconstructed to get the idea of metal characteristics in order to investigate ancient casting process of Bengal and Bangladesh. The characterization of ancient archaeo-metal products come to a type of cast Cu-Sn-Zn-Pb type quaternary alloy produced by a slow freezing process. Though these alloys physically differ from the traditional cast alloy of binary Cu-Zn type brass, the physical characteristics are similar to the binary cast alloy character. This investigation throws light on the similarity of the production processes by which ancient artisans probably produced cast metal products...|$|R

25|$|Molded – Molding {{is used to}} {{manufacture}} some brands of soft contact lenses. Rotating molds are used and the molten material is added and shaped by centripetal forces. Injection molding and computer control are also used to create nearly perfect lenses. The lens is kept moist throughout the entire <b>molding</b> <b>process</b> and is never dried and rehydrated.|$|E
25|$|Cores {{are used}} for complex {{injection}} moldings in the fusible core injection <b>molding</b> <b>process.</b> First, a core is made from a fusible alloy or low melting temperature polymer. It is then placed inside the injection mold's dies and the plastic is shot into the mold. The molding is then removed from the mold with the core still in it. Finally, the core is melted or washed out of the molding in a hot bath.|$|E
25|$|This slip {{is poured}} into the space between plaster of Paris molds. The toilet bowl, rim, tank and tank lid require {{separate}} molds. The molds are assembled and set up for filling and the slip-filled molds sit {{for about an hour}} after filling. This allows the plaster molds to absorb moisture from the slip, which makes it semisolid next to the mold surfaces but lets it remain liquid further {{from the surface of the}} molds. Then, the workers remove plugs to allow any excess liquid slip to drain from the cavities of the mold (this excess slip is recycled for later use). The drained-out slip leaves hollow voids inside the fixture, using less material to keep it both lighter and easier to fire in a kiln. This <b>molding</b> <b>process</b> allows the formation of intricate internal waste lines in the fixture; the drain's hollow cavities are poured out as slip.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} three {{commercial}} unsaturated polyester resins of wide use in Colombia are analyzed {{and it is}} evaluated the convenience of their use in resin transfer <b>molding</b> <b>processes</b> according to viscosity and reactivity criteria. The resin viscosities are compared between 15 and 50 °C, {{in the same way}} as the reactivity by mean of the curing curves at room temperature, using catalyst at 1, 1. 5 and 2 %. In agreement with the results, it was determined that some resins are suitable for RTM process, because of their appropriate viscosity, consistent reactivity and curing velocity. These features are of great importance in the unsaturated polyester resin selection, according to conditions of closed <b>mold</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Fusible core {{injection}} molding, {{also known}} as lost core injection molding, is a specialized plastic injection <b>molding</b> <b>process</b> used to mold internal cavities or undercuts that are not possible to mold with [...] cores. Strictly speaking the term [...] "fusible core injection molding refers {{to the use of}} a fusible alloy as the core material; when the core material is made from a soluble plastic the process is known as soluble core injection molding. This process is often used for automotive parts, such as intake manifolds and brake housings, however it is also used for aerospace parts, plumbing parts, bicycle wheels, and footwear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of castings {{was similar to}} the way they were made {{since the early days of}} founding. [...] Molding was done with green sand until sometime in the 1960s or 1970’s the furan <b>molding</b> <b>process</b> was adopted for medium and large sized castings. [...] Melting continued using the cupola. [...] Most requirements on the foundry were for gray iron, the material normally used in machine tool castings. [...] With the discovery of Ductile iron, the foundry began producing ductile in the 1950s using open ladle treatments or the Gazal porous plug process. [...] Not many machine tool parts were needed in ductile iron.|$|E
