They tell the hungry cat {{that he is a}} lion and a bulldog his prey, leading to several painful encounters for the cat.|$|R

40|$|This study {{questioned}} {{the role of}} paraoxonase 2 (PON 2) in attenuation of macrophage lipids accumulation. Mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) harvested from PON 2 -deficient mice versus control C 57 BL/ 6 <b>mice,</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> foam cells and were larger in size and filled with lipid droplets. Macrophage triglyceride (but not cholesterol) content, biosynthesis rate, and microsomal acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT 1) activity (not mRNA and protein) in PON 2 -deficient versus control MPM were all significantly increased by 4. 6 -, 3. 6 -, and 4. 4 -fold, respectively. Similarly, microsomal DGAT 1 activity and cellular triglyceride content were significantly decreased in human PON 2 -transfected cells as well as upon incubation of PON 2 -deficient MPM with recombinant PON 2. In all the above experimental systems, PON 2 also decreased macrophage oxidative state. Incubation of PON 2 -deficient MPM with the free radicals generator 2, 2 ′-amidinopropane hydrochloride increased cellular oxidative stress and DGAT 1 activity by 2. 2 - and 3. 4 -fold, respectively, whereas incubation of microsomes from PON 2 -deficient MPM with superoxide dismutase decreased DGAT 1 activity by 40 %. We thus conclude that PON 2 attenuates macrophage triglyceride accumulation and foam cell formation via inhibition of microsomal DGAT 1 activity, {{which appears to be}} sensitive to oxidative state...|$|R
50|$|On {{the east}} flank of Eldorado Mountain is its largest cliff, Mickey Mouse Wall. When {{viewed from the}} north, two buttresses {{at the top of}} the cliff <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a pair of mouse ears. But, from the east, Mickey <b>Mouse</b> <b>looks</b> just <b>like</b> one of the flatirons. The only trail on this side of the {{mountain}} is a climber's trail accessing Mickey Mouse Wall. (As of September 2007, the City of Boulder was planning to re-align this trail.) Also on the east flank are the remains of the Conda Quarry, covering about 7 acre. The quarry operated from the 1950s through the 1980s. In 1992, in order to preserve the land as open space, the City of Boulder purchased the quarry along with the underlying land and mining rights. Later, the City undertook a reclamation project on the site, although the quarry is still visible. Down from the quarry on the access road is the Eldorado Mountain Yoga Ashram.|$|R
40|$|The food system {{today is}} {{destroying}} the environment upon which future food production depends. While the food system generates enough food energy for our population of over 7 billion {{it does not}} deliver adequate and affordable nutrition for all. About half the global population is inadequately or inappropriately nourished. Without action, these problems are set to become acute. As our global population grows, urbanises and becomes wealthier, it is demanding more resource intensive, energy rich foods. What, and how much we eat directly affects what, {{and how much is}} produced. We therefore need to consume more „sustainable diets‟ – diets that have lower environmental impacts, and are healthier.

40|$|Summary: Background: Norwegian kindergarten’s are {{supposed}} to have a health promoting and health preventive function. This includes work that can result in social equality and less discrimination. Knowledge about the strong connection between adverce childhood experiences and health development, makes kindergarten an important arena for the society’s promoting and preventive effort in general. In this effort it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> the <b>health</b> promoting perspective have received less focus than preventive strategies. Aim: The aim with this master thesis is to focus and draw attention to the health promoting perspective as foundation for the effort towards socially disadvantaged children and relate this to every day practice in kindergarten. Method: This is a qualitative oriented study. Data is collected by interviewing 4 kindergarten teachers (pedagogic leaders) from 3 different kindergartens using focus group as interview method. Findings: Kindergarten teachers find work with socially disadvantage children meaningful, but also challenging and demanding. Result: Despite the fact that plans for kindergarten focus on promoting children’s health, results from this study shows that in health promoting work towards socially disadvantaged children, strongest focus seems to be on preventive strategies based on individual support. Key words: kindergarten, socially disadvantage children, health promotion, salutogenese, resilience, lifespan, stigma...|$|R
50|$|A {{stuttering}} announcer, (Roscoe Ates), {{introduces the}} special guest of the event, {{none other than}} Krazy Kat. To entertain the crowd in attendance, Krazy plays some short tunes on a piano. The piano is carried to him by <b>mice</b> who <b>look</b> supisciously <b>like</b> miniature versions of Minnie Mouse. The first tune Krazy Kat plays is Merrily We Roll Along. After a first successful performance he is interrupted by Joe E. Brown's high-pitched yelping, but Krazy literally zips his mouth shut. As he continues playing, the Marx Brothers: Groucho, Chico, Zeppo and Harpo pop out of the piano and shake hands with him before leaving on a tandem bicycle. Halfway Harpo hops off to run after a young woman. As she dashes into the kitchen, he follows her, but is kicked out by an African-American female cook.|$|R
2500|$|Apple was {{initially}} reluctant to embrace mice with multiple buttons and scroll wheels. Macs did not natively support pointing devices that featured multiple buttons, even from third parties, until Mac OS X arrived in 2001. Apple continued to offer only single button mice, in both wired and Bluetooth wireless versions, until August 2005, when it introduced the Mighty <b>Mouse.</b> While it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a traditional one-button mouse, it actually had four buttons and a scroll ball, capable of independent x- and y-axis movement. A Bluetooth version followed in July 2006. In October 2009, Apple introduced the Magic Mouse, which uses multi-touch gesture recognition (similar {{to that of}} the iPhone) instead of a physical scroll wheel or ball. It is available only in a wireless configuration, but the wired Mighty Mouse (re-branded as [...] "Apple Mouse") is still available as an alternative. Since 2010, Apple has also offered the Magic Trackpad as a means to control Macintosh desktop computers in a way similar to laptops.|$|R
40|$|In 1975, 50 year-old Americans {{could expect}} to live {{slightly}} longer than most of their Western European counterparts. By 2005, American life expectancy had fallen behind that of most Western European countries. We find that this growing longevity gap is primarily due to real declines in the health of near-elderly Americans, relative to their Western European peers. We use a microsimulation approach to project what US longevity would <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> if US <b>health</b> trends approximated those in Western Europe. The model implies that differences in health can explain most of the growing gap in remaining life expectancy. In addition, we quantify the public finance consequences of this deterioration in health. The model predicts that gradually moving American cohorts to the health status enjoyed by Western Europeans could save up to $ 1. 1 trillion in discounted total health expenditures from 2004 to 2050.

Tom pulls their tails, causing four fake Jerrys to exclaim, [...] "Mama!" [...] until the real Jerry yelps.

Eventually, Jerry stretches the net across to the other side and grabs a croquet mallet before he is shot back at the cat. Tom prepares to dash to the other side and then sees the mallet approaching and gets launched back on impact. Jerry uses the fire truck to speed across the floor and open a pipe so that Tom squeezes through it. The cat snakes through the plumbing and comes out {{in the shape of a}} cylinder. He then is ejected into the opening elevator doors, falling down the shaft until he meets a spring placed by Jerry, and bounces off it and through the mail slot.|$|R
