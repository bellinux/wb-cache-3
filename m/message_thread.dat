Although these interactive tools are highly effective in learning environments, their usability by blind students is very poor. In this paper we develop techniques to improve accessibility of educational content {{for students who}} are blind. Threads of messages in discussion boards evolve with new postings, thus just by investigating the subject headings or contents of earlier postings in a <b>message</b> <b>thread,</b> students {{may not be able to}} guess the contents of the postings deeper in the hierarchy. In order to overcome the navigation obstacle for users, it is essential to develop techniques that help identify how the content of a discussion board grows.

Unfortunately the techniques that have proven successful for searching document collections and the Web are not ideally suited to the task of searching archived community discussions. In this paper, we explore the problem of creating an effective ranking function to predict the most relevant messages to queries in community search. We extract a set of predictive features from the thread trees of newsgroup messages as well as features of message authors and lexical distribution within a <b>message</b> <b>thread.</b> Our final results indicate that when using linear regression with this feature set, our search system achieved a 28. 5 % performance improvement compared to our baseline system...|$|E

In this paper, we investigate how team leadership roles can be inferred from a collection of email messages exchanged among team members.

Using a large email collection with several workgroups whose leaders were previously defined, we demonstrate that leadership positions can be predicted by a combination of traffic-based and textbased email patterns. Traffic-based patterns consist of information patterns that can be extracted from the message headers, such as frequency counts, <b>message</b> <b>thread</b> position and whether the message was broadcast to the entire workgroup or not. Textual patterns are represented by the message’s “email speech acts”,i. e., semantic information with the sender’s intent that can be automatically inferred by language usage.

40|$|Message {{hierarchies}} in web discussion boards {{grow with}} new postings. Threads of messages evolve as new postings focus within or diverge {{from the original}} themes of the threads. Thus, just by investigating the subject headings or contents of earlier postings in a <b>message</b> <b>thread,</b> one {{may not be able}} to guess the contents of the later postings. The resulting navigation problem is further compounded for blind users who need the help of a screen reader program that can provide only a linear representation of the content. We see that, in order to overcome the navigation obstacle for blind as well as sighted users, it is essential to develop techniques that help identify how the content of a discussion board grows through generalizations and specializations of topics. This knowledge can be used in segmenting the content in coherent units and guiding the users through segments relevant to their navigational goals. Our experimental results showed that the segmentation algorithm described in this paper provides up to 80 - 85 % success rate in labeling messages. The algorithm is being deployed in a software system to reduce the navigational load of blind students in accessing web-based electronic course materials; however, we note that the techniques are equally applicable for developing web indexing and summarization tools for users with sight...|$|E

40|$|The Portable Document Format (PDF) is {{currently}} becoming {{the standard for}} digital documents. One of the tasks regularly performed on digital documents is annotating and reviewing annotated documents. In collaborative annotation, the document is a heterogeneous collection of annotations by several persons, which at some level include annotating previous annotations done by other persons. Two different ways exist for annotating digital documents: the first method is the sticky notes way, which {{is a collection of}} expandable layered notes drawn over the text using transparency. The second method is packing the annotations in a message-thread interface where they are grouped by several aspects of the annotation. Our hypothesis is that a threaded interface will help users understand and critique collaboratively annotated documents better than layered interface. Our work was based on the Joanna Wolfe’s studies which revealed three essential requirements for supporting effective collaborative annotation, namely, the need to allow authors to categorize annotations by positive or negative content, a means to provide information about annotators including their general position about a particular topic or text, and a mechanism that helps readers sort and filter annotations systematically In this paper, we present PDFORUM, a tool for supporting collaborative annotation on PDF documents as a plug-in for Adobe Acrobat software. The tool provides the ability to annotate documents contents as well as previous annotations with the ability to specify a type for the annotation and a rating for the document contents and the previous annotations. Finally the tool provides the ability to preview the annotations using color coding to provide a compilation of all the ratings specified by the annotators.

40|$|E-mail {{is used as}} {{the primary}} tool for {{business}} communication and collaboration. This paper presents a novel e-mail interaction mining method to discover and analyze e-mail-driven business processes. An e-mail-driven business process {{is perceived as a}} human collaboration process that consists of interactions between people who may each play different roles. The notion of <b>message</b> <b>threads</b> (i. e. sets of e-mail messages that are replies to each other) is used as the fundamental building block to construct the interactions in the e-mail-driven business process. The proposed method adopts an interaction-centric business process modeling language to visualize the discovered e-mail-driven business process. The method identifies <b>message</b> <b>threads</b> from an e-mail archive, and constructs an interaction-centric process model based on the temporal order and similarity of the threads. Process-related information is extracted from e-mail header fields. A software tool, named E-mail Interaction Miner, implements the proposed method. A case study is used to apply and evaluate the method on a set of e-mails collected from a Dutch gas transport company. The evaluation results are discussed. These results comprise business process improvement opportunities for the case organization, and contributions to theory and language development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the {{management}} of accountability and identity in an online commercial weight loss group. The commercial weight loss context is socially significant {{because it is a}} space which foregrounds women's efforts to control their bodies and behaviour in order to conform to culturally prescribed norms of 'femininity' through continued selfsurveillance and restriction of consumption. The analysis examines 2219 individual posts in 422 <b>message</b> <b>threads</b> over a 24 hour period on a message board on the Weight Watchers website. The site explicitly promotes itself as a space in which members can obtain advice and emotional support from fellow dieters in an encouraging and egalitarian environment, and is therefore intended to be used as an aid to becoming a more successful 'weight watcher' (and consequently a 'better woman'). Using a feminist hybrid discourse analytic method, and drawing on Coffman's notion of 'face', the empirical chapters explore the interactional management of progress reports by group members. The commercial weight loss group provides a space in which the confession of transgression is encouraged, and analysis of the <b>message</b> <b>threads</b> reveals that members of the message board community are accountable to both societal gender norms and to their fellow weight watchers. In these confessional exchanges group members realign themselves with social norms of 'femininity', and renew their commitment to the body modification project. Group members employ face-protective mitigation strategies in their delivery of confessions, and responses to confessional posts orient to group norms of solidarity and support while rehabilitating the transgressing members back into the eating regime. The analysis also explores the use of humour {{in the construction of the}} confessional message which, despite its potential to undermine the regime, appears to perform a face-management function, and is used to display 'expertise' about the regime while fostering group solidarity. In <b>message</b> <b>threads</b> where group members report 'inexplicable' failure to lose weight, the group work to maintain commitment to the regime by explaining lack of success in ways which are protective of the reputation of the regime as an effective means of losing weight, thus ensuring continued dedication to the body modification project. The community offers solutions which provide the member with new 'expertise', helping her to become a 'better weight watcher'...|$|R

40|$|Email-based {{activity}} {{management systems}} promise to give users better tools for managing increasing volumes of email, by organizing email {{according to a}} user’s activities. Current activity management systems do not automatically classify incoming messages by the activity to which they belong, instead relying on simple heuristics (such as <b>message</b> <b>threads),</b> or asking the user to manually classify incoming messages as belonging to an activity. This paper presents several algorithms for automatically recognizing emails {{as part of an}} ongoing activity. Our baseline methods are the use of <b>message</b> reply-to <b>threads</b> to determine activity membership and a naïve Bayes classifier. Our SimSubset and SimOverlap algorithms compare the people involved in an activity against the recipients of each incoming message. Our SimContent algorithm uses IRR (a variant of latent semantic indexing) to classify emails into activities using similarity based on message contents. An empirical evaluation shows that each of these methods provide a significant improvement to the baseline methods. In addition, we show that a combined approach that votes the predictions of the individual methods performs better than each individual method alone...|$|R

In Gmail, the 'All Mail' section displays all of a user's emails, excluding the ones in Spam and Bin. Technically, when a message is archived, the 'Inbox' label is removed from it. Archiving presents a better alternative to deleting as it helps to tidy up the inbox without deleting messages permanently. Archiving, however, is limited to <b>message</b> <b>threads</b> and individual <b>messages</b> cannot be archived. Moreover, archiving is available only for the inbox, and messages in other places such as Sent Mail cannot be archived.
