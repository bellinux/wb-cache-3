5|$|Edward III (13 November 1312– 21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 {{until his}} death; he is noted for his {{military}} success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, EdwardII. EdwardIII transformed the Kingdom of England {{into one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> military powers in Europe. His long reign of 50 years was the second longest in medieval England and saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament—as well as the ravages of the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Bickford went 16–11 with a 4.25 {{earned run}} average and made the National League All-Star team. He {{finished}} seventh {{in the league in}} complete games (15) and third in games started (36) behind teammate Warren Spahn and Ken Raffensberger of the Cincinnati Reds. He lost a no-hitter in the ninth inning in one of those games. At season's end Bickford, alongside Spahn and teammate Johnny Sain created one of the <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> pitching trios in the league for the next several years.|$|E
5|$|Seven other Democratic {{candidates}} for lieutenant governor entered the race, the <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> being sitting attorney general John B. Breckinridge. While Combs lost to Ford in the gubernatorial primary, Carroll won the separate primary for lieutenant governor, {{partly on the}} strength of the Eastern Kentucky votes he gained from his association with Combs. Carroll went on to defeat Republican Jim Host in the general election for lieutenant governor. As lieutenant governor, Carroll chaired the Legislative Research Commission and the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.|$|E

The {{reviewer}} for The Times called it [...] "one of the funniest, most intelligent and far-reaching pieces of satire".Hilary Corke, writing in The Listener wrote that [...] "It is the cleverest novel, and the <b>most</b> intellectually <b>formidable,</b> that I have read for many years. It {{is also one of}} the funniest." [...] W.H. Auden wrote: [...] "I have read no novel published in the last fifteen years with greater pleasure and admiration." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} take was advocated at the dawning of {{the revolution}} by Dennis Robertson, who Fletcher has described as the <b>most</b> intellectually <b>formidable</b> of Keynes's contemporary critics. This view held that the great excitement triggered by the General Theory was unjustified - that genuinely new ideas presented were overstated and not supported by evidence, while the verifiable ideas were merely well-established principles dressed up in new ways. According to Hyman Minsky, this position eventually became dominant in mainstream academia, though {{it is by no}} means unchallenged.|$|R
5|$|The most {{significant}} threat the Roman Empire faced {{during the reign}} of Domitian arose from the northern provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river. Of these, the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed the <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> threat. In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians, led by King Decebalus, crossed the Danube into the province of Moesia, wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor Oppius Sabinus.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus fled in {{the heat}} of the battle. One half of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and the other half {{followed}} the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> antagonists.|$|E
5|$|Content {{with their}} convincing win at Trent Bridge, Australia made no changes to their team, while England made three, omitting Barnett, Hardstaff and Young {{due to a}} {{combination}} of injury and poor form. Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test. Despite his injury, Lindwall {{played a key role in}} a heavy 409-run Australian victory, taking eight wickets. His bowling also led to the controversial omission of Hutton, who performed poorly at Lord's, for the Third Test. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. This decision pleased the Australians, who regarded Hutton as their <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> opponent with the bat.|$|E

Prokofiev biographer, David Nice, noted in 2011: [...] "A decade ago I’d have bet you there were only a dozen pianists in the world who could play Prokofiev’s Second Piano Concerto properly. Argerich wouldn’t touch it, Kissin delayed learning it, and even Prokofiev as virtuoso had got into a terrible mess trying to perform it with Ansermet and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the 1930s, when it had gone out of his fingers." ...|$|R

He was {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the <b>most</b> ferocious and <b>formidable</b> opponents of the Normans since their arrival in Ireland. He died at Inisdowginn on the river Suck, near Dunlo in Hy-Many, in 1239.|$|R
50|$|Kamarupa was <b>most</b> {{powerful}} and <b>formidable</b> kingdom in Northeast India {{ruled by the}} Varman and Pala dynasties from its capital in Pragjyotishpura and Durjaya in Lower Assam and by indigenous peoples at Haruppeswara in central Assam. From these three capitals, its culture and influence spread over the entire region.|$|R
5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another good example of the design and one of the <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond's Norman {{relatives}} in Sicily {{had been in}} conflict with the Byzantine Empire for over 30 years; his father Robert Guiscard was one of the Empire's <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> enemies. While Bohemond was away, Alexios sent an army to reoccupy Antioch and the cities of Cilicia. In 1107, having organized a new army for his planned crusade against the Muslims in Syria, Bohemond instead launched into open warfare against Alexios, crossing the Adriatic to besiege Dyrrhachium, the westernmost city of the Empire. Like his father however, Bohemond was unable to make any significant advances into the Empire's interior; Alexios avoided a pitched battle and Bohemond's siege failed, partly due to a plague among his army. Bohemond soon found himself in an impossible position, isolated in front of Dyrrhachium: his escape by sea was cut off by the Venetians, and Paschal II withdrew his support.|$|E
5|$|By the 2nd century AD {{the territories}} of Persia were {{controlled}} by the Arsacid dynasty and known as the Parthian Empire. Due {{in large part to}} their employment of powerful heavy cavalry and mobile horse archers, Parthia was the <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> enemy of the Roman Empire in the east. As early as 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus had invaded Parthia, but he was killed and his army was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae. In the years following Carrhae, the Romans were divided in civil war and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Trajan also campaigned against the Parthians from 114–117 AD and briefly captured their capital Ctesiphon, putting the puppet ruler Parthamaspates on the throne. However, rebellions in Babylonia and the Jewish revolts in Judea made it difficult to maintain the captured province and the territories were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Rollo's son and heir, William Longsword, and grandchild, Richard the Fearless, forged the Duchy of Normandy into West Francia's <b>most</b> {{cohesive}} and <b>formidable</b> principality. The {{descendants of}} Rollo {{and his men}} assimilated with their maternal Frankish-Catholic culture and {{became known as the}} Normans, lending their name to the region of Normandy.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{linguists}} {{claim that}} there existed a Kamrupi apabhramsa {{as opposed to the}} Magadhi apabhramsa from which the three cognate languages---Assamese, Bengali and Odia and Maithili---sprouted. The initial motive comes from extra-linguistic considerations. Kamarupa was the <b>most</b> powerful and <b>formidable</b> kingdom in the region which provided the political and cultural influence {{for the development of the}} Kamrupi apabhramsa.|$|R

5|$|Putnam himself {{may be his}} own <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> {{philosophical}} adversary. His frequent {{changes of}} mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia {{proceeded}} to reach 460/7Keith Miller making 74before Bradman declared, setting England {{a target of}} 596 midway through the afternoon. The hosts reached 106/3 at stumps on the fourth day, but then collapsed on the final morning to be all out for 186, handing Australia a 409-run victory. Cyril Washbrook and Tom Dollery top-scored for England with 37 apiece. Ernie Toshack had the pick of the figures with 5/40 while Lindwall took 3/61. Although Toshack had the better figures, commentators credited Lindwall with orchestrating the England collapse; {{at the start of}} the innings he bowled at leading English batsmen Len Hutton at great pace before dismissing him. Hutton had appeared very unsettled by Lindwall and played meekly. He was severely criticised for his timid manner and was controversially dropped for the following match as the selectors thought he was providing a poor example to the junior members of the team. The Australians were very pleased with this decision, which they believed to be wrong, as they regarded Hutton as their <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> opponent. The match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.|$|E
5|$|Mithridates the Great was {{the ruler}} of Pontus, a large kingdom in Asia Minor, from 120 to 63 BC. He is remembered as one of Rome's <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> and {{successful}} enemies who engaged {{three of the most}} prominent generals of the late Roman Republic: Sulla, Lucullus, and Pompey the Great. In a pattern familiar from the Punic Wars, the Romans came into conflict with him after the two states' spheres of influence began to overlap. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom, and Rome for her part seemed equally keen for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring. After conquering western Anatolia (modern Turkey) in 88 BC, Roman sources claim that Mithridates ordered the killing {{of the majority of the}} 80,000 Romans living there. In the subsequent First Mithridatic War, the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla forced Mithridates out of Greece proper after the Battle of Chaeronea and later Battle of Orchomenus but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival Marius; consequently, Mithridates VI was defeated but not destroyed. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.|$|E
50|$|For {{the last}} 30 years {{until his death}} in 996 in Fécamp, Richard {{concentrated}} on Normandy itself, and participated less in Frankish politics and its petty wars. In lieu of building up the Norman Empire by expansion, he stabilized the realm and reunited the Normans, forging the reclaimed Duchy of his father and grandfather into West Francia's <b>most</b> cohesive and <b>formidable</b> principality.|$|R

Writing for IGN, Max Nicholson deemed Zaheer [...] "one of the <b>most</b> intimidating and <b>formidable</b> villains yet on the show", praising his effectiveness as an antagonist and his actions that greatly challenged Korra's status as the Avatar. Nicholson also praised Rollins' voice acting in [...] "Beyond the Wilds", declaring that he and Janet Varney had [...] "really knocked {{it out of the}} park." ...|$|R

5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the Santa Anita Derby, {{was seen}} as the <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> {{challenger}} to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory. Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.|$|E
5|$|The main talking {{point after}} the Test was the {{controversial}} omission of England's leading batsman Hutton for the Third Test. The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the Second Test. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the sidewhich was not in good batting formas it was a poor example from a leading batsman. The omission generated considerable acrimony, and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was their <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> opponent with the bat. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, a game in which no other Englishman passed 35, and made 94, 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. Hutton's position was taken by debutant George Emmett, who made only 10 and a duck in a rain-shortened draw, and was subsequently dropped for the Fourth Test.|$|E

The following case study will discuss the development of narco-submarines and the underlying motivations behind the pursuit of this complex engineering task. The case study will outline the different phases of the narco-submarine development and highlight FARC’s determination to overcome the challenges present in each design.

50|$|Columbus {{therefore}} {{estimated the}} distance from the Canary Islands to Japan to be about 3,000 Italian miles (3,700 km, or 2,300 statute miles). The true figure is now known to be vastly larger: about 20,000 km. No ship in the 15th century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage, and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been <b>formidable.</b> <b>Most</b> European navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from Europe to Asia was unfeasible. The Catholic Monarchs, however, having completed an expensive war in the Iberian Peninsula, were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other European countries in the quest for trade with the Indies. Columbus's project, though far-fetched, held the promise of such an advantage.|$|R
40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} a decline in Africa's agricultural exports and a sharp rise in the region's food imports. With over 70 percent of Africa's people dependent on agriculture for their livelihood, getting agriculture moving in Africa {{is one of the}} <b>most</b> important <b>formidable</b> challenges facing Africa in the 1990 s. There is now wide recognition that government policies have contributed to Africa's crisis and that policy reforms can help foster restored growth. This report examines the link between government policy and agricultural performance across countries and over most of the past two decades. The analysis confirms that governments'agricultural pricing and marketing arrangements and their macroeconomic policies have slowed agricultural growth. In particular, overvalued currencies have often caused the largest distortions. Recent trends, however, offer evidence that policy reforms have helped improve agricultural growth where these reforms have sustained agricultural procedures. The author also offers evidence that government policies have been substantially responsible for Africa's growing food imports, by encouraging urban migration and by lowering the prices for imported foods relative to domestically-grown foods. This study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the causes of Africa's agricultural crisis and can help forge a consensus on how to restore vitality in African agriculture.
