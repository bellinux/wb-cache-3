The model considered <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries,</b> partial backordering and inflation. The discounted cash flow (DSF) and optimization technique are also used to derive the optimal solution. A numerical example is given to validate the results of the whole production-inventory system. This study shows that <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries</b> of the integrated system results in an optimal solution for the manufacturer-retailer supply chain system...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{incidence of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries</b> in Spain, {{in addition to}} changes in age at maternity and parity, is attributed to assisted reproductive treatments, but the relative contribution of the latter to this rise remains uncertain, due to the scarce information provided by clinics practicing those treatments. Population based data (1984 - 2004), including information on mother's age, nationality, marital status, date of delivery, and the characteristics of each (parity, single or multiple), and sex of newborns were provided by the Spanish Institute of Statistics. Twinning and triplet deliveries relate to maternal age, parity, and nationality. For younger ages (≤ 19, 20 - 24, 25 - 29) rates remained constant over time, but for older women (30 - 34, 35 - 39, ≥ 40) rates increased after 1994. From 1984 to 2004 the percentage of twins of opposite sex increased from 24. 31 to 36. 58 per cent. Since 1997, Spanish and non-Spanish mothers differentiate with respect to multiple maternity at ages over 30. In addition to unmarried Spanish women, immigrants constitute a reliable reference group that determines the convenience of segregating information on <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries</b> respecting origin. The proportion of twins and triplets of opposite sex, maternal age, and parity patterns observed are concordant with a differential access to reproductive treatments depending on the woman's age. The present norm regulating {{the maximum number of}} fertilizations per cycle and the demand for these treatments explain the high incidence of <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries</b> in Spain. A modified logistic curve predicts a stabilization of <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries,</b> which will probably continue to be high in Spain...|$|R
40|$|Background: Multiple {{pregnancy}} is a pathological condition of pregnancy {{where there are}} two or more products of conception in the same time. Multiple pregnancy and childbirth {{tend to be more}} risky than normal pregnancies. There are no data that is available about <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries</b> in Dr. Kariadi Hospital for the last five years. Therefore this study demonstrated the characteristics of <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries</b> in the Dr. Kariadi Hospital Semarang during 2007 to 2011. Methods: This descriptive observational study using samples that were all women with twin pregnancies who performed deliveries in the of Dr. Kariadi Hospital Semarang during 2007 to 2011. The data were presented in the form of frequency distributions and tabular or graphic. Results: The data of <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries</b> in the Dr Kariadi Hospital during 2007 to 2011 showed the majority of birth mothers are 20 - 30 years of age, first parity, anemia, no pre-eclampsia, vaginal delivery, {{and in the absence of}} premature rupture of membranes. Gestational age in deliveries averaged over 37 - 42 weeks, with a low-weight babies, the same sex, and presentatons of the fetus were a head presentation. Conclusion: Most of maternal characteristics who performed <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries</b> in the Dr. Kariadi Hospital are between 20 - 30 years of age, parity 1, there was both mild to moderate anemia, there was no pre-eclampsia, performed vaginal delivery, and there was no premature rupture of membranes. The majority of twins who were born in the Dr. Kariadi Hospital has the characteristics born between 37 - 42 weeks gestational age, birth weight less than 2500 grams, of the same sex in each delivery, and presentation of fetal showing head presentation.

40|$|Temporal {{variations}} {{in the frequency of}} multiple maternities in many Western European countries have been described. However, within a single country, regional differences are observed. Urban industrialized regions and rural agricultural areas have experienced in recent decades a distinct decline in <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries,</b> which in cases have been related to maternal age and parity changes. Research on <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries</b> in Spain is scarce and none of the studies go {{back to the beginning of}} the 20 th century or consider regional variation over an extended period of time. The present paper is a yearly study on <b>multiple</b> <b>deliveries</b> in Spain since 1900 including a geographical analysis. Rather than dealing with recent changes in multi-parity, this paper is concerned with Spain's long-term national variation (between 1900 and 2006). The changing pattern of double and triple deliveries was analyzed using data from the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE). Twinning rates in Spain are low in comparison to those of equivalent periods in other countries, and the minimum rates correspond to the 1980 s decade. Results were interpreted by taking into account the influence of age at maternity and reproductive variation up to 1990. A good fit between observed and predicted rates was obtained after the application of models, which besides maternal age and parity, include their interaction. Regarding territorial variability, the values corresponding to southern, northern and insular Spanish provinces are consistent with an earlier reduction of the crude birth rate in the northeast regions and latter in the southern regions and the Canary Islands...|$|R

This paper derives the optimal production and futures hedging strategy for a risk-averse competitive firm facing delivery risk. We show that the option value of the <b>multiple</b> <b>delivery</b> specification induces the firm to produce more with than without the delivery risk if the firm gauges this value higher than the market. We further show that if the delivery risk is additively related to the commodity price risk, the firm optimally under-hedges its risk exposure. On the other hand, if the delivery risk is multiplicatively related to the commodity price risk, the firm may optimally choose an under- or over-hedge which we illustrate using a numerical example. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
