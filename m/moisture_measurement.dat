40|$|We {{explore and}} review {{the value of}} soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements</b> in vadose zone {{hydrology}} {{with a focus on}} the field and catchment scales. This review is motivated by the increasing ability to measure soil moisture with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution across scales. We highlight and review {{the state of the art}} in using soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements</b> for (1) estimation of soil hydraulic properties, (2) quantification of water and energy fluxes, and (3) retrieval of spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture profiles. We argue for the urgent need to have access to field monitoring sites and databases that include detailed information about variability of hydrological fluxes and parameters, including their upscaled values. In addition, improved data assimilation methods are needed that fully exploit the information contained in soil moisture data. The development of novel upscaling methods for predicting effective moisture fluxes and disaggregation schemes toward integrating large-scale soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements</b> in hydrological models will increase the value of soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements.</b> Finally, we recognize a need to develop strategies that combine hydrogeophysical measurement techniques with remote sensing methods. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{moisture}} is a {{key variable}} in the hydrologic cycle which determines plant water availability, evapotranspiration and surface runoff processes amongst others. Recently, cosmic-ray probes were proposed to address the need for continuous surface soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements</b> over field scale (~ 30 ha). In this study, calibration results of a catchment scale cosmic-ray soil moisture network are presented. Sixteen extensive gravimetric soil sampling data sets were obtained at ten cosmic-ray probe locations for calibration and evaluation purpose. Soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements</b> derived from cosmic-ray probes were evaluated by two independent in-situ soil moisture sensor networks. Furthermore, calibration results were used to quantify the impact of biomass on neutron flux compared to other neutron moderating factors. Empirical correction coefficients for above ground biomass are derived for the calibration parameters of the N 0 -method and the COSMIC operator. The empirical vegetation correction is compared to present methods of vegetation correction and to independent field measurements. The correction coefficients are then used to model the impact of annual crop growth cycles {{in order to assess}} uncertainty in soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements</b> from cosmic-ray probes associated with time-variable biomass.

40|$|The Kalman filter {{assimilation}} {{technique is}} applied to a simplified soil moisture model for retrieval of the soil moisture profile from near-surface soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements.</b> First, the simplified soil moisture model is developed, based on an approximation to the Buckingham–Darcy equation.

The data used are for the Nerrigundah field site, New South Wales, Australia. This study has identified (i) the importance of knowing the depth over which the near-surface soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements</b> are representative (i. e., observation depth), (ii) soil porosity and residual soil moisture content {{as the most important}} soil parameters for correct retrieval of the soil moisture profile, (iii) the importance of a soil moisture model that represents the dominant soil physical processes correctly, and (iv) an appropriate forecasting model as far more important than the temporal resolution of near-surface soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements.</b> Although the soil moisture model developed here is a good approximation to the Richards equation, it requires a root water uptake term or calibration to an extreme drying event to model extremely dry periods at the field site correctly. 1...|$|R

40|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} the feasibility of using sub epidermal <b>moisture</b> <b>measurement</b> which rises in the inflammatory process, {{as a predictor of}} early pressure ulcer damage. Once identified, and prevention strategies are implemented or heightened, more severe pressure ulcer damage may be averted. This study aimed to explore the relationship between nurses’ assessment of at risk patients’ skin and the assessment of skin using sub epidermal <b>moisture</b> <b>measurement.</b> A descriptive prospective observational design was employed. Following ethical approval and written informed consent, data were collected daily for 4 weeks, from patients assessed as being at risk of pressure ulcer damage within an acute health care facility in Ireland. Data included nurses (n= 372) documented assessment of the patient’s skin condition and researcher led sub epidermal <b>moisture</b> <b>measurement</b> over the sacrum and both heels. A total of 47 patients were included, 38. 3 % (n= 18) were male and 61. 5 % (n= 29) were female, with a median age of 74. 7 years. Of the population studied, 34 % (n= 16) developed signs of early pressure damage. The mean number of days for nurses to detect this damage was 5. 0 (SD 5. 15; max 11, min 3), whereas the mean number of days that it took sub epidermal <b>moisture</b> <b>measurement</b> to detect damage was 1. 1 (SD 0. 75; max 2, min 1). Correlations were low for the left heel (r=. 23), medium for the right heel (r=. 43) and strong for the sacrum (r=. 65) between nurses’ visual assessment and sub epidermal <b>moisture</b> <b>measurement.</b> All patients with sustained elevated sub epidermal moisture levels went on to develop visual signs of pressure ulceration. However, importantly, sub epidermal <b>moisture</b> <b>measurement</b> identified early damage, on average, 3. 9 days earlier than nurses’ assessment. Given that pressure ulcers develop from within the deeper tissues, knowing that early pressure ulcer damage is present can facilitate heightening of prevention strategies to avoid extension. This is of particular importance in clinical practice as the earlier that pressure ulcers can be detected; the earlier interventions can be implemented to prevent further extension, avoiding their associated morbidity and mortality...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{automated}} techniques for point <b>measurement</b> of soil <b>moisture</b> content {{have been developed}} to an operational level over the past few decades. While each of those techniques have been individually evaluated by the thermogravimetric (oven drying and weighing) method, typically under laboratory conditions, there have been few studies which have made a direct comparison between the various techniques, particularly under field conditions. This paper makes an inter-comparison of the Virrib®, Campbell Scientific CS 615 reflectometer, Soil Moisture Equipment Corporation TRASE® buriable- and connector-type time domain reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture sensors, and a comparison of the connector-type TDR sensor with thermogravimetric measurements for data collected during a 2 -year field study. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the techniques are made, and comparisons made with results from a simple water balance 'bucket' model and a Richards equation based model. It was found that the connector-type TDR sensors produced soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements</b> within the ± 2. 5 % v/v accuracy specification of the manufacturer as compared to thermogravimetric data when using the manufacturer's calibration relationship. However, comparisons with the water balance model showed that Virrib and buriable-type TDR sensors yielded soil moisture changes that exceeded rainfall amounts during infiltration events. It was also found that the CS 615 reflectometer yielded physically impossible soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements</b> (greater than the soil porosity) during periods of saturation. Moreover, the buriable-type TDR <b>measurements</b> of soil <b>moisture</b> content were systematically less than the Virrib measurements by approximately 10 % v/v. In addition to the good agreement with thermogravimetric measurements, the connector-type TDR soil <b>moisture</b> <b>measurements</b> yielded the best agreement with Richards equation based model predictions of soil moisture content, with Virrib sensors yielding a poor agreement in the deeper layers.
