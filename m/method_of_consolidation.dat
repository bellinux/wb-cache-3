40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} whether the requirement for New Zealand organisations to switch from the ownership-based <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> to the control-based <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> increased the value relevance of consolidated financial statements in New Zealand. It takes advantage of the unique situation whereby all listed entities in New Zealand were required to comply with FRS 37 : Consolidating Investments in Subsidiaries (FRS 37) in a year relatively free from changes to other financial standards. Motivation: The study was motivated by research undertaken by Hsu et al. (2012). Their research focused on the movement from the ownership-based method to the control-based <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> of financial statements and whether this better reflected market value. They took advantage of the situation in Taiwan which similarly required all public firms to adopt Taiwan’s SFAS 7 : Consolidated Financial Statements (TSFAS 7) at a set time. Research question: Did the change from the ownership-based <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> under SSAP 8 to the control-based <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> under FRS 37 increase the value relevance of consolidated financial statements in New Zealand? Sample selection and design: A sample of 54 entities listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) was used. The sample, although small, represented all of the final available population. Analysis of common accounting ratios was carried out and accounting variables affected by the switch to FRS 37 were analysed to determine changes in the value relevance of the consolidated financial statements. Findings: The adoption of FRS 37 led to an increase in value relevance of financial statements in New Zealand. However the ability to apply judgement to the application of control highlighted entities holding a larger number of subsidiaries and associates had a more complex structure than anticipated. Therefore holdings indirectly controlled may not have been captured with a lower instance of consolidation being achieved than was anticipated...|$|E

An alternative <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> by the application of vacuum pressure can be used to reduce the risks of staged construction of embankments and the consumption of large amount of filling materials.

The results obtained were then compared with the similar magnitudes of surcharge preloading. Tests were also conducted in larger specimens of soil samples, the obtained results of which were comparable with that of the oedometer samples.

40|$|Although the {{consolidation}} settlements beneath foundations and embankments are rarely one dimensional, Terzaghi's one-dimensional consolidation theory is often applied to these situations to approximate consolidation behavior. This paper investigates {{the consolidation}} {{behavior of a}} soil stratum subjected to various initial excess pore pressure distributions which occur under one-dimensional loading. The results show that analysis in terms of average degree of consolidation provides an incomplete representation of the consolidation behavior. While the average degree of consolidation curves for all uniform and linearly varying initial distributions are identical, the degree of consolidation isochrones for each distribution are unique. Furthermore, {{the application of a}} bottom-skewed initial excess pore pressure distribution results in a redistribution of pore pressures toward the skewed region so that an increase in excess pore pressure occurs at some depth after consolidation has already commenced. As a result, conventional consolidation relationships are considered inappropriate for these cases, and an alternative <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> analysis in terms of normalized pore pressures is proposed...|$|E

A trial using GVS system was done at Pantai Indah Kapuk residence, Jakarta to investigate the system reliability. Monitoring equipments used include settlement plate to measure the consolidation decrease, piezometer to measure pore water tension, inklinometer to identify the soil direction and lateral movement during the vacuum preloading process, and manometer to measure the vacuum pump pressure. Analytical calculations to estimate the consolidation decrease is done using one-dimensional consolidation theory of Terzaghi. Besides, a numerical analysis is performed by element method up to Plaxis software application.

The conventional consolidation test as originally proposed by Teaaghi takes considerable time (more than 15 days in highly compressible soils with low coefficient of consolidation) and effort.

In this paper, an attempt has been made to propose a rapid <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> testing. In the proposed method, the next load increment is applied as soon as the necessary time required to identify the percent consolidation is reached and to evaluate the coefficient of consolidation by one of the popular curve-fitting procedures. The rectangular hyperbola method has been used to identify the percent consolidation reached after any load increment, and to determine the coefficient of consolidation, before making the next load increment.

For fractures which develop normally the authors return to the hyperbolic shape of the curve revealed by the theoretical and experimental evidence. This shape is not a characteristic of the evolution of the callus but is due to the mechanical properties of the system. The curves obtained normally show 2 or 3 segments whose characteristics represent the evolution of the callus. The authors report their experience in 97 cases.
