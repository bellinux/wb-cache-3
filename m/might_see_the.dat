25|$|These {{limitations}} {{were made}} clear during the Vietnam War, when early missiles like the AIM-4 Falcon and AIM-9 Sidewinder had success {{rates on the}} order of 9 and 14%, respectively. Much of this was {{due to the fact that}} pilots had been trained to approach using radar or ground-controlled interception, which placed the enemy aircraft somewhere in front of them, but not necessarily flying in the same direction. In these situations, the seeker <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> target's engine and send the growling signal that indicated lock-on, but would fail to track when fired because the target would move out of the FOV in the time while the missile was flying off the mounting rail.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March the Palace Hotel {{where the}} raid {{planning}} was being undertaken caught fire, {{it might have}} been sabotage, and to avoid calling the civilian fire brigade, who <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> attack plans inside the building, the Germans rigged it with explosives to create a fire break, however they exploded early, killing nine soldiers. Next day, on 8 March, to coincide with a spring tide, 13 ships sailed. One American patrol boat guarding the port of Granville, PC564 was alerted by a radar station that identified the convoy, but when it went to the attack, PC564 was destroyed by 88mm shells from German ferries armed with 8.8 cm SK C/35 naval guns. No alert had been sounded in Granville and the ships carrying German troops landed almost unopposed at the French port.|$|E
25|$|A show of gladiators {{was to be}} {{exhibited}} {{before the}} people in the market-place, and most of the magistrates erected scaffolds round about, with an intention of letting them for advantage. Caius commanded them to take down their scaffolds, that the poor people <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sport without paying anything. But nobody obeying these orders of his, he gathered together a body of labourers, who worked for him, and overthrew all the scaffolds the very night before the contest was to take place. So that by the next morning the market-place was cleared, and the common people had an opportunity of seeing the pastime. In this, the populace thought he had acted the part of a man; but he much disobliged the tribunes his colleagues, who regarded it as a piece of violent and presumptuous interference.|$|E

500|$|While School Rumble is {{generally}} recognised as a shōnen title targeting the young male market, Katherine Luther, staff reviewer for About.com, refers {{to it as}} a shōjo title aimed at girls and young women. Lisa Marie, reviewer for RightStuf's Anime Today podcast, agrees that others, notably males, <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> series as shōjo. Luther calls the first DVD [...] "the perfect back-to-school accessory", while Marie characterizes School Rumble as [...] "insane", asserting it appears on the surface more laid back than other titles like Excel Saga and Haré + Guu.

500|$|With [...] "Love Sex Magic," [...] Ciara {{moved in}} a more pop {{direction}} than her past music. Jordan Sargent of PopMatters noted that while a pop fan <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> singer [...] "back in her mind creatively," [...] a Ciara fan would see the song as [...] "signal {{the end of the}} singer's career as it once was." [...] Sargent stated that the song [...] "sounds nothing like the chrome-plated crunk nor the moonlit balladry that Ciara has staked her name on." [...] Musically, the song is a dance-pop-R number which makes use of electro and funk music, as well as displaying disco and soul influences. The song has a minimalistic dance beat, with a [...] "funky, retro 70s style R guitar" [...] as the backdrop. Lauren Carter of the Boston Herald said that the song is influenced by Timberlake's disco-funk work on FutureSex/LoveSounds, stating that [...] "it sounds like a reworked version of his bass-heavy dance number [...] "Sexy Ladies." [...] Carter commented that Timberlake was [...] "ushering Ciara away from her typically crunk-laced stylings in favor of JT’s electro-slide." [...] Ann Powers of The Los Angeles Times said that the song was [...] "Madonna-esque." [...] Both Ciara and Timberlake provide verses, accompanied by vocal whims and falsetto.|$|E

2500|$|An Egyptian {{version of}} the tale that crosses over with the Moses story is found in Manetho who, [...] {{according}} to the summary in Josephus, wrote that a certain Osarseph, a Heliopolitan priest, became overseer of a band of lepers, when Amenophis, following indications by Amenhotep, son of Hapu, had all the lepers in Egypt quarantined in order to cleanse the land so that he <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> gods. The lepers are bundled into Avaris, the former capital of the Hyksos, where Osarseph prescribes for them everything forbidden in Egypt, while proscribing everything permitted in Egypt. They invite the Hyksos to reinvade Egypt, rule with them for 13 years – Osarseph then assumes the name Moses - and are then driven out.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of David Kastan, [...] "this {{is as close as}} we can get to an {{expression}} of [...] own belief, and might well be taken as conclusive evidence [...] ". A. L. Rowse (2013), for instance, insisted that the statement in Shakespeare's Will shows a conformist position to Protestant religion. Kastan discusses how some <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> phrase [...] "through thonlie merittes of Jesus Christe" [...] as a reference to the doctrine of solus Christus, {{but at the same time}} he argues that the expression [...] "might have become merely conventional by 1616, and have little or any theological import". Thus, he asserts that this can hardly be considered as an ultimate evidence to define Shakespeare's religious affiliation, since the preamble was formulaic in the epoch.|$|E

The other began with thorns but ended in clear ground. The person would tell passersby that the path that appeared clear would be fine {{for two or three}} steps, but end in thorns, and the path that began with thorns would be difficult for two or three steps, but end in clear ground. So, said the Sifre, Moses told Israel that one <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> wicked flourish in this world for a short time, but in the end they will have occasion to regret.

2500|$|Tryon {{claimed that}} he had first heard of the idea from Admiral Hopkins. Having become {{convinced}} of its importance he wrote an article explaining the idea in the 'United Service Magazine' of May 1890 as well as having pamphlets printed which he distributed to those likely to be interested. [...] The idea gave rise to an immense amount of discussion nationally. The Times came out against the idea of government intervention in commerce, arguing the important issue was not who paid for sunk ships, but having a navy capable of preventing them being sunk. It argued that the scheme was a diversion from this main objective and would simply provide {{a false sense of}} security. Many smaller papers took the same line, as did a number of naval officers including Lord Charles Beresford. Their concern was chiefly that a government <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> scheme as an alternative to a larger navy.|$|E

2500|$|The large clock {{projecting}} {{from the tower}} was a well-known landmark in the city as it hung over the roadway of Old London Bridge. It {{was presented to the}} church in 1709 by Sir Charles Duncombe (Alderman for the Ward of Bridge Within and, in 1708/09, Lord Mayor of London). Tradition says [...] "that it was erected in consequence of a vow made by the donor, who, in the earlier part of his life, had once to wait a considerable time in a cart upon London Bridge, without being able to learn the hour, when he made a promise, that if he ever became successful in the world, he would give to that Church a public clock ... that all passengers <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> time of day." [...] The maker was Langley Bradley, a clockmaker in Fenchurch Street, who had worked for Wren on many other projects, including the clock for the new St Paul's Cathedral. The sword rest in the church, designed to hold the Lord Mayor's sword and mace when he attended divine service [...] "in state", dates from 1708.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard was {{interested}} in aesthetics, and is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "poet-philosopher" [...] because of the passionate way in which he approached philosophy. But he is often said to be interested in showing the inadequacy of a life lived entirely in the aesthetic level. Aesthetic life is defined in numerous different ways in Kierkegaard's authorship, including a life defined by intellectual enjoyment, sensuous desire, and an inclination to interpret oneself as if one were [...] "on stage." [...] There are many degrees of this aesthetic existence and a single definition is thus difficult to offer. At bottom, one <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> purely unreflective lifestyle. At the top, we might find those lives which are lived in a reflective, independent, critical and socially apathetic way. But many interpreters of Kierkegaard believe that most people live in the least reflective sort of aesthetic stage, their lives and activities guided by everyday tasks and concerns. Fewer aesthetically guided people are the reflective sort. Whether such people know it or not, their lives will inevitably lead to complete despair. Kierkegaard's author A is an example of an individual living the aesthetic life.|$|E
2500|$|Climate {{engineering}} {{would represent}} a large-scale, intentional effort to modify the climate. It would differ from activities such as burning fossil fuels, as they change the climate inadvertently. Intentional climate change is often viewed differently from a moral standpoint. It raises questions of whether humans {{have the right to}} change the climate deliberately, and under what conditions. For example, there may be an ethical distinction between climate engineering to minimize global warming and doing so to optimize the climate. Furthermore, ethical arguments often confront larger considerations of worldview, including individual and social religious commitments. [...] This may imply that discussions of climate engineering should reflect on how religious commitments might influence the discourse. [...] For many people, religious beliefs are pivotal in defining the role of human beings in the wider world. Some religious communities might claim that humans have no responsibility in managing the climate, instead seeing such world systems as the exclusive domain of a Creator. [...] In contrast, other religious communities <b>might</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> human role as one of [...] "stewardship" [...] or benevolent management of the world. [...] The question of ethics also relates to issues of policy decision-making. [...] For example, the selection of a globally agreed target temperature is a significant problem in any climate engineering governance regime, as different countries or interest groups may seek different global temperatures.|$|E
