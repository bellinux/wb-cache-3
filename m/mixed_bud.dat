40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the {{response}} of two apple cultivars bred for low chilling environments to artificial chilling accumulation. Two trials were carried out; in experiment one, excised shoots were randomly taken from “Caricia” and “Princesa”, and in experiment two, intact and excised shoots of “Caricia”, “Princesa” and “Gala” (control) were collected. After collection, both shoot types were exposed to artificial chilling accumulation (4. 0 ± 0. 5 °C) from 0 to 1200 chill units (CU). <b>Bud</b> break of <b>mixed</b> <b>buds</b> of “Caricia” and “Princesa” was higher than 50 % between 0 CU to 1200 CU, irrespective of shoot type. Bud break of “Gala” <b>mixed</b> <b>buds</b> exceeded 50 % only in intact shoots after accumulating 900 CU. The mean time to bud break of “Caricia” and “Princesa” diminished with increasing chilling accumulation and stabilized after ~ 600 CU, {{depending on the type}} of shoot and the year of experimentation. The low-chill apple cultivars tested in this work showed shallow dormancy, but they required moderate cold accumulation (800 – 1150 CU) to fully satisfy their chilling requirements. Thus, although their shallow dormancy makes them suitable for cultivation in chill-deficient environments, they cannot be considered low-chill cultivars. ...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} Branching in temperate {{plants is}} {{closely linked to}} bud fates, either floral or vegetative. Here, we review how the fate of meristematic tissues contained in buds and their position along a shoot imprint specific branching patterns which differ among species. Through examples chosen in closely related species in different genera of the Rosaceae family, a panorama of patterns is apparent. Patterns depend on whether vegetative and floral buds are borne individually or together in <b>mixed</b> <b>buds,</b> develop as the shoot grows or after a rest period, and are located in axillary or terminal positions along the parent shoot. The resulting branching patterns are conserved among varieties in a given species but progressively change with the parent shoot length during plant ontogeny. They can also be modulated by agronomic and environmental conditions. The existence of various organizations in the topology and fate of meristematic tissues and their appendages in closely related species questions the between-species conservation of physiological and molecular mechanisms leading to bud outgrowth vs. quiescence and to floral induction vs. vegetative development. </p...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} a number of physical factors, particularly moisture conditions. The most important of the trials were on the effect of soil moisture on fruit-trees, in particular on growth of shoots and fruits, fruit set and initiation of <b>mixed</b> <b>buds.</b> The watertable was of significance for the water supply necessary for rooting; standards were given for optimum humidity. The water and air balance of sample plots in an orchard with different soil profiles were estimated and differences were compared with the reactions of fruit trees. Finally water consumption and the optimum water table were considered. Part 2 considers how soil chemistry influenced the trees. Critical values for the relation K/Mg were given as a measure of Mg deficiency. The influences of soil humidity, calcium status, nitrogen dressing and soil cover or soil vegetation on Mg deficiency were also studied. A number of soil factors or groups of soil factors were involved in the occurrence of iron deficiency. Standards were derived for zinc content of leaves, and some factors involved in zinc deficiency were detected. N deficiency was also studied. How the standards derived could be applied to soil management in practice is indicated in the final chapter...|$|R
40|$|Pear {{production}} {{has the greatest}} economic importance next to the apple and plum production in Republic of Srpska (BiH) fruit production. Dominant practice of utilizing wild pear (Pyrus communis L.) seedling as a rootstock typically causes an intensive growth and postpones fruiting. Intensive vegetative growth {{during the early years}} influences the formation of long shoots where growth is terminated at time when <b>mixed</b> <b>buds</b> are formed on the tips and then regularly come to be bare at the base. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of date of heading back shoots during the growing season on the growth and development characteristics of one-year-old shoots in pear trees. The study was carried out in pear orchard, age 2 years. The study included three varieties ‘Williams’, ‘Abbé Fétel’ and ‘Packham’s Triumph’. All varieties were grafted on the seedlings of wild pear (Pyrus communis L). Training system is a slender spindle. Newly formed shoots on the central leader were cut back during 2015, and the resultant year-old shoots were analysed in 2016. The shoots were cut back to 5, 10 and 15 nodes (buds) at three different dates during intensive growth. Control shoots were not cut back. The studied varieties had best reaction regarding initiation of new growth points and intensity of new growths in the later shoot heading dates. Intensity of new growth formation is also variety related...|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of sensory and composition properties in young tea shoots and their estimation by near infrared spectroscopy and partial least squares techniques was investigated. The fresh mean weight of four variety control samples from bud to the first, second, {{third and fourth}} leaves were calculated for each position. All moisture contents of the samples were calculated as fresh weight (FW) %. Chemical compound analysis was undertaken as total nitrogen content was determined according to the Kjeldahl method; amino acids content {{was determined by the}} ninhydrine method and caffeine was determined by a UV spectrophotometric method; the lignin content was determined according to the general method; sample quality indexes (QI) were calculated using the formula, moisture total nitrogen/lignin. All data analysis methods were performed using the Bruker OPUS 6. 5 software package. From the analysis of both approaches we can conclude that both points of view are mutually supportive.

40|$|Hydrangea macrophylla is a {{ligneous}} {{plant that}} has attracted he attention of many plant breeders and agronomists {{for the purpose}} of enhancing its phenotypic plasticity. However, this plasticity was always exploited empirically. Can this plasticity be assessed by a more scientific approach? In this work, the phenotypic variation is analysed via a description of the different development sequences of the plant and by exposing the plant to different contrasted environments. The architectural unit consists of two morphogenetic units: the Vegetative Unit (VU) and the Vegetative and Floral Unit (VFU). They result in four successive development sequences: an organogenetic phase accompanied by continuous growth (sequence A), floral transformation (sequence B), dormancy (sequence C) and flower bloom (sequence D). Under the effect of environmental factors, the formation of the <b>mixed</b> terminal <b>bud</b> (sequence B) provides a considerable source of spatial variability, whereas the absence or presence of dormancy (sequence C) is responsible for a source of temporal variation. The in-depth description of the architectural unit with its morphological components and the characterisation of the four development sequences provide a necessary scientific basis to identify environmental effects on plant development and for the integrated use of its plasticit...|$|R

As {{they continue to be}} developed, {{there is a need to}} rethink the role of community benefits in supporting economic resiliency within the innovation ecosystem. Public innovation centers have the opportunity to bolster this environment by providing needed community space, fostering exchange within the public realm, and helping to sustain a <b>mix</b> of <b>budding</b> startups and established firms. Innovation space such as incubators, accelerators, coworking spaces, and makerspaces are not foreign to the commercial real estate market. However, when these relatively new product types collide with the idea of public space and community benefits, there is potential to create something unique. In the spirit of a community center, innovation centers offer the broader public access to the rapidly growing innovation ecosystem and startup culture, all while helping to generate new ideas, products, and-potentially-jobs. by Alice Brooks Davis.

40|$|Fibronectin-rich mesenchymal condensations form {{at sites}} of {{incipient}} chondrogenesis {{in the developing}} vertebrate limb, and in cultures of limb bud mesenchyme. We have used 6 nrn polystyrene latex beads coated with various substances as probes for adhesive interactions that may mediate the formation of these condensations. Beads coated with heparin, chondroitin sulfate, or poly L-lysine, that were <b>mixed</b> with limb <b>bud</b> mesenchymal cells were centripetally conveyed into fibronectin-rich regions of cell condensation {{over a period of}} several days. Beads coated with dextran sulfate remained uniformly dispersed throughout the cultures during the same period. A monoclonal antibody directed against the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin completely inhibited accumulation of heparin-coated beads at condensing foci, but monoclonal antibodies directed against the collagen- or cell-binding domains of fibronectin were not inhibitory. Accumulation of chondroitin sulfate- or poly L-lysine-coated beads at condensing foci was unaffected by the antibody against the fibronectin amino terminus. Peptides with the sequence arg-gly-asp-ser or gly-arg-gly-asp-ser, which inhibit adhesive interactions mediated by the integrin-binding domain of fibronectin, had no effect on conveyance or accumulation of heparin-coated beads, but the peptide with the sequence gly-arg-gly, a repeated motif in the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain was completely inhibitory. These findings indicate that the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain of fibronectin can, within a tissue microenvironment, interact adhesively with heparin-like components on the surfaces of polystyrene beads, and by implication, on mesenchymal cell...|$|R

Période 2000 - 2012. [URL] {{the apple}} tree (Malus domestica), shoot architecture - {{the distribution of}} lateral bud types and growth along the parent shoot - has been extensively investigated. The distal zone of a shoot {{is characterized by a}} high proportion of vegetative or floral axillary branches <b>mixed</b> with latent <b>buds</b> and aborted laterals. The hypothesis tested here was that bud development was related to hydraulic conductance of the sap pathway to the bud, independently of an acrotonic (proximal vs distal) effect. The distal zone of 1 -yr-old shoots was studied on five cultivars for bud size and composition (number of appendages) and hydraulic conductance before bud burst. Bud size, composition and hydraulic conductance were highly variable for all cultivars. A positive correlation was demonstrated between both the number of cataphylls and green-leaf primordia, and hydraulic conductance. Cultivar and bud size affected the intercept of these relationships more than the slope, suggesting similar scaling between these variables, but different hydraulic efficiencies. A great proportion of small buds were also characterized by null values of hydraulic conductance. This study suggests that hydraulically mediated competition exists between adjacent buds within the same branching zone, prefiguring the variability of lateral types in the following growing season. It is hypothesized that this developmental patterning is driven by hydraulic characteristics of the whole metamer, including the subtending leaf, during bud developmen...|$|R
