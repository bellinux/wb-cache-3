5|$|The same {{isolation}} {{that produced}} Kohala's unique ecosystem also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> vulnerable to invasive species. Alien plants and feral animals {{are among the}} greatest threats to the local ecology. Plants like the kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) and the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleinum) displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents never made it onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation.|$|E
5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> efficient.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{empirical}} phenomena {{are considered}} continuously variable, meaning that social developments have no parameters or constants, only variables, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult, if not impossible, to extract historical laws or make predictions.

25|$|The {{nature of}} Chinese {{characters}} <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> easy to produce allographs for many characters, {{and there have}} been many efforts at orthographical standardization throughout history. In recent times, the widespread usage of the characters in several nations has prevented any particular system becoming universally adopted and the standard form of many Chinese characters thus varies in different regions.|$|E

25|$|This ill {{conditioning}} <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> hard {{to develop}} a robust numerical algorithm for the Jordan normal form, as the result depends critically on whether two eigenvalues are deemed to be equal. For this reason, the Jordan normal form is usually avoided in numerical analysis; the stable Schur decomposition or pseudospectra are better alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Pentacene is a {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} consisting of five linearly-fused benzene rings. This highly conjugated compound is an organic semiconductor. The compound generates excitons upon absorption of ultra-violet (UV) or visible light; this <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> sensitive to oxidation. For this reason, this compound, which is a purple powder, slowly degrades upon exposure to air and light.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{report that}} the {{composition}} of water vapor from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, {{as determined by the}} Rosetta spacecraft, is substantially different from that found on Earth. That is, the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water from the comet was determined to be three times that found for terrestrial water. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> unlikely that water found on Earth came from comets such as comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko according to the scientists.|$|E

25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) is a cyber-attack {{where the}} perpetrator uses {{more than one}} unique IP address, often thousands of them. The incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively {{makes it impossible to}} stop the attack simply by using ingress filtering. It also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. As an alternative or augmentation of a DDoS, many attacks involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP address spoofing) also so that the location of the attacking machines cannot easily be identified and defeated.|$|E

25|$|The British Rail Class 73 is a British electro-diesel locomotive. The type {{is unusual}} in that it can operate from the Southern Region's 650/750 V DC third-rail or an {{on-board}} diesel engine {{to allow it to}} operate on non-electrified routes. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> versatile, although the diesel engine produces less power than is available from the third-rail supply so the locomotives rarely stray from the former Southern Region of British Rail. Following the withdrawal and scrapping of the more powerful Class 74 electro-diesels in 1977, the Class 73 is now unique on the British railway network. Ten locomotives have been scrapped.|$|E
25|$|This {{explanation}} of Ubay also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> {{clear that the}} Companions did not differ at all about what {{was part of the}} Quran and what {{was not part of the}} Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is also important to note that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use, in other words, his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since it was not meant for general use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. The same is true of the other copies of the Quran, which some of the Companions had for their own personal use.|$|E
25|$|Results of the zircon {{ages and}} {{possible}} protolith lithologies and their corresponding first-order {{similarities between the}} rock units from Myrow et al. have generally discredited this model. To begin with, the Greater Himalaya yields younger detrital zircon ages than that of Lesser and Tethyan Himalaya, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> unlikely for Greater Himalaya to be a topographic high that separates two depositional basins. All the evidence that supports the passive margin model is also problematic for this model, since the strong paleontological, lithological, and sedimentological relationships between Lesser and Tethyan Himalaya basically rejects the connotation that they were once separated. Missing suture zone rocks in the Main Central Thrust also {{makes it difficult to}} explain this model.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the Bloodhound bay {{is among}} the most {{impressive}} of hound voices. When hunting in a pack they are expected to be in full cry. They are more likely to 'give tongue,' 'throw their tongue,' or 'speak' when hunting in a pack than when hunting singly, and more when hunting free than when on the leash. The quality of 'speaking to the line', that is giving tongue when on the correct scent while remaining silent when off it, is valued in British Bloodhound circles, on aesthetic grounds and because it <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> easy to 'read' the hound's tracking behaviour. As a result, special trophies for speaking to the correct line are on offer at British working trials (where hounds hunt singly), although rarely awarded.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{of all these}} facts <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> probable that this treatise was finally redacted about {{the middle of the}} 8th century, an assumption which is supported by the statement of R. Asher (c. 1300, in the Hilkot Sefer Torah) that Soferim was composed at a late date. At that period written prayer-books were doubtless in existence and were probably produced by the scribes, who combined the offices of communal ḥazzan and reader. It was but natural, therefore, that in treatises intended for the scribes all the regulations should be collected which concerned books, the Masorah, and the liturgy. It is practically certain that few copies of the Talmud were made at that time, and those without special rules; consequently no allusions to them are found in Soferim.|$|E
25|$|Apex seal lifting. Centrifugal force {{pushes the}} apex seal onto the housing surface forming a firm seal. Gaps can develop between the apex seal and troichoid housing in light-load {{operation}} when imbalances in centrifugal force and gas pressure occur. At low engine-rpm ranges, or under low-load conditions, gas {{pressure in the}} combustion chamber can cause the seal to lift off the surface, resulting in combustion gas leaking into the next chamber. Mazda developed a solution, changing {{the shape of the}} troichoid housing, which meant that the seals remain flush to the housing. Using the Wankel engine at sustained higher revolutions helps eliminate apex seal lift off, and <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> viable in applications such as electricity generation. In motor vehicles, the engine will be suited to series-hybrid applications.|$|E
