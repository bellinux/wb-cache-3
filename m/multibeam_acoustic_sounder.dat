40|$|In this study, we {{realized}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>sound</b> field dictation which is effective {{for the security}} systems because it can quickly find an ab-normal sound {{on the basis of}} text information from a captured long signal. Environmental sound identification has been previously researched only with the method that individually models all sound sources. However, it is impossible to model the innumerable real world environmental sounds. Therefore in our research, we try {{to reduce the number of}} models by utilizing onomatopoeias because they can represent an <b>acoustic</b> <b>sound</b> as a word. We thus firstly aimed at the environmental sound identification with the hidden Markov model (HMM) on the basis of onomatopoeias for realizing <b>acoustic</b> <b>sound</b> dictation. We carried out the subjective evaluation experiment with identification results of real world <b>acoustic</b> <b>sounds.</b> The results confirmed that the proposed method can better use identification result to remind people of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sound</b> than the conventional method...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{observations of}} individual convective elements with a high-power narrow-beam scanning radar, an FM-CW radar, and an <b>acoustic</b> <b>sounder,</b> including {{the determination of}} the vertical air velocity patterns of convective structures with the FM-CW radar and <b>acoustic</b> <b>sounder.</b> Data are presented which link the observed velocity structure and geometrical patterns to previously proposed models of boundary layer convection. It is shown that the high-power radar provides a clear three-dimensional picture of convective cells and fields over a large area with a resolution of 150 m, where the convective cells are roughly spherical. Analysis of time-height records of the FM-CW radar and <b>acoustic</b> <b>sounder</b> confirms the downdraft-entrainment mechanism of the convective cell. The Doppler return of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sounder</b> and the insect-trail slopes on FM-CW radar records are independent but redundant methods for obtaining the vertical velocity patterns of convective structures...|$|R

Video conferencing, hand free communications are different applications requiring <b>acoustic</b> <b>sound</b> source localization. This applications need a robust algorithm which can reliably localize and position the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sound</b> sources. The Steered Response Power Phase Transform (SRP-PHAT) is an important and roubst algorithm to localilze <b>acoustic</b> <b>sound</b> sources. However, the algorithm has a high computational complexity thus making the algorithm unsuitable for real time applications. This thesis focuses on describe the implementation of the SRP-PHAT algorithm as a function of source type, reverberation levels and ambient noise. The main objective of this thesis is to present different approaches of the SRP-PHAT to verify the algorithm in terms of acoustic enviroment, microphone array configuration, acoustic source position and levels of reverberation and noise...|$|R

Only minutes are required for converting the system from one mode to the other, so taking atmospheric soundings does not prevent {{the use of the}} same system for oceanic soundings. Changes in temperature gradient occurring within 3 m altitude intervals are detected, thus detail previously unavailable in low-level soundings is obtained routinely. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>sounder</b> and LLAT are complementary instruments for investigating marine layer dynamics.
