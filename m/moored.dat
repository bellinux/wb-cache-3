5|$|For over a century, {{reports from}} the world's oceans have been {{received}} real-time for safety reasons and to help with general weather forecasting. The reports are coded using the synoptic code, and relayed via radio or satellite to weather organizations worldwide. Buoy reports are automated, and maintained by the country that <b>moored</b> the buoy in that location. Larger <b>moored</b> buoys are used near shore, while smaller drifting buoys are used farther out at sea.|$|E

40|$|Analyzed are {{the merits}} and demerits of {{catenary}} <b>mooring</b> system and taut <b>mooring</b> system, which {{are commonly used}} nowadays. As falling somewhere between these two systems, a new <b>mooring</b> system integrating catenary with taut <b>mooring</b> is proposed. In order to expound and prove the advantages of this new system, the motion performance of a semi-submersible platform is simulated by employing full time domain coupled analysis method. A comparison of the result of new <b>mooring</b> system with that of taut <b>mooring</b> system shows that {{the movement of the}} platform using the new type <b>mooring</b> system is smaller than that using the taut <b>mooring</b> system, which ensures a better working condition. Furthermore, the new <b>mooring</b> system is also compatible with the characteristics of catenary <b>mooring</b> system, which eliminates the requirement of anti-uplift capacity of the anchors...|$|R

50|$|Before the 1911 Ceylon Census <b>Moors</b> in Sri Lanka {{were counted}} as one.

In 1971 Indian <b>Moors</b> {{numbered}} 29,416 declining from 55,400 in 1963. Their decline was partly due to returning to India and some declaring themselves and being enumerated as Sri Lankan <b>Moors.</b> Indian <b>Moors</b> were mostly found in the Colombo and Kandy Districts.|$|R
5|$|During World War II, Rijeka was {{targeted}} by around 30 Allied bombing raids, and in 1945 the retreating Germans damaged approximately 90% {{of the port}} facilities. Among the ships sunk in the port was the German auxiliary cruiser Kiebitz, which would later be raised and repaired to become the Yugoslav Navy Yacht Galeb. The city of Rijeka purchased the ship, which was subsequently <b>moored</b> in the port and eventually opened as a museum in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the {{sluggish}} response of Brazil, infuriated by the {{mockery of the}} Buenos Aires press and impatient at Argentina's refusal to permit him to invade a further Brazilian province through sovereign Argentine territory, on 13 April 1865 López fired upon and seized two small Argentine naval vessels <b>moored</b> in the port of Corrientes, then proceeded to take the Argentine province of that name, making Paraguayan paper currency compulsory on pain of death. The resulting War of the Triple Alliance was to destroy his country.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} design an {{effective}} and economical multi-point <b>mooring</b> system for the new concept FPSO IQFP (fillet inverted quadrangular frustum pyramid shaped FPSO, presented by the lead author), {{the effects of the}} <b>mooring</b> parameters on the performance of catenary <b>mooring</b> system and taut <b>mooring</b> system were investigated according to the initial design plans given in advance according to the steady environment forces and practical experiences. Then, the optimal <b>mooring</b> systems were developed {{on the basis of the}} static analysis results combined with the coupled calculations in time domain. Finally, the merits and demerits of the two <b>mooring</b> schemes were compared based on the <b>mooring</b> and static characteristic parameters as well as the curves of restoring force against horizontal displacement of the catenary and taut <b>mooring</b> systems respectively. The results verify that the taut <b>mooring</b> system is preferable to the catenary <b>mooring</b> system for IQFP deployed in shallow waters...|$|R

50|$|The Black <b>Moor,</b> {{along with}} the Red <b>Moor,</b> {{is one of the}} larger <b>moors</b> in the High Rhön, whose name, {{according}} to tradition, comes from the colour of the original vegetation. The vicar cooperator of Simmershausen, Franz Anton Jäger, a keen naturalist, wrote in his letters about the High Rhoene of Franconia, published in 1803, that the Black <b>Moor</b> was much wetter than the Red <b>Moor.</b> As a result, the red Magellan's Peatmoss (Sphagnum magellanicum), the plant that gave the Red <b>Moor</b> its name and which also grew in the Black <b>Moor,</b> became waterlogged as soon as it germinated, became mouldy and black, thus giving rise to the name of the Black <b>Moor.</b> Even today the name appears apt.|$|R
