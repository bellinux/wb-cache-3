25|$|As a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>combating</b> the massed {{firepower}} of bomber streams, JG 11 personnel trialed {{the viability}} of bombing the formations from above with 250kg bombs, a practice pioneered by Luftwaffe Oberleutnant Heinz Knoke in March 1943. On 28 July 1943 Unteroffizier Fest of 5./JG 11 claimed three B-17's with a single bomb. However the loss in performance of the bomb-laden Bf 109's, along with their vulnerability to escorting fighters, soon curtailed the practice. 5./JG 11 were {{at the forefront of}} tactical developments for effectively intercepting the day bomber formations. The most effective tactic were mass frontal assaults, while other methods trialed were the use of Werfer-Granate (Wfr. Gr. or WGr) 21 under-wing rockets. These were inaccurate but were used primarily to break up the bomber formations.|$|E
2500|$|While lecturing there Wintringham helped Levy {{write his}} book [...] {{described}} {{by some as}} a [...] "war pamphlet" [...] Guerrilla Warfare as a practical manual. It originated in the lectures given at Osterley Park, and had much to say about close quarters combat. This was published in mass market paperback in Britain and the U.S. and ran to several editions. [...] Levy advocated guerrilla warfare as a democratic <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>combating</b> fascism, frequently attacking the military establishment who overlooked the lessons born of such commanders as T. E. Lawrence and their experience in irregular war. [...] He also recounts some of his adventures as a guerrilla, such as the time he and his companions trapped cats' tails in mouse traps as a means of distracting sentries. [...] Wintringham said that Levy was the most effective communicator in Great Britain on the tactics of commando and guerrilla warfare. [...] His primary lecture subject was knife fighting and hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
2500|$|The Islamic Institute in Mannheim, Germany, {{which works}} towards the {{integration}} of Europe and Muslims, sees Sufism as particularly suited for interreligious dialogue and intercultural harmonisation in democratic and pluralist societies; it has described Sufism {{as a symbol of}} tolerance and humanism—nondogmatic, flexible and non-violent. According to Philip Jenkins, a Professor at Baylor University, [...] "the Sufis are much more than tactical allies for the West: they are, potentially, the greatest hope for pluralism and democracy within Muslim nations." [...] Likewise, several governments and organisations have advocated the promotion of Sufism as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>combating</b> intolerant and violent strains of Islam. For example, the Chinese and Russian governments openly favor Sufism as the best means of protecting against Islamist subversion. The British government, especially following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, has favoured Sufi groups in its battle against Muslim extremist currents. The influential RAND Corporation, an American think-tank, issued a major report titled [...] "Building Moderate Muslim Networks," [...] which urged the US government to form links with and bolster Muslim groups that opposed Islamist extremism. The report stressed the Sufi role as moderate traditionalists open to change, and thus as allies against violence. News organisations such as the BBC, Economist and Boston Globe have also seen Sufism as a means to deal with violent Muslim extremists.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the limited}} number of {{orthogonal}} channels and the dense deployment of IEEE 802. 11 access points (APs), interference between neighboring basic service sets (BSSs) are very common in indoor environment. One consequence of such neighboring interference is the inter-BSSs hidden terminal problem in which some mobile stations may suffer from throughput starvation. In this paper, we advocate and develop a methodology to allocate bandwidth as a <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>combating</b> such starvation problem. We first propose an analytical model to study the interaction between contending links in the network, then based on this model, we demonstrate how the contention window (CW) can be adjusted in order to allocate the upload and download bandwidth to sustain some predefined bandwidth requirement with only the basic access scheme is used. Our approach does not require any hardware modification, and is compatible with most WLAN chipsets. The optimal window setting can be obtained by simply solving a nonlinear system once without any iterative algorithm. Simulation are invoked to support the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in achieving the target bandwidth even under saturation condition...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the demands of high-acceleration/deceleration and high-precision motion profiles, many motion control systems began to use {{direct-drive}} linear motor as the prime motion actuator. This arrangement has the advantage of providing high-performance motions with reduced mechanical components, but its major drawback is the effect of load variation on the overall system control. Unlike conventional ball-screw drive, a linear direct-drive system eliminates the mechanical couplings, rotary-to-linear translators and reduction gears. Under this arrangement, any change or disturbance in the load will be directly reflected back to the motor and the control system. This will cause large deterioration in the motion profile. In this paper, the authors proposed to use an H∞ robust-controller to overcome the load uncertainty problem. In the investigation, a permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) with large parametric uncertainty is chosen as the target study. First, the state space equations of the motor are established. Then the H∞ control theory is applied to design a robust controller which allows mass variation of the moving part ranging from 0 to 100 percent of nominal load. To minimize the error between the actual response and the reference, the controller parameters are optimized using genetic algorithms (GA). The simulation and experimental results both show that the system can achieve robust performance under large load variations. Thus, the proposed method is an effective <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> <b>combating</b> load variations and load disturbances in high-performance direct-drive systems.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1864, Blackwell sold a large {{property}} whose proceeds allowed him to pay off all his debt, including the mortgage on a house he and brother George had purchased for their mother, as well as purchase property on Martha's Vineyard and invest a large sum in government bonds. Additional land [...] trades {{over the next few}} years and the rental income they produced gave Blackwell, as his daughter termed it, a [...] "competence" [...] that enabled him [...] "to devote himself fully to the progressive causes which he always had at heart." [...] Around 1872, Stone told Francis J. Garrison in confidence that she and Blackwell could live on their income and thus [...] "cheerfully give" [...] their time and effort to the Woman's Journal. Blackwell continued to dabble in business that interested him. In 1871 he was part of a presidential committee sent to Santo Domingo to explore commercial ramifications of a possible annexation, and even after annexation failed he continued to promote a model commercial base in the country. Blackwell continued to be keenly interested in developing a successful alternative to cane sugar as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>combating</b> slavery in the West Indies. After obtaining a patent for a new refining method, he established the Maine Sugar Beet Company in 1878. Although early in its operation he telegraphed Stone: [...] "Beet sugar manufacture a success. Slavery in Cuba is doomed," [...] he and his partners found it impossible to obtain the quantity of sugar beets to keep the enterprise going, and shut the operation down in 1882.|$|E
