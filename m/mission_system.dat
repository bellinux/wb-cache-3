5|$|Announcing {{plans for}} the future of the British {{military}} on 21 July 2004, the Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed plans to reduce the upgrade programme to cover only 16 MRA4 aircraft, and suggested that an eventual fleet of 12 might suffice. PA02, the second development MRA4, achieved its first flight in December 2004 and was used to test elements of the <b>mission</b> <b>system</b> and the air vehicle. BAE Systems received a contract worth £1.1 billion for 12 MRA4s on 18 July 2006; three were to be development aircraft and nine more converted to production standard. The Nimrod MRA4 successfully released the Sting Ray torpedo for the first time on 30 July 2007.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{independence}} from Spain in 1821, the area {{became part of}} Mexico. Under Mexican rule, the <b>mission</b> <b>system</b> gradually ended, and its lands became privatized. In 1835, Englishman William Richardson erected the first independent homestead, near a boat anchorage around what is today Portsmouth Square. Together with Alcalde Francisco de Haro, he laid out a street plan for the expanded settlement, and the town, named Yerba Buena, began to attract American settlers. Commodore John D. Sloat claimed California for the United States on July 7, 1846, during the Mexican–American War, and Captain John B. Montgomery arrived to claim Yerba Buena two days later. Yerba Buena was renamed San Francisco on January 30 of the next year, and Mexico officially ceded the territory to the United States {{at the end of}} the war. Despite its attractive location as a port and naval base, San Francisco was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography.|$|E

25|$|Mexico, after independence, was {{unstable}} {{with about}} 40 changes of government, in the 27 {{years prior to}} 1848—an average government duration was 7.9 months. In Alta California, Mexico inherited a large, sparsely settled, poor, backwater province paying little or no net tax revenue to the Mexican state. In addition, Alta California had a declining <b>Mission</b> <b>system</b> as the Mission Indian population in Alta California continued to rapidly decrease.|$|E
25|$|In 1821, Mexico {{achieved}} {{independence from}} Spain, taking Alta California along with it, but the missions maintained authority over native neophytes {{and control of}} land holdings until the 1830s. At the peak of its development in 1832, the coastal <b>mission</b> <b>system</b> controlled an area equal to approximately one-sixth of Alta California. The Alta California government secularized the missions {{after the passage of}} the Mexican secularization act of 1833. This divided the mission lands into land grants, which became many of the Ranchos of California.|$|E

25|$|The 1824 {{constitution}} dismantled the <b>mission</b> <b>system,</b> requiring missions {{more than}} tenyears {{old to be}} converted into parishes, while newer missions would be given until 1842 to become secularized. Most of the missions had been secularized before the 1820s, and only Missions Refugio, Espiritu Santo and Rosario were not currently secularized. By 1830, these missions had been converted into parishes, {{and most of the}} mission Natives moved to other settlements in Texas. As the missions were secularized, the mission lands were distributed amongst the Natives, who would later be taxed on the profits.|$|E
25|$|Mission San Gabriel Arcángel unknowingly {{witnessed}} {{the origin of}} the California citrus industry with the planting of the region's first significant orchard in 1804, though the commercial potential of citrus was not realized until 1841. Olives (first cultivated at Mission San Diego de Alcalá) were grown, cured, and pressed under large stone wheels to extract their oil, both for use at the mission and to trade for other goods. The Rev. Serra set aside a portion of the Mission Carmel gardens in 1774 for tobacco plants, a practice that soon spread throughout the <b>mission</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|During this period, the {{frontier}} borderlands {{to the north}} became quite isolated from the government in Mexico City, and its monopolistic economic policies caused suffering. With limited trade, the people had difficulty meeting tax payments and resented the central government's actions in collecting customs. Resentment built up from California to Texas. Both the <b>mission</b> <b>system</b> and the presidios had collapsed after the Spanish withdrew from the colony, causing great disruption especially in Alta California and New Mexico. The people in the borderlands had to raise local militias {{to protect themselves from}} hostile Native Americans.

25|$|Many Californios in the Los Angeles area {{wanted the}} mission's rich grazing lands {{to be made}} {{available}} to private citizens, while those in the north, including Mexican governor General Manuel Victoria, preferred to keep the <b>mission</b> <b>system</b> intact. Late in 1831, the Californios rose in armed rebellion against the governor, who led a party of soldiers to the Valley to put down the rebellion. The southern ranchers rode into the Valley via the Cahuenga Pass and the two armies faced off in a skirmish (Battle of Cahuenga Pass) that left one man dead on either side. Although the rebels retreated to the pueblo, they were victorious in defeat; the wounded governor resigned and returned to Mexico. Popular pressure increased on the government to disestablish the missions, and laws were passed to secularize the missions on August 17, 1833.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 17th century, English {{settlers}} in Virginia and the Carolinas gradually pushed {{the boundaries of}} Spanish territory south, while the French settlements along the Mississippi River encroached on the western borders of the Spanish claim. In 1702, English colonel James Moore and allied Yamasee and Creek Indians attacked and razed the town of St. Augustine, {{but they could not}} gain control of the fort. In 1704, Moore and his soldiers began burning Spanish missions in north Florida and executing Indians friendly with the Spanish. The collapse of the Spanish <b>mission</b> <b>system</b> and the defeat of the Spanish-allied Apalachee Indians (the Apalachee massacre) opened Florida up to slave raids, which reached to the Florida Keys and decimated the native population. The Yamasee War of 1715–1717 in the Carolinas resulted in numerous Indian refugees, such as the Yamasee, moving south to Florida. In 1719, the French captured the Spanish settlement at Pensacola.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{attraction}} of Sonora for the Spaniards was its fertile farmlands {{along the river}} valleys and its position {{as part of a}} corridor linking the central Mexican highlands around Mexico City up the Pacific coast and on into Arizona and points north. This corridor still exists in the form of Federal Highway 15. After the establishment of the <b>mission</b> <b>system,</b> Spanish colonists followed. Indigenous response was a mixture of accommodation and violence, as different strategies were employed by different groups at different times. The sporadic violence, which would continue throughout the colonial period, resulted in the Spanish building presidios and other fortifications to protect missions and Spanish settlements. While the colonization process was not especially violent, the impact on the indigenous of the area was severe, as it almost completely disrupted their formerly very independent lives, forcing them to conform to an alien centralized system. One consequence of this was alcoholism among the native peoples.|$|E

25|$|Cattle {{ranching}} rapidly expanded, {{becoming the}} predominant land use; horsemanship and cattle ownership became {{the symbols of}} status, and the society developed quasi-feudal characteristics, in which the largest ranches were almost entirely self-sufficient. The Chumash who previously had served the padres in the <b>Mission</b> <b>system</b> became laborers on the ranches, occupying the lowest rung of the social ladder, with the oldest established families – the Ortegas, De la Guerras, and others – at the top. During this period the town of Santa Barbara grew into a modest, and informally organized collection of structures around the central Presidio. A few of these buildings – such as the Covarrubias adobe, {{on the grounds of}} the Santa Barbara Historical Society on Santa Barbara Street, which was briefly the location of the capitol of California during the Mexican War – survive to the present day. By the mid-1840s the Mexican period, the population of Santa Barbara had reached approximately 2,500.|$|E
25|$|The {{area was}} first {{occupied}} by the Esselen indigenous people, who harvested acorns on the nearby mountain slopes. The area's terrain is mostly steep, rocky, semi-arid except for the narrow canyons, and inaccessible, making long-term habitation a challenge. A large boulder with {{a dozen or more}} deep mortar bowls worn into it, known as a bedrock mortar, is located in Apple Tree Camp on the southwest slope of Devil's Peak, north of the Camp Pico Blanco. The holes were hollowed out over many generations by Indians who used it to grind the acorns into flour. Other mortar rocks have also been found within the Boy Scout camp at campsites 3 and 7, and slightly upstream from campsite 12, while a fourth is found on a large rock in the river, originally above the river, between campsites 3 and 4. Much of the native Indian population had been forced into the Spanish <b>mission</b> <b>system</b> by about 1822, when most of the interior villages within the current Los Padres National Forest were uninhabited.|$|E
25|$|The Mission Spelling (established {{at first}} by Loyalty Islands missionaries in the 1870s, then {{modified}} by Polynesian missionaries in the 1880s): a, b, d, e, g, i, j, k, l, m, n, ng, o, ö, p, r, s, t, u, z, sometimes also th, dh, dth, tr, dr, oe, ë, w, y, j, and sometimes double vowels to show length. This spelling system was strongly {{inspired by the}} one used for the Drehu (Lifu) language {{in the very early}} period, though later with the change of non-European Mission personnel from Lifu to Polynesian, as well as the growing number of indigenous Torres Strait missionaries, the spelling system lost the overtly Drehu forms tr, dr and ë, which had no phonological basis in Kalaw Lagaw Ya. The <b>mission</b> <b>system</b> is the orthography used in the Reports of the Cambridge Expedition to the Torres Strait (Haddon et al., 1898 and on, University of Cambridge) and in Myths and Legends of Torres Strait (Lawrie, University of Queensland, 1971). Ray, the linguist of the Cambridge Expedition, also used various diacritics to represent vowel length (short vowels) and quality.|$|E
