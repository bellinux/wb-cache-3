The stated {{goals of the}} campaign included eliminating open defecation and <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging.</b> The plan was to achieve these aims in five years. As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them. The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants. The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them.|$|E
25|$|The {{emptying}} {{can be done}} manually with {{shovels and}} buckets (<b>manual</b> <b>scavenging),</b> with manually powered pumps or with motorized pumps mounted on a vacuum truck which carries a tank for storage. For the fecal sludge to be pumpable, water usually needs {{to be added to}} the pit and the content stirred up, which is messy and smelly.|$|E
500|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2007 {{assembly}} elections and the 2009 general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. In July 2006, Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh [...] "for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation" [...] such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act. He asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws {{in the wake of the}} 2006 Mumbai train bombings. In 2007 Modi authored Karmayog, a 101-page booklet discussing <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging.</b> In it, Modi argued that scavenging was a [...] "spiritual experience" [...] for Dalits. However, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct. After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, Modi held a meeting to discuss the security of Gujarat's -long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats. In July 2007 Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post, and the BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.|$|E

2500|$|On 2 October 2014, Modi {{launched}} the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan ("Clean India") campaign. The states {{goals of the}} campaign included eliminating open defecation, eliminating <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging,</b> and improving waste management practices. [...] The campaign was announced {{on the anniversary of}} Mahatma Gandhi's birthday, and was planned to achieve these aims in five years, or in time for the 150th anniversary of his birth. As part of the programme, the Indian government began the construction of millions toilets in rural areas, as well as efforts to encourage people to use them. The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants. The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019.

2500|$|He {{has been}} {{supporting}} common causes; {{when asked about}} views on the entertainment tax in the 2012 budget, Khan said, [...] "I don't want any reduction in that, all I expect is focus on education and nutrition." [...] He quit the GOI's copyrights panels in February 2010 after facing sharp differences with other members. During the promotion of 3 Idiots, he journeyed to diverse parts of India, mostly to small towns, noting that [...] "film makers from Mumbai don't understand small-town India." [...] This experience of reaching out to [...] "regional India" [...] was extended in his debut TV show, Satyamev Jayate. On 16 July 2012, Khan met {{the prime minister and}} the minister for social justice and empowerment and discussed the plight of manual scavengers and sought eradication of <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> in the country.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{system is}} the bucket toilet, {{consisting}} of a seat and a portable receptacle (bucket or pail). These may be emptied by their owners into composting piles in the garden (a low-tech composting toilet), or collected by contractors for larger-scale disposal. Historically, this {{was known as the}} pail closet; the municipality employed workers, often known as [...] "nightmen" [...] (from night soil), to empty and replace the buckets. This system was associated in particular with the English town of Rochdale, {{to the extent that it}} was described as the [...] "Rochdale System" [...] of sanitation. 20th century books report that similar systems were in operation in parts of France and elsewhere in continental Europe. The system of municipal collection was widespread in Australia; [...] "dunny cans" [...] persisted well into the second half of the twentieth century, see below. In Scandinavia and some other countries, outhouses are built over removable containers that enable easy removal of the waste and enable much more rapid composting in separate piles. A similar system operates in India, where hundreds of thousands of workers engage in <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging,</b> i.e. emptying pit latrines and bucket toilets without any personal protective equipment.|$|E
2500|$|National Urban Sanitation Policy. In November 2008 the {{government}} of India launched a national urban sanitation policy {{with the goal of}} creating what it calls [...] "totally sanitized cities" [...] that are open-defecation free, safely collect and treat all their wastewater, eliminate <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> and collect and dispose solid waste safely. As of 2010, 12 states {{were in the process of}} elaborating or had completed state sanitation strategies on the basis of the policy. 120 cities are in the process of preparing city sanitation plans. Furthermore, 436 cities rated themselves in terms of their achievements and processes concerning sanitation in an effort supported by the Ministry of Urban Development with the assistance of several donors. About 40% of the cities were in the [...] "red category" [...] (in need of immediate remedial action), more than 50% were in the [...] "black category" [...] (needing considerable improvement) and only a handful of cities were in the [...] "blue category" [...] (recovering). Not a single city was included in the [...] "green category" [...] (healthy and clean city). [...] The rating serves as a baseline to measure improvements in the future and to prioritize actions. The government intends to award a prize called Nirmal Shahar Puraskar to the best sanitation performers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, Bezwada {{began his}} fight to end <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging.</b> The first hurdle in his fight was at home; {{his parents and}} {{relatives}} said he should not focus his life on something that always existed. It was over years that they came to accept that he was dedicating his life to helping eradicate <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging.</b> Too many people within the community were ashamed to even admit <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> existed or that they did it. Bezwada began breaking the silence.|$|E
5000|$|Bezwada {{then worked}} {{for two years}} to {{organize}} manual scavengers in Karnataka. A platform, the Campaign Against <b>Manual</b> <b>Scavenging</b> (CAMS), was formed. This oversaw the conversion of dry latrines into flush toilets and rehabilitation {{of those who were}} engaged in <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1993, the Parliament {{enacted the}} â€˜Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act in 1993', which banned the {{construction}} of dry latrines and outlawed the practice of <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging.</b> Despite the ban, the practice of <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> continues across India.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} bucket toilets {{still in use}} in India is unknown but figures on [...] "manual scavenging" [...] can give some {{indication}} of the practice: <b>Manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> is a term used in Indian English {{for the removal of}} untreated human excreta from bucket toilets or pit latrines. The workers, called scavengers, rarely have any personal protective equipment. According to Socio Economic Caste Census 2011, 180,657 households are engaged in <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> for a livelihood. The 2011 Census of India found 794,000 cases of <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> across India.|$|E

SKA trains teams to work towards the elimination of <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> in various Indian states. SKA initially worked on the state level, until 2003 when Bezwada and four other team members moved to Delhi to launch the Safai Karmachari Andolan nationwide.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2010, {{the head}} of the National Advisory Council, Sonia Gandhi, wrote to the Prime Minister's office declaring <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> as a {{national}} shame and to address its abolition with the utmost urgency and priority. The NAC resolved to see that <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> was over by 2012. Task forces were formed by the government of India for a new survey of the entire country, rehabilitation, amendment of the law to make it stricter and demolition of dry latrines.|$|E
5000|$|Bezwada took {{photographs}} of dry latrines and <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> in KGF {{and sent it}} to P.A.K. Shettigar, the then managing director of KGF, threatening action under the Act. An emergency meeting was called to convert dry latrines into water seal latrines and transfer all scavengers to non-scavenging jobs. However, it was only when photographs were published in a 1994 article in the Deccan Herald, resulting in embarrassing questions in Parliament, that the Karnataka government was forced to acknowledge that <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> continued to be a problem.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{emptying}} {{the pits}} of twin-pit pour-flush toilets is not classified as <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> in India, as the excreta is already partly treated and degraded in those pits.|$|E
50|$|The PIL was a {{major step}} in the efforts to abolish <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging.</b> All the states and central {{ministries}} were forced {{to address the issue}} of <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging.</b> The Supreme Court gave strict orders that the Chief Secretaries of States and Heads of Departments of the central ministries should appear before the court for the case hearings. To date there have been 23 hearings and in the state of Haryana, for the first time, in 2010 the act was enforced and 16 members were taken into custody for violating the law and employing manual scavengers.|$|E
5000|$|The CBS {{system has}} {{received}} opposition {{due to its}} resemblance to unsafe and banned systems, like <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging.</b> The system {{is still in its}} early stages and is yet to gain official recognition in many regions as a safe alternative to sewers and on-site sanitation systems. In order to gain recognition and operate in some regions like India where <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> is unlawful, the systems had to demonstrate their capacity for sustainable growth, replication and to prove its benefits to public health and local economies, when applied at a large scale.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, freedom fighter G. S.

District magistrates are responsible for ensuring that there are no manual scavengers working in their district. Within 3 years time municipalities, railways and cantonments must make sufficient sanitary latrines available. The government of the state of Maharashtra has planned to abolish the menace of <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging</b> completely from the state soon. But by using Article 252 of the constitution which empowers Parliament to legislate for two or more States by consent and adoption of such legislation by any other State, the Government of India has enacted various laws [...] The continuance of such discriminatory practice is violation of ILOâ€™s Convention 111 (Discrimination in Employment and Occupation) ...|$|E

5000|$|In India in 1970s, Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak {{introduced}} his [...] "Sulabh" [...] concept for building and managing public toilets in India, which has introduced hygienic and well-managed public toilet system. Activist Bezwada Wilson founded {{a group in}} 1994, Safai Karmachari Andolan, to campaign for the demolition of then newly illegal 'dry latrines' (pit latrines) and the abolition of <b>manual</b> <b>scavenging.</b> Despite the efforts of Wilson and other activists, the practice persists two decades later. In July 2008 [...] "MissionSanitation" [...] was a fashion show held by the United Nations {{as part of its}} International Year of Sanitation.
