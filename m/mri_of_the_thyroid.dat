40|$|Aim: <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the demographic characteristics and disease patterns among patients with thyroid nodular abnormali-ties (goiter) and benign tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland in Albania, a transitional country in South Eastern Europe. Methods: Our study included all patients diagnosed with goiter and/or benign tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland who were hospitalized at the University Hospital Center (UHC) “Mother Teresa ” in Tirana between 2004 and 2012 (N= 2258). All patients underwent the same examination and interviewing procedures. Demographic characteristics included gender, age, and place of residence. Binary logistic regression was used to compare the demographic char-acteristics between patients with benign tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland and those with goiter. Results: Overall, there were 2204 patients with goiter and 54 patients with benign tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland hospitalized at UHC over the period 2004 - 2012. There was no evidence of statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics (age, gender, or place of residence) between patients with benign tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland and those with goiter. Conclusions: Our study provides useful evidence on <b>the</b> epidemiology <b>of</b> benign tumors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland and <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> nodular abnormalities (goiter) in the Albanian population. Future studies in Albania should assess <b>the</b> main determinants <b>of</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland disorders and compare them with findings pertinent to other similar populations.

RESULTS: The mean distance between the EBSLN and <b>the</b> superior pole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland was 7. 68 ± 3. 07 mm. A tangent to <b>the</b> inferior edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> cartilage between <b>the</b> EBSLN and the STA measured 4. 24 ± 2. 67 mm. A line from <b>the</b> intersection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EBSLN - related to the STA - to <b>the</b> superior pole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thyroid</b> gland measured 9. 53 ± 4. 65 mm.
