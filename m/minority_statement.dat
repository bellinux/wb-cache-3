50|$|On a {{rotating}} basis, Majority Page runners serve as Statement Pages for a day. Two Pages do the job: one serves as Majority Statement Page, one serves as <b>Minority</b> <b>Statement</b> Page. Each Page sits on their respective {{side of the}} Floor about six rows back from the well. After a member speaks from the Leadership Tables or the Well on his/her side of the Chamber, a statement Page will pursue the member and recover any prepared remarks the member had written before he spoke. The Page then delivers it to the Congressional Record Clerks. While Congressional Record stenographers take down all proceedings, copies of prepared remarks aid the Congressional Record staff in increasing their accuracy.|$|E
40|$|A {{model is}} prespnted and {{interpreted}} by which {{college and university}} boards of trustees periodically assess and evaluate key academic administrators, including presidents, vice presidents, and deans. Evaluation {{is defined as a}} process of review to assess the performance of academic administrators and to make a value judgment concerning this assessment. Such review involves the assessment of actual performance, management activity, quality of leadership, and other activities and attributes. The model makes use of an ad hoc evaluation committee that prepares an assessment portfolio. This portfolio contains a self-evaluation statement by the person under review, descriptive and evaluative statements representing the valid interests of various constituencies, and a consensus statement as well as a dissenting or <b>minority</b> <b>statement</b> if any.

40|$|When {{open source}} {{software}} developers are making design decisions, how do they talk about users? To begin to answer this question, 100 contentious Firefox bug reports were analyzed for distinct uses of the word “user. ” The results show that developers use authoritative words (such as allow, educate, and require) to describe what software does for users. Most statements involved confident speculation about what users need, expect and do, whereas a <b>minority</b> of <b>statements</b> demanded evidence for such unsubstantiated claims. The results also show that when describing users, developers describe them in general terms, rather than referring to particular uses cases or user populations. These results suggest that, {{at least in the}} broader Firefox developer community, developers rely largely on stereotype and instinct to understanding user needs...|$|R

In February 2007, Voronin declared that 10 million [...] "ethnic Moldovans" [...] were being persecuted in Romania by not being allowed to officially register as an ethnic <b>minority.</b> Voronin's <b>statement</b> was criticized in harsh terms by various Romanian organizations. Romanian newspaper Gândul pointed out that this alleged minority was about half the Romanian population. Constantin Iordachi interpreted Voronin's statement as: [...] "Moreover, blaming Romania’s irredenta policies, Voronin put forward his own plans for a Greater Moldova, raising territorial claims to Romania’s province of Moldova." [...] A month later Voronin declared that the [...] "Moldovan language is the mother of the Romanian language. ...

40|$|Professional {{guidelines}} {{suggest that}} men should learn about {{risks and benefits}} of screening to make informed decisions consistent with their preferences. We used concept mapping to investigate views of informed decision making (IDM) of <b>minority</b> men. <b>Statements</b> about what men need for IDM about prostate cancer screening were sorted by similarity and rated for importance by 16 Hispanic and 15 African-American men. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to develop a concept map for IDM. The 10 -cluster solution was selected. The clusters rated most important were labeled Future Considerations, What to Know and Decision to Make. Clusters labeled Social Support and Sharing Perspectives depicted social aspects of the decision and were intermediate in importance. There was strong correlation in relative importance ratings of clusters by African-American and Hispanic men. However, African-American men gave higher importance ratings than Hispanic men. Concept mapping, a method with strong participatory elements, was useful in identifying conceptual frameworks for IDM of African-American and Hispanic men. Health education to support IDM requires some shifts in focus and strategy. It is important that interventions with minority men build upon a strong conceptual framework...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThe Centennial Celebration in the State or California in 1950 {{provides}} an appropriate occasion {{for a study}} of Chinese Community life in Los Angeles. The Chinese people began to come to the United States a hundred years ago. They were among the early pioneers who helped to build upthe state. When there was a big demand for cheap labor, Chinese laborers were imported into California to meet the urgent needs. In time, the laborers sent for their friends and relatives to join them on this land or opportunity, and a Chinese community began to grow on American soil. Chinatowns were established in different cities of the United States. Today the descendants of the early Chinese laborers are scattered all over the United States. Some of them are American citizens; others are only residents; they all are members or a distinct <b>minority</b> group.; <b>Statement</b> of the problem. This is a study of the changing socio-cultural patterns of the Chinese community in Los Angeles. On, the one hand, it aims to show how Chinese social institutions and organizations have evolved {{to meet the needs of}} the immigrants in early California as well as in the modern Chinatown in Los Angeles. Attention is also given not only to the observable social, cultural, and economic factors, but to environmental factors which are responsible for the socio-cultural changes that took place in the Chinese community in the past hundred years. On the other hand, the study is concerned with the interrelationships that exist between the Chinese and the white American community, and the ways in which the social organization of the Chinese community functions within the framework of the larger community...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the psychotherapeutic professions and lesbian, gay, {{bisexual}} and trans (LGBT) clients is a deeply troubled one (Davies and Neal, 1996). Thankfully most of the negative attitudes of the past seem to be changing {{with all of the}} major UK therapy associations (BACP, UKCP, BPS) providing guidance on working ethically with clients from sexual and gender <b>minorities</b> and making <b>statements</b> critical of conversion/reparative therapy (which is designed to change someone's sexual orientation). In spite of such changes, pathologizing stances concerning LGBT clients still exist amongst some therapists, particularly those from a psychoanalytic perspective and some religiously informed therapists. The earliest school of existential therapy – Daseinsanalysis – does not escape charges of homonegativity and heteronormativity either. Medard Boss, the founder of Daseinsanalysis wrote in his book The Meaning and Content of Sexual Perversions (1947 / 1949) about homosexuality as a sexual perversion and, even as recently as 1987, thought that the healthiest state for a woman was to have children in a loving relationship with a man (Boss & Kenny, 1987) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} a {{very large}} set of molecular interactions that had been derived automatically from biological texts. We found that published statements, regardless of their verity, tend to interfere with interpretation of the subsequent experiments and, therefore, can act as scientific "microparadigms," similar to dominant scientific theories [Kuhn, T. S. (1996) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Univ. Chicago Press, Chicago) ]. Using statistical tools, we measured {{the strength of the}} influence of a single published statement on subsequent interpretations. We call these measured values the momentums of the published statements and treat separately the majority and <b>minority</b> of conflicting <b>statements</b> about the same molecular event. Our results indicate that, when building biological models based on published experimental data, we may have to treat the data as highly dependent-ordered sequences of statements (i. e., chains of collective reasoning) rather than unordered and independent experimental observations. Furthermore, our computations indicate that our data set can be interpreted in two very different ways (two "alternative universes") : one is an "optimists' universe" with a very low incidence of false results (90 %). Our computations deem highly unlikely any milder intermediate explanation between these two extremes...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the transformations of rhetoric identified in the Lithuanian press in the publications on the “Jewish question”. The established tradition of the Lithuanian press was to picture the Lithuanian Jewish community as a problematic national <b>minority.</b> There were <b>statements</b> voiced to the effect that Jews did not support the main goals of Lithuania, that instead of Lithuanian they were using foreign languages (first of all, Russian and German) for communication. In addition, the generally accepted view was that Jews were over-dominating in Lithuanian economic life. Such opinions were still common in the 1920 s and 1930 s; however, at that time slightly different attitudes were already emerging reflecting some changes in the Lithuanian mentality, especially the idea that every group within the Lithuanian society should know its place and perform a particular role. As regards the rhetoric concerning the Jewish community, more authors began to escalate the question of Jewish alienation based on differences in national psychology or even race. They argued that Jews were not able to change in principle, and it could be difficult to Lithuanize them or to make them more pro-Lithuanian. It is due to this reason that both Jews and Lithuanians should know the status and position of both communities in the society. Lithuanians were seen as owners of the state, and Jews were encouraged to accept this idea in order to avoid conflicts on this issue in the future...|$|R
