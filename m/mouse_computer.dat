40|$|The {{traditional}} {{keyboard and}} <b>mouse</b> <b>computer</b> interface {{is well suited}} for 2 D applications such as document editing, but as 3 D environments become more prevalent there arises a need for new methods of user input. An immersive 3 D interface is preferable, but is often cost prohibitive. This paper presents the design and implementation of a Natural User Interface (NUI), named NuWii. NuWii {{was designed to be}} used with the Spiegel visualization framework for astrophysical data. The interface makes use of Nintendo Wii Remotes as infrared tracking cameras to detect 3 D gestures made by the user. These gestures are interpreted and used to control the viewing camera’s parameters throughout the course of a visualization. Our project provides a new, more intuitive way of manipulating the camera in the Spiegel visualization system. Furthermore, NuWii provides an expandable base {{that could be used for}} gesture control in many other applications. ...|$|E

40|$|Somatic {{mutations}} {{are expected}} to arise with age. This process is accelerated in mice lacking the DNA mismatch repair gene Pms 2. The distributions of microsatellite alleles present in small patches of normal Pms 2 -/- intestines revealed a general increase in genetic diversity {{or the number of}} mutations with age. However, the patterns were complex with different distributions and variances present within a single <b>mouse.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations indicate that the experimental data are consistent with mutation rates between 0. 0020 and 0. 0025 mutations per division, nonrandom cell death, and an effective population size of 20 or fewer cells. Small numbers of cells exacerbate the random accumulation of mutations expected of a stochastic mutation process. The computer simulations and experimental data are consistent with known patterns of intestinal development and renewal by small numbers of stem cells and demonstrate relatively high mutation rates in histologically normal epithelium. These findings provide background for the analysis of microsatellite mutations in normal and tumor tissue lacking mismatch repair and further support the hypothesis that microsatellite loci can function as molecular tumor clocks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} an eye-control method based on electrooculography (EOG) {{to develop a}} system for assisted mobility. One of its most important features is its modularity, making it adaptable to the particular needs of each user according to the type and degree of handicap involved. An eye model based on electrooculographic signal is proposed and its validity is studied. Several human-machine interfaces (HMI) based on EOG are commented, focusing our study on guiding and controlling a wheelchair for disabled people, where the control is actually effected by eye movements within the socket. Different techniques and guidance strategies are then shown with comments on {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each one. The system consists of a standard electric wheelchair with an on-board computer, sensors and a graphic user interface run by the computer. On the other hand, this eye-control method can be applied to handle graphical interfaces, where the eye is used as a <b>mouse</b> <b>computer.</b> Results obtained show that this control technique could be useful in multiple applications, such as mobility and communication aid for handicapped persons. Index Terms—Control, disabled people, electrooculography (EOG), eye movements, graphical interfaces, guidance, wheel-chair. I...|$|E
40|$|Confronted {{with the}} problem of {{overflows}} from its combined sewer system into the River Seine during rainfall, the Department of the Hauts de Seine (which covers some thirty urban districts {{on the west side of}} Paris) has decided to implement the real time control of its sewer system in 1996. To initiate this plan, as the town of Boulogne Billancourt seemed to be a particularly favourable site for the use of such techniques, a project to control its sewer system in real time has been implemented within the scope of the SPRINT 226 programme financed by the European Community. The preliminary studies, based on a <b>MOUSE</b> <b>computer</b> model of the sewer system, showed that the real time control of the sewer network under study had a high potential benefit, since it would allow an 80 % reduction of the volumes of waste water discharged into the Seine annually in the study zone. Following on from these encouraging results, the installation of a complete real time control system was set in hand. The system, at present undergoing testing and evaluation, consists principally of a MOUSE ON LINE real time model and a system for forecasting rainfall by means of radar images.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test whether {{feedback}} signals based on continuous monitoring of specific behaviour during computer work had effects on healthy work style of computer workers, without interrupting the work task. For this purpose an experiment was conducted with an intelligent computer <b>mouse.</b> <b>Computer</b> users frequently hover over their mouse maintaining an extended wrist posture on or above the mouse even when it’s not operated. This leads to unnecessary sustained muscle tension of the forearm muscles. A tactile, vibrating feedback signal in the computer mouse reminds the user to let go of the mouse. The effects of the tactile feedback on reduction of hovering behaviour and consequently on changes in muscle load, productivity, and user friendliness were determined. Fifteen subjects participated. The feedback signal effectively decreased hovering behaviour with 35 %, led to a more dynamic activation pattern of the extensor muscles of the forearm and showed a positive effect on the distribution of micro-pauses. The overall opinion of the feedback signal for future use was rated somewhat variable. The use of a mouse with a tactile vibrating feedback signal seems promising for preventing arm complaints and feedback signals in general seem effective for changing work style regarding interaction with the workplace...|$|E
