25|$|The interactome {{of class}} III β-tubulin {{comprises}} the GTPase GBP1 (guanylate binding protein 1) and {{a panel of}} an additional 19 kinases having prosurvival activity including PIM1 (Proviral Integration Site 1) and NEK6 (NIMA-related kinase 6). Incorporation of these kinases into the cytoskeleton via the GBP-1/ class III β-tubulin interaction protects kinases from rapid degradation. Other pro-survival factors interacting with class III β-tubulin enabling cellular adaptation to oxidative stress include the <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperone</b> HSP70/GRP75.

In the E2 classical pathway or estrogen classical pathway, estradiol enters the cytoplasm, where it interacts with ERs. Once bound E2, ERs dissociate from the <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperone</b> complexes and become competent to dimerize, migrate to nucleus, and to bind to specific DNA sequences (estrogen response element, ERE), allowing for gene transcription which can take place over hours and days.|$|E
25|$|CCT is {{required}} {{in order to ensure that}} folding takes place correctly. CCT is a group II cytosolic <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperone</b> (or chaperonin, a protein that assists in the folding of other macromolecular structures). CCT is formed of a double ring of eight different subunits (hetero-octameric) and it differs from other molecular chaperones, particularly from its homologue GroEL which is found in the Archaea, as it does not require a co-chaperone to act as a lid over the central catalytic cavity. Substrates bind to CCT through specific domains. It was initially thought that it only bound with actin and tubulin, although recent immunoprecipitation studies have shown that it interacts with a large number of polypeptides, which possibly function as substrates. It acts through ATP-dependent conformational changes that on occasion require several rounds of liberation and catalysis in order to complete a reaction.|$|E

Additional research has shown that C16:0 {{plays an important role in}} assisting to improve insulin crystal preservation, and as the β cells in the pancreas secrete insulin, sulfatide aids in the monomerization of insulin, which is the breakdown of insulin into its basics components or monomers. Consequently, sulfatide is needed in order to maintain normal insulin secretion, which sulfatide is capable of mediating through stimulation of calcium dependent exocytosis and Adenosine triphosphate(ATP) sensitive potassium ion channels.

40|$|The {{formation}} of toxic protein aggregates {{is a common}} denominator to many neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Accumulation of toxic, possibly infectious protein aggregates induces a cascade of events, such as excessive inflammation, the production of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis and neuronal loss. A network of highly conserved <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> and of chaperone-related proteases controls the fold-quality of proteins in the cell. Most <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> can passively prevent protein aggregation by binding misfolding intermediates. Some <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> and chaperone-related proteases, such as the proteasome, can also hydrolyse ATP to forcefully convert stable harmful protein aggregates into harmless natively refoldable, or protease-degradable, polypeptides. <b>Molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> and chaperone-related proteases thus control the delicate balance between natively folded functional proteins and aggregation-prone misfolded proteins, which may form during the lifetime and lead to cell death. Abundant data now point at the <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> and the proteases as major clearance mechanisms to remove toxic protein aggregates from cells, delaying the onset and the outcome of protein-misfolding diseases.

40|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> {{consist of}} several highly conserved {{families}} of proteins, {{many of which}} consist of heat shock proteins. The primary function of <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> is to facilitate the folding or refolding of proteins, and therefore they {{play an important role}} in diverse cellular processes including protein synthesis, protein translocation, and the refolding or degradation of proteins after cell stress. Cells are often exposed to different stressors, resulting in protein misfolding and aggregation. It is now well established that the levels of certain <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> are elevated during stress to provide protection to the cell. The focus of this review is on the impact of <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> in biology, medicine and protein biotechnology, and thus covers both fundamental and applied aspects of chaperone biology.

40|$|International audienceThe {{response}} of cells to stress was first {{documented in the}} 1960 s and 1970 s and the molecular nature of the families of proteins that subserve this vital response, the <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones,</b> were identified and subjected to critical study in the period from the late 1980 s. This resulted in the rapidly advancing new field of protein folding {{and its role in}} cellular function. Emerging at the same time, but initially largely ignored, were reports that <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> could be released by cells and exist on the outer plasma membrane or in the body fluids. These secreted <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> were found to have intercellular signalling functions.

An ever-increasing number of intrinsically disordered proteins and amyloid-forming polypeptides challenge this dogma.

Here, we review our current understanding of ATP-dependent <b>molecular</b> <b>chaperones</b> that harness the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to fuel their chaperone functions. An emerging theme is that most of these chaperones do not work alone, but instead function together with other chaperone systems to maintain the proteome.
