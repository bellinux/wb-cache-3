5|$|When Professor Crater arrives, he is {{reluctant}} to be examined, telling Kirk that they only require salt tablets. Before McCoy can complete the examination, they hear a scream from outside. They find Darnell dead, with red ring-like <b>mottling</b> {{on his face and}} a plant root visible in his mouth; Nancy says that she was unable to stop Darnell from tasting the plant. On board Enterprise, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) analyzes the plant. He confirms that it is poisonous, but the <b>mottling</b> is not a symptom. McCoy conducts a medical exam, and together with Spock determines that Darnell died after all the salt was drained from his body. In response, Kirk transports back down to the planet with McCoy and two crewmen, Green (Bruce Watson) and Sturgeon (John Arndt). They spread out to search, but Crater slips away. Kirk and McCoy find Sturgeon's body. Meanwhile, unseen by them, Nancy has killed Green; the faces of Green and Sturgeon show the same <b>mottling</b> as Darnell. Nancy alters her shape, assuming the form of Green, and meets Kirk and McCoy. They beam back up to the ship with Sturgeon's body.|$|E

Even if <b>mottle</b> {{is not a new}} phenomenon, it has been a growing problem in the printing industry, since the print quality requirements have increased strongly these past 10 years. <b>Mottle</b> was (and is still at some locations) evaluated visually. For few years now, a lot of lab instruments have appeared on the market to quantify <b>mottle.</b> But with most of them, the user has to determine an arbitrary threshold level in the scale of pixel values which will determine what is part of an object of interest or not. As a result, <b>mottle</b> measurements are not reproducible between different operators and only few of these systems demonstrate a clear correlation between the visual print quality assessment and the measured <b>mottle</b> index. An other limitation traditionally met is that only few systems allow parameters adjustments to measure <b>mottle</b> both on visible and subvisible levels. The aim of this work is to examine issues related to quantification of the overall subjective impression of <b>mottle</b> and to correlate it with color variations (two-dimensional luminance variations and chromatic variations) resulting from the <b>mottle</b> effect. <b>Mottle</b> measurements on print samples were performed with the Verity IA 2001 <b>Mottle</b> system and color variations were carried out with a spherical spectrophotometer Datacolor SF- 600 +, specular excluded.

The reproductions of fine tone details on these films are challenging as the occurrence of graininess and image-noise results in print defect such as print half-tone <b>mottle.</b> The presence of print half-tone <b>mottle</b> is visually disturbing leading to wastage of ink, substrate and time.

The base line for print half-tone <b>mottle</b> was determined by conducting production runs on press with a defined set of process parameters and the target was set to minimize it from the baseline. The half-tone area was scanned and processed through SFDA algorithm to calculate print half-tone <b>mottle.</b> The design of experiments (DOE) was generated for above-mentioned process parameters and was analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find the significant factor affecting the print half-tone <b>mottle.</b> The analysis revealed line screen, viscosity and hardness as significant factors in minimizing print half-tone <b>mottle.</b> The results showed minimization of print half-tone <b>mottle</b> by 28 % for both PVC and PET-G films.

We observe that many <b>mottles,</b> jet-like features in the quiet Sun, display clear up- and downward motions along their main axis. In addition, many <b>mottles</b> show vigorous transverse displacements. Unique identification of the <b>mottles</b> throughout their lifetime is much harder than for their active region counterpart, dynamic fibrils. This is because many seem to lack a sharply defined edge at their top, and significant fading often occurs throughout their lifetime.

40|$|One of the {{printing}} troubles on print quality is non-uniformity of printing density called print <b>mottle.</b> The causes of print <b>mottle</b> are various. As far as paper, {{it has been}} thought that surface roughness of paper, absorption of ink and fountain solution cause non-uniformity of ink transfer. As the results of evaluation on commercial coated paper, print <b>mottle</b> did not occur in solid area and non-uniformity of ink transfer also did not arise. But print <b>mottle</b> occurred in halftone dots, and it was thought another factor except ink transfer affect print <b>mottle</b> in halftone dots. This was confirmed because print <b>mottle</b> was also observed in halftone dots which shape and density were quite even on the paper (chemical proof). The purpose {{of this research is}} to clarify the cause affecting print <b>mottle</b> in halftone dots. It is known that apparent dot gain (optical dot gain) arises in halftone dots due to lateral light scattering of printing medium, and optical dot gain affects printing density. We set up a hypothesis that non-uniformity of optical dot gain causes print <b>mottle</b> in halftone dots. Therefore, we investigated the non-uniformity of lateral light scattering of paper that was thought to bring about the non-uniformity of optical dot gain. In the past researches to measure the lateral light scattering, ruled-lines were formed on the paper, the modulation arisen in amplitude of microdensity profile of ruled-lines due to light scattering, and light intensity distribution against distance was calculated from the modulation. We measured the modulation using printed ruled-lines on paper. Non-uniformity of light scattering was found, and it was though that this was caused by coating amount variation and so on from microscopic observation. From these results, non-uniformity of optical dot gain was thought {{to be one of the}} important factors affecting print <b>mottle</b> in halftone dots...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”Print <b>mottle</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{detrimental}} factors to general print quality, and to get high quality print, the most important thing is to resolve print <b>mottle</b> problem. The evaluation method for print <b>mottle</b> is proposed by means of discrete wavelet analysis, in which the index of print <b>mottle</b> is built on the base of the coefficient of variance of the wavelet-filtered digital image. Then, in our research, we have compared the three methods: the visual assessment method, the traditional method, and the wavelet-based method. They were applied on offset papers to check their performance. The linear correlation coefficient obtained between the visual ranking of the samples and the results with the traditional method is 0. 6148. While, the correlations using the wavelet-based method with visual evaluation is much better. The print <b>mottle</b> evaluation results with ten wavelet base functions are much better at the third and the fifth decomposition levels. In all, the analytical results compared with visual perception shows that the wavelet-based method proposed is effective and practical in measuring printing <b>mottle.</b> Keywords-print mottle; evalution method; discrete wavelet transform; base function; decomposition level I...|$|R

40|$|Print <b>Mottle</b> {{is perhaps}} one of the most {{disturbing}} factors influencing overall Print Quality. <b>Mottle</b> has traditionally been evaluated by estimating the reflectance variation in the print. Although the amplitude of the reflectance variation is probably the most important aspect of print <b>mottle,</b> other aspects may also influence the perceptibility of <b>mottle.</b> Since the human visual system is optimised to fit the conditions prevailing in its surroundings, it is also important to consider aspects such as mean reflectance factor level, spatial frequency content, structure of the <b>mottle,</b> and colour variations. In this thesis, a new evaluation model for the estimation of print <b>mottle</b> is proposed. The model is best explained as a six-step chain. First, a digital RGB image of the print is acquired with a scanner. The digital RGB image is then calibrated and transformed into the L*a*b* colour space. Next, the three colour components are transformed into the frequency domain by a Fourier transform and the power spectra are calculated. The power spectra are thereafter filtered with respect to the contrast sensitivity functions representing the human eyeâ€™s sensitivity to spatial variations in the three colour channels. To account for systematic variations in the sample, the spectra are filtered a second time with texture enhancement filters, which are based on local calculations of chi-square measures in the power spectra. The energy within the visually detectable area of the filtered power spectra is then integrated to obtain a single measure of the variation for each colour component. A single <b>mottle</b> estimate is obtained as the square root of the sum of the squared variation measures for the three components. To acknowledge the influence of mean lightness level on perceived print <b>mottle</b> in a way that agrees with the results presented in Paper I, the <b>mottle</b> estimate obtained is finally multiplied by the sixth root of the mean reflectance factor level. The theoretical foundations of the model are consecutively developed through the first five papers of the thesis. The first paper considers the influence of the mean reflectance level on perceived print <b>mottle.</b> The second and third papers describe the contrast sensitivity filter and the texture enhancement filter applied. The fourth paper compares the new model with other models for print <b>mottle</b> evaluation. The fifth paper extends the grey-scale version of the model into colour. The sixth paper presents the unified model that takes all the mentioned factors into account. To test the model, samples from both simulated sets of prints with various degrees of colour and/or systematic <b>mottle</b> and sets of real prints from various conventional presses were analysed a) visually, b) with traditional print <b>mottle</b> evaluation models, and c) with the new model. Results obtained using the different evaluation models were compared with visual assessments of the sets of prints. In each one of the evaluations the new model was found to be as good as or superior to the traditional print <b>mottle</b> evaluation models in its agreement with visual assessment. The new model is particularly promising in cases where the evaluated prints show colour and/or systematic disturbances. QC 2010101...|$|R
