40|$|Human {{resource}} development {{is very important}} component of any development activity of national and international importance. A careful planning and implementation besides <b>mid</b> <b>course</b> <b>corrections</b> and feedbacks are essential for success in this area. In spite of very rapid progress made in several fields of late the human resource crunch is being faced today very seriously. How to overcome the difficulties being faced in preparing ourselves to generate appropriate type of human resources is the subject discussed here with special reference to the typical requirements of Nanobiotechnology. Multidisciplinary and multiinstitutional approach {{is the key to}} success as discussed in the present paper. The proposed guidelines are equally valid for any modern discipline emerging in future and therefore the total plan should be prepared by taking into account all the components appropriately and then implementing monitoring and midcourse corrections based on the feedbacks...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{experience}} with public works programs (PWPs) in several countries over the past 20 years to delineate use patterns and to determine the factors contributing to its use as a successful safety net program. The analysis shows that PWP have been used extensively in response to either a one-time large covariate shock, or repeated shocks. In low income countries, PWPs also have an antipoverty or poverty reduction objective. Our review shows that well designed and implemented PWPs can help mitigating income shocks; the program {{can also be used}} as an effective anti-poverty instrument. The paper examines the factors behind the observed wide variation in the effectiveness of the program in accomplishing its goals and identifies prerequisites for making PWPs successful safety net interventions capable of protecting the poor from income shocks, thus reducing both temporal and seasonal poverty, while creating useful public goods or services for the communities. For public works programs to be successful, it is important firstly to: a) have clear objectives; b) select projects that can create valuable public goods; and c) ensure predictable funding. Secondly, the success of the program depends critically on careful design and incorporation of all the key design features. Finally, a credible monitoring and evaluation system designed right upfront, prior to launching of theprogram can allow for <b>mid</b> <b>course</b> <b>corrections</b> and to respond to sudden changes which can inhibit effective implementation. The potential of the PWP program is enormous both in countries that have experiences with these programs and especially in countries that never used them. However, more research is needed investigation is needed to better understand the impact of PWPs, such as second round effects from the created assets, the impacts on the labor market, and their cost-effectiveness after factoring in both the immediate and second round benefits from its program.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{addresses}} {{the design of}} the trajectory transferring from Earth to Halo orbit, and proposes a timing closed-loop strategy of <b>correction</b> <b>maneuver</b> during the transfer in the frame of circular restricted three body problem (CR 3 BP). The relation between the Floquet multipliers and the magnitudes of Halo orbit is established, so that the suitable magnitude for the aerospace mission is chosen in terms of the stability of Halo orbit. The stable manifold is investigated from the PoincarÃ© mapping defined which is different from the previous researches, and six types of single-impulse transfer trajectories are attained from the geometry of the invariant manifolds. Based on one of the trajectories of indirect transfer which are ignored in the most of literatures, the stochastic control theory for imperfect information of the discrete linear stochastic system is applied to design the trajectory <b>correction</b> <b>maneuver.</b> The statistical dispersion analysis is performed by Monte-Carlo simulation...|$|R
