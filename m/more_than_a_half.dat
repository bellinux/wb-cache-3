5|$|The lone {{portion of}} NY590 {{within the city}} of Rochester runs due north–south, acting as a divider between {{residential}} neighborhoods {{to the west and}} the Irondequoit Creek valley (much of which is part of Ellison Park) to the east. Little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> mile after entering the city, NY590 exits the city and enters the neighboring town of Irondequoit. Here, the freeway turns to the northwest to avoid the area surrounding the intersection of North Winton Road and NY404 (Empire Boulevard). After passing under North Winton Road, NY590 resumes its northward trek and connects to NY404 by way of a modified cloverleaf interchange. The expressway continues onward, separating a large residential area from Irondequoit Bay Park West as it progresses toward a northbound-only exit with Norton Street. One half-mile to the north of Norton, NY590 meets NY104 via a large interchange.|$|E
5|$|Titanics {{survivors}} {{were rescued}} around 04:00 on 15April by the RMS Carpathia, which had steamed {{through the night}} at high speed and at considerable risk, as the ship had to dodge numerous icebergs en route. Carpathias lights were first spotted around 03:30, which greatly cheered the survivors, though it took several more hours for everyone to be brought aboard. The 30 or more men on collapsible B finally managed to board two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made. Collapsible A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; many of those aboard (maybe <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>half)</b> had died overnight. The remaining survivors– {{an unknown number of}} men, estimated to be between 10–11 and more than 20, and one woman– were transferred from A into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies in the boat, which was left to drift away. It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner Oceanic, with the bodies still aboard.|$|E

25|$|Some ideas {{underlying}} the small cancellation theory {{go back to}} the work of Max Dehn in the 1910s. Dehn proved that fundamental groups of closed orientable surfaces of genus at least two have word problem solvable by what is now called Dehn's algorithm.

Pro-independence Kashmiri leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq warned that the peaceful uprising could lead to an upsurge in violence if India's heavy-handed crackdown on protests was not restrained. The United Nations expressed concern at India's response to peaceful protests and urged investigations be launched against Indian security personnel who had taken part in the crackdown.|$|E

25|$|The {{city was}} under martial law {{under the command}} of Karl von Thüngen. The Viennese court wanted to destroy the city first, but later they decided to keep it to {{counterbalance}} the importance of Szigetvár, which was still under Ottoman rule. Slowly the city started to prosper again, but in the 1690s two plague epidemics claimed many lives. In 1688 German settlers arrived. Only about one quarter of the city's population was Hungarian, the others were Germans or Southern Slavs. According to 1698 data, South Slavs comprised <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> {{of the population of the}} town. Because Hungarians were only a minority of the population, Pécs did not support the revolution against Habsburg rule led by Francis II Rákóczi, and his armies pillaged the city in 1704.|$|E
25|$|Following de Condorcet's repeated, yet failed, {{appeals to}} the National Assembly in 1789 and 1790, Olympe de Gouges (in {{association}} with the Society of the Friends of Truth) authored and published the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen in 1791.

De Gouges wrote the Declaration in the prose of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, almost mimicking the failure of men to include <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of the French population in egalité. Even though,the Declaration did not immediately accomplish its goals, it did set a precedent for a manner in which feminists could satirize their governments for their failures in equality, seen in documents such as A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and A Declaration of Sentiments.|$|E
