"It {{starts off}} {{with a bit of}} {{keyboards}} that lead to a series of rapid but somewhat quiet beats over which she sings softly, almost whispering, until she reaches the chorus and fulminating beats drop.

[...] "My pervasive need for justice left me feeling pretty disappointed when we never found out who the utterly repulsive villain had been behind these sex crimes... Other than the lack of closure, though, this was a solid, well-written episode and it was nice seeing the (supposed) redemption of Troy. Television reviewer Alan Sepinwall was very positive towards the episode, praising it as a return to form for the series. [...] "Now that's <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> Veronica Mars. A good self-contained mystery, a suggestion that the show could do okay once Veronica leaves high school, a gratuitously awesome [...] "Arrested Development" [...] double-cameo, the biggest spotlight yet for wisecracking Cliff, and a fine showcase for Jason Dohring, who's becoming so good that Veronica may need to investigate a case of show-stealing." [...] He went on to laud the supporting characters' performances, especially the subplot involving Cliff and Sheriff Lamb: [...] "Cliff and Lamb are my favorite non-Keith adult characters, so any subplot that has one busting on the other gets the Sepinwall seal of approval." ...|$|E

2500|$|The box of dust {{enabling}} travel between worlds {{originated in}} Atlantis. Both Lewis and his close friend J.R.R. Tolkien were {{fascinated by the}} Atlantis legend. The degeneration of Charn's rulers, Jadis' ancestors, from the early kind and wise to the later cruel and arrogant {{is reminiscent of the}} similar degeneration in Tolkien's Númenor, the fabled island kingdom that finally sank under the waves due to the sinfulness of its latter inhabitants. The world of Charn was destroyed when Jadis spoke The Deplorable Word, a form of knowledge ancient Charnian scholars feared for its destructive potential. A number of commentators believed Lewis was referring {{to the use of the}} atomic bomb, used less than a decade earlier. It is perhaps more likely that Lewis was echoing the mythical destruction of Atlantis by the forces of evil and arrogance. As noted by Alice Ward, the comparison with nuclear arms is made explicit in Aslan's last warning: [...] "You [...] are growing <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> [...] It is not certain that some wicked one of your race will not find out a secret as evil as The Deplorable Word and use it to destroy all living things".|$|E
