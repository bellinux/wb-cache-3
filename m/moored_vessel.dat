50|$|A {{few years}} earlier Huibers built a half-scale {{interpretation}} of the Ark, in the river port of Schagen, 50 km north of Amsterdam. Huibers did the work mostly with his own hands, using modern tools and occasional help from his son, in {{one and a half}} years. Its size, adapted for sailing the Dutch canals and locks, was 70 m long, 9.5 m wide, and 13 m high. The cost to build was 1 million euro. In 2007 Huibers opened the doors to visitors. After a few months the vessel was towed by tugboat through the canals and moored in 21 harbors in the Netherlands. The ark was sold to Dutch artist Aad Peters in 2010. He tours through Germany, Denmark and Norway. Although the ark isn't really seaworthy and can't handle waves higher than two meters, he was successfully towed across the sea from Denmark to Norway. On 10 June 2016, the ark collided with a <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> (NoCGV Nornen) while under tow in Oslo harbor. The ark suffered severe damage to its wooden cladding.|$|E

According to the National Transportation Safety Board in the U.S., this accounted for 26.3 percent of all PWCs involved in accidents in 2007. Reckless driving has been defined in the Personal Watercraft Act of 2005 in the U.S. as follows: Every personal watercraft shall at all times be operated in a reasonable and prudent manner. No person shall operate a personal watercraft in an unsafe or reckless manner. Unsafe personal watercraft operation shall include, but {{not be limited to}} the following: (1) Becoming airborne or completely leaving the water while crossing the wake of another vessel within feet of the vessel creating the wake. Or wake jumping (2) Weaving through congested traffic. (3) Operating a vessel at greater than slow/no wake speed within feet of an anchored or <b>moored</b> <b>vessel,</b> shoreline, vessel underway, dock, pier, boat ramp, marina, swim float, marked swim area, person in the water, person(s) engaged in angling, or any propelled vessel. [...] (4) Operating contrary to the [...] "Rules of the Road" [...] or following too close to another vessel, including another personal watercraft. For the purposes of this section, following too close shall be construed as proceeding in the same direction and operating at a speed in excess of MPH when approaching within feet to the rear or feet to the side of another motorboat or sailboat which is underway unless such vessel is operating in a narrow channel, in which case a personal watercraft may operate at speed and flow of other vessel traffic.|$|E

The elastic behaviour of the cables, made of various fibers, is difficult to determine, because it depends on material, composition, loading history and environmental conditions. The natural oscillation period of the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> depends on the vessels displacement, number, type and loading of the lines. Several cases were studied, in order to determine the influence of the variables on the oscillation and vibration modes of vessels and basins. The oscillation period of the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> was determined with the module „Surging of a <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> ” implemented in the demo version of CEDAS. The results refere to the amplification factor and the possibility of resonance of the natural oscillations period of vessels and basins...|$|E
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the question of}} <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> stationkeeping operations in pack ice, {{on the basis of}} full scale experience with the Kulluk in the Beaufort Sea. As part of this work, a data base which documents full scale ice load levels on moored vessels has been significantly extended, and now includes almost 700 individual ice loading events. In addition, more operationally oriented information about ice management support activities and levels of risk (alerts) has been blended with the load data, for each event. Various scatter plots of expected ice loads in managed pack ice conditions are presented. Data relating to the effect of different levels of ice management support on load and risk levels is also included. The implications of this information are outlined in relation to various <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> system operations in Grand Banks pack ice conditions. It is shown that <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> operations in the type of pack ice conditions periodically encountered on the Grand Banks should be less difficult than is currently perceived, provided systems with reasonable in-ice capabilities and adequate levels of ice management support are used.

40|$|After the {{introduction}} of Fast Ferry public transport in the Netherlands a number of complaints about wake wash induced hindrance onboard moored vessels appeared. It was already possible to calculate the wake wash characteristics of fast sailing vessels, the progress of these waves in a waterway and their effect on moored vessels. This paper describes the full scale tests carried out to develop the missing relation between the wash induced motions of a <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> and the hindrance thereof. Many different combinations of moored ships, passing ships and shore configurations have been realised. An expert panel scored the hindrance due to the motions of the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel.</b> A guideline for maximum ship motions is developed from the results. With this guideline, it can be determined prior to {{the introduction}} of a new innovative vessel with reasonable accuracy if its wake wash will remain within acceptable limits. © 2009 : The Royal Institution of Naval Architects...|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of the MoorMasterTM system by Cavotec MSL in inland shipping is researched. It is an innovative mooring system using vacuum pads with active motion control, utilising a PID controller. A {{case study of}} a 110 m Large Rhine vessel moored directly beside the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal (ARK) is performed. In order for the system to be suitable, the ship motions have to remain within certain mooring criteria, while passing vessels {{should not have to}} reduce speed. The forces on the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> caused by the passing vessels are simulated using ROPES, a numerical method based on a 3 D flow model, using the panel method. Three different passing vessels at three different passing distances are simulated. All passing vessels are simulated to sail at the maximum allowed speed in the ARK. Next, the manoeuvring model is used to set up the equations of motion of the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel.</b> The external force consists of the forces calculated in the Ropes simulations and the modelled forces of the MoorMasterTM units. Solving these equations results in the ship motions. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringMaritime & Transport Technolog...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the dynamic of}} a {{floating}} body moored in waves is analysed and some aspects concerning the optimization of the mooring lines are discussed. A frequency domain approach to the linearized problem is adopted. Namely the boundary value hydrodynamic problem is recast in integral form by using the proper Green function and the relevant integral equations are solved via a zeroth order panel method. A variational formulation for the cable dynamics is then proposed and its frequency response matrix is recovered in a closed analytical form by a Rayleigh-Ritz approach. The procedure is applied {{in the frame of}} an optimization technique and the sensitivity of the <b>moored</b> <b>vessel</b> response with respect to some mooring line design parameters is investigated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} additional validation to {{the problem}} of estimating wave spectra based on the first-order motions of a <b>moored</b> <b>vessel.</b> Prior investigations conducted by the authors have attested that even a large-volume ship, such as an FPSO unit, could be adopted for on-board estimation of the wave field. The obvious limitation of the methodology concerns filtering of high-frequency wave components, for which the vessel has no significant response. As a result, the estimation range is directly dependent on the characteristics of the vessel response. In order to extend this analysis, further small-scale tests were performed with a model of a pipe-laying crane-barge. When compared to the FPSO case, the results attest that a broader range of typical sea states can be accurately estimated, including crossed-sea states with low peak periods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
