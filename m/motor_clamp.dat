50|$|The {{electrical}} equipment on the ER2 multiple units {{is similar to}} that of the late-model ER1s. Each power car has 4 traction motors connected in a series-parallel connection. The traction <b>motor</b> <b>clamp</b> voltage is controlled by means of starting resistances, as well as by changing the motors' connectivity and by field weakening. They are protected from electrical surges by various protective units: a fast-acting circuit breaker, an overload relay, a differential relay, etc. Early units also had a fuse in the traction motor circuit, but later units had more reliable protective equipment, which led to the fuse being removed as redundant.|$|E

50|$|The {{traction}} motors are {{mounted on the}} truck frames (see above), which protects them from impact when rolling over rail joints and reduces the train's unsprung weight. The first ER2s had the same DK-106B {{traction motors}} as the ER1; these were DC series motors (the armature and field windings were connected in series, as is normal for variable-speed DC motors) with 4 main and 4 auxiliary poles and wavy armature windings. The <b>motor's</b> <b>clamp</b> voltage was 1500 V, and the insulation was designed for 3000 V (which gave a 2-fold safety margin). Unlike locomotive traction motors, these motors normally operated in weak field, with maximum field strength used only during acceleration. The motors are self-cooling (the cooling fan is fixed on the motor's output shaft); the cooling air is taken in through air intakes above the passenger doors.|$|R
50|$|For the clock, {{the work}} {{consisted}} of a RPH50C motor and Junior winder weighing approximately 16 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 10 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and chain adjuster. For the strike, the installation {{consisted of a}} RPH50AC motor and Mark II winder weighing approximately 40 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 35 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and chain adjuster. The clock was also cleaned and repainted with the internal dial re-lacquered. The work {{was carried out by}} the inventor of the system, David Gamble of Eaton Socon and consists of a small electric <b>motor</b> <b>clamped</b> to weights and geared with sprockets onto a continuous chain. As the weight operates the clock mechanism by pulling downwards, the electric motor monkey is climbing up the chain at the same speed, so that the weight never has to be cranked back to the top.|$|R
40|$|SummaryATP {{hydrolysis}} by AAA+ ClpX hexamers powers protein unfolding and translocation during ClpXP degradation. Although ClpX is a homohexamer, {{positive and}} negative allosteric interactions partition six potential nucleotide binding sites into three classes with asymmetric properties. Some sites release ATP rapidly, others release ATP slowly, {{and at least two}} sites remain nucleotide free. Recognition of the degradation tag of protein substrates requires ATP binding to one set of sites and ATP or ADP binding to a second set of sites, suggesting a mechanism that allows repeated unfolding attempts without substrate release over multiple ATPase cycles. Our results rule out concerted hydrolysis models involving ClpX 6 •ATP 6 or ClpX 6 •ADP 6 and highlight structures of hexameric AAA+ machines with three or four nucleotides as likely functional states. These studies further emphasize commonalities between distant AAA+ family members, including protein and DNA translocases, helicases, <b>motor</b> proteins, <b>clamp</b> loaders, and other ATP-dependent enzymes...|$|R
40|$|For analysis, {{control design}} {{and testing of}} an electro-mechanically {{actuated}} CVT, a sim-ulation model is built. The model incorporates all major driveline components and the proposed actuation system with servo <b>motor</b> actuation. The <b>clamping</b> forces in the variator are calculated using an explicit formulation of a model based on Coulomb friction. Identifi-cation of the non-linear model using step response analysis shows resonances between 8 - 12 [Hz] and between 20 - 30 [Hz], depending on the ratio. Closed loop bandwidths {{that can be achieved}} are typically 5 [Hz] for ratio control and 20 [Hz] for slip control. Topics / CVT, Modeling, Control...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the casting}} process, the {{finished}} mold spins along its central axis for anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes {{depending upon the}} chosen casting material. Internally a spin casting machine or spin caster consists of a <b>motor</b> and pressure <b>clamping</b> system which holds and positions the mold properly while it spins at a steady rate. These components are placed inside of a machine body which shields against flashing of molten metal or liquid plastic that is inadvertently ejected from the mold during the spinning process. Without the proper containment, hot melted flashing can be a serious hazard to the machine operator and anyone else nearby.|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} integrated electric {{parking brake}} (IEPB) system is introduced and studied. Through analyzing the various working stages, the stages switched IEPB system models are given with the consideration of the friction and system idle inertia. The sliding mode control (SMC) method is adopted to control the clamping force by the widely used <b>motor</b> angle and <b>clamping</b> force relationship method. Based {{on the characteristics of}} the state equations, two sliding surfaces are built to control the motor angle and current, respectively. And in every working stage, the control stability is guaranteed by choosing the control parameters based on Lyapunov theory and SMC reachability. The effectiveness of the proposed control system has been validated in Matlab/Simulink...|$|R
5000|$|In 1950 Mercury {{engineers}} {{came out}} with the Super 10 Hurricane, Model KG-7. This motor was based on previous models KE-7 Lightning and KF-7 Super 10. Upgrades included redesigned connecting rods, upgraded aluminum clamp and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and <b>motor's</b> <b>clamp</b> brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{numerical}} simulations and experimental measurements {{carried out on}} a high power ultrasonic motor are presented. The proposed motor is composed of a annular shaped stator and two cone shaped rotors. The rotors are pressed in contact to {{the borders of the}} inner surface of the stator by means of an opportune pre-stress system. A travelling rotating wave is generated in the stator by three pairs of Bolted Langevin Transducers opportunely shifted both in space and time. Each transducer is designed to excite in the ring radial nonaxisymmetric modes. The <b>motor</b> has been <b>clamped</b> to the housing by using two flanges passing through the middle plane of two transducers. The effective excitation of the travelling wave in the stator, has been simulated with FEM. Experimental measurements were carried out on a manufactured prototype in order to validate numerical results and to evaluate motor performances. Main characteristics of the motor are summarized as follow: weight 0. 67 Kg, working frequency 23. 5 kHz, max rotational speed 116 rpm, static torque 0. 94 Nm...|$|R
40|$|The {{academic}} community is paying {{more and more}} attention {{to the question of the}} individual characteristics of the brain processes which ensure the manual motor programming of movements performed not only by the leading, but also by the subdominant hand. Researchers do not exclude the existence of the particular parameters of the human brain correlating with manual motor activities. This study involved 136 women at the age of 19 – 21 years. The testees were divided into two groups according to high and low values of the EEG modal α-frequency determined individually and in a motionless state. We evaluated the coherence status of the EEG frequency components in the motionless state and during movements performed by fingers of the subdominant (left) hand in response to rhythmic sound signals. The testing stages involved the sequential execution of <b>motor</b> tasks including <b>clamping</b> and unclamping performed by the fingers of the subdominant hand (such as grasping movements) without effort. The testees also performed fingering (a manual response to each stimulus) at in different times and not by all the fingers of the hand simultaneously, but separately, one by one, in a given sequence). Clamping and unclamping was executed by the fingers subject to power loading the (additional load on the fingers being 10 H). Execution of manual movements by means of the subdominant hand in response to the sensory signals was accompanied by an increase in coherence in the EEG frequency components, especially in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortexes of the central areas. Women with a low individual α-rate of such a regularity had significantly increased scores at the high (α 3 -, β-) frequencies of the EEG spectrum. At the same time, women in both groups mainly showed a decrease in the coherence coefficients of θ-, α 1 - and α 3 -activity in the frontal cortex leads in terms of the execution of the sequential finger movements and movements under power loading. The analysis of differences proved that women with a low IαF had relatively higher coherence of the EEG frequency components in the frontal lobes. However, relatively higher frequency components of EEG coherence in the central, posterior temporal and parietal leads were set in women with high IαF. Changes in cortical activity were established during different movements performed by fingers of the subdominant hand, namely, grasping movements of common occurrence, successive movements and movements under power loading. They differ from each other in their low specificity. Thus, the factor of motor performance of tests by means of the subdominant hand had obviously more decisive importance in the nature of the organization of brain activity than for the actual specifics of manual movements...|$|R
