5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concept. Tillich used {{the example of a}} national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information of the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> word.

For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra.

5|$|The <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reconstructed root is {{conventionally}} {{that of a}} verb; {{the terms}} root and verbal root are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from {{a limited number of}} so-called root nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in verbal inflection through well-established morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their meanings are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in the meanings of reflexes in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verbal roots via suffixes and ablaut.|$|E
40|$|There {{is nothing}} {{absolute}} in this world. However, this study could prove that vagueness is inherit {{in the nature}} of language. Vagueness exists in today's newspapers. Concerning this situation and so far there has been no thesis discussing vagueness in newspapers, the researcher could find that vagueness in newspapers is an interesting topic to be further discussed. Moreover, vagueness in newspapers can be used as an instrument to determine the quality of the newspapers. Vagueness is considered as an uncertain, unclear, or imprecise thing which is lack of specification. Moreover, vagueness should be avoided in communicating news since its existence causes misunderstanding among the readers. Driven by her curiousity to know more about vagueness in the writing of news, the researcher formulated two questions, "What kinds of vagueness are found in politics, social-affairs, and economics news in the first pages of Jawa Pos newspaper during the May- 2000 edition?, and, "How is the quality of Jawa Pos newspaper on May- 2000 in terms of writing politics, social-affairs, and economics news in the first pages viewed from the four kinds of vagueness?, as the research questions of the study. According to Kempson in Semantic Theory, there are four kinds of vagueness, namely referential vagueness, indeterminacy <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item or phrase, lack of specification in the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item, and the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item involves the disjunction of different interpretations. Depending on these kinds of vagueness, the researcher could find kinds <b>of</b> vagueness in <b>a</b> newspaper and judge its quality concerning its ability avoiding vagueness. In line with this case, this study analyzed the news on politics, social-affairs, and economics of the first pages of Jawa Pos newspaper during the edition of May 2000, to find the vagueness contained in the news and to judge the quality of the newspaper under study. The vagueness found was then categorized into referential vagueness, indeterminacy <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item or phrase, lack of specification in the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item, and the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item involves the disjunction of different interpretations. After that, the researcher count the percentage of the quality that Jawa Pos acquired. The lower the precentage is, the better the quality of Jawa Pos newspaper would be. The analysis on the news found that there were three kinds of vagueness in the news. They were indeterminacy <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item or phrase, lack of specification in the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item, and the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item involves the disjunction of different interpretations. Out of the 198 news under sudy, only eight of them contained vagueness. There were 2 times of occurrence in the vagueness of indeterminacy <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item or phrase, 4 times of occurrence in the vagueness of lack of specification in the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item, and 2 times of occurrence in the vagueness <b>of</b> the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item involves the disjunction of different interpretations.

5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a syllable is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> word never changes {{depending on the}} stress), but it is partly determined by syllable weight. Words of two syllables are stressed on the first syllable. In words of three or more syllables, the stress is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy, otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable, i.e. the third-to-last syllable. In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, mm, ss, etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable. Quenya has also a secondary accent. The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|E
5|$|In his lifetime, J. R. R. Tolkien {{never ceased}} to {{experiment}} on his constructed languages, {{and they were}} subjected to many revisions. Therefore, Quenya had many grammars with substantial differences between the different stages of its development. During the first conceptual stage of early Quenya c. 1910 to c. 1920, the language was called Elfin in English and Eldarissa in Qenya proper. While its development was a continuous process, Quenya underwent {{a number of major}} revisions in its grammar, mostly in conjugation and the pronominal system. The vocabulary, however, was not subject to sudden or extreme change. Tolkien sometimes changed the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> word, but he almost never discarded it once invented, and he kept on refining its meaning, and countlessly forged new synonyms. Moreover, Elvish etymology was in constant flux. Tolkien delighted in inventing new etymons for his Quenya vocabulary. But after the publication of The Lord of the Rings (finished c. 1949–1950, published in 1954–1955), the grammar rules of Quenya went through very few changes and this version was then defined as late Quenya (c. 1950–1973).|$|E
