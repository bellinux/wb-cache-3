On 8 September he {{destroyed}} a Halberstadt C over Gonnelieu, {{and another on}} 24 September. Early on 28 September 1918 Carbery and his observer Lieutenant J. B. V. Clements were on patrol, and after shooting down a Halberstadt C near Vacquerie-le-Boucq, they saw a German gun crew near Bapaume with a limbered 77 <b>mm</b> gun. A <b>message</b> dropped to British guns for an artillery strike brought no result, so Carbery attacked the German gun with four 25 lb bombs, then strafed the position, scattering the German troops, who abandoned the damaged gun near Achiet-le-Petit. The gun was subsequently captured and presented to Carbery as a war trophy. After the war he donated it to the RAF College at Cranwell, but kept one of the broken wheels, which later became the symbol of 59 Squadron.|$|R

Kuitenkin viime vuosina matkapuhelimen käyttö mediana on lisääntynyt. Matkapuhelimella on ollut myös vaikutusta muihin medioihin. Esimerkiksi {{television}} interaktiivisuus nojaa Suomessa pitkälti tekstiviestintään. Myös monet sanomalehdet julkaisevat tekstiviestipalstoja, koska niiden katsotaan mahdollistavan välittömämmän kontaktin sanomalehden ja yleisön välillä kuin perinteiset mielipidepalstat. Kamerapuhelimien yleistyminen on kiihdyttänyt tätä kehitystrendiä ja usein lukijoiden ottamia kuvia julkaistaan merkittävistäkin uutistapahtumista. Globaalisti tarkasteltuna monissa maissa matkapuhelin on ensimmäinen ja ainoa tietoyhteiskuntaväline, jotka on mahdollista hankkia kotitalouteen. Se on usein myös ainoa väline internetin käyttöön. Matkapuhelin on ulottunut lukemattomille elämänalueille ja saanut erikoisiakin piirteitä kuten esimerkiksi puheajan käyttö maksuvälineenä epävakaan valuutan maissa. Matkapuhelimella on omat piirteensä mediana. Matkapuhelinta on käsitelty paljon henkilökohtaisen viestinnän välineenä, vaikka sen käyttö on laajentunut henkilökohtaisen viestinnän ulkopuolelle. Uutisvälineenä matkapuhelinta kuvaavat välittömyys ja nopeus. Matkapuhelinta voitaisiin kehittää kriisitiedottamisen välineenä, mikä edellyttäisi yhteistyötä viranomaisten ja palveluiden kehittäjien välillä. Toisaalta tekstiviestiuutisiin liittyy tietty epäluotettavuus, jos tekstiviestin lähde ei ole todennettavissa. Luotettavuusongelmiin voidaan kuitenkin löytää teknisiä ratkaisuja. Väitöskirja käsittelee matkapuhelimen nopeaa omaksumista suomalaisten arkeen ja sen kehittymistä mediavälineenä. Aineisto koostuu mm. 1600 eri-ikäisen suomalaisen haastatteluista, mediapäiväkirjoista ja valokuvamateriaaleista, kuten kamerakännykkäkuvista. Lisäksi kenttätutkimuksien avulla on kerätty lokitietoa erilaisten palveluiden kuten mobiili-television käytöstä. The {{mobile phone}} - a medium in itself In media studies the mobile phone has been {{perceived as a}} sub-media to traditional media. As a medium {{it has its own}} specific characteristics and social functions, although its uses may vary in different contexts and cultures. However, this argument {{does not mean that the}} mobile phone is a medium without user involvements. The role of user innovations has been important in constructing the mobile phone´s role in the media field: for instance, text messaging has brought a new kind of social interaction and media form with it. Indeed, the mobile phone has influenced the ways in which we can interact with other media. The mobile phone is located between personal, social and mass media, and can serve personal, peer-to-peer and mass communication purposes in different communications situations. The mobile phone is not only a developing tool for citizenship journalism and participatory media making, but also a channel between traditional and new media, as it, in some cases enables the interactivity of television. Text messaging has been incorporated into television and, in some cases, also into newspapers. It seems that the mobile phone as a personal and ubiquitous technology may lower the threshold for participating in media making. The role of the mobile phone as a tool in digital storytelling has become more important as the number of reader´s own photographs as news material in newspapers has increased. The newspaper offices and other media have to find a solution for how to act with the increasing content produced by their audience; for instance, how to find the important news and verify the reliability and originality of the material. Yet, the physical user interface of the mobile phone is quite different from other media. This means that in the media production stage, the media content has to be tailored so that it can be accessed with a mobile phone and read on their small-screen user interfaces. Currently, there are problems related to the immature technology, such as mobile web browsing problems. Usability issues regarding small-screen user interfaces are particularly important. The mobile phone enables an instantaneous news, information and discussion channel for the mass media. Indeed, the role of the mobile phone in participatory media making could be further developed in media companies. Furthermore, the possibilities of mobile phones are not yet fully utilized in crisis communication. More likely, the role of the mobile phone as an interactive link between the personal user and social and mass media will increase in the future. The dissertation examines the integration of the mobile phone into every day life as a communication device and as media. It focuses on the uses of the mobile phone as a pervasive multimedia tool and its relationship to other media in the changing media landscape. The empirical material of the dissertation consists of 1, 600 interviews of Finnish people conducted between 1997 and 2007. The research sample includes teenagers, young adults, families and senior citizens from different socio-economic backgrounds. In addition, media diaries and photographic materials, such as 1200 <b>mms</b> <b>messages</b> were collected. Log data was collected to reveal the time and duration of actual occurrences of mobile media service such as mobile TV use...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of botnets {{represents}} the greatest computer security threat facing individuals and corporations today. Fuelled by financial incentives and readily available source code, malware authors pursue aggressively the development of newer modules and the exploitation of code into these bots. For an organization, internal bot infections can have serious repercussions, including the loss of man hours and downtime. The average cost of such incidents runs into {{tens of thousands of}} dollars [1]. An early warning system that alerts on and captures bot-like activity in the internal network can be a big help in containing and isolating sources of infection. Having a controlled worm replication environment available in-house can also be helpful, allowing for the quick evaluation of captured worm samples and speedy implementation of countermeasures. This article describes the process of setting up an IRC honeypot on the network – using minimal resources and requiring little maintenance – which can then be used as an early warning system for botnet activity. We also discuss using the IRC honeypot to gain control of infected machines and remove bots from infected machines. BACKGROUND Bots have developed IM (instant <b>messaging),</b> <b>MM</b> (mass-mailing) and P 2 P (peer-to-peer sharing) capabilities. They also drop rootkits in order to conceal their presence on infected systems. Once a network is infected, cleaning can be difficult for the following reasons: If machines are unpatched, a cleaning tool or an anti-virus program is not going to be of much help. Reinfection will occur almost immediately as long as there are other infected machines on the network. The volume of network traffic created by bots makes it impossible for an administrator to perform a Windows update on affected machines. Bots tend to kill AV and firewall processes, which makes cleaning a system difficult, even with updated signatures, as the AV is killed at launch. Bots modify registry entries so they remain active even when the infected machine is booted in Windows safe mode...|$|R
40|$|Let us {{consider}} {{a system in}} which a group of entities have all the same encyption exponent e, but, each entity has a distinct modulus. If an entity A wishes to send the same message m to three entities whose public moduli are n 1, n 2, and n 3, and whose encryption exponents are e = 3, then A would send ci = m mod ni, i = 1, 2, 3. Notice that by definition it must be m < ni, i = 1, 2, 3, and thus m 3 < n 1 n 2 n 3. Furthermore, if moduli are pairwise prime (which is very likely), an eavesdropper 1 observing c 1, c 2, and c 3 can apply the CRT (using the Gauss’s algorithm) to find a solution x, 0 ≤ x ≤ n 1 n 2 n 3, to x ≡ c 1 (modn 1) x ≡ c 2 (modn 2) x ≡ c 3 (modn 3). (1) The CRT guarantees that x = m 3 (modn 1 n 2 n 3). As m 3 < n 1 n 2 n 3, then x = m 3. It follows that the eavesdropper can recover m by computing the integer cube root of x. Thus small encryption exponent such as e = 3 should not be used if the same message is sent to many entities. Alternatively, to prevent such an attack a pesudorandomly generated string should be appendend to the plaintext prior to encryption. 1. 2 RSA with CRT Let e, d, and n be, respectively, the encryption exponent, the decryption exponent, and the modulus. Let c a cryptogram obtained by encrypting <b>message</b> <b>m,m</b> < n with e, i. e., c = me mod n. In order to recover m from c, the recipient has to compute m = cd mod n. The same result can be obtained more efficiently using the CRT as follows. Initially, the recipient computes m 1 and m 2 as follows{ m 1 = c d modp m 2 = c d modq (2) 1 A passive adversary...|$|R
