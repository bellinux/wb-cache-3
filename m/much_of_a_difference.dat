500|$|A {{documentary}} on the game and its professional scene was produced by Valve and released in March 2014. Known as Free to Play, the film follows three players during their time at the first International in 2011. American basketball player Jeremy Lin, who was a media sensation at the time, had a guest appearance in the film, where he called the game [...] "a way of life". Lin later compared {{the game and the}} professional gaming scene in general to basketball and other traditional sporting events, saying that there was not <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between the two, while also comparing various NBA all-stars, such as Stephen Curry, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James, to different heroes in the game. Starting in 2016, Valve began producing an episodic documentary series titled True Sight, a spiritual successor to Free to Play. The first three episodes followed the professional teams Evil Geniuses and Fnatic during the Boston Major tournament in late 2016. Two more episodes were released in 2017, focusing on the grand finals of the Kiev Major and The International 2017 tournaments. Valve have also officially endorsed cosplay competitions featuring the game's heroes, which take place during downtime at professional Dota 2 tournaments and feature prize pools of their own. Creation of Dota 2-themed animations and CGI videos, mostly created by the community with Source Filmmaker, also take place. Similar to the cosplay competitions, Valve holds short film contests every year at The International, with winners of the competition also being awarded prize money. In addition, Valve have created free webcomics featuring some of the heroes, further detailing their background lore. A physical collection of the comics was released as Dota 2: The Comic Collection by Dark Horse Comics in August 2017. Some Asian schools and universities, such as the Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation in Malaysia, have held courses on Dota 2, teaching students the fundamentals and core skills to use during the game. Dota 2 has also been a part of traditional multi-sport events, such as under the eSports category of the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games.|$|E
40|$|Objective. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a novel adaptive accessibility framework for Hybrid TV platforms and the user-centred {{approach that is}} being used in its design. It integrates various types of user interface (UI) technologies, supports multimodal interaction, performs adaptation to individual needs and limitations of elderly users, and uses virtual user simulation for efficient UI testing in the design process. Main content. Digital TV has gained importance as an interactive and personalized media terminal, now combining traditional broadcast content with internet and legacy web services. However, the elderly face problems when using these services. The availability of accessible user interfaces and supporting software is very limited. For developers, user-centred design and provision of accessible user interfaces is expensive and time-consuming. In order to support developers we propose <b>a</b> solution comprising <b>of</b> (1) <b>an</b> adaptive software framework and (2) <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> tools to support development, including a simulation tool. The software framework can be integrated in existing applications and provides an API for developers to automatically perform adaptation of user interface input and output data. The simulation tool is able to render simulated perception of elderly users for the developers. Results. The approach presented relies on user modeling identifying the most relevant impairment configurations among users in comprehensive trials. Using the simulation tool, developers can iteratively make modifications in order to optimize their application's UI. Simulation considers models for perception, cognition and motor functions. The resulting design is then executed in a framework where first time users are characterized by a procedure which measures their individual abilities. A user model instance is then the foundation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> multi-modal adaptation module performing input fusion and output fission for various combinations of user interface technologies considering the user impairments and high level events describing the interaction context. As a result, the system selects proper combinations and configurations of available input and output modalities. Conclusion. For elderly users, accessible ICT can make <b>much</b> more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in living quality, by enabling and simplifying participation and inclusion in their surrounding communities. By supporting TV application developers through a design time simulation tool, and a run time adaptive framework, we lay the basis to drastically improve overall accessibility of these applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is {{severely}} affected by HIV/AIDS and conflict. Sexual violence as <b>a</b> weapon <b>of</b> {{war has been}} associated with concerns about heightened HIV incidence among women. Widespread rape by combatants has been documented in Burundi, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Sudan and Uganda. To examine the assertion that widespread rape may not directly increase HIV prevalence at the population level, we built a model to determine the potential impact of varying scenarios of widespread rape on HIV prevalence in the above seven African countries. Discussion Our findings show that even in the most extreme situations, where 15 % of the female population was raped, where HIV prevalence among assailants was 8 times the country population prevalence, and where the HIV transmission rate was highest at 4 times the average high rate, widespread rape increased the absolute HIV prevalence of these countries by only 0. 023 %. These projections support the finding that widespread rape in conflict-affected countries in SSA has not incurred a major direct population-level change in HIV prevalence. However, this must not be interpreted to say that widespread rape does not pose serious problems to women's acquisition <b>of</b> HIV on <b>an</b> individual basis or in specific settings. Furthermore, direct and indirect consequences of sexual violence, such as physical and psychosocial trauma, unwanted pregnancies, and stigma and discrimination cannot be understated. Summary The conclusions of this article do not significantly change current practices in the field from an operational perspective. Proper care and treatment must be provided to every survivor of rape regardless of the epidemiological effects of HIV transmission at the population level. Sexual violence must be treated as a protection issue and not solely a reproductive health and psychosocial issue. It is worth publishing data and conclusions that could be misconstrued and may not make <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> programmatic <b>difference</b> in the field. Data, if collected, analysed and interpreted carefully, help to improve our understanding of complicated and nuanced situations. Ultimately, our understanding of what the outcomes of such interventions can achieve will be more realistic. It also helps decision-makers prioritise their funding and interventions. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{the results of}} the {{estimation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rich dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U. S. economy with both stochastic volatility and parameter drifting in the Taylor rule. We use the results of this estimation to examine the recent monetary history of the U. S. and to interpret, through this lens, the sources of {{the rise and fall of}} the great American inflation from the late 1960 s to the early 1980 s and of the great moderation of business cycle fluctuations between 1984 and 2007. Our main findings are that while there is strong evidence of changes in monetary policy during Volcker’s tenure at the Fed, those changes contributed little to the great moderation. Instead, changes in the volatility of structural shocks account for most of it. Also, while we find that monetary policy was different under Volcker, we do not find <b>much</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> big <b>difference</b> in monetary policy among Burns, Miller, and Greenspan. The difference in aggregate outcomes across these periods is attributed to the time-varying volatility of shocks. The history for inflation is more nuanced, as a more vigorous stand against it would have reduced inflation in the 1970 s, but not completely eliminated it. In addition, we find that volatile shocks (especially those related to aggregate demand) were important contributors to the great American inflation.
