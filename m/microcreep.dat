40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the correlation of the strength of brittle amorphous nonmetallic materials with the defective surface layers and their physical properties. The defective surface layer of materials for optoelectronic and sensors devices consists of abundant structural near-surface defects, which are displaced under action of constant load and thermal fluctuations, reducing the elasticity of the surface layer. <b>Microcreep</b> processes in tested materials can be described by a general equation that is known as the logarithmic <b>microcreep</b> equation. The applicability of this equation for tested optical materials is indicative of the generality of <b>microcreep</b> processes in crystalline and amorphous hard materials. For each grade of polished optical glass, a minimal residual defective layer exists. The parameters of this layer are interrelated with the mechanical properties of glass, such as microhardness and optical strain coefficient, and thermophysical properties, such as thermal diffusivity, sintering temperature, and annealing temperature. The greater are the values of these properties, the less is the concentration of disrupted interatomic bonds. Based on the test results, the corresponding equation, using the parameter E⋅a¹/², for determining the strength of optical silicate glass and glassceramic has been proposed...|$|E

Although {{there are a number of}} potential sources for such dimensional changes, those given major consideration here are applied stresses and residual stresses. Results of room-temperature microyield strength (MYS) and <b>microcreep</b> tests to detect permanent strains associated with both short- and long-duration loading are reported for several engineering materials, including four aluminum alloys (2024, 5456, 6061, and 2014), I 400 beryllium, TZM molybdenum, AZ 31 magnesium, two titanium alloys (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Ti- 5 Al- 2. 5 Sn), 321 stainless steel, a graphite/epoxy composite, and low-expansion glass ceramics. The data indicate that: metallic materials have no true elastic limit; the MYS cannot be predicted reliably from, and is appreciably less than, the conventional yield strength: significant <b>microcreep</b> and stress relaxation can occur at stresses somewhat below the MYS...|$|E

For the melt-bearing materials, superimposed upon the high-temperature background is a dissipation peak whose height varies systematically with melt fraction that {{is attributed to}} elastically accommodated grain-boundary sliding facilitated by the rounding of grain edges at melt-filled triple junctions. The melt-free materials display only the high-temperature background dissipation associated with transient diffusional creep—elastically accommodated sliding evidently being inhibited by their tight grain-edge intersections. These and similar observations for other ceramic materials require that the classic theory of grain-boundary sliding be revisited and suitably modified...|$|E
40|$|Hardness {{together}} with abrasivity is quite {{often used in}} the field of wear resistance as the criteria for judging surfaces of the alloys, castings, hardfacings and overlays. This research is devoted to the investigation of microhardness phenomena of poly (ethylene terephatalate) (PET) blends with polyolefins and thermoplastic elastomers. The effect of radiation modification and chemical compatibilization (polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride) on the microdeformative and structural properties of the investigated compositions was determined. It was concluded that micromechanical properties of the investigated compositions – especially those with higher PET content – were strongly dependent from the crystallinity of polyester. By increasing PET content in the investigated multiphase systems universal microhardness and microhardness modulus increased, but <b>microcreep</b> decreased, that allowed assume that wear resistance of the compositions also increased. Besides it was found out {{that as a result of}} radiation modification microhardness of the investigated compositions increase...|$|E
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} herein of a test program that evaluated the stiffness, accuracy, torque ripple, frictional losses, and torque holding capability of a 16 : 1 ratio, 430 N-m (320 ft-lb) planetary roller drive for a potential space vehicle actuator application. The drive's planet roller supporting structure and bearings {{were found to be}} the largest contributors to overall drive compliance, accounting {{for more than half of}} the total. In comparison, the traction roller contacts themselves contributed only nine percent of the drive's compliance based on an experimentally verified stiffness model. The drive exhibited no backlash although 8 arc sec of hysteresis deflection were recorded due to <b>microcreep</b> within the contact under torque load. Because of these load-dependent displacements, some form of feedback control would be required for arc second positioning applications. Torque ripple tests showed the drive to be extremely smooth, actually providing some damping of input torsional oscillations. The drive also demonstrated the ability to hold static torque with drifts of 7 arc sec or less over a 24 hr period at 35 percent of full load...|$|E
40|$|Molybdenum single {{crystals}} 1 / 8 inch {{in diameter}} were prepared by a zone-melting technique. Crystals were tested in tension in a special creep machine using a very sensitive capacitance extensometer. Flow stress was measured on an Instron machine. <b>Microcreep</b> of the crystals was studied at stresses below half the macroscopic flow stress in the temperature range 200 ° to 300 °K. at resolved shear strains of below 5 %. The creep following addition of a stress increment {{was found to have}} two parts. In the initial portion the creep rate decreased rapidly, but approached a constant rate in from one to ten minutes. The stresses used produced constant creep rates in the range 10 - 9 to 10 - 6 sec. - 1. The effect of temperature, strain, and effective stress on that rate was studied. The effective stress is the externally applied stress minus the internal back-stress. The internal stress was measured by finding the stress at which forward creep balanced backward strain recovery. The constant creep rate, following the initial creep, obeyed an equation of the form A sin h(v times T times * over K times T) as predicted by Alefeld and others for creep at low effective stresses. The activation volume v was found to be in the range 15 to 40 b 3, decreasing with strain and decreasing at lower temperatures. The parameter A contains the number of activable dislocation segments. The increase of A with strain was proportional to the increase of dislocation density as reported by Lawley and Gaigher. From the temperature dependence of the parameter A, the activation energy for the constant rate <b>microcreep</b> was found to be on the order of 0. 1 ev. Results indicate that higher values obtained by other investigators for deformation of b. c. c. metals arises from a neglect of the change of the internal stress. The internal stress was found to rise strongly at low temperature with the same temperature dependence as that of the macroscopic flow stress. Extrapolation showed the internal stress should approach zero at 360 °K. which is {{the point at which the}} flow stress of molybdenum has been found to become temperature independent. The internal stress did not appear to be an innate property of the b. c. c. lattice, but developed during small amounts of strain. Indications were found that the internal stress then decreases after the material is unloaded or during a return of the material to higher temperature. No detailed model for the creep process or for the recovery of the internal stress is presented. However, it is thought that cross-slip of screw dislocations plays an important role. It was concluded that the strong temperature dependence of the flow stress reflects a very high rate of work-hardening which strongly increases the internal stress during strains of 10 - 3 or less...|$|E
40|$|Single {{crystals}} of 99. 97 % pure magnesium {{were grown}} by the Bridgman technique. A very sensitive capacitance strain gage {{was employed to}} observe <b>microcreep</b> in these crystals at temperatures from 77 ° to 300 °K. The microstrain-time results at a constant applied stress for all temperatures within this range were found to fit the empirical equation where I is the resolved shear microstrain, t is time and oc and A are constants. The constant A {{did not appear to}} be a function of temperature. Although A did seem to vary with the load increment, this dependence was not well defined by the observed results. The constant infinity was a function of several parameters but it seemed to be best described experimentally as proportional to the total strain during an incremental creep curve. The effective activation volume is defined where Ta is the resolved shear stress, k is Boltzman's constant and T is the absolute temperature in °K. The effective activation volume was found to be independent of applied stress. It was proportional to temperature such that v* = 2. 38 x 10 - 21 T cm 3 for an ultrahigh purity specimen and v* = 2. 28 x 10 - 21 T cm 3 for an alloyed crystal containing 0. 046 % Al. Internal stress was measured by experimentally finding the applied stress at which the forward creep balances the backward strain recovery. It was found to be 93 % of the applied stress...|$|E
