500|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with The Big Issue Gruff Rhys claimed {{that some of}} the lyrics to the song are based on Tony Blair's speech at the Labour Party Conference in 2004, in particular his opening line 'a radical new vision is needed': [...] "I've nicked that wholesale, but I am offering a radical new vision whereas he wasn't. He was offering a 19th century imperialist vision and [...] "Lazer Beam" [...] offers an end to Hollywood romantic comedies and imperial colonialist bastards". According to guitarist Huw Bunford the song is [...] "about making your own reality": [...] "Today's reality is insane so we may as well <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>own.</b> It's about aliens coming down from space and zapping humans with amazing lazer [...] beams that make them intelligent rather than being jerks. It's obviously a highly unlikely scenario".|$|E
500|$|In July 2015, Butters {{revealed}} that the season would feature the Darkforce, which ties to the characters Doctor Strange and Marcus Daniels, the latter having appeared in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In January 2016, Fazekas elaborated, saying that the Darkforce, known as Zero Matter in the series, {{is the result of}} a nuclear test gone wrong by Isodyne Energy. Looking to the history of the Darkforce in the comics, Fazekas and Butters [...] "were able to select what we liked and sort of <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> rules as to what it does, how it operates, and who it affects in our world." [...] The producers tried to take a scientific approach to the explanation of the Zero Matter, consulting with theoretical physicist Clifford Johnson to help ground it in science. Johnson provided the science equations seen on blackboards throughout the season, as well as real world reference for the Zero Matter containment systems. The showrunners also conversed with Eric Carroll at Marvel Studios to ensure anything they were doing with the Darkforce would not contradict the Doctor Strange script, and to see if they could destroy Howard Stark's hover car, which was originally seen as a prototype in Captain America: The First Avenger. The mention in the season finale of the land Stark owns in Malibu is a reference to what will become the location for the home of his son, Tony, in the MCU films.|$|E
500|$|The {{team working}} on the film {{commuted}} between the project and the series, pushing both to scheduling extremes (changes to Bigger, Longer & Uncut were made as late as two weeks before its release) and fighting constantly with Paramount. [...] "They wanted a Disney kind of trailer. We said no. They put together a totally un-South Park MTV video for the song 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?'. We had to go <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> version." [...] Paramount's first trailer for the film advertised it, according to Parker, as [...] "the laughiest movie of the summer", and promoted {{it in a way}} that South Park [...] "was completely against". Parker and Stone told the studio of their dissatisfaction with the trailer, and upon the creation of a second trailer with minimal changes, the two broke the videocassette in half and sent it back in its original envelope. [...] "It was war," [...] said Stone in 2000. [...] "They were saying, 'Are you telling us how to do our job?' And I was going, 'Yes, because you're fucking stupid and you don't know what you're doing.'" [...] In another instance, Paramount took the songs from the film and created a music video to be aired on MTV. In accordance with broadcast standards, the studio cut various [...] "R-rated" [...] parts out and edited it into what Parker described as a [...] "horrible little medley with all humor absent". The studio sent the original tape to Parker and Stone over a weekend, with plans to send it to MTV on Monday to prepare it for airtime beginning Wednesday. Stone instead put the tape in the trunk of his car and went home. Paramount threatened to sue Parker and Stone in response. Parker also noted that the title was an obvious innuendo, and [...] "they (the MPAA) just didn't get it".|$|E
500|$|Sternberg concludes: [...] "This thought-provoking thriller is {{the kind}} of movie that keeps reverberating in the viewer's mind, and each {{iteration}} makes one examine preconceived notions in a different light. Memento is a movie for anyone interested in the workings of memory and, indeed, in what it is that <b>makes</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> reality." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1996 interview, Clinton {{commented on}} the {{relationship}} between government and the private sector, saying: [...] "I just believe that there's got to be a healthy tension among all of our institutions in society, and that the market is the driving force behind our prosperity, our freedom in so many respects to <b>make</b> <b>our</b> lives <b>our</b> <b>own</b> but that it cannot be permitted just to run roughshod over people's lives as well." ...|$|R

500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E

5000|$|The songs consist {{mostly of}} Mou {{sampling}} other musicians' backing tracks. According to Lennox, [...] "It’s like a mix CD with toasting {{over the top}} .... But we <b>make</b> the songs <b>our</b> <b>own</b> because the way we move from track to track is unique.".|$|R

2500|$|According to Farage, {{the smoking}} ban in {{enclosed}} public spaces is [...] "silly and illiberal"; he recommends separate smoking areas {{along the lines}} of some German states. He believes that banning things makes them more attractive to children, and said that [...] "Obesity is killing more people than smoking, you could ban chip shops, you could ban doughnuts. The point is we are big enough and ugly enough to <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> decisions".|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{plight of}} the Karen people, who were forced into slave labour in the {{rainforest}} to build pipelines for oil companies (some of them British), was a tale of human suffering {{that needed to be}} told by any branch of the media that was interested. I handed over all the names and numbers I had, as well as details of the secret route through Thailand to get into Burma. Good girl. Afterwards– and not for the first time– {{it seemed to me that}} we at The Guardian should be using our resources ourselves. Instead of providing contact numbers for any independent TV company prepared to get on the phone to a journalist, we should <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> films." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 23. We {{are fully}} aware of the {{difficulties}} confronting the public authorities in this matter, especially in the developing countries. In fact, We had in mind the justifiable anxieties which weigh upon them when We published Our encyclical letter Populorum Progressio. But now We join Our voice to that of Our predecessor John XXIII of venerable memory, and We <b>make</b> <b>Our</b> <b>own</b> his words: [...] "No statement of the problem and no solution to it is acceptable which does violence to man's essential dignity; those who propose such solutions base them on an utterly materialistic conception of man himself and his life. The only possible solution to this question is one which envisages the social and economic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human society, and which respects and promotes true human values." [...] No one can, without being grossly unfair, make divine Providence responsible for what clearly seems {{to be the result of}} misguided governmental policies, of an insufficient sense of social justice, of a selfish accumulation of material goods, and finally of a culpable failure to undertake those initiatives and responsibilities which would raise the standard of living of peoples and their children.|$|E

6000|$|... "And if we haven't the money," [...] remarked Euphemia, [...] "it {{would be}} of no earthly use {{to look at the}} book. It would only <b>make</b> us doubt <b>our</b> <b>own</b> calculations. You might as well try to make brick without mortar, as the {{children}} of Israel did." ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{certainly}} true that we must first <b>make</b> a cause <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> egoistic cause, before we can do anything to further it[...] [...] [...] We are communists out of egoism also, and {{it is out of}} egoism that we wish to be human beings, not mere individuals...|$|R
2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were working with students. Then we would <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There was something in Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, I did not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. But I could see he had something special." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Puts me {{in mind of}} {{our trip}} out West," [...] said Tom. [...] "What {{are we going to}} do when night comes on? Go to some ranch, or <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> camp?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, Beth," [...] said Patsy to her cousin, in a businesslike tone, [...] "that we must {{organize}} {{a company and}} <b>make</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> films. Then we can get exactly what we want." ...|$|E
60|$|On the one hand, then, we {{see that}} the notion, of late years uncritically received, that the nebulæ are {{extremely}} remote galaxies of stars like those which <b>make</b> up <b>our</b> <b>own</b> Milky Way, is totally irreconcilable with the facts--involves us in sundry absurdities. On the other hand, {{we see that}} the hypothesis of nebular condensation harmonizes with the most recent results of stellar astronomy: nay more--that it supplies us with an explanation of various appearances which in its absence would be incomprehensible.|$|R
6000|$|... (S. 6.) [...] Another misery {{there is}} in affection, that whom we truly love like [...] ourselves, we forget their looks, nor can our memory retain the idea [...] of their faces; {{and it is no}} wonder: for they are ourselves, and <b>our</b> [...] affection <b>makes</b> their looks <b>our</b> <b>own.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Drama in Education {{can allow}} {{students}} to {{develop an understanding of}} themselves and others. Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear {{is that there is no}} correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. ... In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to <b>make</b> manifest <b>our</b> <b>own</b> subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{complicity}} of {{this notion}} {{is exacerbated by}} observations by experts such as Letty Cottin Pogrebin, a founding editor of Ms. magazine, {{who is said to}} have diagnosed America as having an [...] "epidemic of paedophobia", saying that, [...] "though most of us <b>make</b> exceptions for <b>our</b> <b>own</b> offspring, we do not seem particularly warm-hearted towards other peoples' children".|$|R
