50|$|Sternochetus mangiferae is a weevil {{commonly}} known as the <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> mango stone weevil, or mango weevil. It is a compact weevil typical of the Cryptorhynchinae. It was first described in 1775 in the genus Curculio. The adults are 7.5-9.5 mm long and 4 mm in width.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{species of}} Cryptorhynchinae are {{considered}} agricultural pests, {{such as the}} <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> Sternochetus mangiferae, but {{the great majority of}} species live in primary forests, often on deadwood and are threatened by habitat loss. In Europe, the flightless genus Acalles is most diverse, and restricted to woodlands of long-lasting habitat continuity ...|$|E
50|$|The colour varies {{and they}} may be covered with black, greyish, reddish or {{yellowish}} scales. In Australia adult weevils are dark brown to black with grey markings. When disturbed, adults press their legs to the body, and fit their beak into a ventral groove. Females have an elevated ridge at the pygidial apex while it is rounded in the male. The adults are not strong fliers and are not found far from fallen fruit. New areas are infested by human transport of infested fruit. Eggs are elongated and creamy white and covered by a protective brown coating with two tiny tails at one end. It is widespread and occurs in most countries especially where mangoes are grown. The adult female lays eggs {{on the surface of the}} mango fruit. Larvae and pupae develop inside the fruit and adults emerge, cutting their way out of the seed and pericarp after the fruit falls and decays. Adults enter a diapause until the next fruiting season. <b>Mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> is considered a pest on mangoes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cryptorhynchus mangiferae (F.), has {{prevented}} {{the export of}} mangoes from Hawaii to the U. S. mainland for over 50 years {{because there were no}} approved quarantine treatments to control this pest. Irradiation was explored as a method to prevent adult emergence in, or to sterilize, <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil.</b> Mixed-age mango seed weevils in mangoes were irradiated with target doses of 50, 100, or 300 Gy and held for adult emergence. The 300 Gy treatment (dose range 180 – 310 Gy) did not prevent adult emergence. Emerging adults from the 100 and 300 Gy treatments were lethargic and short-lived, and laid no eggs indicating sterility. An irradiation quar-antine treatment (100 Gy) to sterilize <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> in mangoes has been pro-posed. Approval of this treatment will open U.

40|$|The <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Sternochetus mangiferae (Fabricius), {{is one of}} {{the major}} mango insect pests in {{northern}} Australia. A reasonable level of control can be obtained with insecticide sprays together with orchard sanitation, but the only option available for organic growers is the latter. Weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius), are effective in controlling the main insect pests in citrus, cashew and mango orchards. To determine whether weaver ants, which are usually abundant in non-sprayed mango orchards, have the potential to control the <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> field experiments together with regular monitoring programmes at six orchards in the Northern Territory of Australia were conducted from 2001 to 2003. Data from two conventional orchards showed that the treatment with weaver ants plus soft chemicals produced lower levels of downgraded fruits (< 0. 5 %) compared to the treatment with chemical insecticides (1. 4 - 2. 1 %). In three organic or insecticide-free orchards, fruits were much less damaged on trees with weaver ants (< 1 %) than on trees without the ants (2. 5 - 15. 7 %). In the sixth orchard, that had much higher <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> populations than the others, levels of downgraded fruits were lower on trees with abundant weaver ants than on trees with fewer weaver ants. We conclude that weaver ants are efficient biocontrol agents of the <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> and that for successful control of the pest it is important both to maintain the ants at high levels and to destroy excess fruits...|$|E
40|$|The {{export of}} mangoes from Hawaii is {{prevented}} {{by the presence}} of the <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> (MSW), Cryptorhynchus mangiferae. Adult females oviposit on the surface of young fruit and the first instars burrow through the pulp to the developing seed where they feed and pupate. Larval development takes 20 - 30 d. The long-lived adult leaves the seed after the fruit falls to the ground and decays to find protected places to overseason. Infestation levels can reach 100 % and can vary widely (0 - 100 %) at sites in the same general area, suggesting dispersal is limited. We question three widely held beliefs about MSW relative to its pest status (Pena et al. 1998) : that MSW causes damage to the flesh of the fruit rendering it unmarketable, or at least unappetizing; that MSW infestation can cause premature fruit drop; and that MSW infestation reduces seed germination. (1) In Hawaii and Australia, larval development in the mango occurs entirely in the seed after the newborn larva burrows into the fruit. The path of the neonate through the fruit is indistinct when it first occurs, and later disappears altogther...|$|E

We investigated the phylogenetic relationships and population structures of red and gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> populations collected {{on either side of the}} Rocky Mountains using nuclear 18 S rDNA, mitochondrial ribosomal DNA, and microsatellites. The results showed that the sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevils</b> are sister taxa in a monophyletic clade. No significant relationships attributable to geographic barriers were found. Thirty-three unique mitochondrial 16 S rDNA sequences (haplotypes) were identified and the sequence divergence among haplotypes ranged from 0. 2 to 3. 68 %. Because more individuals per population could be collected for gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> than for red, a more detailed study of population structure was possible for this species. Most of the genetic variation observed in gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> resulted from variation within populations. Contiguous range expansion appeared to be the main mechanism for increased variability within the species. Significant differences were found in analyses of five polymorphic microsatellite loci in four geographically separated field populations from which multiple individuals could be collected. More genetic differences occurred among weevil populations collected from sunflowers along the East-West axis than among weevil populations collected on a North-South axis. The overall results are consistent with current theories concerning the origin of the sunflower. The population represented by haplotype 33 from Texas is likely a new species that evolved independently. The sample size for this species was limited and additional studies are needed. ...|$|R

40|$|There {{are four}} major insect pests attacking achenes of {{sunflower}} in the Great Plains of North America (Charlet et al., 1987); the red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> Smicronyx fulvus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil,</b> S. sordidus LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera: Cochylidae), and the sunflower moth, Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Identification of achenes damaged by larvae {{of these species}} is important for assessment of yield loss caused by each species (Peng and Brewer, 1995). Achenes infested by the gray sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> are easily identified because they are enlarged and protrude above the surrounding achenes on intact sunflower heads and the kernel is entirely consumed (Brewer, 1991). Descriptions of achenes infested by larvae {{of the other three}} species are similar (Carlson, 1967; Oseto and Braness, 1979; McBride and Charlet, 1991) except for the location of feeding/exit holes {{on the surface of the}} achenes infested by the red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> and banded sunflower moth (Charlet and Gross, 1990). The red sunflower <b>seed</b> <b>weevil</b> oviposits in the developing achenes. The larvae feed on the developing kernels and when mature chew emergence holes in the pericarp (hull) (Oseto and Braness, 1979). The banded sunflower moth and sunflower moth oviposit on the bracts and florets. Early instars feed on the pollen and florets, later instars penetrate into achenes and feed on the developing kernels (Charlet et al., 1987, Charlet and Gross, 1990).

Crude methanolic extracts of <b>mango</b> <b>seed</b> kernel were analyzed for the phytochemical constituents. The free radical scavenging activity was determined by 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Antibacterial activity was evaluated by disc diffusion assay with three medically important bacterial pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (MRSA), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Vibrio vulnificus (V. vulnificus). ResultsQualitative phytochemical analysis indicated the presence of important phytochemical compounds such as glycosides, saponins, flavanoids, tannins and alkaloids.
