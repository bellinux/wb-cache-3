40|$|Abstract — Nonlinear <b>mixing</b> <b>model</b> of <b>mixed</b> pixels {{in remote}} sensing {{satellite}} images {{taking into account}} landscape is proposed. Most of linear <b>mixing</b> <b>models</b> of <b>mixed</b> pixels do not work so well because the mixed pixels consist of several ground cover targets in a nonlinear basis essentially. In particular, <b>mixing</b> <b>model</b> should be nonlinear because reflected photons from a ground cover target are scattered with atmospheric continuants and then reflected by the other or same ground cover targets. Therefore, <b>mixing</b> <b>model</b> has to be nonlinear. Monte Carlo Ray Tracing based nonlinear <b>mixing</b> <b>model</b> is proposed and simulated.

Linear <b>mixed</b> <b>models</b> {{are commonly used}} models {{in the analysis of}} correlated data, in which the observed data are grouped according to one or more clustering factors. The selection of covariates, the variance structure and the correlation structure is crucial to the accuracy of both estimation and prediction in linear <b>mixed</b> <b>models.</b> Information criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and the risk inflation criterion are mostly applied to select linear <b>mixed</b> <b>models.</b> Most information criteria penalize an increase in the size of a model through a fixed penalization parameter. In this dissertation, we firstly derive the generalized degrees of freedom for linear <b>mixed</b> <b>models.</b> A resampling technique, data perturbation, is employed to estimate the generalized degrees of freedom of linear <b>mixed</b> <b>models.</b> Further, based upon the generalized degrees of freedom of linear <b>mixed</b> <b>models,</b> we develop an adaptive model selection procedure with a data-adaptive model complexity penalty for selecting linear <b>mixed</b> <b>models.</b> The asymptotic optimality of the adaptive model selection procedure in linear <b>mixed</b> <b>models</b> is shown over a class of information criteria. The performance of the adaptive model selection procedure in linear <b>mixed</b> <b>models</b> is studied by numerical simulations.

The basis of the organization established in July 1926 will prevail, although with diverse and successive adjustments, until the 1990s. The Swiss inspired concept of a militia army is abandoned and replaced by a <b>mixed</b> <b>model,</b> capable of allowing the rapid engagement of operational forces, which had proven difficult with the previous model. Two types of units came into existence. The first were the territorial units spread across the territory, including the regiments of the several arms, that continued to serve mainly as training and mobilization centers, with a small permanent staff of professional officers and NCOs responsible for the annual training of conscripts. The second type were units permanently maintained in a higher state of readiness, with their effectives in time of peace being almost identical of those planned for war. These last units consisted mainly in 10 border defense reinforced battalions (with the title caçadores being recovered to designate these units) and in two brigades of cavalry. No divisions or other field formations, besides the two cavalry brigades, would be permanently maintained active, only being raised if needed. The number of military units was decreased, the territorial divisions were abolished, with the territory of Continental Portugal becoming divided in four military regions and in the Military Government of Lisbon (this one having both the role of military region {{and the role of the}} abolished Lisbon Entrenched Camp command).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper studies a {{nonlinear}} <b>mixing</b> <b>model</b> for hyperspectral image unmixing and nonlinearity detection. The proposed model {{assumes that}} the pixel reflectances are nonlinear functions of pure spectral components contaminated by an additive white Gaussian noise. These nonlinear functions are approximated by polynomials leading to a polynomial post-nonlinear <b>mixing</b> <b>model.</b> We have shown in a previous paper that the parameters involved in the resulting model can be estimated using least squares methods. A generalized likelihood ratio test based on the estimator of the nonlinearity parameter is proposed to decide whether a pixel of the image results from the commonly used linear <b>mixing</b> <b>model</b> or from a more general nonlinear <b>mixing</b> <b>model.</b> To compute the test statistic associated with the nonlinearity detection, we propose to approximate the variance of the estimated nonlinearity parameter by its constrained Cramér–Rao bound. The performance of the detection strategy is evaluated via simulations conducted on synthetic and real data. More precisely, synthetic data have been generated according to the standard linear <b>mixing</b> <b>model</b> and three nonlinear models from the literature. The real data investigated {{in this study are}} extracted from the Cuprite image, which shows that some minerals seem to be nonlinearly mixed in this image.

Current models estimate probability distributions of source contributions, have user friendly interfaces, and incorporate complexities such as variability in isotope signatures, discrimination factors, hierarchical variance structure, covariates, and concentration 4 dependence. For proper implementation of <b>mixing</b> <b>models,</b> we offer the following suggestions. First, <b>mixing</b> <b>models</b> can only {{be as good as}} the study and data. Studies should have clear questions, be informed by knowledge of the system, and have strong sampling designs to effectively characterize isotope variability of consumers and resources on proper spatio 4 temporal scales.

Decisions about source grouping or incorporation of concentration 4 dependence can influence results.
