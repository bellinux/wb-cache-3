He was not an average man. Yet such men as he are reared here and there in every generation of our peasant artisans--with an inheritance of affections nurtured by a simple family life of common need and common industry, and an inheritance of faculties trained in skilful courageous labour: they make their way upwards, rarely as geniuses, most commonly as painstaking honest men, with the skill and conscience to do well the tasks that lie before them. Their lives have no discernible echo beyond the neighbourhood where they dwelt, but you are almost sure to find there some good piece of road, some building, some application of mineral produce, some improvement in farming practice, some reform of parish abuses, with which their names are associated by one or two generations after them. Their employers were the richer for them, the work of their hands has worn well, and the work of their brains has guided well the hands of other men. They went about in their youth in flannel or paper caps, in coats black with coal-dust or streaked with lime and red paint; in old age their white hairs are seen in a place of honour at church and at market, and they tell their well-dressed sons and daughters, seated round the bright hearth on winter evenings, how pleased they were when they first earned their twopence a-day. Others there are who die poor and never put off the workman's coal on weekdays. They have not had the art of getting rich, but they are men of trust, and when they die before the work is all out of them, it is as if some <b>main</b> <b>screw</b> had got loose in a machine; the master who employed them says, [...] "Where shall I find their like?" ...|$|E

50|$|Guard Cooke was in {{the rear}} brake van of the train, {{together}} with six passengers, who {{should not have been}} there. Cooke and his passengers were drinking and smoking in the van, and Cooke invited passengers to apply the van handbrake. Correct operation of the brake was necessary, not only to slow the train, but also to control the tension in the carriage couplings. There were three separate breakages of couplings ahead of the rear brake van on the outward journey: at Brettell Lane and Hagley both the <b>main</b> <b>screw</b> couplings and side safety chains failed, and at Droitwich it was found that another screw coupling was failed, but its associated side chains had held. Cooke made temporary repairs on all three occasions. To repair the first two breakages, Cooke managed to find spare three-link or screw couplings; but at Droitwich he was only able to patch up the side chains, which were not designed to hold the full weight of a train. On arrival at Worcester, the train was examined by the inspector of rolling stock: the repaired/replaced side chains were replaced by four-link goods couplings before the return journey, but no attempt was made to repair or replace failed centre couplings: these were difficult to access, and the inspector considered that a re-made screw coupling was weaker than the goods couplings (which he considered adequate).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{constantly}} rising {{energy demand}} and {{the depletion of}} fossil fuel resources currently represent the main concerns for global energy sustainability, alongside environmental issues. Low-grade energy sources have moved into the limelight and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology {{is well known for}} its suitability to recover waste heat. The optimization of the expansion process of an ORC system is crucial in order to maximize the power output, to increase the overall efficiency, and to obtain an economically feasible machine. Scroll, reciprocating, single screw, twin-screw and vane-type expanders are the main technologies. Screw expanders are particularly suited for low-grade heat recovery. The advantages of single screw technology over twin-screw include the balanced loading of the <b>main</b> <b>screw,</b> long working life, high volumetric efficiency, low leakage, low noise, low vibration, and a simplified configuration. In this paper, a detailed geometry-based model of a single screw expander is presented. The model is based on a rotation-dependent function that completely describes the geometry of the screw rotor and the engaging surfaces of the star wheels. A computation of the swept volume at each angular step and of the inlet conditions leads to a solution of the system of differential equations governing the thermodynamics of the expansion process. The model considers heat losses, oil-flooded mixing and leakage paths and permits the investigation of the impact of design modifications on the expander performance.

40|$|The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) {{system is}} {{considered}} one of the leading technologies for waste heat recovery applications. In order to increase the overall efficiency, design improvements and optimization analyses are necessary. The expander is the key component to convert the thermal energy in useful work. Several volumetric and turbine expanders have been investigated. Among volumetric machines, scroll, twin-screw and vane-type expanders are the main technologies. Recently, a number of experimental studies on single screw expanders (SSE) have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of employing such machine as an ORC expander. The single screw configuration presents a number of advantages over twin screw including balanced loading of the <b>main</b> <b>screw,</b> long working life, high volumetric efficiency. In this paper, a detailed geometry-based multi-chamber model of a single screw expander is presented. The model is based on a rotation-dependent function that entirely describes the geometry of the engaging surface between the screw rotor and the starwheels. The computation of the swept volume at each angular step and the inlet conditions, enables the solution of the system of differential equations governing the thermodynamic problem. The level of details of the model, which includes heat transfer losses, oil-flooded mixing and leakage paths calculation, allows the investigation of the impact of design changes to the expander machine performance. The validation of the proposed model is realized with experimental data obtained from an ORC set up which employs a SSE and Solkatherm (SES 36) as working fluid. Test results have shown a maximum isentropic efficiency of 67 % at 3000 rpm. The model predicts the mass flow rate and the power output within ± 10 % and ± 15 % respectively...|$|E

40|$|A {{screw press}} machine {{is used to}} {{compress}} the fruit mash between the <b>main</b> <b>screw</b> and the travelling cones to extract the palm oil. The position of the cones against the discharge end of the press cage determines the pressure. The pressure controller {{is an important factor}} in determining the oil loss and nut breakages. A conventional control system which is the band control system, uses a kilowatt meter as a controller in adjusting the press cage pressure. However, the screw press machine can be improved in order to reduce the oil loss and nut breakages. Not much researches has been conducted on reducing the nut breakages as well as oil loss. Therefore, the objective of this study is to minimise the oil loss and broken nuts. The objective can be achieved through upgrading the screw press machine and the use of fuzzy control system. During the course of this research project, the hydraulic system of the screw press machine was upgraded by utilising the proportional pressure relief valve. A current transducer was used to measure the motor current load. A ladder diagram program and fuzzy logic algorithm were written and downloaded into the programmable logic control to regulate the press cage pressure. For comparison purposes, a band control system and fuzzy control system were implemented in the control environment. The performances of both systems were compared in a number of tests. The first test was the oscillation of motor current load with the performance of fuzzy control system that was stabilised at 8. 33 mA. This is due to the reaction of fuzzy pressure controller in regulating the proportional pressure relief valve. The fuzzy control system is able to reduce 1. 20 % of oil loss compared to tiie band control system. The percentage of the broken nuts of the fuzzy control system was reduced by 3. 55 %. This implies that the objective to reduce the breakages is achieved. Thus, the screw press machine with a fuzzy control system is found to be significantly more efficient than the band control system...|$|E

40|$|Multiphase pumping with twin-screw pumps is a {{relatively}} new technology that has been proven successful in a variety of field applications. It has three advantages such as less environment pollution, few separation equipments and more convenient operation than the conventional system. Despite many advantages of this technology, some problems have been encountered when operating under conditions with high gas volume fractions (GVF). While twin-screw multiphase pump is operating under high GVF conditions, the inner temperature of the pump increases obviously. The clearances between rotors change greatly and influence the volumetric efficiency of the twin-screw multiphase pumps. In some severe conditions, it may cause the pump damage. In this paper, the actual force and thermal boundary conditions are proposed through further investigations of pressure distributions and heat transfer. And then the screw rotor deformation and temperature field are calculated under different GVF conditions with ANSYS software. The results indicate that the <b>main</b> deformation of <b>screw</b> rotors is thermal deformation and the maximum radial deformation occurs {{on the top of the}} rotor in the discharge port.

40|$|Load-bearing cold-formed steel (CFS) walls {{sheathed}} {{with double}} layers of gypsum plasterboard {{on both sides}} have demonstrated good fire resistance and attracted increasing interest for use in mid-rise CFS structures. As the <b>main</b> connection method, <b>screw</b> connections between CFS and gypsum sheathing {{play an important role}} in both the structural design and fire resistance of this wall system. However, studies on the mechanical behavior of screw connections with double-layer gypsum sheathing are still limited. In this study, 200 monotonic tests of screw connections with single- or double-layer gypsum sheathing at both ambient and elevated temperatures were conducted. The failure of screw connections with double-layer gypsum sheathing in shear was different from that of single-layer gypsum sheathing connections at ambient temperature, and it could be described as the breaking of the loaded sheathing edge combined with significant screw tilting and the loaded sheathing edge flexing fracture. However, the screw tilting and flexing fracture of the loaded sheathing edge gradually disappear at elevated temperatures. In addition, the influence of the loaded edge distance, double-layer sheathing and elevated temperatures is discussed in detail with clear conclusions. A unified design formula for the shear strength of screw connections with gypsum sheathing is proposed for ambient and elevated temperatures with adequate accuracy. A simplified load–displacement model with the post-peak branch is developed to evaluate the load–displacement response of screw connections with gypsum sheathing at ambient and elevated temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the influence of covert motor processes in the recognition of visual events, we compared the response times (RT) in two similar tasks, one involving a to-be-grasped object and the other involving a to-be-observed object. In one task, we asked right-handed subjects to tell whether an observed screwdriver presented in different orientations and rotating on its <b>main</b> axis was <b>screwing</b> or unscrewing (screwdriver task). In the other task the visual stimuli were precisely the same, but subjects had {{to think of the}} screwdriver as being the pivot pin of an imagined clock, turning its hands from the back (clock task). They had to tell whether the imagined clock hands were moving clockwise or counterclockwise. In the screwdriver task, a prominent right-left asymmetry consisting of higher RTs for stimulus orientations awkward for a right-hand grip was present, suggesting that subjects adopted a strategy based upon mentally simulating the grabbing of the screwdriver handle with the dominant hand. Consistent with the hypothesis that the crucial factor that triggers these motor imagery processes is the “graspability ” of the relevant object in the scene, in the clock task the right-left asymmetry disappeared in most subjects, RTs mirroring the symmetry of the visual stimuli. These findings indicate that, when interpreting a scene involving a to-be-grasped object, a strategy based upon motor imagery (mental grasping), probably unfolding procedural knowledge, is activated. When the scene involves a to-be-observed object, the recognition task can be accomplished through other, possibly visual, strategies. C. de'Sperati (✉...|$|R
30|$|The occlusal force {{does not}} load {{only on the}} screw. The {{internal}} conical connection interface also helps to transfer and distribute the loading force to the implant [13]. The axial compressive component of occlusal force during oral function causes axial displacement of the abutment to the implant connection, increasing the frictional resistance and screw joint stability of the dental implant [7, 8]. Three factors {{that may lead to}} the axial displacement of the implant-abutment connection are machining tolerance, the wedge effect, and the settling effect. Firstly, machining tolerance is a dimensional variation characteristic of machined components. The precision of every implant component varies during manufacturing due to machining tolerance [14]. Secondly, the wedge effect occurs when tightening torque or loading force is applied to the abutment [15]. The abutment acts as a wedge transferring the axial force directly to the implant. Lastly, the settling effect occurs when rough spots on the contacting surfaces of the connection are flattened under load [16]. It causes the two surfaces to come closer together and leads to axial displacement. This axial displacement causes the length of the abutment screw to shorten, diminishing the screw preload [17]. The settling effect is the <b>main</b> cause of <b>screw</b> loosening. When the abutment is fastened to the implant body with the abutment screw, a settling phenomenon occurs in which the implant body and the abutment are deformed. Even if fastened at 30 [*]N[*]cm, depending on the implant system, the loosening torque becomes smaller than the 7 to 10 % fastening torque. After 5 [*]min from this point, it is necessary to loosen it twice [18]. The degree of settling depends on the surface roughness, surface hardness, and magnitude of the tightening torque and of the occlusal loading force [16]. On the one hand, the settling effect [17] causes the axial displacement leading to the decrease of the screw preload. On the other hand, the axial displacement causes the cone connection surface adaptation providing frictional resistance and screw-joint stability [7, 8].|$|R

40|$|Biorefinery of {{sunflower}} whole {{plant can}} be conducted with water by thermo-mechano-chemical fractionation in a Clextral BC 45 (France) co-penetrating and co-rotating twin-screw extruder. An extract and a raffinate are produced separately {{and in a}} single continuous step. The arrangement of screw profile makes possible to define three successive zones along the barrel, in which the three unit operations of the aqueous extraction process are taking place. (I) The grinding zone consists of a succession of 10 monolobes paddles, and 5 bilobe paddles. It ensures the conditioning and the grinding of solid matter. (II) The extracting zone begins with water injection. It is composed of a second series of 5 bilobe paddles to mix liquid and solid. (III) The pressing zone {{is the place where}} liquid/solid separation is realized. Screw configuration is then arranged with reversed pitch screws used to place pressure on the liquid/solid mixture, and positioned immediately downstream from a filter section. Representation of liquid/solid transport inside the barrel is performed thanks to (i) the measuring of the filling of each screw element after visual observation, (ii) the characteristics of the corresponding solid, and (iii) the modelling of the contribution of each screw element to the residence time distribution of solid and liquid phases. Consequently, twin-screw extruder can be represented as the association of a grinder, a liquid/solid extractor, and a liquid/solid separator, in which material exchanges are intensified. Thus, it is possible to predict the evolution of mean residence times of liquid and solid in the three zones of twin-screw extruder with the <b>main</b> operating variables: <b>screw</b> rotation speed, and inlet flow rates of whole plant and water. The decrease of both screw rotation speed and inlet flow rate of whole plant, simultaneously with the increase of inlet flow rate of water, causes the increase of liquid to solid ratio in the extracting zone, and the increase of residence time of solid in the pressing zone. These operating conditions (60 rpm for screw rotation speed, 5. 0 kg/h and 20. 3 kg/h for inlet flow rates of whole plant and water, respectively) are favourable to an efficient contact between liquid and solid (8. 2 for liquid to solid ratio), and to the liquid/solid separation (156 sec for residence time of solid inside the separator). Oil yield is then around 55 %, and residual oil content of the cake meal is only 13 % of dry weight. The oil is extracted in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The emulsion stability is ensured at interface by surface-active agents: phospholipids, proteins, and pectins. Extracts are also made up of a hydrophilic phase.
