60|$|And now we {{were seated}} by the brisk fireside of the old farmhouse, the same fire that glimmers so faintly among my reminiscences at the {{beginning}} of this chapter. There we sat, with the snow <b>melting</b> <b>out</b> of our hair and beards, and our faces all ablaze, what with the past inclemency and present warmth. It was, indeed, a right good fire that we found awaiting us, built up of great, rough logs, and knotty limbs, and splintered fragments of an oak-tree, such as farmers are wont to keep for their own hearths, since these crooked and unmanageable boughs could never be measured into merchantable cords for the market. A family of the old Pilgrims might have swung their kettle over precisely such a fire as this, only, no doubt, a bigger one; and, contrasting it with my coal-grate, I felt so much the more that we had transported ourselves a world-wide distance from the system of society that shackled us at breakfast-time.|$|E

The collier kept on talking to her, stretching his bare, grey-black hairy arm across her vision, and pointing with his knotted hand. The thick-wicked tallow candles guttered and smelled. There was a thickness in the air, a sense of dark, fluid presence in the thick atmosphere, the dark, fluid, viscous voice of the collier making a broad-vowelled, clapping sound in her ear. He seemed to linger near her as if he knew--as if he knew--what? Something for ever unknowable and inadmissible, something that belonged purely to the underground: to the slaves who work underground: knowledge humiliated, subjected, but ponderous and inevitable. And still his voice went on clapping in her ear, and still his presence edged near her, and seemed to impinge on her--a smallish, semi-grotesque, grey-obscure figure with a naked brandished forearm: not human: a creature of the subterranean world, melted out like a bat, fluid. She felt herself <b>melting</b> <b>out</b> also, to become a mere vocal ghost, a presence in the thick atmosphere.

60|$|The {{party at}} Villa Pandolfini {{used to sit}} in the garden in the evenings, which Rowland almost always spent with them. Their {{entertainment}} was in the heavily perfumed air, in the dim, far starlight, in the crenelated tower of a neighboring villa, which loomed vaguely above them in the warm darkness, and in such conversation as depressing reflections allowed. Roderick, clad always in white, roamed about like a restless ghost, silent for the most part, but making from time to time a brief observation, characterized by the most fantastic cynicism. Roderick's contributions to the conversation were indeed always so fantastic that, though half the time they wearied him unspeakably, Rowland made an effort to treat them humorously. With Rowland alone Roderick talked a great deal more; often about things related to his own work, or about artistic and aesthetic matters in general. He talked as well as ever, or even better; but his talk always ended in a torrent of groans and curses. When this current set in, Rowland straightway turned his back or stopped his ears, and Roderick now witnessed these movements with perfect indifference. When the latter was absent from the star-lit circle in the garden, as often happened, Rowland knew nothing of his whereabouts; he supposed him to be in Florence, but he never learned what he did there. All this was not enlivening, but with an even, muffled tread the days followed each other, and brought the month of August to a close. One particular evening at this time was most enchanting; there was a perfect moon, looking so extraordinarily large that it made everything its light fell upon seem small; the heat was tempered by a soft west wind, and the wind was laden with the odors of the early harvest. The hills, the vale of the Arno, the shrunken river, the domes of Florence, were vaguely effaced by the dense moonshine; they looked as if they were <b>melting</b> <b>out</b> of sight like an exorcised vision. Rowland had found the two ladies alone at the villa, and he had sat with them for an hour. He felt absolutely hushed by the solemn splendor of the scene, but he had risked the remark that, whatever life might yet have in store for either of them, this was a night that they would never forget.|$|E
6000|$|In {{front of}} our house is a broad stretch of grass, dotted with cocoanuts, breadfruits, mangoes, and the strange {{pandanus}} tree. I wish you could have seen them, their lower branches glowing with the rich colours of the fruits hung upon them by Ori and his men, and great heaps lying piled against their roots, {{on the evening of}} our feast. From the bamboo poles that they were carried upon, a pen was made for the ten pigs, and a fowl house for the twenty-three fowls that were among the presents. But there was a day of reckoning at hand. Time after time we ran down to the beach to look for the Casco, until we were in despair. For over a month we had lived in Ori's house, causing him infinite trouble and annoyance, and not even his, at that. Areia (the chief--Areia means the Prince) went to Papeete and came back with a letter to say that more work had to be done upon the Casco, and it might be any time before she could get to Tautira. We had used up all our stores, and had only a few dollars of money left in Tautira, and not very much in Papeete. Could we stand the journey to Papeete, we could not live upon the yacht {{in the midst of the}} workmen, and we had not money enough left to live at an hotel. We were playing cards on the floor, as usual, when this message came, and you can imagine its effect. I knew perfectly well that Rui would force us to stay on with him, but what depressed me the most of all, was the fact of Louis having made brothers with him just before this took place. Had there been a shadow of doubt on our dear Rui's face, I should have fled from before him. Sitting there on the floor waiting for him was too much for my nerves and I burst into tears, upon which the princess wept bitterly. In the meantime the priest had dropped in, so that we had him and Moë, and Areia, as witnesses to our humiliating position. First came Madame Rui, who heard the story, and sat down on the floor in silence, which was very damping for a beginning, and then Ori of Ori, the magnificent, who listened to the tale of the shipwrecked mariners with serious dignity, asking one or two questions, and then spoke to this effect. [...] "You are my brother: all that I have is yours. I know that your food is done, but I can give you plenty of fish and taro. We like you, and wish to have you here. Stay where you are till the Casco comes. Be happy--et ne pleurez pas." [...] Louis dropped his head into his hands and wept, and then we all went up to Rui and shook hands with him and accepted his offer. Madame Rui, who had been silent only as a dutiful wife, that her husband might speak first, poured forth manifold reasons for our staying on as long as we could possibly manage. During all this scene, an attendant of the princess had been sitting on the floor behind us, a baby in his arms, where he had ensconced himself for the purpose of watching the game. He understood nothing of what was going on; we wondered afterwards what he thought of it. Reduced as we were, we still had a few bottles of champagne left. Champagne being an especial weakness of our gigantic friend, it occurred to some one that this was a proper occasion to open a couple of bottles. Louis, the Princess, and I were quite, as the Scotch so well say, [...] "begrutten," [...] Areia's immense eyes were fairly <b>melting</b> <b>out</b> of his head with emotion, the priest was wiping his eyes and blowing his nose: and then for no apparent cause we suddenly fell to drinking and clinking glasses quite merrily: the bewildered attendant clinked and drank too, and then sat down and waited in case there should be any repetition of the drinking part of the performance. And sure enough there was, for in the midst of an animated discussion as to ways and means, Mrs. Stevenson announced that it was St. Andrew's day, so again the attendant clinked and drank with Ori's mad foreigners.|$|E
5000|$|The {{best way}} to control <b>melting</b> <b>out</b> in golf course roughs {{is to use a}} {{resistant}} cultivar. Using cheap common cultivars will make the plant susceptible. Several cultivar names are; 'Avid', 'Empire', 'Everglade', 'Midnight', 'Moonlight', 'Total Eclipse'. [...] Since <b>melting</b> <b>out</b> likes lush, nitrogen-filled plants, making sure there is not a large application of nitrogen in spring is important {{to reduce the risk of}} infection. In turn, a nitrogen-hungry plant is weak, also making it susceptible, so a good fertility plan is key in reducing risk of a <b>melting</b> <b>out</b> outbreak. Water management is another way to help control <b>melting</b> <b>out.</b> There is evidence that keeping thatch moist can reduce sporulation, but keeping leaf wetness down is also important If there is a history of <b>melting</b> <b>out</b> in certain areas. Also it is important to avoid irrigation during cool wet rainy periods. Lastly it is important to have a consistent practice of aeration and topdressing to reduce thatch in the grass.|$|E

40|$|Long term (3 ̆e 30 year) daily snow water {{equivalent}} (SWE) observations enable {{researchers to}} establish relationships between various SWE and hydrograph characteristics. The shape {{and magnitude of}} snowmelt hydrographs in Utah depend predominantly on {{the magnitude of the}} snowpack being melted. As observed elsewhere, years with low snowpacks <b>melt</b> <b>out</b> earlier, have lower peak flows and lower total flow volume than average or high snowpack years, and vice versa for high snowpack years. However, in relation to melt-out dates at SNOTEL sites, a higher proportion of the annual April-July flow in low years is shifted {{toward the end of the}} hydrograph, whereas a larger proportion of flow occurs prior to melt-out in higher snowpack years. This paper examines the timing of peak flow and the proportion and distribution of flow relative to the timing of snowpack <b>melt</b> <b>out</b> at selected watersheds and SNOTEL stations across the state of Utah.

50|$|Turf <b>melting</b> <b>out</b> {{begins as}} black to purple {{spots on the}} leaf blades. These spots {{eventually}} appear on the leaf sheaths. The fungus then begin to move down and invade the crowns and {{the roots of the}} plants. From far away, the turf appears yellow or blackish brown. The colors that appear on the turf directly reflect the nitrogen levels in the plant. When turfgrass has low levels of nitrogen it turns yellow and when it has high nitrogen levels, it turns blackish brown. As the disease progresses, the infected turf becomes thin and brown. These symptoms are related to wilted turf. Unless the turfgrass is properly treated by fungicides, the grass will be replaced by broadleaf weeds and invasive grasses.|$|E
