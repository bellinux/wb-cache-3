2500|$|Given the {{importance}} in Jewish ritual of establishing the accurate timing of monthly and annual times, some futurist writers and researchers have considered whether a [...] "corrected" [...] system of establishing the Hebrew date is required.

What happens instead is that the traditional Hebrew calendar [...] "prematurely" [...] inserts a leap month one year before it [...] "should have been" [...] inserted, where [...] "prematurely" [...] means that the insertion causes the spring equinox to land more than 30 days before the latest acceptable moment, thus causing the calendar to run [...] "one month late" [...] until the time when the leap month [...] "should have been" [...] inserted prior to the following spring.
