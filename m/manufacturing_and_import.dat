50|$|Asbestos {{was banned}} in South Africa in 2008. Prior to this, {{the country was}} one of the global leaders in {{asbestos}} production, and consequently had one of the highest rates of mesothelioma. Regulations to ban asbestos in South Africa occurred in March 2008 under the leadership of Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk. The first draft regulations were announced in November 2005 for public comment and again in September 2007. The regulations prohibited the use, processing, <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>import</b> and export of any asbestos or asbestos-containing materials (ACMs). A grace period of 120 days was allowed to give people or traders currently dealing in asbestos or ACMs to clear their stock. Exemptions would be granted under strict control. The regulations did not prohibit the continued use of asbestos-containing materials that were already in place such as asbestos-cement roof sheets or ceilings, the department was satisfied that there was “no undue risk” and they would be replaced in due time. Penalties for the continued use of asbestos include a fine which would not exceed R100 000 and/or imprisonment of less than ten years. Prior to the regulations' implementation, asbestos had been {{in the process of being}} phased out from as early as 2003. Requests from Zimbabwe and Canada to be excepted from the prohibition were denied. South also terminated all import of asbestos or ACMs from Zimbabwe. South Africa would allow products to pass through its borders while in transit under strict conditions and if registered with the department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. Everite, a building company, supported the government’s ban on imports from Zimbabwe It became an offence to acquire, process, package or repackage, manufacture or distribute these products from after July 28, 2008. Kgalagadi Relief Trust (KRT) chair Brian Gibson stated that asbestos may still be imported into South Africa for research or analysis. Asbestos may also be imported into the country for disposal from Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries that were unable to dispose of the waste themselves.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation was}} undertaken {{of the techniques}} (materials and technologies) used to construct the shell of the New Zealand house (envelope and interior linings) between 1792 and 1982. Using census, <b>manufacturing</b> <b>and</b> <b>import</b> statistics with analysis of local and international archives and publications, principal techniques were selected and documented. A review of local construction and building publications provide a background {{to the development of}} construction education and training, as well as the speed of change. Analysis of census data showed that from 1858 to 1981 the majority of dwelling walls in terms of construction (appearance) were timber, brick, board or concrete, while the structure was timber frame. Analysis of import data for seven materials (galvanised iron, asbestos cement, cement, window glass, wood nails, gypsum and roofing slate) from 1870 to 1965 found the UK was a majority supplier until 1925, except for USA gypsum. For the rest of the period, the UK continued to play a preeminent role with increasing Australian imports and local manufacture. Examination of archival and published information on techniques used for the sub-floor, floor, wall (construction and structure), fenestration, roof and thermal insulation provide an overview of country of orign, decade of arrival, spread of use and, if relevant, reasons for failure. Forty materials (including earth and brick, stone, cement and concrete, timber and ferrous metals) and twenty-four technologies are documented. Revised dates of first NZ use are provided for eight of these e. g. the shift from balloon to platform framing occurred in the early 1880 s rather than 1890 s. Three case studies examine different aspects of the techniques (nails 1860 to 1965, hollow concrete blocks 1904 to 1910 and camerated concrete 1908 to 1920). The research shows that timber was the predominant structural (framing) material from 1792 to 1982. From the 1930 s there was a shift away from timber construction (external appearance) to a wider range of products, including brick, board (asbestos- and more recently fibre-cement) and concrete. A new chronological classification of house development is proposed. These techniques travelled {{in a variety of ways}} and at speeds which indicate over this time New Zealand was technologically well connected and supported an innovative construction sector. The techniques covered are: Boards: asbestos, and cellulose fibre-cement, particle, plywood, pumice, softboard, and hardboard; Bricks: double and veneer; Building paper; Cement and lime: local and imported; Concrete: hollow block, monolithic, reinforced, Camerated, Oratonu and Pearse patents; Fired earth: bricks and terracotta roof tiles; Floors: concrete slab, suspended, and terrazzo; Framing: balloon, braced, light steel, and platform; Insulation: cork, fibreglass, macerated paper, perlite, pumice, foil, and mineral wool; Iron and Steel: cast and wrought iron, steel; Linings: fibrous plaster, plasterboard and wet; metal tile, shingles and slates; Nails: cut, hand-made, wire and plates; Piles: concrete, native timber and stone; Roof: strutted and truss rafter; Roofing: aluminium, corrugated iron,; Sub-floor: vapour barrier, walls and ventilation; Timber: air and kiln drying, glulam, native, pit-saw and preservative treatments; Wall constructions: earth, log, slab, solid timber, raupo and stone; Weatherboards; and Windows: glass, aluminium, steel and timber frames...|$|E

Some researchers specialized in economic growth analyse the export-led growth in many countries and insist upon the importance of openness to increase real Gdp. Often this type of beneficial effects seem very clear but it does not always happen that way. The important question in our view is not only to increase the degree of openness due in order to increase foreign demand but also to relate foreign trade with supply side having into account the general positive effects of imports on the domestic growth of industry, building and services. International cooperation is also recommended in order to help Asian developing countries to reach sustained development at high rates for real income per inhabitant. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. In {{recent years}} South Africa {{has started to}} embark on {{policies}} to increase FDI and boost the country’s manufacturing sector. FDI inflows are important for their perceived role of bridging the savings-investment gap, while increasing the country’s manufacturing capacity will help diversify the economy and could contribute towards job creation. The literature has revealed that the debate on causality between FDI and trade {{has not yet been}} resolved. Furthermore, the FDI/trade relationship has not been adequately addressed in African literature. The research study has investigated the causal link between FDI <b>and</b> <b>manufacturing</b> exports <b>and</b> FDI <b>and</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>imports</b> in South Africa for the period 1994 – 2011. Unit root tests of stationarity were performed on the respective time series and {{it was found that the}} included variables are non-stationary at their levels, but stationary at first differences. Tests of cointegration revealed that FDI <b>and</b> <b>manufacturing</b> exports as well as FDI <b>and</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>imports</b> <b>and</b> vice versa were cointegrated, implying a long-run relationship between the two sets of variables. The study then utilised causality tests based on the significance of the ECM coefficient as well simple Granger causality tests in a bivariate setting. The results indicate one-way causality from manufacturing exports to FDI <b>and</b> from <b>manufacturing</b> <b>imports</b> to FDI. These results suggest that exports <b>and</b> <b>imports</b> of the <b>manufacturing</b> sector matter in the locational inflows of FDI in South Africa. It is recommended that the South African government should encourage FDI policies that have an export component or export strategy. This could attract more FDI inflows that would close the investment gap in the manufacturing sector...|$|R
