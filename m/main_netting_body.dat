The total area within the boundaries of the hunting ground is 26, 810 ha. Field data are classified into the following age and sex classes: calves, yearling females, hinds, yearling males, males 3, 4 and 5 years old, males 6, 7 and 8 years old, and males 9 years old and older. The observed parameters were: the <b>net</b> <b>body</b> weight, fertilization, fetus length and weight, the length of the antler branches, the length of the third tine, the number of tines, weight and value of the antlers in the CIC. Statistical data processing and distribution of values of the parameters were established for each age and sex class. The values of parameters are the selection standards that should be reached by deer of every age and gender, or standards within which the values of certain parameters should be in order to enable support with which, together with selection shooting, clear standards can be set for the observed population.

A comparative phase 3 trial was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of deferasirox in regularly transfused patients with beta-thalassemia aged 2 years or older. Patients were randomized and received treatment with deferasirox (n = 296) or deferoxamine (n = 290), with dosing of each according to baseline liver iron concentration (LIC). The primary endpoint was maintenance or reduction of LIC; secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability, change in serum ferritin level, and <b>net</b> <b>body</b> iron balance. In both arms, patients with LIC values of 7 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw) or higher had significant and similar dose-dependent reductions in LIC and serum ferritin, and effects on <b>net</b> <b>body</b> iron balance.

40|$|AbstractAn {{interesting}} modeling {{problem is}} the need to model {{one or more of the}} system modules without exposition to the other system modules. This modeling problem arises due to our interest in these modules or incomplete knowledge, or inherent complexity, of the rest of the system modules. Whenever the performance measures (one or more) of the desired modules are available through previous performance studies, data sheets, or previous experimental works, the required performance measures for the whole system can be predicted from our proposed modeling technique. The incomplete knowledge problem of the dynamic behavior of some system modules has been studied by control theory. In the control area, such systems are known as partially observed discrete event dynamic systems, or POS systems. To the best of our knowledge, the performance evaluation of the POS system has not been addressed by the Petri net theory yet. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new modeling technique for solving this kind of problem based on using the Petri net theory (i. e. Stochastic Reward Nets (SRNs)) in conjunction with the optimal control theory. In this technique, we develop an SRN Equivalent Model (EM) for the modeled system. The SRN EM-model consists of two <b>main</b> <b>nets</b> and their interface nets. One of the <b>main</b> <b>nets</b> represents the part(s) of interest or the known part(s) of the overall POS system that allows us to model its dynamic behavior and evaluate its performance measures. The other <b>main</b> <b>net</b> represents the remaining part(s) of the overall POS system that feeds the part(s) of interest. The well-known maximum principles have been used to develop an algorithm for determining the unknown transition rates of the proposed model. Numerical simulations are given to show that the proposed approach is more effective than the conventional modeling techniques, especially when dealing with systems having a large number of states.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a novel bat-like {{micro air vehicle}} inspired by the morphing-wing mechanism of bats. The goal {{of this paper is}} twofold. Firstly, a modelling framework is introduced for analysing how the robot should maneuver by means of changing wing morphology. This allows the definition of requirements for achieving forward and turning flight according to the kinematics of the wing modulation. Secondly, an attitude controller named backstepping+DAF is proposed. Motivated by the biological fact about the influence of wing inertia on the production of body accelerations, the attitude control law incorporates wing inertia information to produce desired roll (φ) and pitch (θ) acceleration commands (DAF function). This novel control approach is aimed at incrementing <b>net</b> <b>body</b> forces (Fnet) that generate propulsion. Simulations and wind-tunnel experimental results have shown an increase about 23 % in <b>net</b> <b>body</b> force production during the wingbeat cycle when the wings are modulated using the DAF function {{as a part of the}} backstepping control law. Results also confirm accurate attitude tracking in spite of high external disturbances generated by aerodynamic loads at airspeeds up to 5 ms− 1.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the relation between}} international trade and employment in Portugal {{with regard to the}} labour content of trade in intermediates. It considers both the overall level of employment and labour disaggregated by skills (high-skill, medium-skill and low-skill). The assessment makes use of the newly developed internationally linked inputoutput (IO) database named World Input-Output Database (WIOD), complemented with the Socio-Economic Accounts (SEA) for skill-types of labour. The period analysed – 1995 - 2009 - is the longest possible taking into account the two databases used. The amount of labour required to produce imported intermediates (exported intermediates) is taken as a proxy to the job effect of downward (upward) embeddedness of the country into Global Value Chains (GVCs). We conclude that intermediates’ exports are basically intensive in low-skilled labour although presenting a tendency to skill-upgrading during the period analysed, while intermediates’ imports are proportionally much more intensive in skilled labour, predominantly of a medium skill level, an expected result in a country of an intermediate level of development. We also concluded that the estimated net labour content of jobs in trade in intermediates in the final year of the period analysed was globally negative in 51 thousand jobs. <b>Main</b> <b>net</b> losses were observed with Brazil, People’s Republic of China and India, while <b>main</b> <b>net</b> gains were observed with Spain and France. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

This means no adaptation is accommodated for input variations that have any {{influence on the}} network parameters. Attempts were made in this work to design a neural network that includes an additional mechanism that adjusts the threshold values according to the input pattern variations. The new approach is based on splitting the whole network into two subnets; <b>main</b> traditional <b>net</b> and a supportive net. The first deals with the required output of trained patterns with predefined settings, while the second tolerates output generation dynamically with tuning capability for any newly applied input. This tuning {{comes in the form}} of an adjustment to the threshold values. Two levels of supportive net were studied; one implements an extended additional layer with adjustable neuronal threshold setting mechanism, while the second implements an auxiliary net with traditional architecture performs dynamic adjustment to the threshold value of the <b>main</b> <b>net</b> that is constructed in dual-layer architecture. Experiment results and analysis of the proposed designs have given quite satisfactory conducts. The supportive layer approach achieved over 90 % recognition rate, while the multiple network technique shows more effective and acceptable level of recognition. However, this is achieved at the price of network complexity and computation time. Recognition generalization may be also improved by accommodating capabilities involving all the innate structures in conjugation with Intelligence abilities with the needs of further advanced learning phases...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} motion of {{colloidal}} particles relative to a two component fluid consisting of solvent and solute. Particle motion can result from (i) <b>net</b> <b>body</b> forces on the particle due to external fields such as gravity; (ii) slip velocities on the particle surface due to surface dissipative phenomena. The perturbations of the hydrodynamic flow field exhibits characteristic differences in cases (i) and (ii) which reflect different patterns of momentum flux corresponding {{to the existence of}} net forces, force dipoles or force quadrupoles. In the absence of external fields, gradients of concentration or pressure do not generate net forces on a colloidal particle. Such gradients can nevertheless induce relative motion between particle and fluid. We present a generic description of surface dissipative phenomena based on the linear response of surface fluxes driven by conjugate surface forces. In this framework we discuss different transport scenarios including self-propulsion via surface slip that is induced by active processes on the particle surface. We clarify the nature of force balances in such situations. Comment: 22 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

Otherwise, right cheliped dimensions show different relative growth patterns and left cheliped ones present a positive allometry in males and females. Unlike brachyurans, ontogenetic changes in the growth rate of chelar propodus are not clearly discernible, which prevents the accurate detection of allometric variations.

Of 22 patients predicted to develop iron deficiency (mean projected deficit 268 ± 70 mg), 20 developed evidence of exhausted iron stores (transferrin %sat< 16 or ferritin < 30 µg/liter) before reaching target hemoglobin; two predicted to become deficient (projected deficit < 100 mg) did not; and all five predicted to avoid iron deficiency (mean projected surplus 177 ± 20 mg) remained iron replete. During acute rHuEPO therapy <b>net</b> <b>body</b> iron balance remained neutral in patients receiving no iron supplements and increased 5 mg/kg in patients prescribed oral ferrous sulfate. However, in patients given iron dextran i. v. less than 60 % of elemental iron administered became measurable as iron stores or usable for hemoglobin synthesi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} motion of {{colloidal}} particles relative to a two-component fluid consisting of solvent and solute. Particle motion can result from i) <b>net</b> <b>body</b> forces on the particle due to external fields such as gravity; ii) slip velocities on the particle surface due to surface dissipative phenomena. The perturbations of the hydrodynamic flow field exhibit characteristic differences in cases i) and ii) which reflect different patterns of momentum flux corresponding {{to the existence of}} net forces, force dipoles or force quadrupoles. In the absence of external fields, gradients of concentration or pressure do not generate net forces on a colloidal particle. Such gradients can nevertheless induce relative motion between particle and fluid. We present a generic description of surface dissipative phenomena based on the linear response of surface fluxes driven by conjugate surface forces. In this framework we discuss different transport scenarios including self-propulsion via surface slip that is induced by active processes on the particle surface. We clarify the nature of force balances in such situations. PACS. 65. 20.
