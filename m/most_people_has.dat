40|$|In {{these days}} {{psychological}} pressure and stress are relevant and actual because the times are fast-moving, living pace is faster {{and the life}} without stress does not exist anymore. Stress is playing more significant part in our life and <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>has</b> a lot of stressful experiences. The teoretical part is based on connections between psychological pressure and stress. Consequential part is focused on prevention and stress management. In the following part methodological procedure, data processing methods and evaluation of results are explained. The next part includes the research results and the final part state possible propositions and recommendations to solve the problem. The aim of the thesis is to characterise psychological pressure and its categories by mentioning examples, causes, effects and options management. On {{the basis of this}} executed research the aim is also to determine how students of University of Economics in Prague (VŠE) cope with these stressfull situations, how they respond to it and how they manage to have this influential factor under control, and to comment on the results and potencial recommendations to optimalise management of these situations...|$|E
40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a phenomenal {{increase}} in public awareness and concern over environmental quality. The desire to consume larger amounts of environmental quality {{has been difficult to}} satisfy because many of the natural resources involved do not lend themselves to market allocation. This fail-ure of markets to solve the major environmental quality problems has been well documented (Bator, Mishan, Samuelson, Turvey), and generally can be attributed to externalities imposed by use of the environment and the public goods nature of many natural resources. The failure of markets to perform the allocation function to the satisfaction of <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>has</b> caused us to tum to other institutions for solutions. Most frequently society has turned to legal pro-cesses, both the passage of new legislation and the interpretation or enforcement of existing legislation in the courts. While these activities affect many environmental areas, this paper is focused on water quality, where many state and federal laws have been passed in recent years. Typical of this legisla-tive effort are the 1972 Amendments to the Wate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to the IPCC WGII Fourth Assessment Report, {{more than}} 89 % of {{observational}} data series and studies {{are consistent with}} the greenhouse gas change, which is produced from human activities, as a response to global warming. In the previous point, the tourism and leisure industry is regarding as the non-smokestack industry. However, with an increase of leisure and tourism activities, the carbon dioxide emission and energy use have been growing. Recognizing these risks, the Agenda 21 for the Tourism and Travel Industry promulgated by the World Travel and Tourism Council, the WTO and the Earth Council addressed energy consumption as a key issue of concern. The buildings are {{a major part of the}} leisure industry. Therefore, this work aims to investigate the energy use and carbon emission of a hotel building, located in the middle of Taiwan, for four seasons. The consumption generated from each visitor activating in the building also were conducted. The results will be used as a reference for further investigations into the reduction of energy use and carbon emission in the leisure buildings. By investigation of proposed carbon neutral model, the willing price to pay is highly larger than both of the shifted and non-shifted prices. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>has</b> always inclined to pay for self-related GHG emission. Green development and sustainable operations in the leisure industry should be attended because the real costs of a green building are less than you think...|$|E
40|$|Interdependent {{approach}} {{study is}} a new area in negotiation research. A negotiation approach reflects people's predisposition towards conflict resolution. Although there are five single approaches, negotiators tend to {{use a combination of}} more than one approach during the negotiation process. Traditionally, researchers use the strongest approach to represent a negotiator's approach profile. However, a negotiator's approach profile is determined typically by the combination of single approaches and the strength of their occurrence measured by the Thomas-Kilmann questionnaire. This is an exploratory study of interdependent approaches. Discovery and specification of the effectiveness of such profiles are the research focus. Approach effectiveness is discussed from two perspectives: first, the numbers of strong approaches included; and second, the profile similarity between negotiators. This study analyzes two datasets from the Inspire e-negotiation system. It shows that negotiation approaches are significantly correlated with each other and <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>has</b> one or two strong approaches. Although there is significant evidence that a larger number of strong approaches is more effective in the first dataset, it does not hold in the second, suggesting future studies around this topic; it also finds significant relationship with profile similarity and contract balance, although it does not show in the second dataset. In addition, no significant relationship between profile similarity and opening offer utility is found in both datasets. As an exploratory study, this thesis contributes to the understanding of interdependent negotiation approaches from a new manne...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Hepatitis A is {{acute and}} usually self – {{limiting}} disease, {{but sometimes it}} can be dangerous such as in immunosuppressed patients. Purpose {{of this study is}} to investigate the prevalence of hepatitis A serology in HIV/AIDS Patients. 247 HIV positive patients from March 2005 to September 2006 were entered in this study. Participants completed questionnaires to elicit demographic, drug and sex risk information, and were tested for hepatitis A. They were all referred to Counseling center for behavioral diseases in Imam Khomeini Hospital. Cases were chosen from volunteers with no history of jaundice or acute hepatitis. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 13 and results were compared between seropositive and seronegative groups using T test and chi square. Statistical significance was accepted at a level of P< 0. 05. 200 (80. 98 %) were male and 47 (19. 02) were female. The mean age was 369. 3. 238 (96. 3 %) of patients were seropositive. One hundred percent and 96 % who were born in rural and urban areas were seropositive, respectively. Also, 85. 7 % and 96. 6 % who reside in rural and urban areas were seropositive, respectively. Iran is an endemic country for hepatitis A in which <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>has</b> asymptomatic infectious during childhood. According to high prevalence of hepatitis A positive serology in HIV/AIDS patients, routine vaccination seems to be unnecessary. But special sub populations like HIV infected infants should be evaluated more precisely and different approaches may be needed for them...|$|E

40|$|The article {{explores the}} ironies {{involved}} in the contemporary enforcement of family obligations. As forms of intimate partnership and parenthood become ever more varied, the law of family obligation - child support, property division and alimony - has become increasingly routine and formulaic. As scholars increasingly {{call for more attention}} to the varied ways in which different individuals and communities structure their care networks and their intimate lives, the law of family obligation has become less, not more attentive to context. This piece explains how the law’s rejection of context is an understandable reaction to the growing diversity of family forms. By unpacking contemporary family law rules, one see that the baselines and value judgments informing the law of family obligation are usually contested or arbitrary or both. They are accepted not because they represent consensus on what obligation should be but because they clearly demarcate who is obligated and for how much. Predictability emerges as more important than context for almost everyone. Social acceptance of so many different family forms makes judicial attention to context extraordinarily invasive and expensive. In an area of law where very few of the parties have the resources or desire to debate the normative underpinnings of family obligation and where both the parties and the state have strong interests in minimizing contested issues, there are compelling reasons to establish a very rule and status based law of obligation, even if that system is rooted in a normative vision of family that, for <b>most</b> <b>people,</b> <b>has</b> ceased to exist. The article thus argues that despite the profoundly limited way in which the current law identifies families, some reliance on restricted legal definitions of family will be necessary for any meaningful system of family obligation to operate. In doing so, the article challenges much contemporary family law scholarship and suggests that we may have to accept the law’s privileging of certain family forms if we are to expect an enforceable system of family obligation...|$|E
