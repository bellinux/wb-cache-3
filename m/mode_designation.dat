40|$|The {{choice of}} {{predator}} foraging mode has important consequences for ecological communities. Foraging <b>mode</b> <b>designations</b> are often {{made on the}} basis of predator activity, yet activity can be affected by various environmental stimuli independent of changes in foraging mode. Structural complexity can reduce predator activity by either interfering with predator vision and mobility or as part of a foraging mode shift. We examined the effects of simulated aquatic vegetation on multiple behaviors of 2 aquatic insect predators to distinguish between these 2 possible outcomes. Larvae of the diving water beetle (Dytiscus spp.) shifted from an active predator in treatments without structure to a sit-and-pursue (SAP) predator in treatments containing structure, as indicated by a decrease in activity and prey encounter rates and an increase in probability of capture. This trade-off between encounter rates and probability of capture resulted in an equal number of prey captures among the treatments. Dragonfly nymphs (Anax junius) remained SAP predators in both treatments, although interference from the simulated vegetation significantly reduced activity. Structure also slightly decreased the number of aeshnid prey captures. Physiological attributes of the predators, such as mode of respiration and method of prey detection, seemed to influence foraging behavior. This study emphasizes the benefits of measuring multiple predator behaviors when classifying predators to particular foraging modes. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA detailed, {{analytic}} model is developed {{to represent the}} duel between a ground laser designator (GLD) directing a sequence of laser-guided rounds against a platoon of target tanks which counterfire against the GLD. The model accurately portrays the complex interplay between the designator-on time, the rate of fire of the laser-guided rounds, and the tank counterfire response time distributions. Also taken into account are the tank aiming errors and range estimating techniques, the level of GLD protection, flight times, <b>designation</b> <b>modes,</b> and degree of coordination of the tank platoon. One of the innovations of this model is the utilization of gamma distributions to represent tank counterfire response times. This permits {{the representation of the}} time-to-fire for any number of tank rounds within the designator-on time interval by convolution of the gamma density functions. Exact expressions which allow for all encounter outcomes are derived for computation of the expected number of tanks killed and probability of GLD kill. This model was used to determine the probabilistic outcomes of the encounters at each stage of the force-on-force analysis in the definitive U. S. Army study on GLD survivability...|$|R
