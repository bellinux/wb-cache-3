The sun {{being the}} nearest star, seismic {{observations}} with high spatial resolution are possible, thus providing accurate <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> of about half million modes of solar oscillations covering {{a wide range}} of degree. With these data helioseismology has enabled us to study the solar interior in sufficient detail to infer the large-scale struc-ture and rotation of the solar interior. With the availability of high quality helioseismic data over a good fraction of a solar cycle it is also possible to study temporal variations in solar structure and dynamics. Some of these problems and recent results will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} {{progress}} {{the author has}} made over the past 5 years in understanding coherence ef-fects in water and living systems using quantum mechanical models. Background: The implications of existing theoretical work on water are discussed. Methods: Available techniques for the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> imprinted in water are described or ref-erenced. Results: The importance of frequency is shown in respect of {{the understanding of the}} mechanisms of ho-moeopathy, acupuncture and how bioinformation may be stored in water and also in respect of chemical and electrical sensitivities or hypersensitivities; hypersensitivity being that degree of sensitivity that seriously in-terferes with normal functioning. Conclusion: Water and living systems have macroscopic quantum properties that can give rise to a mem-ory for frequencies, long-range effects, and entanglement between separated systems. 6...|$|E

40|$|In {{studies of}} competence-deficient mutants of Haemophilus influenzae which absorb deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) but {{fail to produce}} transformants, it was {{observed}} that in some mutants the residual transforming activity for different markers varied widely, i. e., produced a ratio effect. One of these mutants, com− 56, was studied intensively to determine the cause of the residual efficiency of transformation and the reason for the ratio effect. The residual frequency of transformation was higher for markers considered single-site mutations (like naladixic acid resistance), whereas the least efficient markers tested were those conferring resistance to high levels of streptomycin or novobiocin which are more complex than single-site mutations. <b>Measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> of cotransformation indicated that overall genetic linkage was reduced. Transfection was fairly efficient with phage S 2 DNA, but not prophage DNA. Donor marker activity could be detected in transformed cell lysates, but not linked to recipient markers in recombinant molecules. Sucrose gradient analysis of such lysates revealed that donor material was associated with recipient DNA in at least normal quantities, but lacked detectable genetic activity. Material from donor DNA labeled with heavy isotopes was incorporated into recipient chromosomal fragments having a density indistinguishable from normal density, unlike the hybrid density recombinant material found in normal cells. No excessive solubilization or nicking of unincorporated donor was detected. It is postulated that this strain contains a hyperactive nuclease, which reduces the effective size of the input DNA during the integration process...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA new {{technique}} {{has been developed}} which allows the direct <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> of ions trapped in a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. This pump/probe method employs a fast direct current (DC) pulse (pump) to displace a kinetically cooled ion population {{from the center of}} the trap, and a laser (probe) which recognizes when ions reappear at the center of the trap by the formation of photodissociation fragments. The translationally excited ions undergo periodic motion within the confines of the ion trap, and this periodic motion can be followed by recording the intensity of the photodissociation fragment as a function of the delay time between the DC pump and the laser probe. The DC pulse has a rise time of 15 ns; data are taken 1 ms after its application to allow stable ion motion to be sampled. Sampling of the ion cloud is done at 50 ns intervals, and fast Fourier transformation of the time-based data yields the ion frequencies and their relative magnitudes. Data are reported for ions derived from acetophenone (m/z 105) and 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene (m/z 80) under various trapping conditions corresponding to different Mathieu qz values. The measured fundamental secular frequencies, fz and fr, are found to agree well with those predicted. The presence of higher order multipole contributions to the trapping field is evident from such ion frequencies as the drive frequency, fRF. The ability to measure ion frequencies under operating conditions provides a new tool for comparing simulated and experimental data. Simulation data from the program ITSIM, modified to account for the effects of collisions, are shown to predict the major frequency components observed in the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to address the relationship between formulation of friction lining materials and their propensity to friction induced noise generation. The basic idea was formulated earlier by Dr. Filip, who showed that the friction layer plays the relevant role when noise is observed during braking. It was shown that when newly formed patches (parts of the friction layer) exhibit a large difference in the coefficient of friction, brake lining is stretched and released repeatedly, which leads to significant vibrations and corresponding noise when coupled with the vibration mode of the system. Farhang,on the other hand, demonstrated that noise can be related to specific surface roughness parameters and when properties of friction lining and friction layer (such as compressibility, stiffness and modulus of elasticity) fit into certain specific value ranges, noisy behavior occurs. This research will address the braking related to friction induced noise in relation to the properties of the bulk lining material and the character and properties of the friction layer. The friction tests will be performed using the CAFS-developed (Szary and Lee) real time noise measurement system compatible with the major part of SAEJ 2521 standard (note that the system does not allow for reliable <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> lower than 900 Hz). The mechanical properties of fourteen samples will be investigated. Of the fourteen samples, friction layer of three of the samples will be investigated by several analytical techniques developed by Dr. Filip [1]. They include polarized light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive microanalysis, and X-ray diffraction. This research summarizes data from the J 2521 dynamometer test of the Dodge Caravan samples exhibiting specific compressibility, porosity and hardness. Also, this research provides the results of friction surface analysis by SEM with energy dispersive microanalysis, light microscopy, surface roughness, and X ray diffraction. Of the fourteen samples, Bendix has the largest occurrence of noisy braking. Based on techniques developed by Dr. Filip, the characteristics of the friction layer strongly influence brake noise propensity. The friction layer characteristics are dependent on brake formulation. As predicted, 2 ̆ 2 noisy stop 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 quiet stop 2 ̆ 2 samples exhibit completely different friction surfaces...|$|E
