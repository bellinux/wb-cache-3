Enterprises {{in order to provide}} consumers with a better service must proceed from the perspective of consumers. Their double clear consumer <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> and influencing factors have factors on the impact of consumers. Using <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> can develop effective marketing strategy, and actively seeking to develop the road, so as to continuously promote the development of <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping.</b> This paper analyzes the characteristics of <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> behavior of consumers, identifies the factors affecting consumer <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping,</b> and concludes with recommendations for the development of <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping.</b> The Definition and Characteristics of <b>Mobile</b> <b>Shopping</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> refers to <b>mobile</b> devices (such as mobile phones, PDAs, etc.) for the terminal, relying on wireless Internet online shopping process, belonging to mobile e-commerce.

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> {{has grown}} into a huge market and an {{increasing}} number of consumers have begun to use <b>mobile</b> websites to <b>shop.</b> Therefore, how <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> websites provide good shopping to customers is significant. The object {{of this study is to}} relate factors of website quality to college students’ satisfaction with <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> experiences, which in turn influence their intentions to return to the website and/or to purchase on the website. Five dimensions of website quality, which were information quality, navigation, visual appeal, response time and interactivity, were selected in this study. The model of self-regulatory process (Bagozzi, 1992) has been widely used in consumer behavior to explain the relationship between attitude and intention. This model was adopted in this study to examine the relationship between website quality and consumer satisfaction with <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> experience and the relationship between consumer satisfaction and their intentions to return to the website and/or to purchase on the website. The results of this study suggested all dimensions of mobile website quality except navigation were positively related to consumer’s satisfaction with their <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> experience and consumer satisfaction positively related to consumers’ intentions to revisit and/or purchase a product in mobile website contexts. There are a limited number of studies focusing on consumer <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> behaviors. Further study might consider other dimensions of mobile website quality, such as security (Szymanski 2 ̆ 6 Hise, 2000) and innovativeness (Loiacono et al., 2002), and their relationship with consumer satisfaction with <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> experience. In addition, the results of this study will provide marketers and retailers a better understanding of consumer <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> behavior. Adviser: Rita C. Kea...|$|R

40|$|Despite their {{generally}} increasing use, {{the adoption}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> applications often differs across purchase contexts. In order to advance our understanding of smartphone-based <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> acceptance, this study integrates and extends existing approaches from technology acceptance literature by examining two previously underexplored aspects. Firstly, the study examines the impact of different mobile and personal benefits (instant connectivity, contextual value and hedonic motivation), customer characteristics (habit) and risk facets (financial, performance, and security risk) as antecedents of <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> acceptance. Secondly, {{it is assumed that}} several acceptance drivers differ in relevance subject to the perception of three <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> characteristics (location sensitivity, time criticality, and extent of control), while other drivers are assumed to matter independent of the context. Based on a dataset of 410 smartphone shoppers, empirical results demonstrate that several acceptance predictors are associated with ease of use and usefulness, which in turn affect intentional and behavioral outcomes. Furthermore, the extent to which risks and benefits impact ease of use and usefulness is influenced by the three contextual characteristics. From a managerial perspective, results show which factors to consider in the development of <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> applications and in which different application contexts they matter...|$|R

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> {{is gaining}} {{increased}} {{attention in the}} mobile commerce research area. Trends show {{an increase in the}} development and usage of online shopping. Existing research has focused on mobile commerce and studied <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> in general. This study addresses the present gap in the literature regarding the acceptance of <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> applications for fashion goods (m-shopping fashion apps), by investigating the factors that affect users’ behavioral intention to use m-shopping fashion apps in Sweden. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the factors that affect the behavioral intention to use m-shopping fashion apps from a consumer perspective, where the consumers are the users of m-shopping fashion apps. The research model was proposed thought a literature review and incorporated the trust factor into the Consumer Acceptance and Use of Information Technology model (UTAUT 2) of Venkatesh, Thong and Xu (2012), as one of the in total eight proposed predictors of users’ behavioral intention to use <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> fashion apps. A questionnaire was conducted to collect primary data and the study sample consisted of 110 respondents. Multiple linear regressions was applied to test the proposed hypotheses. The results reveal that Performance Expectancy, Habit, Facilitating Conditions and Hedonic Motivation affect the users’ behavioral intention to use m-shopping fashion apps. On a different note, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Price Value and Trust do not significantly affect the behavioral intention to use m- shopping fashion apps. These findings provide several managerial implications, namely  the ways in which behavioral intention to use m-shopping fashion apps is needed to be taken into consideration in order to increase <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> fashion apps’ usage. Moreover, this study’s research model can be used for future studies on <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> fashion applications and <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping...</b>|$|R

40|$|Though several {{industry}} {{reports have}} suggested that the rate of shopping cart abandonment is high in the mobile channel, the reasons for such abandonment remain relatively unexplored. Drawing on the cognition-affect-behavior (CAB) paradigm, this study aims to provide a conceptual framework explaining why consumers hesitate to use <b>mobile</b> channels for <b>shopping</b> and thus abandon their <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> carts. Results from two studies show that <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> cart abandonment is positively influenced by emotional ambivalence, a result of consumers' conflicting thoughts. More specifically, emotional ambivalence amplifies consumers' hesitation at the checkout stage, leading to cart abandonment. However, if hesitant consumers are satisfied with the choice process during shopping, {{they are less likely to}} give up their <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> carts.

40|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> is {{increasing}} in prevalence {{and has become}} a necessary part of many people's daily lives. However, one main channel for <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping,</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> applications (apps), has not been thoroughly investigated. This study focused on mobile text advertising delivered from <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> apps using the intention to purchase as the dependent variable for testing its marketing effect. In the context of a promotion focus vs. a prevention focus, we used Higgins' regulatory focus theory combined with Ajzen's TPB and Herzog's U&G to analyze the mechanism by which consumers formulate an intention to purchase in a mobile advertising context. This empirical study surveyed 320 consumers who had made a purchase using a <b>mobile</b> <b>shopping</b> app in the previous month. The results showed that infotainment, irritation, and subjective norms were significantly associated with attitudes; in turn, attitudes mediated the impact of these three factors on the intention to purchase. Moreover, a high promotion focus not only strengthened the positive effect of infotainment on attitudes but also intensified the mediation effect of attitudes between infotainment and the intention to purchase. A high prevention focus also consolidated the negative effect of irritation on attitudes as well as reinforced the mediation effect of attitudes between irritation and the intention to purchase. Furthermore, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control collectively impacted the intention to purchase. These findings shed light on ways to customize goods information in mobile advertising and have strong theoretical and practical implications...|$|R
