40|$|A {{study of}} the {{influence}} of the proportion of dietary essential fatty acids (EFA) in the lipid of diets fed to the prawn, Penaeus monodon, showed clearly that these nutrients are required as a proportion of the total fatty acids in the diet. A factorial array of diets were prepared to contain optimal <b>levels</b> (<b>g</b> <b>kg)</b> of the fatty acids, linoleic (LOA, 18 : 2 n - 6), linolenic (LNA, 18 : 3 n - 3), eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20 : 5 n - 2) and docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22 : 6 n - 3). As a second factor to the study, the total amount of lipid in the diet was also increased at incremented levels from 45 to 135 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> at 30 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> increments. The weight gain of prawns was greatest (156. 2 ± 6. 2 %) when their diet contained 75 <b>g</b> lipid <b>kg,</b> of which 30 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> was essential fatty acids. Weight gain of prawns fed with diets containing 45 <b>g</b> lipid <b>kg</b> with 17 <b>g</b> of essential fatty acids kg was greater (148. 0 ± 3. 4 %) than prawns fed with the diet that had 45 <b>g</b> lipid <b>kg</b> and 30 <b>g</b> of essential fatty acids kg (124. 0 ± 6. 8 %). The nutritional condition of the prawns, as determined by the amount of lipid in their digestive glands, was generally reflective of weight gain, though there were exceptions, with higher lipid levels in prawn DG from faster growing prawns. The fatty acid composition of the DG lipid generally mimicked that of the dietary lipid. The proportions of each of the essential fatty acids in the DG lipid varied marginally between treatments, but generally LOA, LNA, EPA and DHA levels in the DG fatty acids were present in slightly lower proportions than that in the diet. The amount of dietary lipid present influenced the composition of the fatty acids in the DG lipid when the lowest inclusion level of lipid was compared with the higher inclusion levels. The results of this study clearly indicate that EFA are required as a proportion of the total fatty acids in the diet, and not as a proportion of the diet. Accordingly, it is suggested that EFA should be defined {{as a percentage of the}} total fatty acids in conjunction with an indication of the amount of lipid in the diet. This study also showed that for weight gain, the optimal total lipid level of the diet is less than 105 <b>g</b> <b>kg...</b>|$|R

40|$|Biomass burning {{releases}} trace {{gases and}} aerosol particles that significantly affect {{the composition and}} chemistry of the atmosphere. Australia contributes approximately 8 % of gross global carbon emissions from biomass burning, yet there are few previous measurements of emissions from Australian forest fires available in the literature. This paper describes the results of field measurements of trace gases emitted during hazard reduction burns in Australian temperate forests using open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In a companion paper, similar techniques are used to characterise the emissions from hazard reduction burns in the savanna regions of the Northern Territory. Details of the experimental methods are explained, including both the measurement set-up and the analysis techniques employed. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} different ways to estimate whole-fire emission factors are discussed and a measurement uncertainty budget is developed. Emission factors for Australian temperate forest fires are measured locally for the first time for many trace gases. Where ecosystem-relevant data are required, we recommend the following emission factors for Australian temperate forest fires (in grams of gas emitted per kilogram of dry fuel burned) which are our mean measured values: 1620 ± 160 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of carbon dioxide; 120 ± 20 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of carbon monoxide; 3. 6 ± 1. 1 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of methane; 1. 3 ± 0. 3 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ethylene; 1. 7 ± 0. 4 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of formaldehyde; 2. 4 ± 1. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of methanol; 3. 8 ± 1. 3 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of acetic acid; 0. 4 ± 0. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of formic acid; 1. 6 ± 0. 6 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ammonia; 0. 15 ± 0. 09 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of nitrous oxide and 0. 5 ± 0. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ethane...|$|R

T 1 was kept control; T 2 contained 23 + 60 + 30 kg NPK ha - 1 and from T 3 to T 7 N fertilizer {{in the form of}} urea was added @ 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 kg ha - 1 along with combination of the same constant dose of P 2 O 5 and K 2 O respectively. After physiological maturity, seeds were analyzed for their mineral N contents. Results showed that fertilizer treatments in general significantly, but negatively influenced the NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N, but reverse was true for NO 2 -N. A minimum level of NO 3 -N was recorded in T 4 (0. 065 μ M), NH 4 -N in T 7 (0. 133 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> 1) and a <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> of NO 2 -N in T 5 (1. 864 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> - 1).

40|$|Savanna fires {{contribute}} approximately 40 – 50 % {{of total}} global annual biomass burning carbon emissions. Recent comparisons of emission factors from different savanna regions have highlighted {{the need for}} a regional approach to emission factor development, and better assessment of the drivers of the temporal and spatial variation in emission factors. This paper describes the results of open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopic field measurements at 21 fires occurring in the tropical savannas of the Northern~Territory, Australia, within different vegetation assemblages and at different stages of the dry season. Spectra of infrared light passing through a long (22 – 70 m) open-path through ground-level smoke released from these fires were collected using an infrared lamp and a field-portable FTIR system. The IR spectra were used to retrieve the mole fractions of 14 different gases present within the smoke, and these measurements used to calculate the emission ratios and emission factors of the various gases emitted by the burning. Only a handful of previous emission factor measures are available specifically for the tropical savannas of Australia and here we present the first reported emission factors for methanol, acetic acid, and formic acid for this biome. Given the relatively large sample size, it was possible to study the potential causes of the within-biome variation of the derived emission factors. We find that the emission factors vary substantially between different savanna vegetation assemblages; with a majority of this variation being mirrored by variations in the modified combustion efficiency (MCE) of different vegetation classes. We conclude that a significant majority of the variation in the emission factor for trace gases can be explained by MCE, irrespective of vegetation class, as illustrated by variations in the calculated methane emission factor for different vegetation classes using data sub-set by different combustion efficiencies. Therefore, the selection of emission factors for emissions modelling purposes need not necessarily require detailed fuel type information, if data on MCE (e. g. from future spaceborne total column measurements) or a correlated variable were available. From measurements at 21 fires, we recommend the following emission factors for Australian tropical savanna fires (in grams of gas emitted per kilogram of dry fuel burned), which are our mean measured values: 1674 ± 56 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of carbon dioxide; 87 ± 33 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of carbon monoxide; 2. 1 ± 1. 2 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of methane; 0. 11 ± 0. 04 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of acetylene; 0. 49 ± 0. 22 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ethylene; 0. 08 ± 0. 05 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ethane; 1. 57 ± 0. 44 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of formaldehyde; 1. 06 ± 0. 87 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of methanol; 1. 54 ± 0. 64 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of acetic acid; 0. 16 ± 0. 07 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of formic acid; 0. 53 ± 0. 31 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of hydrogen cyanide; and 0. 70 ± 0. 36 <b>g</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 of ammonia. In a companion paper, similar techniques are used to characterise the emissions from Australian temperate forest fires...|$|R
