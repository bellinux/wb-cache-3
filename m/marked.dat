40|$|Manual <b>marking</b> of free-response {{solutions}} in mathematics assessments is very demanding {{in terms of}} time and effort. Available software equipped with automated <b>marking</b> features to <b>mark</b> open-ended questions has very limited capabilities. In most cases the <b>marking</b> process focuses on the final answer only. Few available software are capable of <b>marking</b> the intermediate steps as is norm in manual <b>marking.</b> This paper discusses the line-by-line <b>marking</b> performance of the n_gram string similarity method using the Dice coefficient as means to measure similarity. The <b>marks</b> awarded by the automated <b>marking</b> process are compared with <b>marks</b> awarded by manual <b>marking.</b> <b>Marks</b> awarded by manual <b>marking</b> are used as the benchmark to gauge the performance of the automated <b>marking</b> technique in terms of its closeness to manual <b>marking...</b>|$|R

The <b>Mark</b> II was an improvement over the <b>Mark</b> I, although it still was based on electromechanical relays. The <b>Mark</b> III used mostly electronic components—vacuum tubes and crystal diodes—but also included mechanical components: rotating magnetic drums for storage, plus relays for transferring data between drums. The <b>Mark</b> IV was all-electronic, replacing the remaining mechanical components with magnetic core memory. The <b>Mark</b> II and <b>Mark</b> III were delivered to the US Navy base at Dahlgren, Virginia. The <b>Mark</b> IV was built for the US Air Force, but it stayed at Harvard.|$|R
