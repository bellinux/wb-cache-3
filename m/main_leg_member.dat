40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demands on power supply and telecommunication services, existing transmission towers are frequently being required to carry extra loads above their initial design limits. A range of methods have therefore been used to increase the capacity of existing towers by retrofitting them in some way. This paper addresses steel lattice transmission towers with <b>main</b> <b>leg</b> <b>members</b> retrofitted by steel angles through bolted double steel angle connectors, a method that is widely used in practice but to date with little theoretical research to support it. Three unreinforced tower models and four groups of retrofitted tower models with and without preloading have been tested in the structural laboratories at the University of South Australia. The experimental results verify {{the effectiveness of the}} retrofitting method. Load sharing analysis shows that axial loads can be effectively transferred between original tower members and reinforcing members through the bolted-splice system. Preloading reduces the load sharing in reinforcing members in the early loading stage but does not have significant influence on the ultimate strength of the whole structure. ...|$|R

40|$|Results of {{experimental}} investigation on the compressive strength of twenty solid round steel <b>leg</b> <b>member</b> specimens of lattice communication towers reinforced {{with one or}} two split pipe(s) are presented in this paper. The reinforcement was connected to the <b>leg</b> <b>members</b> either by means of U-bolts only or by means of U-bolts and end welding. It was found that bolt torque has no significant effect in the increase on the strength. It was also concluded that using two split pipes without end welding is better than using one split pipe with end welding. Based on the test results, a simplified and conservative design procedure in accordance to the Canadian and American Standards is proposed to determine the compressive strength of solid round steel <b>leg</b> <b>members</b> reinforced with split pipe(s) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{aiming to}} reduce the cost of {{production}} through analyzing and optimizing a set of weaving machine components including five legs; three <b>main</b> <b>legs</b> and two support legs. This set of legs has a reciprocating revolutionary movement around a central axis which is driven by a crank shaft. Finite element static Structural analysis, explicit and fatigue analyses been applied using Ansys workbench. The results show that some areas of legs are under small stresses far from material yield strength. This fact provides the potential for mass reduction of legs without significant effect on mechanical safety factors. Ansys Workbench parameter optimization and shape optimization been applied in this study in order to reduce mass while maintaining almost the same safety factors. Besides performing optimization on original legs, new optimized design alternatives presented for both <b>main</b> <b>legs</b> and support legs. Mass reduction of maximum 18 % is obtained in new designs...|$|R
