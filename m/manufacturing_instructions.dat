40|$|The {{concept of}} Flexible Manufacturing Cells (FMCs) {{proves to be}} one of the major {{productivity}} enhancement tools for batch processing. The cost and expertise required to setup a cell, and subsequently to operate it, negates the many advantages of implementing FMCs. This problem hampers the introduction of the concept in many industries. At present, combining machines from different manufacturers to form an FMC is cumbersome. Incompatibility due to unique characteristics and varying programming and control languages among machines present the largest difficulties. This thesis demonstrates that it is possible to create a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>instruction</b> set and environment labelled UniSet (the acronym for Unified instruction Set) that enables programming and controlling a flexible manufacturing cell with a set of common instructions. UniSet is a software environment designed to provide the FMC user with a consistent platform in which to configure, program, simulate and control an FMC irrespective of the constituent machines. The environment is coded in an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language; Smalltalk.

Two components of epoxy resin mixed according to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>instruction</b> with the weight ratio that was 100 : 10. Epoxy plates fabricated in three different thicknesses (2, 4 and 6 mm) and shielding effectiveness measured by Vector Network Analyzer. Then, shielding effectiveness measured by the scattering parameters. The results showed that 6 mm thickness of epoxy had the highest and 2 mm had the lowest average of shielding effectiveness in X-band frequency that is 4. 48 and 1. 9 dB, respectively. Also, shielding effectiveness increased by increasing the thickness. But this increasing is useful up to 4 mm.

40|$|Flexible Manufacturing Cells (FMC) may be {{considered}} the most significant development in small batch manufacturing. Setting up and operating costs {{prove to be the}} most major hindrance to large scale implementation and use of the FMCs, particularly by small and medium size industries. Incompatibility between the different components constituting the cells, and the lack of a unified language/approach to programming and coordinating them, are cited as the cause of the complexity of setting up and subsequently operating the cells. In order to eliminate these difficulties, a new philosophy for setting up, programming, and control of FMCs has been developed. This thesis reports part of the effort for developing the new "UniSet" philosophy and the components of the UniSet Environment. UniSet has been developed as a Unified <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Instruction</b> Set based on a comparison of machine tool and programming primitives. UniSet allows programmers, if they so desire, to concentrate on only one instruction set rather than numerous machine programming languages. Task level UniSet has been designed using an object-oriented and a knowledge based approach to eliminate cell programming difficulties. An expert cell programmer can be replaced by a less experienced manufacturing operator. A software environment for Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM), called UniSet Environment, has been developed to address the shortcomings of setting up and operating FMCs comprising incompatible components from the different suppliers. The UniSet Environment provides the users with a consistent platform to configure, program, simulate, and control an FMC irrespective of the nature of its constituents. The Environment is coded an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language, Smalltalk. The Environment consists of four modules which capture complete information about the cell program, existing cell facilities and databases, and distribute the information into the corresponding Object Models. Each of the module is responsible for a specific function. The Setup module is primarily used for defining the cell, its components and their functionalities, and reconfiguring a cell or building preparation databases. The Programming module allows the user to edit cell programs which may be developed in UniSet, Task level UniSet, or native machine languages. The programs written in Task level UniSet are used to generate detailed UniSet codes which are translated into specific machine codes by the generation and translation module.

As a result of the project detailed herein, 186 manufacturing batch records that meet current quality requirements were created and approved for the manufacturing department's cell banking and bulk cell production processes that replace the department's laboratory notebooks that have historically documented such activities. Further, the <b>Manufacturing</b> Work <b>Instructions</b> document that accompanies each batch record was updated to current department requirements. This achievement of {{the first part of this}} project represents a broken bottleneck that precluded the department from culturing the vast majority of the company's cell lines due to lack of batch records. Additionally, this achievement has increased efficiency by saving 50 labor hours for the department's supervisor from the creation and approval of affected documents.

40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} processes have become fully automated resulting in high production volumes. However, {{this is not}} the case for inspection. Shortening the inspection times in manufacturing industry using the available information resources can result in the reduction of production lead-time and overall costs. Rapid advances in machine tool technology have resulted in fast processing computer numerical control (CNC) machines that are capable of manufacturing parts at high speeds, turning their manual inspection process into a bottleneck. However, most CNC machines record the operations that they perform as realization logs. This paper proposes an approach that utilizes these realization logs for automating the inspection process. The automation occurs with the implementation of a software tool that imports and compares the realization logs with the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>instructions</b> for a manufactured part. The output of the tool is an inspection report that lists all the identified skipped or mishandled operations for that part.

40|$|Abstract: The use {{of virtual}} reality in {{interactive}} design and manufacture {{has been researched extensively}} but the practical application of this technology in industry is still very much in its infancy. This is surprising as one would have expected that, after some 30 years of research commercial applications of interactive design or manufacturing planning and analysis would be widespread throughout the product design domain.

40|$|Part 5 : Sustainable Human Integration in Cyber-Physical Systems: The Operator 4. 0 International audienceNowadays, {{manufacturers}} must {{be increasingly}} flexible to quickly produce a high mix of on-demand, customer-specific, low volume product types. This requires flexible assembly lines with operators that are well-supported in their constantly changing assembly task, while producing high-quality, first-time-right, zero-defect products.

40|$|In Germany, about 8000 sinking- and 6000 wire cutting-machines are in use, {{which shows}} the high {{acceptance}} of this concept as an industrial manufacturing process. Its benefits, compared to conventional processes, like milling and grinding, lie in the machining of materials with high hardness and strength as hardened steel tungsten carbide or conductive. There are several environmental aspects that are influenced by EDM. Health of machine operators can be attacked by exposure to chemicals that arise during the process and are set free to air, dielectric and slurry. This investigation’s main objective is {{the establishment of an}} instrument for assessing the exposure of machine operators of the sinking process of electrical discharge machining, a hazard valuating concept. The assessment of exposure will therefore provide opportunities to map the hazards of a specific EDM manufacturing process in an industrial plant, by using data from emission-based measurements as input. During this project, an encased structure around an EDM installation is used for emission based monitoring and measurements in an industrial environment are performed (immission based monitoring). The calculation of emission quantities to immission quantities using a simplified scenario shows the importance of metal emissions and emissions of aliphatic compounds, whose limit values will be exceeded after relative short production times. The concentrations of PAH and volatile organic compounds are present in very low, not significant quantities. The immission based measurements support this emission estimation scenario. The investigations have shown that the experimental model, that captures total emission of the electrical discharge machine, and is not solely based on immission values, have lead {{to a better understanding of}} the production process. This information can be used to extract recommendations regarding protection measures and monitoring aspects. Regarding the present investigation, the following recommendations are noted; 1. The parameters that are subject to investigation have to be directed to the specific EDM technical adjustments. This is particularly valid for the emissions of metals (like chromium), that have high toxicological relevance, and that are highly dependent on the metals used as work-piece and tool during electrical discharge machining; 2. During routine monitoring, the total manufacturing process and the local environment have to be paid attention to. During informal meetings with manufacturers, the information was given that next to inhalation exposure to emissions, dermatological problems have appeared. Direct contact with dielectric and slurry has probably been the main cause of these problems; 3. The need for, and the type of end-of-pipe measures has to be an individual recommendation and depends on the process, location, etc; 4. The hazard reducing measures should not solely focus on end-of-pipe measures like recommendations and <b>instructions.</b> During routine <b>manufacturing</b> these <b>instructions</b> are not applied most of the time. A combination with a (or more) source related technical measures, like change in technical adjustments (current, dielectric level, workpiece and tool), cleaning/changing dielectric, has higher hazard reducing potential; 5. Contact with dielectric (air borne or direct) may lead to allergic reactions (mostly skin). Operators that show these problems have to consult a practitioner and an occupational medicine man. Further activities should not only be focussed on the treatment of the operator but also on prevention by inspection and optimization of the manufacturing process in the specific plant...|$|R

The paper outlines the information requirements of a process plan {{so that they can be}} used for generic shop floor control. These requirements are expressed as a function of the shop floor tasks/activities that are required to produce a product. The process planning requirements represent a basic part of the shop floor control system's ability to change its actions so that alternative products can be produced using the same control schema. By altering data in its databases, new manufacturing process information and alternative process information can be considered and executed by the shop floor control system.

Specifically, we define the current use and implementation of process plans.

Given that a key feature of the nanosatellite market is use of batch or mass production to minimize costs, efficient configuration {{and control of the}} systems as offered to customers and throughout the full life-cycle plays an increasingly important role. Use of a Space System Model (SSM) to define a logical structure of the system, such as that defined for operations in ECSS standards, presents the opportunity to reflect configuration of the satellite throughout the development and subsequent operation of the satellite.
