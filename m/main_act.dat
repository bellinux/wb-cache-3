5|$|Despite {{the success}} of Moo, You Bloody Choir, much of Augie March's post-album touring {{involved}} supporting other bands. They played shows supporting The Aliens and Andrew Bird in the United States, before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House. Richards said the band's status as an opening act, rather than headlining their own shows, was something they saw as a challenge—their intention was to win over fans who {{came to see the}} <b>main</b> <b>act.</b> However, he called the tour with The Aliens depressing; the bands played very different types of music, and the attendance at shows was small.
