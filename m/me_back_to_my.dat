500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{directed}} by Cameron Duddy and Mars was released on October 15, 2012. The concept of the video shows Mars {{having a good time}} with his bandmates, doing things like smoking, drinking beer and playing games. He is also seen singing the song with his band at a club. The video has a vintage style reminiscent of VHS tapes. Mars explained to MTV News, [...] "The concept is just old-fashioned fun. No story line, it's not me singing to a girl, you get a good sense of what you're going to get live... It's very VHS-y. I love that man, it takes <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> childhood, when the tracking is off and the color is off, there's a beauty in that. You'd have to stand by the TV with, like, aluminum foil all over you." ...|$|E
500|$|Taare Zameen Par {{received}} several positive reviews. Subhash K. Jha {{suggests that the}} film is [...] "a work of art, a water painting where the colors drip into our hearts, which could easily have fallen into the motions of over-sentimentality. Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its [...] "remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience." [...] Manish Gajjar from the BBC stated that the film [...] "touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [...] a film full of substance!" [...] Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that Taare Zameen Par is a [...] "far cry from the formulaic masala flicks churned out by the Bollywood machine," [...] and is [...] "an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; {{this is a little}} twinkling star of a movie." [...] Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of Screen gave the film four stars and stated, [...] "Taare Zameen Par cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would make everyone think. Because it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director." [...] In addition, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap stated that, [...] "Taare Zameen Par took <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> hostel days. If you take away the dyslexia, it seems like my story. The film affected me so deeply that I was almost left speechless. After watching the film, I was asked how I liked Taare Zameen Par. I could not talk as I was deeply overwhelmed." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 29, Harlow was {{shooting}} {{a scene in}} which the character she was playing had a fever.

60|$|He rose, and in {{that instant}} of dignity I foresaw what was never to be--lawn sleeves {{encasing}} those loose, black arms. He had somehow wafted <b>me</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> Confirmation.|$|E
60|$|Those words {{did more}} than {{surprise}} <b>me.</b> They brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mind, in a flash, the three jugglers, and Penelope's notion that they meant some mischief to Mr. Franklin Blake.|$|R
