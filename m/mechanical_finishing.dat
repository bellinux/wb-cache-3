40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{finishing}} {{and polishing}} phases {{are essential to}} improve smoothness and shining {{on the surface of}} acrylic resins used to make removable orthodontic appliances. A good surface finishing reduces roughness, which facilitates hygiene, prevents staining and provides greater comfort to the patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to analyze the changes on surface morphology of acrylic resins during finishing and polishing phases. METHODS: Thirty discs (10 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length) were made with acrylic resin and randomly divided into ten groups. The control group did not receive any treatment while the other groups received gradual finishing and polishing. The last group received the entire finishing and polishing procedures. Surface morphology was qualitatively analyzed through scanning electron microscopy and quantitatively analyzed through a laser profilometer test. RESULTS: The acrylic resin surfaces without treatment showed bubbles which were not observed in the subsequent phases. Wearing out with multilaminated burs, finishing with wood sandpaper and finishing with water sandpaper resulted in surfaces with decreasing irregularities. The surfaces that were polished with pumice and with low abrasive liquids showed high superficial smoothness.

40|$|Abstract. Electrochemical buffing {{technology}} (ECB) applies electrochemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>finishing</b> {{characteristics in}} the surface finishing process. ECB can buff ultrahigh purity components to make them shine, without leaving residual stress, micro-cracks, and etc. The control parameters of the ECB process include current density, the rate of revolution of the buffing head, the buffing pressure on the surface, the concentration of electrolyte, the buffing time and others. Improper control parameter setting in the process will result in unsatisfactory surface quality. It is necessary to determine optimal control parameters of an ECB process with robust performance that can insure surface quality and process reliability. In this study, parametric analyses were conducted on electrochemical buffing technology. An ECB system with a CNC machine was established. The buffing head was clamped on the tool holder of the CNC machine. It was used {{on a flat surface}} for automatic surface buffing. Taguchiâ²s parameter design approach is employed to evaluate signal-to-noise ratios (SN) given from various levels of these factors. Then, the optimized control parameters will be recognized thus can get the optimal surface buffing, reducing with the lowest variability.

Combined wear-corrosion experiments were performed using a reciprocating ball-on-plate apparatus equipped with an electrochemical cell.
