The purpose of this work was to apply the second law of thermodynamics and entropy generation minimisation to optimise these geometries using an optimisation method. The dynamic trajectory optimisation method was used and off-the-shelf micro-turbines and a range of parabolic dish concentrator diameters were considered. A modified cavity receiver was used in the analysis with an assumed cavity wall construction method of either a circular tube or a rectangular channel. A maximum temperature constraint of 1 200 K was set for the receiver surface temperature. A counterflow plate-type recuperator was considered and the recuperator length was constrained to the length of the radius of the concentrator. Systems producing a steady-state net power output of 2 – 100 kW were analysed. The effect of various conditions, such as wind, receiver inclination and concentrator rim angle on the <b>maximum</b> <b>net</b> <b>power</b> output, and optimum {{geometry of}} the system were investigated. Forty-five different micro-turbines and seven concentrator diameters between 6 and 18 metres were considered. Results show the optimum geometries, optimum operating conditions and minimum entropy generation as a function of the system mass flow rate. The optimum receiver tube diameter was relatively large when compared with the receiver size. The optimum counterflow plate-type recuperator channel aspect ratio is a linear function of the optimum system mass flow rate for a constant recuperator height. The optimum recuperator length and optimum NTU are small at small system mass flow rates but increase as the system mass flow rate increases until the length constraint is reached. For the optimised systems with <b>maximum</b> <b>net</b> <b>power</b> output, the solar receiver is the main contributor to the total rate of minimum entropy generation. The contributions from the recuperator, compressor and turbine are next in line.

When a black cavity receiver is mounted at the focus of a parabolic dish concentrator, the reflected light is absorbed and converted into a heat source. The second law of thermodynamics and entropy generation minimisation are applied to optimise the geometries of the recuperator and receiver. The irreversibilities in the recuperative solar thermal Brayton cycle are mainly due to heat transfer across a finite temperature difference and fluid friction. In a small‐scale open and direct solar thermal Brayton cycle with a micro‐turbine operating at its highest compressor efficiency, the geometries of a cavity receiver and counterflow‐plated recuperator can be optimised in such a way that the system produces <b>maximum</b> <b>net</b> <b>power</b> output. A modified cavity receiver is used in the analysis, and parabolic dish concentrator diameters of 6 to 18 m are considered. Two cavity construction methods are compared. Results show that the maximum thermal efficiency of the system is a function of the solar concentrator diameter and choice of micro‐turbine. The optimum receiver tube diameter is relatively large when compared with the receiver size. The optimum recuperator channel aspect ratio for the highest <b>maximum</b> <b>net</b> <b>power</b> output of a micro‐turbine is a linear function of the system mass flow rate for a constant recuperator height.

40|$|We {{present a}} generic {{methodology}} for organic Rankine cycle optimization, where the working fluid is included as an optimization parameter, {{in order to}} maximize the net power output of the cycle. The method is applied on two optimization cases with hot fluid inlet temperatures at 120 °C and 90 °C. Pure fluids and mixtures are compared to see how mixed working fluids affect performance and important design parameters. The results indicate that mixed working fluids can increase the net power output of the cycle, while reducing the pressure levels.

40|$|The {{combined}} {{sugar and}} ethanol production process from sugar cane is a paradigmatic application for energy integration strategies {{because of the}} high number of hot and cold streams involved, the external hot utility requirement at two temperature levels for juice evaporation and crystallization, and the electricity demand for juice extraction by milling.

The strategies, tools and expertise on energy integration developed separately by the research teams authoring this paper are applied here jointly to optimize the synthesis and the design parameters of the process and of the total site starting from the basic idea of dissociating the heat exchanger network design problem from the total site synthesis problem. At first the minimization of the external heat requirement for the process alone is pursued and results show that a one third reduction can be achieved by optimal heat integration.

40|$|An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a {{thermodynamic}} cycle {{that is particularly}} well-suited for waste heat recovery. It is generally employed for waste heat with temperatures {{in the range of}} 80 °C – 300 °C. When the application is strictly to convert waste heat into work with no restrictions on heat source exit temperature, thermal efficiency is not as relevant as other aspects of the cycle performance. In such an application, maximization of <b>net</b> <b>power</b> may be the objective rather than maximization of thermal efficiency. An air-cooled ORC for waste-heat conversion is studied in the present work. Two alternative cycle configurations which could increase the <b>net</b> <b>power</b> produced from a heat source with a given temperature and flow rate are proposed and analyzed. These cycle configurations are: • An ORC with two-phase flash expansion • An ORC with a zeotropic working fluid mixture (ZRC) A simplified ORC model is introduced which calculates the pinch point in the heat exchangers based on a specified minimum temperature difference. This model is used to assess the merits of each cycle configuration with respect to a baseline ORC when the finite capacity of the heat source and heat sink fluids is considered. The finite capacity of the heat sink fluid is incorporated into the model in terms of a condenser fan power requirement. Of all working fluids studied for the baseline ORC, R 134 a and R 245 fa result in the highest <b>net</b> <b>power.</b> The ORC with two-phase flash expansion offers the most improvement over the baseline cycle provided the expander can handle two-phase flow at the same isentropic efficiency as in the baseline case. Relative improvements are highest at low source temperatures. The <b>maximum</b> increase in <b>net</b> <b>power</b> is 84 % over the baseline ORC when water is the working fluid at a source temperature of 80 °C. At low source temperatures, the improvements decrease with increasing condenser fan power requirements. The improvements of the ZRC are also higher for low heat source temperatures. The ZRC shows improvement between 20 % and 40 % over the baseline as long as the condenser fan power is not negligible. At the highest estimated condenser fan power, the ZRC shows up to 92 % improvement at a source temperature of 100 °C, while the ORC with flash expansion is no longer beneficial. This work represents a first step toward identifying a more optimal ORC configuration for waste heat recovery.
