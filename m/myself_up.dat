She {{believes}} in extensive preparations for a role: [...] " [...] fill <b>myself</b> <b>up</b> {{with as much}} history of the character as I can".

500|$|After McCain and Palin were {{defeated}} in the general election, a Republican campaign advisor told The New York Times that the McCain Campaign was not happy about the prank, which caused friction between McCain and Palin. McCain and his advisors were allegedly upset that Palin did not tell them beforehand that she planned to speak with who she thought was Nicolas Sarkozy. McCain strategist Steve Schmidt called a meeting and demanded to know who let Palin talk to the fake Sarkozy without checking with senior advisors first. Steve Biegun, one of Palin's aides admitting to vetting the call without speaking to campaign advisors or the U.S. State Department, told the Los Angeles Times that [...] "No one's going to beat me up more than I beat <b>myself</b> <b>up</b> for setting up the governor like that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1808, Champollion {{received}} a scare when French Archeologist Alexandre Lenoir published {{the first of}} his four volumes on Nouvelles Explications des Hieroglyphes. making the young scholar fear that his budding work had already been surpassed. But he was relieved to find that Lenoir still operated under the assumption that the hieroglyphs were mystic symbols and not a literary system expressing language. This experience made him even more determined {{to be the first to}} decipher the language and he began dedicating himself even more to the study of Coptic, writing in 1809 to his brother: [...] "I give <b>myself</b> <b>up</b> entirely to Coptic... I wish to know Egyptian like my French, because on that language will be based my great work on the Egyptian papyri." [...] That same year, he was appointed to his first academic post, in history and politics at the University of Grenoble.|$|E

500|$|Before the fight, sports writers {{considered}} Gomez a tough opponent for Khan, {{with his}} [...] "knockout punch" [...] and his success against Alex Arthur in similar circumstances, despite having lost {{three of his}} last six fights. Gomez saw the fight {{as an opportunity to}} reignite his career; in an interview shortly before the fight he spoke of how [...] "his fight really is my last chance to set <b>myself</b> <b>up</b> for life and become known in every household in Britain". At the same time, he reflected on the positive effects of his career in the ring, saying [...] "Boxing kept my feet on the ground and gave me a focus.

Gomez lives with his wife Alison and their three children in Manchester.|$|E
500|$|The demo {{was sent}} to {{producer}} Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. [...] "I guess {{to see if he}} made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day," [...] remembers Afanasieff. [...] "He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can {{to put it on the}} album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by <b>myself</b> <b>up</b> until that time." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{late spring}} 1942, Andrić {{sent a message}} of sympathy to Draža Mihailović, {{the leader of the}} royalist Chetniks, one of two {{resistance}} movements vying for power in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia, the other being Josip Broz Tito's communist Partisans. In 1944, Andrić was forced to leave his friend's apartment during the Allied bombing of Belgrade and evacuate the city. As he joined a column of refugees, he became ashamed that he was fleeing by himself, in contrast to the masses of people accompanied by their children, spouses and infirm parents. [...] "I looked <b>myself</b> <b>up</b> and down," [...] he wrote, [...] "and saw I was saving only myself and my overcoat." [...] In the ensuing months, Andrić refused to leave the apartment, even during the heaviest bombing. That October, the Red Army and the Partisans drove the Germans out of Belgrade, and Tito proclaimed himself Yugoslavia's ruler.|$|E

500|$|At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Peirsol won two gold medals. [...] In {{his first}} event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol {{surprised}} many after {{he failed to}} make the final, which he attributed to a miscalculation of his own position in the semi-finals. [...] Peirsol said, [...] "I thought I was going faster. [...] I am very disappointed. I completely misjudged my race. I have to go on, pick <b>myself</b> <b>up</b> and focus on my next events." [...] But Peirsol's world record in the 100-meter backstroke would stay in place after the final. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won the gold in a time of 1:51.92, breaking his own world record of 1:53.08 by more than a second. Peirsol then competed in the 50-meter backstroke but did not advance past the heats. In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Eric Shanteau, Michael Phelps, and David Walters to win gold in a world record time of 3:27.28, lowering the old mark of 3:29.34 set a year ago in Beijing.

500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one of my colleagues told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but I really think I beat <b>myself</b> <b>up</b> horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E
