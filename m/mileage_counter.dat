5000|$|Introduced for 1980 models, an {{optional}} resettable trip meter was installed on speedometers and the <b>mileage</b> <b>counter</b> {{was moved to}} the top of the speedometer as part of the optional Sport Instrumentation Group. The Sport Instrumentation Group also included the optional tachometer in the center of the cluster, as well as oil and ammeter gauges. In 1984, the body moulding and interior trim were updated. In 1985-1986 models, the upper accent mouldings were moved below the front marker. For 1985, the rear tailgate moulding on XLT models was updated and previewed the design of the 1987 model. This molding has become increasingly rare and fetches a high price. A cargo light was available as an option and was included in the Light Group option package. (A Combination Stop/cargo lamp was not required until September 1, 1993 for the 1994 year model.) ...|$|E
40|$|In Transactional Memory (TM), a {{conflict}} {{occurs when a}} memory block is accessed concurrently by two or more trans-actions {{and at least one}} of them is a write access. The man-agement of conflicts significantly impacts TM performance. There are two alternative approaches for managing conflicts: Reactive Contention Management (RCM) [1] and Proactive Contention Management (PCM) [2]. Previous contention management schemes treat all transactions with no weights, and make a decision based on the information provided by the running transaction instance. In this work, we suggest that all critical sections (trans-actions) are not equally performance-critical. Among the transactions from a program, some transactions are more important than others with respect to the performance of the implemented algorithm; e. g., the producer transaction in the producer-consumer relationship. It is worthy to dis-tinguish the performance-critical transactions from others for speeding up the overall execution. For this purpose, we propose a mileage technique and show its effectiveness in the contexts of RCM and PCM. To express the criticality of transactions, we define new in-structions, MILEAGE and MRSTCNT. MILEAGE has one oper-and, mileage id (mid). A mid indicates how far a thread pro-gresses and monotonically increases during the program ex-ecution. Each processor has a mileage unit. A mileage unit maintains the current mid and a <b>mileage</b> <b>counter</b> (mcnt), which tracks the number of times that MILEAGE has been ex-ecuted with the current mid as its operand. When MILEAGE with a new mid is shown, that mid is stored in the mid register and the mcnt register is cleared. Every time the same mid appears again, the mcnt register is incremented.

Its products are generally used on commercial tractor-trailers and include hub oil seals, axle fasteners, hub caps, wheel bearings, <b>mileage</b> <b>counters,</b> king pin kits, suspension kits, brake friction, lightweight brake drums, foundation brake parts and automatic brake adjusters.|$|R
