Dalam proses miniaturisasi dengan proses cold upset forging ada beberapa jenis cacat yang mungkin terjadi pada produk yang dihasilkan seperti cacat dimensi, buckling, cacat lipatan, cacat pada kualitas permukaan. Cacat produk bisa disebabkan oleh faktor dari {{material}} bahan baku, kesalahan set up proses, serta adanya cacat pada cetakan. 	 Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk menganalisa penyebab cacat dimensi pada miniatur produk hasil dari proses cold upset forging Aluminium 1100. Untuk mencapai tujuan penelitian, metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah dengan eksperimen dan analisa dengan Metode Elemen Hingga. 	Dari hasil penelitian dapat disimpulkan penyebab cacat dimensi pada miniatur produk dari proses cold upset forging adalah adanya perubahan dimensi dan penampang pada cetakan yang telah melebihi batas toleransi yang disyaratkan. Perubahan dimensi dan penampang cetakan menimbulkan efek lanjutan yang juga berpengaruh pada pencapaian dimensi head produk, diantaranya kurangnya volume material benda kerja untuk bisa mencukupi volume yang diperlukan oleh cetakan, gaya upsetting yang bekerja pada material untuk pembentukan head (pada area top die) menjadi berkurang serta proses deformasi terhambat karena timbulnya cacat lipatan selama proses. Kata Kunci: cold upset forging, cacat dimensi, FEM, miniaturisasi In modern fabrication technologies, the miniaturization trend is increasing. One {{of the processes}} used for miniaturization is cold upset forging process. In the process of miniaturization with cold upset forging, there are several types of defedts that may occur in the product such as dimensional defect, buckling, folds, and surface quality defect. In the cold upset forging process, product defects {{can be caused by}} factors from raw materials, the error of set up process, and the presence of defects in the dies 	The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the dimensions of defects that occur on the <b>miniature</b> <b>product</b> in the process of cold upset forging of Aluminium 1100. To achieve the research objectives, Finite Element Method and experiment is used to achieve the purpose of this study. 	From the results of the study concluded that the main factor that caused the dimensinal defect of the <b>miniature</b> <b>product</b> is the change in the dimensions of the dies which exceeds the tolerance limit. Change in the dimensions of the dies also effects the others factor that have influence to the achievement of the head produk dimension too, such as the material volume of the workpiece cannot fulfil the volume that dies needed, The upsetting load that worked on the workpiece is reduce, and the deformation process is slow down because of the folding defect was present.

40|$|Thumbnails are {{typically}} <b>miniature</b> <b>product</b> images displayed on one {{page of a}} Web site and hyperlinked to other pages in the site. As a type of online product display, thumbnails are used to attract Web surfers to enter the internal environment (i. e., internal pages) of a virtual store. Thumbnails are often organized in rectangular arrays; when consumers view such an array, the rectangular configuration is likely to activate an eye-movement (scanning) routine in the consumers' memory that causes them to scan the array {{in a manner similar}} to their reading of text. The presence of the routine and its influence on consumers' scanning of thumbnails are supported by the results of an eye-tracking experiment reported in this article. The experiment shows that consumers process information in the middle and left regions of a thumbnail array to a greater extent than they do in the right regions, and that they can find a particular product more quickly if it is placed in the middle and left regions. As expected, the results are consistent with the dominant reading direction of the participants in the experiment. In demonstrating differing levels of processing for items located across an array, the findings have significant marketing implications. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and Direct Marketing Educational Foundation, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Surface {{texture of}} a part or a product has {{significant}} effects on its functionality, physical-mechanical properties and visual appearance. In particular for <b>miniature</b> <b>products,</b> the implication of surface quality becomes critical owing {{to the presence of}} geometrical features with micro/nano-scale dimensions. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of surface texture are carried out predominantly by profile parameters, which are often insufficient to address the contribution of constituent spatial components with varied amplitudes and wavelengths. In this context, this article presents a novel approach for advanced measurement and analysis of profile average roughness (Ra) and its spatial distribution at different wavelength intervals. The applicability of the proposed approach was verified for three different surface topographies prepared by grinding, laser micro-polishing and micro-milling processes. From the measurement and analysis results, Ra(3 ̆bb) spatial distribution was found to be an effective measure of revealing the contributions of various spatial components within specific wavelength intervals towards formation of the entire surface profile. In addition, the approach was extended to the measurement and analysis of areal average roughness Sa(3 ̆bb) spatial distribution within different wavelength intervals. Besides, the proposed method was demonstrated to be a useful technique in developing a functional correlation between a manufacturing process and its corresponding surface profile.

40|$|International audienceThe {{last decade}} was {{characterized}} by an important increase in the request concerning <b>miniature</b> <b>products.</b> Nowadays, the miniaturization of the products represents major strategic and economic stakes. Economic surveys expect an important increase in the needs for MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) and MOEMS (Micro Opto Electro Mechanical Systems) in various fields. Components used in MEMS {{are different from those}} used in microelectronics technology. Micromanipulation of flat SMD (Surface Mounted Devices) electronic components has been successfully done using vacuum handling systems. However, components used in MEMS have electrical, mechanical, optical or fluidic functions. These components have complex 3 D shapes. This is why new micromanipulation technologies must be developed taking into account the specificities of these new components. One of the most important functions is the gripping of microcomponents. In order to fulfil the demands concerning microhandling, various laboratories have developed prototypes of microgrippers. Most of them are able to handle micro-objects in a narrow range of sizes. Moreover, these grippers are rarely equipped with precise sensors for force measurement. However, measuring the force applied by the gripper on the manipulated object is very important in order to avoid damaging or destroying the object. In this paper we present the design and the control of a microgripper dedicated to very high precision tasks. This microgripper is able to handle small components {{in a wide range of}} sizes (from 100 µm to several mm). The object handled can be moved laterally on several cm with force control...|$|R

Only two hotels out of 28 hotels under consideration were into innovations. This implies that at current level of patronage, hotel managers could still achieve {{the same level of}} patronage by cutting down the level of innovation activities. The Middle cluster results show that only two 1 -star hotels were operating at efficiency level of innovation with a score of one. The remaining 46 hotels are operating at inefficiencies level, which means innovative activities are not inculcated in the business plan of the hotels. Concerning the three clusters, Coastal was involved with almost all the service, process, marketing and management rated innovation variables. These innovations are room service, front desk 24 -h services, guest amenities daily replenishment, bed & breakfast, WIFI, online booking, airport/bus terminal pick-up, 24 -h reservation line, checking -in procedure, qualified owner/manager, qualified of operating staff, R&D activities, T&D of staff, active website, customized <b>miniature</b> <b>products,</b> uniform staff, conference room, CSR activities, following up customers. This confirms (Krstic et al., 2015; Malik, 2013; Smith et al., 2015) that for small hotel to be abreast with current trends of business, it needs to upgrade its technology and be efficient. Though responses from coastal zone show that SH encourages some level of innovations, the findings reveal that most hotels are operating at unproductive level by not inculcating service innovations, process innovations, marketing innovations, management innovations in the small hotels. This implies that managers can cut down these excesses and still achieve the same level of patronage. The results show a seamless positive correlation between innovation strategies and hotel patronage which can lead to growth of the business. That is, an increase in the level of innovation strategies would result in an increase in hotel patronage and vice versa as this performance which eventually leads to customer retention. The adoption of innovation strategies should be done at resourceful level to keep the SH in business and grow as well.|$|R
40|$|The use of microrobotics in high {{throughput}} {{and precise}} characterization of objects at microscale has been noticeably increased during recent years. Microrobotics {{has provided a}} significant added value to multiple realms e. g. biomedical research, bio-based industry, microassembly of <b>miniature</b> <b>products,</b> etc. Recently, the use of microrobotic technology in paper industry has been also commenced for measuring properties at the single fibre level. There is a large interest in the measurement of different loading modes of individual fibre-fibre bonds in pulp and paper/board industry. Among the four different modes of loading, it would be desirable for papermaking companies and paper converting companies to obtain the Z-directional strength of pulp and paper. Indeed, the Z-directional properties affect compressive properties, and accordingly the performance of structural paperboard products. Several methods {{have been developed to}} measure the Z-directional strength at a handsheet level; however, there is not any reported device capable of the Z-directional fibre-fibre bond strength measurement at a fibre level. This thesis work presents a novel method for the experimental evaluation of the Z-directional bond strength using microrobotics and a Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film microforce sensor. Due to the special dynamics of PVDF microforce sensors, the effect of the deformation rate on the performance of the sensor is studied. The Z-directional fibre-fibre bond strength experiments have been performed successfully for unrefined and refined bleached softwood Kraft pulp fibres. Besides, paper scientists are interested in microfibril angle changes during and after application of the Z-directional force. Indeed, there is interest in simultaneous measurement of microfibril angle and mechanical properties such as Z-directional bond strength. To address this need, a microfibril angle measurements system based on microscopic transmission ellipsometry is developed and integrated to the microrobotic platform. The results from both Z-directional bond strength and microfibril angle measurement are promising. In summary, the first concept for simultaneous measurement of microfibril angle and mechanical properties such as Z-directional bond strength at the individual fibre level is developed during this thesis work which has a high practical impact on the fibre characterization research field...|$|R

40|$|In a time {{of fierce}} global competition, where an immense amount of {{commercial}} messages reaches consumers around the clock and in every conceivable context, companies constantly seek {{to find new ways}} to reach out with their product. One way to do so, that has increased in popularity in recent years, is the use of gift bags. A gift bag may contain samples, <b>miniature</b> <b>products</b> and even products in full size, as a rule from several different brands, which the recipient receives free of charge. The gift bag is typically distributed at some form of event, such as store openings, fashion shows, theme parties and the like, and the receiver of the gift bag can then evaluate the content without any obligation to purchase. The ambition of the companies that choose to participate with their products in a gift bag is, of course, that the recipient will find their products satisfactory, and ideally, that he or she will continue to consume the brand in the future. There are numerous scientific research contributions related to the use of free samples, but very few that concern the gift bag, where a collection of samples from different sources and brands appear. The ambition of this study is to investigate how the conditions change when a free sample is exposed to competition from samples from other companies. The study has a qualitative approach, and consists of interviews with companies that use, or have used, gift bags as a marketing channel, along with an interview with a focus group consisting of people with experience of participating in various events where gift bags occur. The study concludes that marketing through the use of gift bags can have several positive effects for the participating brands. These are, for example, increased brand awareness and an increase in sales. However, it is of importance to evaluate the competing brands participating in the gift bag, as well as the context in which it will be distributed. The study shows that the size of the sample is of importance, since the receiver tends to notice more voluminous samples over smaller ones. Also, the presence of more established brands can have a positive effect on less well-known brands, as their credit will enhance the other participating products. It is important to note that this is only true for samples that are not of the same product category. If this is the case, they will instead be in direct competition with each other. ...|$|R

The important {{finding of this study}} is that the constitutive model used has a major impact on dynamic response of solder joint stress and strain results. It was expected that the strain-rate dependent plastic model gave better correlation results than the simple elastic model or bilinear plastic model. In addition to solder material properties, many other factors, including package locations on the PCB, boundary conditions, input-G level, PCB thickness and solder materials, were also simulated to investigate their effects on stress strain performance of solder joint. Comparing to clamped boundary, the 4 -screw support condition leads to higher stress level in solder joint. Higher input G-level results in higher solder stress due to larger inertial force and deflection effects on solder joint. The thinner PCB and softer solder can improve the drop performance of board-level electronic assembly. 1...|$|R

Eriko Tsuji wrote an article about the Theodore Psalter and the appearance of the image of a pelican, [...] " [...] Where both the Chludov (Moscow, Historical Museum, 129d) and the Barberini Psalters show a bird nesting on a column as an illustration of Psalms 103:17 ("There the sparrows will build their nests; and the house of the heron takes the lead among them," [...] the Theodore Psalter has precisely the same composition at Psalms 101:7, [...] "I have become like a pelican of the wilderness; I have become like an owl in the ruined house"). Theodore must have moved the miniature intentionally because he added a new motif instead of the bird on a column as an illustration of Psalms 103:17. The illustration of the bird on a column was regarded as a pelican in the Theodore Psalter because of the relationship to the word [...] "Pelican" [...] in the text. Though the miniature of the pelican itself is now lost, we have a photograph of the miniature of Crucifixion interpreting a fable of the pelican.

40|$|High {{precision}} <b>miniature</b> and micro <b>products</b> which possess 3 D complex structures or free-form {{surfaces are}} now being widely used in industry. These micro products require to be fabricated by several machining processes and the integration of these various machining processes onto one machine becomes necessary since this will help reduce realignment errors and also increase the machining efficiency. This thesis describes the development and testing of several hybrid machining approaches for machines which are typically used to produce micro products such as micro fluidic moulds, solar concentrator moulds, micro grooves in brittle materials and micro structured milling cutters. These are: (a) micro milling and laser deburring; (b) micro grinding involving laser pre-heating; (c) micro milling and laser polishing. The hybrid micro milling/ laser deburring process was tested during the fabrication of a micro fluidic injection mould. Micro burrs on the channel of micro fluidic mould generated during micro milling were completely removed by developed laser deburring process. This approach can achieve a good surface finish on a micro fluidic mould. The hybrid laser assisted micro grinding process was investigated by fabricating a set of micro grooves on brittle materials, including Al 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4. The workpiece was pre-heated by laser to increase its temperature above that of the brittle to ductile transition phase interface. It was found that lower cutting forces were apparent in the grinding process when used to machine brittle materials. It was also found that laser assisted grinding helped achieve a very good surface finish and reduced subsurface damage. The final hybrid machining approach tested involved micro milling and laser polishing to fabricate solar concentrator moulds. Such a mould requires a good surface finish in order to accurately guide light focusing on a target. The laser polishing process was successfully used to remove any unwanted cutting marks generated by a previous micro milling process. Abstract iii As a novel extension to this hybrid machine world, a focussed ion beam (FIB) fabrication approach was researched regarding the generation of microstructures on the rake faces of milling cutters {{with the aim of}} reducing cutter cutting forces and increasing tool life. The tool wear resistance performance of these microstructured tools was evaluated through three sets of slot milling trials on a NAK 80 specimen with the results indicating that micro structured micro milling cutters of this kind can effectively improve the tool wear resistance performance. A microstructure in a direction perpendicular to the cutting edge was found to be the best structure for deferring tool wear and obtaining prolonged tool life. This approach can potentially be further integrated into a hybrid precision machine such that micro structure cutters can be fabricated in-situ using a laser machining process. The conceptual design of a 5 -axis hybrid machine which incorporates micro milling, grinding and laser machining has been proposed as a test-bed for the above hybrid micro machining approach. Through finite element analysis, the best configuration was found to be a closed-loop vertical machine which has one rotary stage on the worktable and another on machining head. In this thesis, the effectiveness of these novel hybrid machining approaches have been fully demonstrated through machining several microproducts. Recommendations for future work are suggested to focus on further scientific understanding of hybrid machining processes, the development of a laser repairing approach and the integration of a controller for the proposed hybrid machine...|$|R
