5|$|Arafat's {{ability to}} adapt to new {{tactical}} and political situations was perhaps tested {{by the rise of}} the Hamas and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel. These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as <b>malls</b> <b>and</b> movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties. In the 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood.|$|E

5|$|The 1993 {{annexation}} made London one of {{the largest}} urban municipalities in Ontario. Intense commercial and residential development is presently occurring in the southwest and northwest areas of the city. Opponents of this development cite urban sprawl, destruction of rare Carolinian zone forest and farm lands, replacement of distinctive regions by generic <b>malls,</b> <b>and</b> standard transportation and pollution concerns as major issues facing London. The City of London is currently the eleventh-largest urban area in Canada, eleventh-largest census metropolitan area in Canada, and the sixth-largest city in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|With new {{suburban}} developments beckoning, {{many white}} middle-class residents {{moved out of}} the city along new highway routes, and Norfolk's population declined, a pattern repeated in numerous cities during the postwar era independently of segregation issues. In the late-1960s and early-1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's Granby Street commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. The opening of <b>malls</b> <b>and</b> large shopping centers drew off retail business from Granby Street.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{possibility}} of aftershocks, police evacuated shopping <b>malls</b> <b>and</b> office buildings around the city. Essential organisations in the area were evacuated as a safety precaution, including the police headquarters and offices of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. At Christchurch International Airport, officials halted operations after the earthquake, but all flights resumed later that day. Months before the event, a severe magnitude 6.3 earthquake occurred in a similar area adjacent to Christchurch, causing widespread destruction and fatalities in the city. Concerns arose about the condition of previously damaged structures, and the 13 June earthquakes caused further distress among many victims. Dozens of dissatisfied residents were expected {{to move out of the}} city, and many others sought professional help for anxiety and depression-related issues.|$|E

5|$|Before Joy struck Australia, {{residents}} {{evacuated from}} resorts on Fitzroy and Green islands by boat or plane. Officials set up evacuation centres {{on the mainland}} and put the Australian Army on standby. The military evacuated its fleet of Blackhawk helicopters inland from RAAF Base Townsville. A man required rescue from Hope Island by helicopter {{in advance of the}} storm. The threat of the storm caused shopping <b>malls</b> <b>and</b> the airport near Cairns to close just before Christmas. Several flights were diverted or delayed, stranding about 1,000travellers, many of whom spent Christmas in the airport. Road travel was banned in some areas of northeastern Queensland, and residents in Port Douglas were forced to evacuate. The Flood Warning Centre in Brisbane issued 192flood warnings related to Cyclone Joy in December and January, beginning on 23December. Most of the warnings were related to increased water levels along rivers.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, an {{existing}} tropical storm watch was extended northward to the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. The next day, {{a tropical storm}} warning was extended northward to Plymouth, Massachusetts, but was soon replaced by a hurricane warning.

In Connecticut, utility companies readied supplies and emergency crews {{in advance of the}} hurricane. In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with the anticipation of heavy rains, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) prepared to send eight teams into the field to take measurements along 30 rivers. Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond advised residents to prepare for the storm's onslaught. The storm disrupted many residents' travel plans in the state, while people evacuated from certain coastal communities.

5|$|The route heads {{through some}} {{residential}} neighborhoods before entering a commercial area with strip <b>malls</b> <b>and</b> some high-rise buildings where White Flint Mall, {{once one of}} the D.C. metropolitan area's largest shopping malls, was located {{on the east side of}} the road.
