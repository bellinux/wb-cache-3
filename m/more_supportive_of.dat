5|$|Events in {{the world}} {{appeared}} to play into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War and the Austro-Turkish War); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War). At first, King Poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain Russian support for the reforms; they attempted to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans {{as an opportunity to}} strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line of reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. With the new Polish-Prussian alliance seeming to provide security against Russian intervention, King Poniatowski drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. This alliance was also helped as the 1790 elections were <b>more</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> the royal faction then Potocki's; and the conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten the reformers if they were to stay divided. With the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, Potocki and Poniatowski begun to reach a consensus on a more constitutional monarchy approach, and started to draft a constitutional document.|$|E

Research suggests that despite living in a society often hostile to them, Black adolescents have Selves that is at least as strong as Whites. Using Add Health data, a nationally representative sample of Black (N= 652) and White (N= 1592) girls I explore racial differences in self-concepts in U. S. adolescent females. Drawing on Rosenberg's contextual theory and Black Feminist theory, this study posits that black mothers' unique socialization of their daughters may help to explain Black girls' advantaged Selves. Black girls are significantly better off than white girls on measures of the Self, and mothers' socialization may help explain some of the race differences. Black mothers were found to be <b>more</b> <b>supportive,</b> <b>more</b> encouraging <b>of</b> daughters' independence, and to have higher academic aspirations for their daughters.
