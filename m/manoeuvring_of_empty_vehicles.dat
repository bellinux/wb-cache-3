40|$|In this paper, an {{original}} heuristic algorithm <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> management in {{personal rapid transit}} network is presented. The algorithm {{is used for the}} delivery <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> for waiting passengers, for balancing the distribution <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> within the network, and for providing an <b>empty</b> space for <b>vehicles</b> approaching a station. Each of these tasks involves a decision on the trip {{that has to be done}} by a selected <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> from its actual location to some determined destination. The decisions are based on a multi-parameter function involving a set of factors and thresholds. An important feature of the algorithm is that it does not use any central database of passenger input (demand) and locations of free vehicles. Instead, it is based on the local exchange of data between stations: on their states and on the vehicles they expect. Therefore, it seems well-tailored for a distributed implementation. The algorithm is uniform, meaning that the same basic procedure is used for multiple tasks using a task-specific set of parameters. Comment: 22 pages, 6 figures, 5 table...|$|R

40|$|Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) takes {{passenger}} {{parties on}} demand direct to their desired destination. <b>Empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{need to be}} moved to stations with waiting passengers or with expected demand. Efficient redistribution <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> is critical in larger PRT networks where running times are longer than acceptable waiting-times. We have previously developed methods for allocating destinations to <b>empty</b> PRT <b>vehicles</b> sequentially as they become available. In this paper the allocation <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>vehicles</b> is refined into three stages. The first stage is essentially the previous sequential allocation.

The optimization problem in the third stage corresponds to the transportation problem and it is solved approximately by a heuristic method suggested by Russel. Applied to a network with 25 stations, 16 kilometers of guide-way and 200 vehicles the combined reallocation methods reduced average waiting and the longest wait to about half compared with sequential decisions alone.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{new techniques}} to enhance Automated Transit Networks (ATN, previously called Personal Rapid Transit - PRT) based on Artificial Intelligence tools. The main direction is {{improvement of the}} cooperation of autonomous modules that use negotiation protocols, following the IoT paradigm. One of the goals is to increase ATN system throughput by tuning up autonomous vehicles cooperation. Machine learning (ML) was used to improve algorithms designed by human programmers. We used "existing controls" corresponding to near-optimal solutions and built refinement models to more accurately relate a system's dynamics to its performance.

Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of RGZ in a rat model of periodontal disease induced by ligature placed around the mandible first molars of each animal. Male Wister rats were divided into four groups: 1) animals without ligature placement receiving administration <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> (control); 2) animals with ligature receiving administration <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> vehicle; 3) animals with ligature receiving administration with oral RGZ (10 mg/kg/day); and 4) animals with ligature receiving administration of subcutaneous RGZ (10 mg/kg/day). Thirty days after induction of periodontal disease, the animals were sacrificed, and mandibles and gingival tissues were removed for further analysis. An in vitro assay was also employed to test the inhibitory effects of RGZ on osteoclastogenesis. Histomorphological and immunohistochemical analyses of periodontal tissue demonstrated that RGZ-treated animals presented decreased bone resorption, along with reduced RANKL expression, compared to those animals with ligature, but treated with <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Corresponding to such results obtained from in vivo experiments, RGZ also suppressed in vitro osteoclast differentiation {{in the presence of}} RANKL in MOCP- 5 osteoclast precursor cells, along with the down-regulation of the expression of RANKL-induced TRAP mRNA.

40|$|City {{logistics}} planning involves {{organizing the}} movement of goods in urban areas carried out by logistics operators. The loading and routing of goods are critical components of these operations. Efficient utilization of vehicle space and limiting number <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> movements can strongly impact the nuisances created by goods delivery vehicles in urban areas. We consider an integrated problem of routing and loading known as the three-dimensional loading capacitated vehicle routing problem (3 L-CVRP). 3 L-CVRP consists of finding feasible routes with the minimum total travel cost while satisfying customers’ demands {{expressed in terms of}} cuboid and weighted items. Practical constraints related to connectivity, stability, fragility, and LIFO are considered as parts of the problem. We address the problem in two stages. Firstly, we address the three-dimensional (3 D) loading problem followed by 3 L-CVRP. The main objective of a 3 D loading problem without routing aspect is finding the best way of packing 3 D items into vehicles or containers to increase the loading factor with the purpose <b>of</b> minimizing <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> movements. We present the general linear programming model to the pure three-dimensional vehicle loading problem and solve it by CPLEX. To deal with large-sized instances, Column Generation (CG) technique is applied. The designed method in this work outperforms the best existing techniques in the literature. The 3 DVLP with allocation and capacity constraints, called 3 DVLP-AC, is also considered. For the 3 DVLP-AC, CPLEX could handle moderate-sized instances with up to 40 customers. To deal with large-sized instances, a Tabu Search (TS) heuristic algorithm is developed. There are no solution methods or lower bounds (LBs) for the 3 DVLP-AC existent in the literature by which to evaluate the TS results. Therefore, we evaluate our TS with the CPLEX results for small instances. 3 L-CVRP is addressed by using CG technique. To generate new columns, the pricing problem that is part of CG is solved by using two approaches: 1 -by means of shortest path problem with resource constraints (ESPPRC) and loading problem, and 2 -a heuristic pricing method (HP). CG using HP with a simple scheme can attain solutions competitive with the efficient TS algorithms described in the literature. ...|$|R

40|$|Transport {{operators}} worldwide need {{to focus}} on how they can implement automated vehicles in their schedules in the coming years. Automated vehicles are particularly suited for use in demand-responsive transport, which is often modeled as a Dial-a-Ride problem. This report investigates how public transport demand forecasts can be used to improve the routing of vehicles in the Dial-a-Ride problem. In particular, two improvements to solutions of the Dial-a-Ride problem are investigated. The first, <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> rerouting, deals with the relocation of vehicles that are currently idle, which has been studied before. The second, demand rerouting, is introduced in this thesis and uses demand forecasts {{to deal with the issue}} of which vehicles serve which passenger. To analyze the performance of these additions to the Dial-a-Ride problem, the rerouting measures are modeled for various demand distribution patterns on the road network of the Tata Steel IJmuiden area in the Netherlands. A visualization tool is created to analyze the key performance indicators of the solution algorithm, with an insertion algorithm used to assign passengers to vehicles. Throughout this report it is assumed that deterministic distance and path matrices are available for the network. Stochastic travel times are not taken into account, but can be incorporated in the model. The inclusion <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> rerouting reduces passenger rejections by up to 98 % and can reduce passenger travel and waiting times by up to 5 and 16 % respectively. This requires an increase of the vehicle distance driven per passenger by up to 25 %. Demand rerouting reduces travel and waiting times by up to 6 and 30 % respectively, with only a very minor increase in vehicle distance driven. The main conclusion of this thesis is that the two rerouting measures can be combined and that this combines the strengths of both types of rerouting. Passenger rejections are all but eliminated, passenger travel times can be reduced by 10 % and waiting times can be reduced by almost 50 %. This comes at the cost of only a 25 % increase of vehicle distance driven per passenger. A sensitivity analysis of the input parameters of the model shows that the advantages of the rerouting measures are effective in all cases. Demand forecasts can thus be a very strong tool in optimizing the solution to Dial-a-Ride problems. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Automated {{vehicles}} (AVs) {{have been}} receiving much attention {{all over the}} world, where the first fully AVs are already operating on the road network. AVs could not only have {{a tremendous impact on}} the urban environment but also on human travel behaviour. The focus {{of this study is to}} gain insight into the effects of private highly AVs on drivers’ parking location choice. The capability of AVs to ride and park themselves instead of being parked by the driver, will result in a change in parking choice behaviour. The aim of this research is to find the importance of different factors that could influence drivers’ parking location choice for a future situation in which private highly AVs will become available for passenger transport. The results of this study are used to guide opportunities for promising parking policies. In this study, theoretical expectations are examined with an empirical framework to get conclusions on the medium- and long term impacts of highly AVs on drivers’ parking location choice. A stated preference experiment was specified to examine which parking location drivers would chose, based on factors that influence their decision for the parking location. The Hague is used as a case study for this research in which it is assumed that passengers have their destination in the inner city of The Hague. Two parking locations are considered: parking at an off-street parking garage in the inner city and parking at an off-street parking lot at the edge of the city. Based on the model interpretation, it can be concluded that individuals are most sensitive for a change in direct costs, i. e. the ‘parking cost’ at the parking facility and the ‘parking fee’ for temporary parking the highly AV at an onstreet parking place near the passenger’s destination when the vehicle arrives too early at the pick-up point. Furthermore, it can be concluded that individuals are less sensitive for ‘personnel surveillance’ at the parking facility and the ‘risk of extra waiting time’ for the vehicle arriving too late at the pick-up point. Personal characteristics, trip characteristics and perceptions on the risk of damage during the <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> driving trip do not affect attributes that influence drivers’ parking location choices. To reduce the number of on-street parking places in the inner city, it is advised to forbid the parking of highly AVs at on-street parking places. Released on-street parking space could be used for amongst others drop-off and pickup manoeuvres. To minimize the number <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>vehicle</b> kilometres on the road network, it is advised to stimulate short term parking of highly AVs in the inner city and stimulate long term parking of highly AVs at the edge of the city. Furthermore, it is advised to implement a parking fee for temporary parking the vehicle at an on-street parking place near the passenger’s destination in the inner city. With an implemented parking fee, the municipality is able to 1) control supply and demand, 2) account for competitor pricing and 3) account for external factors (e. g. peak periods). When more parking capacity is needed, it is advised to invest in flexible parking facilities at the edge of the city near distributor roads.
