2500|$|In {{order to}} pay the {{additional}} costs of Gropius’s design, Benscheidt and his American partners had decided on smaller building {{than the one that}} was actually planned. By winter 1912 {{it was clear that the}} factory could not keep up with the number of orders and a major expansion was decided. This time the contract went directly to Gropius and Meyer and, from now on, they were to be the only architects of the Fagus buildings. The expansion practically doubled the surface of the buildings by adding to the street (south) side. This gave the opportunity to create a proper street elevation. Initially the <b>main</b> <b>elevation</b> was considered the north elevation that faced the railway and Behrens’s factory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{geography}} of the Cholula area is mostly flat with an average altitude of between 2,100 and 2,200 meters above sea level.

2500|$|Moulsecoomb Place is {{the only}} {{building}} in the Moulsecoomb area mentioned by Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner in the Sussex edition of their Buildings of England architectural guides. [...] They describe it as [...] "an early 19th-century seven-bay house of yellow brick", and note that the hall house attached to the rear is [...] "the only worthwhile timber-framed cottage in Brighton". [...] The seven-bay façade, which faces east, is the original part dating from 1790; another two-window range was added {{on the south side}} in the early 20th century, making the composition asymmetrical. [...] The original section has yellow brickwork in a Flemish bond pattern to the <b>main</b> <b>elevation</b> and brown and yellow gauged brickwork on the north (side) wall. [...] Yellow bricks are also used on the south extension, but in a stretcher bond layout. [...] The 1790 section has a 2–3–2 bay pattern whose central three-bay section projects slightly and is set beneath a pediment. [...] Its tympanum has a pattern of raised brickwork. [...] Behind the pediment is a parapet and a cornice with mutules below. [...] Some of the ground-floor windows have elements of the Palladian and Neoclassical Adam styles; those at first-floor level are straight-headed. [...] The hipped roof has several chimney-stacks. [...] The early 20th-century extension is in complementary style. [...] On the east elevation, a single-storey two-window section projects forward and is topped with a parapet and cornice. [...] This continues round to the south elevation, which has a full-height bow front with a three-window range. [...] A modern conservatory has been added to one side.|$|E
