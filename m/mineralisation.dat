5|$|Exmoor is an upland area formed almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Devonian and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the geological period and system, 'Devonian', comes from Devon, as rocks of that age were first studied and described here. With {{the exception of a}} suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself), all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group, which comprises a mix of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron <b>mineralisation</b> can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member (formerly 'Formation') of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (formerly 'Group'). The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform. The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet, acid soil.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} komatiite was first widely {{recognised in the}} early 1960s {{with the discovery of}} massive nickel sulfide <b>mineralisation</b> at Kambalda, Western Australia. Komatiite-hosted nickel-copper sulfide <b>mineralisation</b> today accounts for about 14% of the world's nickel production, mostly from Australia, Canada and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{hanging wall}} to the deposit can be {{volcanic}} units essentially contiguous and coeval with the footwall rocks, indicating <b>mineralisation</b> was developed in an inter-eruptive pause; it may be volcanic rock dissimilar to the footwall volcanics in bimodal volcanic subtypes, {{or it could be}} sedimentary strata if <b>mineralisation</b> occurred toward the end of an eruptive cycle.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the prevalence, size, location and appearance of <b>mineralisations</b> in feline stifle joints, and to evaluate their relationship with osteoarthritis and cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) status. Methods: Presence or absence, and size of <b>mineralisations</b> were determined from lateral stifle radiographs of 25 cats with CrCL rupture, and 44 cat cadavers without CrCL rupture. <b>Mineralisations</b> were classified as small, medium or large. Prevalence was compared between the clinically affected cats and the cadavers; the cadaver group was subdivided into an age-matched and an older group. Ten stifles with varying sizes of <b>mineralisations</b> were prepared as whole-knee specimens for histopathology. Location and appearance of the <b>mineralisations,</b> and degenerative changes in the cruciate ligaments, menisci, articular cartilage and joint capsule are described. Results: Prevalence of articular <b>mineralisations</b> was 0. 76 in stifles of cats with CrCL rupture (mean ± SD age 8. 6 ± 4. 5 years), 0. 64 in stifles of age-matched cat cadavers and 0. 74 in older cat cadavers (mean ± SD age 17. 0 ± 2. 4 years). Cats with CrCL rupture had a higher percentage of medium and large <b>mineralisations</b> than cats without CrCL rupture. Microscopically, small <b>mineralisations</b> were calcifications usually located in the cranial horn of the medial meniscus. Larger <b>mineralisations</b> were found to be ossifications, commonly located in the joint capsule and fat pad. Cats with larger <b>mineralisations</b> showed more signs of osteoarthritis, including degenerative changes in the CrCL. Conclusions and relevance: <b>Mineralisations</b> in feline stifle joints were found to differ in size, appearance and location. Small <b>mineralisations</b> were usually confined to the medial meniscus as described previously; larger <b>mineralisations</b> tended to be located in the tissues cranial to the menisci and seemed to be associated with osteoarthritis and CrCL pathology. Large <b>mineralisations</b> in feline stifles are ossifications in periarticular tissue and are associated with degenerative joint disease...|$|R

25|$|Geophysically, nickel sulfides are {{considered}} effective superconductors in a geologic context. They are explored for using electromagnetic exploration techniques which measure {{the current and}} magnetic fields generated in buried and concealed <b>mineralisation.</b> Mapping of regional magnetic response and gravity is also of use in defining the komatiite sequences, though of little use in directly detecting the <b>mineralisation</b> itself.|$|E
25|$|The Wear {{rises in}} the east Pennines, an upland area raised up during the Caledonian orogeny. Specifically, the Weardale Granite {{underlies}} {{the headwaters of the}} Wear. Devonian Old Red Sandstone in age, this Weardale Granite does not outcrop but was surmised by early geologists, and subsequently proven to exist as seen in the Rookhope borehole. It is the presence of this granite that has retained the high upland elevations of this area (less through its relative hardness, and more due to isostatic equilibrium) and accounts for heavy local <b>mineralisation,</b> although it is considered that most of the <b>mineralisation</b> occurred during the Carboniferous period.|$|E
25|$|Ponticola kessleri, the bighead goby or Kessler's goby, is {{a species}} of goby native to Eurasia. The bighead goby is a Ponto-Caspian relict species. It inhabits the fresh and {{oligohaline}} waters, with <b>mineralisation</b> from 0-0.5‰ up to 1.5-3.0‰.|$|E
50|$|Several small uranium <b>mineralisations</b> {{were also}} {{explored}} in the Ore Mountains outside the mined deposit areas. Together {{they account for}} another 11,200 tonnes of inferred resources, which {{were added to the}} SDAG Wismut resource base.|$|R
50|$|The SAG/SDAG Wismut {{carried out}} {{exploration}} {{in the whole}} German Democratic Republic. Several uranium <b>mineralisations</b> were discovered but finally not mined {{because of the small}} amount or high costs. The largest unmined resource was discovered in the late 1970s and early 1980s north of Leipzig, hosted by carboniferous volcano-sedimentary rock units. This uranium occurrence near Delitzsch consists of several separate <b>mineralisations.</b> An inferred resource of 6,660 tonnes was taken into the resource base of Wismut and studies were made for underground exploration. However, the high costs prevented realisation. Wismut also discovered a significant supplies of tungsten, niobium, rare-earth elements and phosphate in the area, which is being reinvestigated by a private company since 2008.|$|R
50|$|Authigenic <b>mineralisations.</b> These {{can provide}} very fine, {{three-dimensional}} morphological detail, and have proved {{especially important in}} the study of reproductive structures that can be severely distorted in adpressions. However, as they are formed in mineral nodules, such fossils can rarely be of large size.|$|R
25|$|Nickel <b>mineralisation</b> in the regolith, in {{the upper}} saprolite {{typically}} exists as goethite, hematite, limonite and {{is often associated with}} polydymite and violarite, nickel sulfides which are of supergene association.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} types of rock are found on and around Clough Head, which were formed in very different circumstances. These include deep-sea sedimentation, effusive volcanic lava flows, explosive volcanism, an intrusion of granite, <b>mineralisation</b> and finally glacial sculpting. To understand the geology of Clough Head is to understand much of the geology of the Lake District.|$|E
40|$|The geotectonic {{setting of}} Serbo-Macedonian Zone(SMZ) {{facilitates}} {{the formation of}} porphyry copper <b>mineralisations.</b> This zone hosts many known deposits having been discovered and located {{in the areas of}} Pontokerasia, Vathi, Skouries, Gerakario and Fissoka in Greece, and Buchim, Ilovitza and Osogovo in FYROM. The SMZ metallogenetic belt consists of strongly deformed metamorphic rocksof Palaeozoic age superimposed by Tertiary magmatic activity. The 3 D modeling tools are frequently used to make cost- och time-efficient tools in mineral exploration, to visualize, correlate and interpret geological data. This paper aims at presenting a comparative evaluation of the porphyry copper <b>mineralisations</b> of AgiosPavlos (Gerakarioarea) and Kadiica (Bukovik-Kadiica area) based on 3 D modeling tools of respective geological settings, deformation structures and geochemical distributions, in terms of better understanding related ore-genetic processes and exploration potential...|$|R
40|$|Indium is {{extensively}} used in LCD {{screens and}} solar cells. It is mainly produced as a byproduct during ore processing. With ever increasing demand for indium {{and most of}} the production being restricted to a few countries new sources for indium are needed. In Sweden, the westernmost Bergslagen is the only area, which is known to exhibit minerals with essential indium. The indium <b>mineralisations</b> at Långban, the Linbom prospect, which are studied in this bachelor’s thesis show several trends. The most notable is the copper indium trend seen in sphalerite. A likely substitution based on similar ionic radii and charges is Cu 1 ++ In 3 + ↔ 2 Zn 2 +. Usually when cassiterite is associated with similar polymetalic indium bearing <b>mineralisations</b> as at Långban there is also high concentrations in cassiterite. This has previously not observed in Sweden, however during this project concentrations were indeed found in cassiterite...|$|R

25|$|The Greenside {{fault is}} a normal fault with an average dip of 70° to the east. A fault plane is not a flat surface and the actual dip of the Greenside fault varies between 58° east and vertical; in one place it was 83° west. As the rock {{fractured}} and the two sides moved against each other, cavities were created, partly filled with broken rock (fault breccia and fault gouge). Hydrothermal circulation of sea water at temperatures of 110130°C, probably during the Carboniferous Period, led to <b>mineralisation</b> of the fault cavities. The metal content {{is believed to have}} been leached out of rocks of the Skiddaw Group, or the underlying granite batholith. The <b>mineralisation</b> of the fault shows some vertical zonation, with baryte (barium sulphate) in the upper part of the vein, and small amounts of both blende (sphalerite, zinc sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) at deeper levels.|$|E
25|$|Kambalda style komatiitic nickel <b>mineralisation</b> was {{initially}} discovered by gossan searching in ~1965, which discovered the Long, Victor, Otter-Juan and other shoots within the Kambalda Dome. The Redross, Widgie Townsite, Mariners, Wannaway, Dordie North and Miitel nickel gossans were identified generally at {{or around the}} time of drilling of the Widgiemoltha area beginning in 1985, and continuing till today.|$|E
25|$|Major gold {{deposits}} {{occur at}} Kalgoorlie, Kambalda, Mount Magnet, Boddington, Laverton and Wiluna, and are hosted in greenstone belts. These form linear belts of mafic, ultramafic and felsic volcanics, intercalated with sedimentary sequences, {{and have been}} deformed and metamorphosed. The mode of occurrence of the gold <b>mineralisation</b> tends to be small- to medium-sized structurally controlled lodes, shears, and quartz veins.|$|E
50|$|The Ore Mountains (German: Erzgebirge) and Vogtland {{were the}} first {{exploration}} targets for uranium and host {{the largest number of}} deposits mined by Wismut. All deposits in these mountain ranges are hydrothermal vein-style <b>mineralisations</b> in Palaeozoic metasedimentary and igneous rocks and Variscan age granites. Most deposits are situated in the western Ore Mountains and the neighbouring Vogtland region, whereas the central and eastern Ore Mountains contain only a few smaller deposits.|$|R
40|$|Mineralogical and {{chemical}} analysis of an Eastern Pacific core {{has been conducted}} {{in the context of}} a study of <b>mineralisations</b> in pelagic sediments; the data point out the relations between thin (2 - 100 m) manganese oxyhydroxide concretions and volcano-sedimentary environments. Between Clarion and Clipperton Islands, the polymetallic precipitates are precocious and they are due to the submarine volcanic activity of this spreading zone; in spite of their small size, all the elements are concentrated in the precipitates: Mn (9 - 46 %), Fe (0. 2 - 11 %), Ni (0. 1 - 3. 4 %), Cu (0. 1 - 1. 7 %), Co (0. 1 - 0. 8 %). The high internal structuration of micromineralisations, the splitting up of the elements in the laminations, the variability of contents according to the state of crystallinity can be explained by diagenetic processes at the scale of the grain. The contrast between the degree of evolution of these <b>mineralisations</b> and the situation of the area, that was submitted to important terrigenous and volcanic sedimentary inputs, lead to consideration of the micronodules as 'blocked structures', precursors of nodules, developed from diagenetic reactions of the micro-environment...|$|R
50|$|The Pic de Fon and Ouéléba iron {{deposits}} {{are located}} approximately 4 km {{from one another}} {{at the southern end}} of the Simandou Range, approximately 550 km ESE of the capital Conakry. Both deposits are approximately 7.5 km in length and up to 1 km wide. At both banded iron formations (metamorphosed to staurolite-grade itabirites) have been enriched to form haematite and haematite-goethite <b>mineralisations.</b> The potential yield of the two deposits is estimated at 2.25 billion tonnes of high-grade iron ore.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} bone {{tissue is}} no longer present but the calcium phosphate <b>mineralisation</b> has preserved the structure of original bone cells, showing individual osteocytes including their inner hollow spaces and the canaliculi.

25|$|Gossans {{of nickel}} <b>mineralisation,</b> {{especially}} massive sulfides, are dominated in the arid Yilgarn Craton by boxworks of goethite, hematite, maghemite and ocher clays. Non-sulfide nickel minerals are typically soluble, and preserved rarely at surface as carbonates, although often can be preserved as nickel arsenates (nickeline) within gossans. Within subtropical and Arctic regions, {{it is unlikely}} gossans would be preserved or, if they are, would not contain carbonate minerals.|$|E
25|$|The {{intrusion}} of the granite {{into the surrounding}} sedimentary rocks gave rise to extensive metamorphism and <b>mineralisation,</b> and this led to Cornwall {{being one of the}} most important mining areas in Europe until the early 20th century. It is thought tin was mined here as early as the Bronze Age, and copper, lead, zinc and silver have all been mined in Cornwall. Alteration of the granite also gave rise to extensive deposits of China Clay, especially in the area to the north of St Austell, and the extraction of this remains an important industry.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} aims at the {{characterisation}} of geochemical anomalies in soils {{in order to}} identify possible <b>mineralisations</b> related to carbonatized structures within basic and ultrabasic rocks, where elements such as Cr, Ni, and V apparently display anomalous concentrations. Assuming a multifractal distribution for the data, geochemical anomalies were defined and separated from background by calculation of threshold values for each element: 231. 6 ppm for Cr, 75. 6 ppm for Ni, 88. 3 ppm for V, and 48. 6 ppm for Cu. Geochemical maps were produced with ordinary lognormal kriging, and the distribution of elements was displayed only for grades above the calculated thresholds. It was verified that the distribution of V maps the gabbroic rocks of the area, and Cr and Ni are the ones more clearly related to the ultrabasic rocks and carbonatized structures. However, only V indicates the possible occurrence of anomalous concentrations in gabbros (by comparison with their mean content in rock). As to the remaining elements, their content in soil is very diluted and the persistent low values for Cu seems to indicate that sulphide minerals are scarce. Therefore, as to the existence of Ni-Co-Cu and Cr <b>mineralisations,</b> investigations must be carried out combining other approaches to the problem. 1...|$|R

40|$|The TUPOLAR project {{focuses on}} {{investigations}} {{and evaluation of}} potential hydrocarbon and mineral resources of the Upper Permian – Mesozoic sedimen-tary basins.

25|$|The {{morphology}} of breccias {{associated with}} ore deposits varies from tabular sheeted veins and clastic dikes associated with overpressured sedimentary strata, to large-scale intrusive diatreme breccias (breccia pipes), or even some synsedimentary diatremes formed solely by the overpressure of pore fluid within sedimentary basins. Hydrothermal breccias are usually formed by hydrofracturing of rocks by highly pressured hydrothermal fluids. They {{are typical of}} the epithermal ore environment and are intimately associated with intrusive-related ore deposits such as skarns, greisens and porphyry-related <b>mineralisation.</b> Epithermal deposits are mined for copper, silver and gold.|$|E
25|$|Geochemically, the Kambalda Ratio Ni:Cr/Cu:Zn {{identifies}} {{areas of}} enriched Ni, Cu and depleted Cr and Zn. Cr {{is associated with}} fractionated, low-MgO rocks and Zn is a typical sediment contaminant. If the ratio is at around unity or greater than 1, the komatiite flow is considered fertile. Other geochemical trends sought include high MgO contents to identify the area with highest cumulate olivine contents; identifying low-Zn flows; tracking Al content to identify contaminated lavas and, chiefly, identifying anomalously enriched Ni (direct detection). In many areas, economic deposits are identified within a halo of lower grade <b>mineralisation,</b> with a 1% or 2% Ni in hole value contoured.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the tin mines on Dartmoor are located in granite country rock {{and most of the}} lodes trend ENE–WSW and are of limited length, though there are exceptions. In the underground workings, the tin ore, cassiterite, was usually found in association with large amounts of tourmaline, and in central Dartmoor with much specular haematite. In {{the southern part of the}} moor, the cassiterite was usually found in relatively large grains, but the lodes were of very variable quality. These factors, combined with the fact that none of the underground workings was found to be profitable at depth, are typical of the deepest zone of tin <b>mineralisation.</b> The once very extensive alluvial deposits of tin ore, that were the first deposits to be mined, also point to the vast quantity of ore that once existed in lodes that have been eroded from above the granite since it was emplaced in the Carboniferous period.|$|E
50|$|These fine- to medium-grained rocks have {{a rather}} dark appearance, {{they are quite}} rich in green {{hornblende}} but nearly devoid in alkali feldspar (less than 10 volume percent). Their SiO2-contents are fairly low, so they compositionally approach dioritic rocks. In the past this facies has been extensively quarried (Tabataud quarry south of Nontron). Associated with this facies are several NW-SE striking mineralised veins that have been mined for lead, silver and zinc. Mining activity stopped in 1939. The Cantonnier vein is famous for very rare <b>mineralisations.</b> Besides baryte, calcite, chalcedony, dolomite, galena, marcasite, pyrite and sphalerite occur very rare minerals like anglesite, cerussite, crocoite, dundasite, embreyite, hisingerite, leadhillite, mimetite, ozokerite (pseudomineral), pyromorphite, native silver, vauquelinite and wulfenite.|$|R
50|$|Black shale <b>mineralisations</b> {{are large}} low-grade {{resources}} of uranium. They form in submarine environments under oxygen-free conditions. Organic matter in clay-rich sediments {{will not be}} converted to CO2 by biological processes in this environment and it can reduce and immobilise uranium dissolved in seawater. Average uranium grades of black shales are 50 to 250 ppm. The largest explored resource is Ranstad in Sweden containing 254,000 t of uranium. However, there are estimates for black shales in the USA and Brasil assuming a uranium content of over 1 million tonnes, but at grades below 100 ppm uranium. The Chattanooga Shale in the southeastern USA for example is estimated to contain 4 to 5 million tonnes at an average grade of 54 ppm.|$|R
