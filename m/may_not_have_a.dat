5|$|Passive linear {{electronic}} analogue {{filters are}} those filters {{which can be}} described with linear differential equations (linear); they are composed of capacitors, inductors and, sometimes, resistors (passive) and are designed to operate on continuously varying (analogue) signals. There are many linear filters which are not analogue in implementation (digital filter), {{and there are many}} electronic filters which <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> passive topology both of which may have the same transfer function of the filters described in this article. Analogue filters are most often used in wave filtering applications, that is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from analogue (continuous-time) signals.|$|E

25|$|The midsole is {{the layer}} {{in between the}} outsole and the insole, {{typically}} there for shock absorption. Some types of shoes, like running shoes, have additional material for shock absorption, usually beneath the heel of the foot, where one puts the most pressure down.

25|$|A {{semiconductor}} is {{a material}} {{with a small}} but non-zero band gap that behaves as an insulator at absolute zero but allows thermal excitation of electrons into its conduction band at temperatures that are below its melting point. In contrast, a material with a large band gap is an insulator. In conductors, the valence and conduction bands may overlap, so they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> band gap.|$|E

25|$|A {{construction}} of the surreal numbers as a maximal binary pseudo-tree with simplicity (ancestor) and ordering relations is due to Philip Ehrlich, The difference from the usual definition of a tree is that the set of ancestors of a vertex is well-ordered, but <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> maximal element (immediate predecessor); in other words the order type of that set is a general ordinal number, not just a natural number. This construction fulfills Alling's axioms as well and can easily be mapped to the sign-sequence representation.|$|E

25|$|Critics object {{claiming}} that the ASEAN Way's emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference, forces the organisation to adopt only those policies which satisfy the lowest common denominator. Decision making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue. Members <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> common conception {{of the meaning of}} the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasise non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination. These differences hinder efforts to find common solutions to particular issues, but also make it difficult to determine when collective action is appropriate in a given situation.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{reasoning}} stating that hydroxyapatite orbital implants without a motility peg would yield a superior artiﬁcial eye motility, when similar surgical techniques are used unpegged porous (hydroxyapatite) enucleation implants and donor sclera-covered nonporous (acrylic) spherical enucleation implants yield comparable artiﬁcial eye motility. In two studies {{there were no}} differences in maximum amplitude between hydroxyapatite and acrylic or silicone spherical enucleation implants, thus indicating that the implant material itself <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bearing on implant movement as long as the muscles are attached directly or indirectly to the implant and the implant is not pegged.|$|E
25|$|Through 21 CFR 1040, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates laser {{products}} entering {{commerce and}} requires all classIIIb and classIV lasers offered in commerce in the US to have five standard safety features: a key switch, a safety interlock dongle, a power indicator, an aperture shutter, and an emission delay (normally {{two to three}} seconds). OEM lasers, designed to be parts of other components (such as DVD burners), are exempt from this requirement. Some non-portable lasers <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> safety dongle or an emission delay, but have an emergency stop button and/or a remote switch.|$|E

25|$|Square step cuts whose corners are not {{truncated}} {{are known}} as carré; they are also characteristic of antique jewelry. They may resemble the square-shaped Princess cut in passing, but a carré's lack of fire and simpler facets are distinctive. They may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> culet. In Western jewelry dating to {{before the advent of}} brilliant-type cuts, very shallow step-cut stones were used as lustrous covers for miniature paintings: these are known in the antique trade as portrait stones. Characteristic of Indian jewelry are lasque diamonds, which may be the earliest form of step cut. They are flat stones with large tables and asymmetric outlines.|$|E
25|$|A sup (supremum) of X is a least {{upper bound}} on X, namely an upper bound on X that is less or equal to every upper bound on X. Dually an inf (infimum) of X is a {{greatest}} lower bound on X. The sup of x and y always exists in the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a sup and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sup and/or an inf; in a power set algebra they always do.|$|E
25|$|L. mexicana is {{normally}} 6–9mm in length. This species specifically has a metallic blue green thorax with purple tints, a propleuron with black setae and dark brown basal sclerites at the wing. The legs of adults are usually black. The abdomen is similarly colored like the thorax in four segments. The first segment is mainly purple, the second segment may or <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> row a bristles, the third segment has {{a row of}} bristles, and the fourth segment has scattered erect bristles. The head of the species has black cheeks with black vestiture or hairs. The {{back of the head}} is also black with an orange colored metacephalon (a region on the posterior of the head) that distinctly shows the two or more rows of post-ocular setae. The main difference between the males and females is that males have their frontal plates separated with a wider frontal vittal and the females have a broader frons and larger head width.|$|E

25|$|Floppy disks {{are used}} for {{emergency}} boots in aging systems lacking support for other bootable media and for BIOS updates, since most BIOS and firmware programs can still be executed from bootable floppy disks. If BIOS updates fail or become corrupt, floppy drives can sometimes be used to perform a recovery. The music and theatre industries still use equipment requiring standard floppy disks (e.g. synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, sequencers, and lighting consoles). Industrial automation equipment such as programmable machinery and industrial robots <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> USB interface; data and programs are then loaded from disks, damageable in industrial environments. This equipment may not be replaced due to cost or requirement for continuous availability; existing software emulation and virtualization do not solve this problem because no operating system is present or a customized operating system is used that has no drivers for USB devices. Hardware floppy disk emulators {{can be made to}} interface floppy-disk controllers to a USB port {{that can be used for}} flash drives.|$|E
25|$|The {{ease with}} which an {{individual}} can acquire an amateur radio license varies from country to country. In some countries, examinations may be offered {{only once or twice}} a year in the national capital and can be inordinately bureaucratic (for example in India) or challenging because some amateurs must undergo difficult security approval (as in Iran). Currently only Yemen and North Korea do not issue amateur radio licenses to their citizens, although in both cases a limited number of foreign visitors have been permitted to obtain amateur licenses in the past decade. Some developing countries, especially those in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, require the payment of annual license fees that can be prohibitively expensive for most of their citizens. A few small countries <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> national licensing process and may instead require prospective amateur radio operators to take the licensing examinations of a foreign country. In countries with the largest numbers of amateur radio licensees, such as Japan, the United States, Thailand, Canada, and most of the countries in Europe, there are frequent license examinations opportunities in major cities.|$|E
25|$|Volvulus of {{the large}} colon usually occurs where the {{mesentery}} attaches to the body wall, but may also occur at the diaphragmatic or sternal flexures, with rotations up to 720 degrees reported. It is most commonly seen in postpartum mares, usually presents with severe signs of colic that are refractory to analgesic administration, and horses often lie in dorsal recumbency. Abdominal distention is common due to strangulation and rapid engorgement of the intestine with gas, which then can lead to dyspnea as the growing bowel pushes against the diaphragm and prevents normal ventilation. Additionally, compression can place pressure on the caudal vena cava, leading to pooling of blood and hypovolemia. However, horses <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> high heart rate, presumably due to increased vagal tone. Rectal palpation will demonstrate a severely gas distended colon, and the examiner {{may not be able}} to push beyond the brim of the pelvis due to the obstruction. The colon may be irreversibly damaged in as little as 3–4 hours from the initial time of the volvulus, so immediate surgical correction is required. The surgeon works to correct the volvulus and then removes any damaged colon. 95% of the colon may be resected, but often the volvulus damages more than this amount, requiring euthanasia. Plasma lactate levels can help predict survival rates, with an increased survival seen in horses with a lactate below 6.0mmol/L. Prognosis is usually poor, with a survival rate of approximately 36% of horses with a 360 degree volvulus, and 74% of those with a 270 degree volvulus, and a reoccurrence rate of 5–50%. Complications post-surgery include hypoproteinemia, endotoxic shock, laminitis, and DIC.|$|E
