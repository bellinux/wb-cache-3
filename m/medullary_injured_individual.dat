40|$|M. A. Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) and its {{sequelae}} pose many challenges, {{not only to}} the <b>injured</b> <b>individual,</b> but also to all involved in his or her life. The effects of TBI on the family of the <b>injured</b> <b>individual</b> is a well-documented phenomenon, as is the experience of the <b>injured</b> <b>individual’s</b> siblings post-TBI. This qualitative, phenomenological study explores the phenomenon of the sibling relationship post TBI, {{from the perspective of the}} <b>injured</b> <b>individual.</b> There is limited literature available documenting the sibling relationships as experienced by the <b>injured</b> <b>individual</b> post TBI. Descriptions of such experiences were sourced from interviews conducted with each of the three participants. Through the interpretation of each transcript, themes were identified. Although similarities were found across the participants’ descriptions, the distinctiveness of each individual’s experience was acknowledged. Common themes found in this study were alterations in the sibling relationship, feeling alone as a consequence of not being understood and the experience of emotional reactions at the alterations in the sibling relationship. Other commonalities across participants were the experience of jealousy in the sibling relationship, expectations pertaining to familial roles and a change in self-concept post TBI. Through giving expression to the <b>injured</b> <b>individual</b> in terms of his or her experience of the sibling relationship post TBI, an awareness of the impact of traumatic brain injury on the sibling relationship is fostered...|$|R

So far, it is unclear to which extent early psychological interventions can improve the ability to return to work. Purpose of the study The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate whether an improvement of the treatment-triage (by the screening questionnaire work and health [FAB]) influences early return to work and well being in <b>injured</b> <b>individuals.</b> Methods The study sample consists of <b>injured</b> <b>individuals</b> with different mental health-related or work-related disabilities after an accident. Participants are included eight weeks after an accident. Participants are randomly assigned to the intervention or to the control group. The intervention is an individualized psychotherapy consisting of cognitive-behavioral therapy and work related topics in an individual setting. Well being and work related actors are assessed at baseline and after six months. Results The recruitment is still ongoing. The preliminary results of this randomized controlled study will be presented at the conference.

40|$|At present, {{clinical}} {{interventions and}} research efforts {{are not fully}} successful in defining the risk of pressure ulcer development and as such in eventually preventing pressure ulcers. As a result, the prevalence and incidence values of pressure ulcers remain unacceptably high. It is common sense that healthy subjects do not develop pressure ulcers due to a dynamic variation in sitting posture. This dynamic sitting behavior can be identified and used as a reference values for the optimal sitting behavior of individuals that use a wheelchair and {{are at risk of}} developing pressure ulcer. The main research question that has been answered in this thesis is if imposing dynamic sitting behavior by means of the Dynasit chair in Spinal Cord <b>Injured</b> <b>individuals</b> results in elevated tissue viability? In order to define a reference values for the sitting behavior of spinal cord <b>injured</b> <b>individuals,</b> an analysis of healthy sitting behavior has been performed. It was found that healthy subjects change their sitting posture at least every eight minutes. To impose this dynamic sitting behavior on spinal cord <b>injured</b> <b>individuals,</b> the Dynasit chair has been developed. The Dynasit chair is an experimental sitting device developed to investigate the effects of different sitting postures, alternating tuberal support and pelvic orientations on the (sub-) cutaneous tissue viability. Two studies on healthy subjects demonstrated the positive effect of actuation with the Dynasit chair on the tissue load. Regarding the main research question of this thesis, a study performed in 10 male spinal cord <b>injured</b> <b>individuals,</b> confirmed the ability of the Dynasit chair to impose dynamic sitting behavior, based on healthy sitting behavior, in spinal cord <b>injured</b> <b>individuals.</b> This imposed dynamic sitting behavior resulted in significant elevation of the (sub-) cutaneous tissue oxygenation. This elevated tissue oxygenation implies that due to the dynamic sitting, the wheelchair user can sit for prolonged periods of time without tissue breakdown...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{identify}} any changes to lower limb biomechanics during steady rate cycling {{as a result}} of an anterior cruciate ligament deficiency Design. Comparative study in which healthy and anterior cruciate ligament <b>injured</b> <b>individuals</b> underwent biomechanical analysis during stationary cycling. Background. Individuals with an anterior cruciate ligament deficiency often exhibit reductions in the magnitude of quadriceps muscle activity and subsequent knee joint extensor moments during walking. It is not known whether these compensations are present during cycling, an exercise frequently used to retrain anterior cruciate ligament <b>injured</b> <b>individuals.</b> Methods. Ten healthy and 10 unilateral anterior cruciate ligament deficient individuals participated. All participants were required to cycle for approximately 30 s at each of six different cycling intensities while lower limb EMG, kinetics, and kinematics were collected bilaterally. Before riding, participants performed submaximal isometric contractions to generate normalizing data. Results. In addition to reduced quadriceps activation and net knee joint extensor moments, the anterior cruciate ligament deficient limbs exhibited decreases in linear impulse of the resultant pedal force, knee joint flexor moments, hip and ankle extensor moments, and muscle activity from gluteus maximus. These decreases were counteracted by an increase in output from the anterior cruciate ligament intact limb. Conclusion. Anterior cruciate ligament <b>injured</b> <b>individuals</b> exhibited a limb attenuation strategy during cycling activities...|$|R

Data demonstrate that the intervention was successful for the 3 participants who completed the study.

The importance of social support for those individuals who suffer an injury related to physical activity is where increased knowledge is needed. Four interviews to were conducted using a thematic interview guide with the following themes: The experience of the training break, two sides of social support, several ways of dealing with the experience, the design of the support, Varied support providers relationship changes.  The most important property of the individual who gave support was an experience similar to that of the <b>injured</b> <b>individuals</b> underwent.
