50|$|Actually {{building}} the apple tube's electronics {{proved to be}} difficult.

50|$|Though the radios {{themselves}} are inexpensive, the zigbee Qualification Process involves a full {{validation of the}} requirements of the physical layer.

An uncertified physical layer that malfunctions could cripple the battery lifespan of other devices on a zigbee network. Zigbee radios have very tight constraints on power and bandwidth. Thus, radios are tested with guidance given by Clause 6 of the 802.15.4-2006 Standard. Most vendors plan to integrate the radio and microcontroller onto a single chip getting smaller devices.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{chrominance}} signal was missing, or deliberately ignored, the focusing system was disconnected and its power {{added to the}} gun. This produced a slightly stronger and unfocused beam, which hit all three colored strips and produced a B&W image. [...] The spaces between the stripes meant the overall image would be about as bright as a conventional B&W set.
