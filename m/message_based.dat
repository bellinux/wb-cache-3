500|$|In {{everyday}} life, psychologists {{noticed that}} people are persuaded by messages differently based on {{the identity of the}} author. It seemed that the more prestige the author/speaker has, the more likely the person will believe them. [...] Many social psychologists prior to Asch had studied this phenomenon. However, Asch disagreed with many of them and critiqued their interpretations. His main conclusion was that a change in evaluation requires a change in the content and meaning of the response {{as a result of the}} change in context. Therefore, the meaning of the message is interpreted differently depending on who is the author of the message. He suggests that participants are not blindly accepting a <b>message</b> <b>based</b> on the author, but rather they are making meaning of the quote based on the author.|$|E

500|$|Tripp {{was interviewed}} about his book by Thom Willenbecher in Christopher Street magazine. Phil Derbyshire {{dismissed}} The Homosexual Matrix in Gay Left, {{arguing that it}} was based in [...] "bourgeois social science" [...] and that Tripp did not appreciate the role of sexism in supporting taboos against homosexuality, which he viewed through [...] "the ideological forms of advanced capitalism" [...] and therefore misunderstood as a [...] "unitary and trans-historical category", that Tripp had a sexist focus on gay men and mostly ignored lesbians, that he viewed male and female sexuality as [...] "biological givens", and ignored alternative feminist and Marxist accounts of the oppression of gay men and lesbians. Derbyshire contrasted Tripp's work unfavorably {{with that of the}} philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault. The novelist Lewis Gannett, writing in The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide, credited Tripp with writing [...] "the first work to explain in cogent psychological terms why homosexuality is not a developmental failure to achieve heterosexuality." [...] According to Gannett, Tripp's view that [...] "gay people and straight people develop their orientations in exactly the same ways" [...] appalled [...] "many clinicians and much of the general public", while Tripp's <b>message,</b> <b>based</b> on [...] "impeccable science", that [...] "homosexuality is an integral and natural component of human sexuality" [...] made an enormous impact, with Pomeroy calling The Homosexual Matrix [...] "the best book I have ever read on the subject of homosexuality". Gannett wrote that the book influenced prominent sex researchers, critics, and the public, and sold nearly half a million copies. Paul Varnell, writing in the Chicago Free Press, described The Homosexual Matrix as one of the ten best non-fiction books relating to homosexuality.|$|E
