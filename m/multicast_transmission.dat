More specifically, multicast packets are sent in an open-loop fashion as broadcast packets i. e. without any acknowledgements.

In this paper, we propose new mechanisms based on the leader-based approach to enhance the legacy <b>multicast</b> <b>transmission</b> scheme in WLANs. We focus on practical solutions that can be deployed in current and future WiFi devices and are compatible with legacy 802. 11 devices.

Our simulations show that for static environments, LB-ARF and RRAM can achieve high multicast throughput and fairness between the set of multicast receivers. LB-ARF is sufficient to outperform the legacy multicast mechanism when the stations are fixed.

The IEEE 802. 11 WLAN MAC (Medium Access Control) layer does not support reliable multicast since, for <b>multicast</b> <b>transmissions,</b> it has no control packets such as the RTS, CTS, and ACK, which are used for unicast transmissions. Several protocols have been proposed to provide reliable <b>multicast</b> <b>transmissions.</b> However, they are not efficient for IEEE 802. 11 WLANs due to the large number of packet transmissions and the excessive control overhead caused by the use {{of a large number of}} control packets in the error recovery process. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective scheme. The proposed scheme combines FEC (Forward Error Correction) and ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) to reduce a large number of packet transmissions and to provide data reliability in the IEEE 802. 11 WLANs multicast environment. It then uses busy tones to improve efficiency by reducing the excessive control overhead. Performance evaluation is conducted using both numerical analysis and simulation.
