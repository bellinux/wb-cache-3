50|$|The euglenid genus Trachelomonas is {{characterized}} by the presence of a shell-like covering called a lorica. Details of lorica structure determine the classification of distinct species in the genus. The lorica can exist in spherical, elliptical, cylindrical, and pyriform (pear-shaped) forms and measures anywhere from 5 to 100 μ in diameter or length. The lorica surface can be smooth, punctuate or striate and range from hyaline, to yellow, or brown. These colors are due to the accumulation of ferric hydroxide and <b>manganic</b> <b>oxide</b> deposited with the mucilage and minerals that comprise the lorica. In Trachelomonas, the presence of a lorica obscures cytoplasmic details of the underlying cell. In each Trachelomonas cell, there is a gap at the apex of the lorica from which the flagellum protrudes. Thickening around this gap results in a rim-like or collar-like appearance. During asexual reproduction, the nucleus divides yielding two daughter cells one of which exits through the opening in the lorica. This new cell then synthesizes its own new lorica.|$|E
40|$|Microbes that couple {{growth to}} the {{reduction}} of manganese could {{play an important role}} in the biogeochemistry of certain anaerobic environments. Such a bacterium, Alteromonas putrefaciens MR- 1, couples its growth to {{the reduction of}} manganese oxides only under anaerobic conditions. The characteristics of this reduction are consistent with a biological, and not an indirect chemical, reduction of manganese, which suggest that this bacterium uses <b>manganic</b> <b>oxide</b> as a terminal electron acceptor. It can also utilize a large number of other compounds as terminal electron acceptors; this versatility could provide a distinct advantage in environments where electron-acceptor concentrations may vary...|$|E

Bacteriol. 91 : 1543 – 1547. 1966. —Cell suspensions of Sphaerotilus discophorus in 0. 02 m {{potassium phosphate}} buffer (pH 7. 2) readily oxidized MnSO 4 to dark-brown <b>manganic</b> <b>oxide.</b> The latter {{appeared to be}} MnO 2, since its color {{was the same as}} MnO 2 and, like the latter, it was readily soluble in HCl with the evolution of chlorine. The amount of O 2 consumed in the oxidation of Mn++ was 63 % or more of theoretical. The ability of the cells to oxidize Mn++ was destroyed by heating the cells at 93 C for 5 min. Only cell suspensions prepared from cultures of S. discophorus grown with MnSO 4 were able to oxidize Mn++. It was concluded that the oxidation of manganous ions by S. discophorus is catalyzed by an inducible enzyme(s) ...|$|E

40|$|The key for {{successful}} and efficient dissolution of copper, nickel and cobalt from ocean nodules depends on prior {{reduction of the}} manganese and ferric oxides with which the above valuable nonferrous metals are interlocked. We have shown that {{through the application of}} negative reduction potential or DC current, significant reduction of <b>manganic</b> and iron <b>oxides</b> in the ocean nodules can be achieved, thus liberating the occluded copper, nickel and cobalt for easy dissolution in an acid medium. Polarization studies using a slurry electrode system indicated that maximum dissolution of iron and manganese due to electrochemical reduction occurred at negative DC potentials of - 600 mV(SCE) and - 1400 mV(SCE). Electroleaching of the ocean nodules at the above negative applied DC potentials resulted in significant dissolution of copper, nickel and cobalt in IM H 2 SO 4...|$|R

Mechanisms involved in electrobioleaching of ocean nodules are discussed. The effect of bacterial metabolites in the dissolution of copper, nickel and cobalt from the ocean nodules is also examined as a function of pH, time and applied potentials. Various electrochemical and biochemical parameters were optimized and the electrobioleaching process so developed is shown to yield almost complete dissolution of all metal values...|$|R
40|$|Lake Nordbytjernet (Southeast Norway) had up to 40 mg liter- ’ {{dissolved}} iron and 67 mg liter- ’ dissolved manganese in a stagnant layer. The ratio between iron and manganese loading was around 3 : 1, while {{the inventory of}} manganese was six times higher than for iron. High concentrations of {{dissolved iron}} occurred solely under strictly anoxic conditions, while dissolved manganese was unaffected by intrusion of oxygen during the autumnal partial circulation. Mixed potentials caused by oxidation of ferrous iron and reduction of <b>manganic</b> <b>oxide</b> or 0, controlled the redox potential values, while dissolved manganese appeared to have no influence. The following main processes controlled the sedimentation rates: fluvial supply of suspended material, precipitation of ferric hydroxide and manganese oxide from the water column, and plankton production, Sorption to ferric hydroxide in the oxic zone and reductive desorption in the anoxic zone controlled the deep water stratification of phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and some major cations. No similar effects were seen for manganese sedimentation. The iron sedimentation rate was enhanced in the anoxic zone due to redox coupling of iron oxidation and manganese reduction. Phosphorus was depleted in the anoxic zone during periods of substantial ferric hydroxide sedimentation. Sedimentation of manganese under anoxic conditions seemed to be governed by precipitation of carbonate and phosphate. Residence times in the lake were 0. 2 yr for iron and phosphorous vs. 3. 3 yr for manganese and 1. 4 yr for water...|$|E
