40|$|A fibrous {{monolith}} {{cemented carbide}} with WC- 6 %Co as cell and WC- 20 %Co as cell boundaries was produced through hot co-extrusion process in this paper. The density, hardness, {{transverse rupture strength}} (TRS) and fracture toughness (KIc) of the fibrous monolith cemented carbide were tested, and the fracture and crack propagation were observed by <b>metalloscope</b> and Scanning Electron Microscope. The result shows fibrous monolith structure design could effectively improve the TRS and the KIc of WC/Co cemented carbide without a significant decrease of hardness. It is the reason of high transverse rupture strength and fracture toughness that WC- 20 %Co can absorb more fracture energy in order to slow, prevent, or deflect crack propagation, proved by <b>metalloscope</b> and scanning electron microscope...|$|E

40|$|A {{decarburization}} {{protective coating}} was fabricated onto spring steel by using bauxite with functional additives. <b>Metalloscope,</b> XRD, and TG-DTA thermal analysis revealed that, at < 1050 A degrees C, {{the depth of}} the ferrite layer of the coated specimen decreased because of the shield effect and carbon concentration of the coating. The protective effect increased to 100 % above 1050 A degrees C, because Na 2 Al 6 P 2 O 15 formed by the sintering process pulled the solid phase closer and filled the void through wetting power and surface tension between the liquid and solid phases and made the coating more compact...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The samples with {{different}} strontium contents of AE 42 magnesium alloy were prepared. The <b>metalloscope</b> and electronic microscope and XRD {{were used to}} characterize the microstructure and composition of the samples. The elevated temperature mechanical properties of the samples were tested and the strontium phases in the AE 42 and their influence to the mechanical properties analyzed. The {{results showed that the}} main strontium phase in the AE 42 was Al 4 Sr. Al 4 Sr pinned the crystal boundary of magnesium matrix and hindered dislocation climbing and sliding through the crystal boundary effectively. As a result, the crystal axial range was reduced and the crystal grain refined, and hence the creep resistance increased. ...|$|E
40|$|The dislocations and {{precipitates}} in SI-GaAs single crystals {{are revealed}} by ultrasonic-aided Abrahams-Buiocchi etching (USAB), and the etch pits are observed and measured by <b>metalloscope</b> and {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), respectively. The size of etch pit revealed by USAB etching is about 1 order of magnitude smaller than that revealed by molten KOH. The amount of arsenic atoms in the dislocation-dense zone is about 1 % larger than that in an adjacent dislocation-free zone measured by EDS attached to SEM, which indicates that the excess arsenic atoms adjacent to the dislocation-dense zone are attracted to the dislocations and precipitate there due to the deformation energy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{the size}} effect of {{thickness}} on fracture toughness in the fracture {{behavior of a}} kind of copper foils was studied experimentally and analytically. Copper foil specimens with thicknesses ranging from 0. 02 mm to 1 mm were adopted. The fracture toughness defined as the value of the critical J integral at cracking initiation was shown to depend on foils ’ thickness within a certain range of thickness. For elucidating the relationship between fracture toughness and thickness, microscopic experimental analysis was carried out. <b>Metalloscope</b> results also showed that microscopic structure of different specimens with different thicknesses is also a factor affecting the fracture toughness. In order to explore the effect of pure thickness on fracture, specimens with the same microscopic structure were also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Salt fog {{corrosion}} test {{was employed to}} observe the corrosion behavior of welded joint of 7 N 01 -T 4 aluminum alloy of high-speed train. Tensile strength and hardness change after corrosion were tested and micro morphology was observed by <b>metalloscope</b> and LCSM. The results indicated that HAZ was the most sensitive corrosion zone in welded joint of 7 N 01 -T 4 in chlorinated moisture environment. Influenced by the heat-input of welding, the grains of HAZ were coarsening and inhomogeneous. A corrosion cell between welding seam with high Mg content and HAZ with high Zn content formed. HAZ corroded preferentially as anode, and the dissolving of zinc-rich phase in grain boundary resulted in the extending of corrosion crack along grain boundaries...|$|E

40|$|A CoO {{glass-ceramic}} was {{coated on}} 200 stainless steel and its thermal shock resistance and anti-oxidation effect were detected at 600 - 1250 degrees C in ambient air. This coating was prepared by a slurry method and it exhibited fairly good adhesion, oxidation resistance and stability at elevated temperature. Specifically, its thermal shock resistance and anti-oxidation effect were detected.

40|$|Abstract. Molybdenum {{alloying}} {{or modified}} layer was fabricated on the H 13 steel substrate by electronic spark deposition technique (EDS). The microstructure, element distribution and microhardness of the modified layer {{were analyzed using}} <b>metalloscope,</b> X-ray diffraction (XRD), Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy (GDOES) and microhardness tester, respectively. The modified layer is composed of white layer, diffuse layer and heat affected zone. The interdiffusion between Mo element and other elements in H 13 substrate results in Metallurgical bonding. Microhardness of the coating is 1482 HK 0. 025 which is 5 times {{higher than that of}} H 13 steel base (280 HK 0. 025). The ball-on-disc dry sliding test indicates that the friction coefficient of H 13 substrate is decreased obviously by the molybdenum modified layer.

40|$|Keywords:Electrolytic and {{chemical}} etching;Surface morphology;DLC coating; Adhesion Abstract. To improve adhesion strength of DLC coatings on {{304 stainless steel}} substrate,we studied substrate pretreatment by electrolytic/chemical etching methods. In this study,The DLC coatings were deposited on two groups of 304 stainless steel which had been electrolytically {{and chemical}}ly etched separately. The morphology of the coatings and substrate were characterized by SEM and <b>metalloscope.</b> The surface roughness of substrate was measured by roughness tester. The result shows that adhesion strength of DLC coatings on 304 stainless steel substrate is improved obviously due to mechanical interlock,surface adsorption and stress release. With prolonging the etching time,the adhesion strength of DLC coatings on the chemically etched substrate increase firstly and then decrease. The adhesion strength of DLC coatings on electrolytically etched substrate continuously increase. DLC coatings on electrolytically etched substrate perform better than the one on chemically etched substrate in adhesion. This {{is caused by the}} different surface morphology...|$|E

The novel decarbonization-resistant nano-coating has been successfully fabricated, by using a low-cost, and easily accessible bauxite minerals and other additional components, including magnesia, silicon carbide, glass powder and agglomerant, {{which is used to}} prevent spring steels from being decarburized during the hot-rolling process. The microstructure of the protective nano-coating is observed by means of X-ray diffraction, TG-DTA, <b>metalloscope</b> and so on. It is found that even if some glass ceramic exists within the coating in the initial lower temperature (950 degrees C similar to 1000 degrees C) the decarbonization-preventing coating still presents decarburization resistance up to 72. 2 %. Furthermore, the protective ration reaches to 100 % when the heating temperature rises to range (1050 degrees C similar to 1100 degrees C). The excellent decarbonization preventing properties are attributed to the formation of glass ceramic and pleonaste, which hinders the second interdiffusion of oxygen and carbon...|$|E
