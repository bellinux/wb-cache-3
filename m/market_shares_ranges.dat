National-level scanner data for mainstream supermarkets are employed to assess <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> and price premiums, {{as well as to}} estimate key demand elasticities. Container size is important in analyzing <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> for organics. Half-gallon containers are the principle organic <b>market</b> with volume <b>shares</b> <b>ranging</b> from 1. 6 % to 2. 8 % in 1999. <b>Market</b> <b>shares</b> for quarts and gallons of organic milk are considerably below 0. 5 %. Price premiums for organic milk averaged 60 % of branded prices and 75 % of private-label prices during the study period (November 1996 -December 1999). Own-price elasticities suggest considerable response to lower organic prices, although the magnitude of this response declines as expenditure shares increase in later months. Cross-price elasticities indicate that organic and branded milks are usually substitutes but with considerable asymmetry in responses; branded prices affect organic purchases much more than the converse. Expenditure elasticities for organic milk imply that as milk expenditures decline, quantities purchased of organic milk will increase. Jointly, the elasticities suggest considerable response to changing retail prices. organic foods, beverage milk, almost ideal demand system, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsBryan W. SchurleThe {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} simulation model to determine the probability of achieving a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal. Two different simulation models were developed and compared allowing the author to select the best model. The first simulation model developed used the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the mean and the standard deviation of historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the standard deviation. So, a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> of 31. 00 % and a standard deviation of 3. 88 % were used in the simulation. When these values were simulated the results determined the probability of achieving the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal of 33 %. The simulation results indicated that only 12 out of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal. Therefore, there is a 12 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on the current <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and historical <b>market</b> <b>share</b> standard deviation. To predict future <b>market</b> <b>share,</b> a regression model was used to determine the impact of factors on <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The regression model was used to forecast an estimate of <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> This forecasted share of 31. 13 % was used as the mean and 3. 45 %, the standard error of the model, was used to generate a second simulation model. The simulation results indicated that 26 of 100 observations resulted in <b>market</b> <b>share</b> greater than the goal of 33 %. This indicates that there is a 26 % probability of achieving or exceeding the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> goal based on results using regression to predict future <b>market</b> <b>share</b> and variability in <b>market</b> <b>share.</b> The second simulation model generated from the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> forecast and standard error from the regression model produced the better results.

The effects of changes in R&D and S&M expenditures to future <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> are investigated by using comparable and descriptive methods and regression analysis.
