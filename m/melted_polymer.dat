50|$|Benchtop {{injectors}} {{are smaller}} and simpler than their larger commercial counterparts because {{they rely on}} the operator to manually inject <b>melted</b> <b>polymer</b> into the mold and remove the finished part from the mold. Production injectors automatically inject <b>melted</b> <b>polymer</b> at a prescribed rate into the mold, cool the mold to rapidly solidify the polymer, then eject the part from the mold once it's cool. The two halves of the mold must be pressed together with great force to prevent a defect in the part where the two halves meet, and the nozzle of the injector must be pressed tightly against the inlet port of the mold to prevent the escape of <b>melted</b> <b>polymer</b> and again a defect in the finished part. In a benchtop injector this is done manually by clamping or bolting the mold together and clamping the complete mold into the injector. In a production injector this is accomplished with hydraulic or pneumatic actuators, which increase {{the cost of the}} machine but dramatically reduce the labor required to produce a finished part.|$|E

The resultant web is collected into rolls and subsequently converted to finished products. The extremely fine fibers (typically polypropylene) differ from other extrusions, particularly spun bond, in that they have low intrinsic strength but much smaller size offering key properties. Often melt blown is added to spun bond to form SM or SMS webs, which are strong and offer the intrinsic benefits of fine fibers such as fine filtration, low pressure drop as used in face masks or filters and physical benefits such as acoustic insulation as used in dishwashers. One of the largest users of SM and SMS materials is the disposable diaper and feminine care industry.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The fire hazards {{associated}} with polypropylene wall linings sub-jected to small ignition sources, were evaluated using large scale experiments and cone calorimetry. A series of seven ignition sources with increasing sever-ity as recommended in BS 5852 {{were used in}} the tests. The results obtained in-dicate that ignition of the polypropylene linings is likely when exposed to igni-tion sources 5 to 7 as defined in BS 5852. It was observed that the melting behaviour of the polypropylene wall linings significantly affected the burning behaviour. A pool fire, consisting of <b>melted</b> <b>polymer,</b> formed {{at the base of the}} wall which then controlled the fire growth processes. The rate of flame spread on the lining surface which depended on the growth of the pool fire was slow because the thin polymer sheet could only supply a limited amount of <b>melted</b> <b>polymer</b> to the pool. The estimated heat release rates from the pool fire were close to the values measured in the cone calorimeter at the heat flux level of 25 kW m- 2.

In this paper, we introduce simply fabricated and more useful low-temperature indicator (~ 30  °C) for devices that actuates using paraffin-infiltrated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) coiled yarn. The density difference of MWCNT yarn provides large strain (~ 330  %) when heat causes the <b>melted</b> <b>polymer</b> to move. Furthermore, the MWCNT yarn decreases the melting point of paraffin.

30|$|To {{minimise}} heat transfer, Popov et al. (Popov et al. 2004) {{developed a}} technique of surface {{selective laser sintering}} (SSLS) to fabricate 3 D composite scaffolds that are both bioactive and biodegradable. SSLS is different to conventional SLS {{in terms of using}} the laser power and laser intensity. In the conventional SLS process, polymer particles absorb infrared radiation (λ =  10.6  µm) and are completely melted. <b>Melted</b> <b>polymer</b> particles are then fused with each other to form a bulk shape. This process involves large volumetric shrinkage. In the SSLS process, a near-infrared laser radiation (λ =  0.97  µm) is used, which is not absorbed by polymer particles at all. For the sintering purpose, polymer particles are coated with carbon. Hence, the melting of polymer is limited to the surface layer of polymer particles. Since there is no overheating in the particles’ internal region, the SSLS technology has the potential to maintain the nature of delicate biomolecules inside the polymer particles during the scaffold fabrication (Bartolo et al. 2008; Antonov et al. 2005; Kanczler et al. 2009).|$|E

40|$|To {{design an}} {{extruder}} screw {{for a given}} polymer, the barrel length for melting is needed for a given flow rate and speed. The melting rate needed for calculating the length is given through the conservation laws in cylindrical coordinates based on defined fundamental average parameters. Extrusion machine data are {{used to calculate the}} functions of the parameters. Results based on polyethylene data are given. Background Detailed distributed analytical models [1, 2] have been developed for melting with elaborate experimental freezeout data for verification. A laboratory technique for measuring melting under compacting stress was introduced [3], and it was further developed [4] and modeled [5]. Many versions of a distributed model for melting are available [6], each with its own set of assumptions and technique. Conversely, the model developed here uses the performance data of operating extruders to comprehensively establish average general terms of the energy equation that control the melting process. Model Domain of Melting: The extruder is divided into three domains (volumes), which are the feed, melting, and pumping domains. The lengths of the extruder that pertain to each domain are defined portions. Portions are determined by thermodynamics and not by geometrical changes (as typically are sections of the screw). Figure 1 shows the melting portion of the extruder to begin at axial position Lf, where the first melting of the polymer occurs (usually on the barrel). The end of the melting portion is reached at axial position Lm, where the average enthalpy (and temperature) of the polymer are those of the fully <b>melted</b> <b>polymer.</b> Mass Balance: Solid and melt flow will exist at any point, but the net flow in the axial direction is constant at any cross section (see Figure 2).

40|$|The {{generalized}} entropy theory (GET) {{offers many}} insights into how molecular parameters influence polymer glass-formation. Given {{the fact that}} chain rigidity often plays {{a critical role in}} understanding the glass-formation of polymer materials, the GET was originally developed based on models of semiflexible chains. Consequently, all previous calculations within the GET considered polymers with some degree of chain rigidity. Motivated by unexpected results from computer simulations of fully flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>melts</b> concerning the dependence of thermodynamic and dynamic properties on the cohesive interaction strength (ϵ), the present paper employs the GET to explore the influence of ϵ on glass-formation in models of <b>polymer</b> <b>melts</b> with a vanishing bending rigidity, i. e., fully flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>melts.</b> In accord with simulations, the GET for fully flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>melts</b> predicts that basic dimensionless thermodynamic properties (such as the thermal expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility) are universal functions of the temperature scaled by ϵ in the regime of low pressures. Similar scaling behavior is also found for the configurational entropy density in the GET for fully flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>melts.</b> Moreover, we find that the characteristic temperatures of glass-formation increase linearly with ϵ and that the fragility is independent of ϵ in fully flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>melts,</b> predictions that are again consistent with simulations of glass-forming <b>polymer</b> <b>melts</b> composed of fully flexible chains. Beyond an explanation of these general trends observed in simulations, the GET for fully flexible <b>polymer</b> <b>melts</b> predicts the presence of a positive residual configurational entropy at low temperatures, indicating a return to Arrhenius relaxation in the low temperature glassy state.
