25|$|Frequencies below {{approximately}} 10MHz (wavelengths {{longer than}} 30 meters), including broadcasts in the mediumwave and shortwave bands (and {{to some extent}} longwave), propagate most efficiently by skywave at night. Frequencies above 10MHz (wavelengths shorter than 30 meters) typically propagate most efficiently during the day. Frequencies lower than 3kHz have a wavelength longer than {{the distance between the}} Earth and the ionosphere. The <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> for skywave propagation is strongly influenced by sunspot number.|$|E
2500|$|Skywave propagation, also {{referred}} to as skip, is any of the modes that rely on reflection (actually refraction) of radio waves from the ionosphere. [...] The ionosphere is [...] a region of the atmosphere from about 60km (37mi) to 500km (310mi) that contains layers of charged particles (ions) which can refract a radio wave back toward the Earth. [...] A radio wave directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth beyond the horizon by these layers, allowing long distance radio transmission. The F2 layer is the most important ionospheric layer for long-distance, multiple-hop HF propagation, though F1, E, and D-layers also play significant roles. The D-layer, when present during sunlight periods, causes significant amount of signal loss, as does the E-layer whose <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> can rise to 4MHz and above and thus block higher frequency signals from reaching the F2-layer. The layers, or more appropriately [...] "regions", are directly affected by the sun on a daily diurnal cycle, a seasonal cycle and the 11-year sunspot cycle and determine the utility of these modes. During solar maxima, or sunspot highs and peaks, the whole HF range up to 30MHz can be used usually around the clock and F2 propagation up to 50MHz is observed frequently depending upon daily solar flux 10.7cm radiation values. During solar minima, or minimum sunspot counts down to zero, propagation of frequencies above 15MHz is generally unavailable.|$|E

50|$|The Kp-index is {{used for}} the study and {{prediction}} of ionospheric propagation of high frequency radio signals. Geomagnetic storms, indicated by a Kp = 5 or higher, have no direct effect on propagation. However they disturb the F-layer of the ionosphere, especially at middle and high geographical latitudes, causing a so-called ionospheric storm which degrades radio propagation. The degradation mainly consists of a reduction of the <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> (MUF) by as much as 50%. Sometimes the E-layer may be affected as well. In contrast with sudden ionospheric disturbances (SID), which affect high frequency radio paths near the Equator, the effects of ionospheric storms are more intense in the polar regions.|$|E

A delay equaliser designed to this specification can therefore insert a delay of 33μs. In reality, the differential delay that might be required to equalise may be many hundreds of microseconds. A chain of many sections in tandem will be required. For television purposes, a maximum frequency of 6 MHz might be chosen, which corresponds to a delay of 83ns. Again, many sections {{may be required to}} fully equalise. In general, much greater attention is paid to the routing and exact length of television cables because many more equaliser sections are required to remove the same delay difference as compared to audio.|$|E

5000|$|Skywave {{modes of}} radio {{communication}} operate by bending (refracting) radio waves (electromagnetic radiation) through the Ionosphere. During the [...] "peaks" [...] {{of the solar}} cycle, the ionosphere becomes increasingly ionized by solar photons and cosmic rays. This affects the propagation of the radio wave in complex ways that can either facilitate or hinder communications. Forecasting of skywave modes is of considerable interest to commercial marine and aircraft communications, amateur radio operators and shortwave broadcasters. These users occupy frequencies within the High Frequency or 'HF' radio spectrum that are most affected by these solar and ionospheric variances. Changes in solar output affect the <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency,</b> a limit on the highest frequency usable for communications.|$|E
5000|$|Though fairly regular in its characteristics, {{it is not}} {{observable}} everywhere or on all days. The principal {{reflecting layer}} during the summer for paths of 2,000 to 3,500 km is the F1 layer. However, this depends upon the frequency of a propagating signal. The E layer electron density and resultant MUF, <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency,</b> during high solar activity periods can refract and thus block signals of up to about 15 MHz from reaching the F1 and F2 regions, {{with the result that}} distances are much shorter than possible with refractions from the F1 and F2 regions. But extremely low radiation-angle signals (<6 degrees or so) can reach distances of 3000 km via E region refractions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> {{regularly}} {{drops below}} 10 MHz in darkness {{during the winter}} months, while in summer during daylight it can easily surpass 30 MHz. It depends on the angle of incidence of the waves; it is lowest when the waves are directed straight upwards, and is higher with less acute angles. This means that at longer distances, where the waves graze the ionosphere at a very blunt angle, the MUF may be much higher. The lowest usable frequency depends on the absorption in the lower layer of the ionosphere (the D-layer). This absorption is stronger at low frequencies and is also stronger with increased solar activity (for example in daylight); total absorption often occurs at frequencies below 5 MHz during daytime. The result of these two factors is that the usable spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies and into the Medium Frequency (MF) range during winter nights, while on a day in full summer the higher frequencies {{tend to be more}} usable, often into the lower VHF range.|$|E
