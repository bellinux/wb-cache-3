40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{forecast}} variability in <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> by using interval measured data and interval computing method. Design/methodology/approach – Variability (interval) forecasts generated by the interval computing are compared with lower- and upper-bound forecasts based on the ordinary least squares (OLS) rolling regressions. Findings – On average, 56 per cent of annual changes in <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> may be predicted by OLS lower- and upper-bound forecasts while the interval method improves forecasting accuracy to 72 per cent. Research limitations/implications – This paper uses the interval computing method to forecast variability in <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates.</b> Future studies may expand variability forecasting into more risk-managing areas. Practical implications – Results of this study may be interesting to executive officers of banks, mortgage companies, and insurance companies, builders, investors, and other financial decision makers with an interest in <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates.</b> Originality/value – Although it is well-known that changes in <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> can significantly affect the housing market and economy, there is not much serious research that attempts to forecast variability in <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> in the literature.

40|$|We employ {{empirical}} pricing {{models for}} mortgage-backed security (MBS) yields and for <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> to measure deviations from normal market functioning {{in order to}} assess how the Federal Reserve MBS purchase program [...] a 16 month program announced on November 25, 2008 and completed on March 31, 2010 [...] affected risk premiums that were embedded in mortgage and swap markets. Our pricing models suggest that the announcement of the program, which signaled strong and credible government backing for mortgage markets in particular and for the financial system more generally, reduced <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> by about 85 basis points between November 25 and December 31, 2008, even though no MBS had (yet) been purchased by the Federal Reserve; Once the Federal Reserve's MBS program started purchasing MBS, we estimate that the abnormal risk premiums embedded <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> decreased roughly 50 basis points. However, observed <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> declined only slightly because of generally rising interest rates.; After May 27, 2009 fairly normal pricing conditions existed in U. S. primary and secondary mortgage markets; that is, the relationship between <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> and its determinants was similar to that observed prior to the financial crisis. After the end of the Federal Reserve's MBS purchase program on March 31, 2010, <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> and interest rates more generally were significantly less than they had been at the beginning.; In sum, we estimate that the Federal Reserve's MBS purchase program removed substantial risk premiums embedded in <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> because of the financial crisis. The Federal Reserve also re-established a robust secondary mortgage market, which meant that the marginal mortgage borrower was funded by the capital markets and not directly by the banks during the financial crisis-had bank funding been the only source of funds, primary <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> would have been much higher.; Lastly, many observers have attributed part of the Federal Reserve's effect from purchasing MBS to portfolio rebalancing. We find that if portfolio rebalancing had a substantial effect, it may have had its greatest importance only after the Federal Reserve's purchases ended, but while the Federal Reserve held {{a substantial portion of the}} stock of outstanding MBS.

5000|$|The {{price to}} income ratio {{is the basic}} {{affordability}} measure for housing in a given area. It is generally the ratio of median house prices to median familial disposable incomes, expressed as a percentage or as years of income. It is sometimes compiled separately for first-time buyers and termed attainability. This ratio, applied to individuals, is a basic component of mortgage lending decisions. According to a back-of-the-envelope calculation by Goldman Sachs, a comparison of median home prices to median household income suggests that U.S. housing in 2005 was overvalued by 10%. [...] "However, this estimate {{is based on an}} average <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> of about 6%, and we expect rates to rise", the firm's economics team wrote in a recent report. According to Goldman's figures, a one-percentage-point rise in mortgage rates would reduce the fair value of home prices by 8%.|$|E
50|$|Securitization {{allows the}} banks to quickly relend {{the money to}} other borrowers (including {{in the form of}} {{mortgages}}) and thereby to create more mortgages than the banks could with the amount they have on deposit. This in turn allows the public to use these mortgages to purchase homes, something the government wishes to encourage. Investors in conforming loans, meanwhile, gain low-risk income at a higher interest rate (essentially the <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate,</b> minus the cuts of the bank and GSE) than they could gain from most other bonds. Securitization has grown rapidly in the last 10 years {{as a result of the}} wider dissemination of technology in the mortgage lending world. For borrowers with superior credit, government loans and ideal profiles, this securitization keeps rates almost artificially low, since the pools of funds used to create new loans can be refreshed more quickly than in years past, allowing for more rapid outflow of capital from investors to borrowers without as many personal business ties as in the past.|$|E

In Australia, [...] "honeymoon" [...] mortgages with introductory rates are common, but can last as short as a year, and may instead offer a fixed reduction in interest rate rather than a fixed rate itself. Furthermore, they are often combined with properties of flexible mortgages to create what is known as an Australian mortgage, which often allow borrowers to overpay to reduce interest charges and then draw on these overpayments in the future.|$|E

At the cross-country level the use of LTV caps decelerates property price growth. Both LTV and DTI caps slow property lending growth. LTV caps also affect a broader range of financial stability indicators in economies with pegged exchange rates and currency boards. For Hong Kong SAR, LTV policy tends to be forward looking, with caps lowered to counter downward movements in <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates,</b> and higher growth in mortgage loan and volumes of transactions. The reduction in caps appears to respond to small and medium size flat price appreciation, and contributes to a decline in high-end volume growth after a year and total transactions volume growth after 1 Â½? 2 years. Price growth responds favorably after 2 years. The evidence suggests LTV tightening could affect property activity through the expectations channel rather than through the credit channel.
