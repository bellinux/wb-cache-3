50|$|Broiler {{chickens}} are yellow {{when they}} are fed with carotenoid-containing feed, as these carotenoids are accumulated in skin and subcutaneous fat of the animal. Carotenoid deposition is also {{the cause of the}} yellow colour of egg yolk. For this reason, poultry producers add carotenoids (typically lutein, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin and β-apo-8´-apocarotenal) to the feed to increase the attractiveness of the final product for the consumer, but also to support animal health. It is believed that lutein and zeaxanthin act synergistically to increase the yellow hue, whereas zeaxanthin is more powerful than lutein due to its larger chromophore. Therefore, a number of companies use <b>marigold</b> <b>extract</b> where a percentage of lutein has been converted into zeaxanthin (the meso form, meso-zeaxanthin) in order to supplement broilers and hens with both carotenoids. The isomer of zeaxanthin obtained from lutein is meso-zeaxanthin {{due to the nature of}} the technique used (see below). Indeed, meso-zeaxanthin has been identified in eggs from Mexico and California.|$|E

40|$|The methanol, {{petroleum}} ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol {{and water}} extracts {{were obtained by}} extraction of marigold flower (Calendula officinalis L). The content of total phenolic compounds, determined by UV spectrophotometric method using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, was 15. 12 mg/g. The content of total flavonoids, determined by UV spectrophotometric method according to Markham, was 5. 13 mg/g. Qualitative determination of phenolic compounds in the extracts was performed by one- and two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC) procedures. The results of one- and two-dimensional TLC analyses showed that different flavonoids and phenolic acids {{were present in the}} investigated extracts. The greatest number of flavonoids (rutin, quercetin and some unidentified flavonoid glycosides) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, coumaric and vanillic acid) were deteminated in methanol extract. The influence of <b>marigold</b> <b>extracts,</b> in concentration range 0. 6 - 1. 2 mg/mL, on 2, 2 ’-diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals was investigated by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.

40|$|Abstract: The {{stability}} of carotenoids was studied in <b>marigold</b> oil <b>extracts</b> prepared with following solvents: Myritol 312 ®, paraffin oil, almond oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, grape seed oil, and soybean oil. The {{concentration of the}} carotenoids was deter-mined by spectroscopic measurement at 450 nm. Degradation rate showed a first or-der dependence on the concentration of carotenoids with a faster first stage (which lasted 35 – 50 days, depending on the solvent) and a slower second stage. The highest degradation rates were observed in extracts prepared with linoleic acid rich solvents (sunflower oil, soybean oil and grape seed oil), while the lowest were found in oil with saturated fatty acids (Myritol 312 ®) and paraffin oil. These results confirm {{the connection between the}} degradation of carotenoids and lipid autoxidation, and sug-gest that the influence of the oil solvents on the {{stability of}} oil extracts of Calendula officinalis is a factor that must be considered when selecting a solvent for the pro-duction of <b>marigold</b> oil <b>extracts...</b>|$|R

In addition, the in vivo capacity to prevent/treat the UVB irradiation-induced skin damage, in hairless mice, of the formulation with better skin penetration capacity was investigated. All of the formulations were physically and functionally stable. The gel formulation [Formulation 3 (F 3) ] was the most effective for the topical delivery of ME, which was detected as 0. 21 mu g/cm(2) of narcissin and as 0. 07 mu g/cm(2) of the rutin in the viable epidermis. This formulation was able to maintain glutathione reduced levels close to those of nonirradiated animals, but did not affect the gelatinase- 9 and myeloperoxidase activities increased by exposure to UVB irradiation. In addition, F 3 reduced the histological skin changes induced by UVB irradiation that appear as modifications of collagen fibrils. Therefore, the photoprotective effect in hairless mice achieved with the topical application of ME in gel formulation is most likely associated with a possible improvement in the collagen synthesis in the subepidermal connective tissue.

40|$|Abstract. Marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) {{has long}} {{been used as a}} {{medicinal}} herb for a number of therapeutic activities. In the present study, the cytotoxicities of ethanol and ethyl acetate <b>extracts</b> of <b>marigold</b> flowers and their inhibitory effects on elastase and tyrosinase enzymes were investigated. An MTT assay was performed to measure the cytotoxicity of these two extracts on the H 460 lung cancer and the Caco‑ 2 colon cancer cell lines. An elastase assay kit, based on the diges-tion of a non‑fluorescent elastin substrate to highly fluorescent fragments by elastase, was used for the elastase inhibition assay. Tyrosinase inhibition activity was investigated using the dopachrome method with L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) as a substrate. The data obtained in this study demonstrated that the extracts were nontoxic to H 460 and Caco- 2 cell lines. The elastase inhibition activities of ethanol (250 µg/ml) and ethyl acetate (125 µg/ml) extracts were found to be significantly higher than that of the negative control.

The recommended doses are a function both of the type and severity of the condition to be treated and the individual condition of each patient. Therefore, the present study investigated the potential use of Calendula officinalis extract to prevent UV irradiation-induced oxidative stress in skin. Methods: Firstly, the physico-chemical composition of <b>marigold</b> extract(ME) (hydroalcoholic <b>extract)</b> was assessed and the in vitro antioxidant efficacy was determined using different methodologies. Secondly, the cytotoxicity was evaluated in L 929 and HepG 2 cells with the MTT assay. Finally, the in vivo protective effect of ME against UVB-induced oxidative stress in the skin of hairless mice was evaluated by determining reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and monitoring the secretion/activity of metalloproteinases. Results and conclusions: The polyphenol, flavonoid, rutin and narcissin contents found in ME were 28. 6 mg/g, 18. 8 mg/g, 1. 6 mg/g and 12. 2 mg/g, respectively and evaluation of the in vitro antioxidant activity demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of ME against different radicals. Cytoxicity experiments demonstrated that ME was not cytotoxic for L 929 and HepG 2 cells at concentrations {{less than or equal to}} of 15 mg/mL However, concentrations greater than or equal to 30 mg/mL, toxic effects were observed. Finally, oral treatment of hairless mice with 150 and 300 mg/kg of ME maintained GSH levels close to non-irradiated control mice. In addition, this extract affects the activity/secretion of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP- 2 and - 9) stimulated by exposure to UVB irradiation. However, additional studies are required to have a complete understanding of the protective effects of ME for skin. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
