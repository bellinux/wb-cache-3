40|$|The {{effect of}} ammonia of {{low and high}} {{concentrations}} on <b>milled</b> <b>wheat</b> straw on biogas production was investigated. Aqueous ammonia was applied to <b>milled</b> <b>wheat</b> straw in a pretreatment process to assess improvement in biogas production through anaerobic digestion. Two different concentrations, 4 % (low) and 15 % (high), of ammonia were applied to mechanically pretreated wheat straw for 48 hours at 50 oC. Fermented sludge, obtained from Lemvig Biogasanlæg, was used as inoculum and 12 reactors were loaded {{with a mix of}} inoculum and pretreated wheat straw in a VS ratio of 4 : 1. <b>Milled</b> <b>wheat</b> straw pretreated with 15 % ammonia produced the highest average yield with 26. 5 ml per gVS- 1 and a cumulative output of 367 ml gVS- 1 compared with an average production of 19 ml per gVS- 1 and a cumulative output of 289 ml gVS- 1 of the 4 % ammonia pretreated <b>milled</b> <b>wheat</b> straw. Both produced more than the milling-only pretreatment which yielded 12. 8 ml per gVS- 1. with a cumulative 192 ml gVS- 1. The results indicate an increase in production of biogas per gVS- 1 for pretreatments using higher concentrations of ammonia. Based on the differences alone it seems that the ammonia pretreatment is effective at increasing biogas yield in a lab setting, however, no statistical significance was found for the data collected with regards to the effect of the ammonia pretreatment on biogas production (p= 0. 012). A second experiment was conducted examining the physical effects of the ammonia pretreatment which strong suggest that ammonia pretreatment has an effect on the sinkability of wheat straw, eliminating the scum layer formed under usual circumstances by wheat straw added to manure. A correlation between ammonia concentration applied to the wheat straw and sinkability was observed...|$|R

Resistant starch content of cooked rice may decrease due to grinding or cooking.|$|R

The main grain crop is <b>milling</b> <b>wheat,</b> which is {{typically}} high in quality and protein. There is a growing trend for Kazakhstan to export its grain internationally. In 2011, the country netted a record crop - nearly 27m tonnes, which enabled it to set its grain export target at nearly 15m tonnes for the 2011/2012 marketing year. FAS/Astana forecasts Kazakhstan’s wheat production in 2014 at 14.5 million tons, up from 13.9 million tons in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|Starch {{also affects}} the {{viscosity}} of predough. At room temperature and in sufficient water, intact starch granules can absorb {{water up to}} 50% of their own dry weight, causing them to swell to a limited extent. The slightly swollen granules {{are found in the}} spaces between the gluten network, thus contributing to the consistency of the dough. However, {{it should also be noted}} that the granules may not be intact, as the process of <b>milling</b> <b>wheat</b> into flour damages some of the starch granules. Given that damaged starch granules have the capacity to absorb around three times as much water as undamaged starch, the use of flour with higher levels of damaged starch requires the addition of more water to achieve optimal dough development and consistency ...|$|E

5000|$|The children's home {{itself is}} {{situated}} {{in an area of}} 22 acre. Here is the main building and a large outbuilding which everybody simply refers to as the [...] "new building". In this area, too, are the cowshed, stables, pig shed and various other farm buildings, garages, the workshop and stores. There are 7 polytunnels (i.e. polyethylene greenhouses) which alone cover an area of 23.000 SF. It {{can be seen from the}} foregoing how much dependence there is on the farm (set up through considerable effort) together with gifts from abroad. In the fields and polytunnels, among other things, carrots, parsley, kohlrabi, potatoes, radish, cauliflower, peas, beans, tomatoes, paprika, beetroot, cabbage etc. are grown. Out of this, other institutions are supported too. An apiary provides honey for the children. Cattle and pig stocks provide meat and dairy produce: milk, sour cream and cottage cheese. Altogether, approx. 120 acre is under cereals: spelt, durum wheat and other <b>milling</b> <b>wheat,</b> providing all-year-round feeding for the animals. Unfortunately, more often than not, they are unsuitable for bread flour. The working bakery supplies the daily bread requirements, also rolls and approx. 15 types of bakery produce.
