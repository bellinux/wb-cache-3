One of {{machining process}} technologies that can reduce production costs and simultaneously prevents the environmental damage due to the use of cooling lubricant (cutting fluid) is dry <b>machining.</b> <b>Turning</b> with actively driven rotary tools is a novel method that has the potential for applying this dry machining technology. This paper presents an experimental study the effects of tool rotational speeds on the workpiece surface roughness. In order to apply the turning with actively driven rotary tool, a multi axis turning machine tool, Mori Seiki NT 4200 DCG, that applicable for industry is utilized. The surface roughness value is obtained by measuring the surface roughness profile using a Surface Roughness Tester, Mitutoyo. Experimental results show that the surface roughness value could be reduced by increasing the tool rotational speed both in tool rotation direction of clockwise and counterclockwise. However, a decreasing trend of the surface roughness value based on the increase of tool rotational speeds is limited by the rigidity of tool holder system...|$|E
40|$|Burnishing is a {{cold working}} surface {{treatment}} process in which plastic deformation of surface irregularities occurs by exerting pressure through a very hard and a very smooth roller or ball on a surface to generate a uniform and work-hardened surface.

This tool allows for generating simultaneously the <b>machining</b> (<b>turning)</b> and the burnishing of the cylindrical surface using a turning machine. First, turned surfaces at different conditions, sketches, finishing and half finishing were performed using only the cutting tool. The evolutions of a surface roughness parameter and the technological time relative to every test condition have been investigated. Second, using the combined machining/burnishing tool at coarse conditions, the evolutions of the surface roughness and the technological time have been also investigated.

The study aimed at evaluating the best process environment which could simultaneously satisfy multiple requirements of quality and productivity. In view of the fact, the traditional Taguchi method cannot solve a multi-objective optimization problem; to overcome this limitation, TOPSIS and Utility concepts have been coupled with Taguchi method. These two concepts have been adopted to convert a multi-response optimization problem into a single response optimization problem; in which CC (Closeness Coefficient) and U (Utility Index), respectively serve as the representative single objective function for optimization. The study combined TOPSIS/Utility and Taguchi method for predicting optimal setting. Based on Taguchi’s Signal-to- Noise ratio (S/N), analysis has been made on the CC/U and optimal process environment has been selected finally which corresponds to highest S/N Ratio of the CC/U. Optimal result has been verified through confirmatory test.

40|$|Optimization of {{machining}} processes not only increases machining efficiency and economics, {{but also the}} end product quality. In recent years, among the traditional optimization methods, stochastic direct search optimization methods such as meta-heuristic algorithms are being increasingly applied for solving machining optimization problems. Their {{ability to deal with}} complex, multi-dimensional and ill-behaved optimization problems made them the preferred optimization tool by most researchers and practitioners. This paper introduces the use of pattern search (PS) algorithm, as a deterministic direct search optimization method, for solving machining optimization problems. To analyze the applicability and performance of the PS algorithm, six case studies of machining optimization problems, both single and multi-objective, were considered. The PS algorithm was employed to determine optimal combinations of machining parameters for different {{machining processes}} such as abrasive waterjet <b>machining,</b> <b>turning,</b> turn-milling, drilling, electrical discharge machining and wire electrical discharge machining. In each case study the optimization solutions obtained by the PS algorithm were compared with the optimization solutions that had been determined by past researchers using meta-heuristic algorithms. Analysis of obtained optimization results indicates that the PS algorithm is very applicable for solving machining optimization problems showing good competitive potential against stochastic direct search methods such as meta-heuristic algorithms. Specific features and merits of the PS algorithm were also discussed...|$|E

The manufacture and use of high strength, lightweight materials such as titanium alloys have become of great importance in the aerospace and biomedical industries over the past few decades. The manufacturing costs of titanium alloy components however, are considered high due to the poor machinability of the material. Furthermore, as with all metals during machining, surface residual stresses are induced into the material. These are of particular interest in the aerospace industry as they can be either detrimental or beneficial to the performance and fatigue life of materials. The aim of this investigation is therefore to examine the effect that machining parameters have on the magnitude, sign and distribution of residual stresses induced in Grade 4 and 5 titanium alloys during high performance <b>machining</b> (<b>turning).</b> The effect of these machining parameters is investigated by residual stress measurements conducted with X-ray diffraction and grain structure analysis of the machined surfaces by optical microscopy. Results show that cutting speed and depth of cut {{have a significant effect on}} the residual stresses. At low cutting speeds, the surface residual stresses are largely compressive, becoming more tensile with an increase in cutting speed. An increase in depth of cut also introduces more compressive residual stresses into the material. The microstructural analysis of the alloys shows that grain deformation decreases with an increase in cutting speed and cutting depth...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} of the paper is to obtain an optimal setting of turning process parameters-cutting speed, feed, depth of cut, cutting tool and cutting fluid which may result in optimizing the thrust force and feed force encountered during machining of EN 31 alloy. EN 31 is a high carbon alloy steel which achieves {{a high degree of}} hardness with compressive strength and abrasion resistance, but is usually known to create major challenges during its <b>machining.</b> <b>Turning</b> is the process known for its capabilities in providing machining efficiency in terms of higher machining rate low tool wear apart from reasonably good surface quality. The study was aimed to investigate the effect of several input parameters of turning operation (cutting tool, cutting oil, cutting speed, feed and depth of cut) on the different response parameters such as thrust force and feed force in turning process on EN 31. The result showed that the response variables were strongly influenced by the input parameters. The experiments were performed on conventional lathe machine. Taguchi's robust design methodology has been used for statistical planning of the experiments.

Stainless steel is a widely used material in day to day applications. This paper deals with the optimization of turning process by the effects of machining parameters applying Taguchi methods so as {{to improve the quality of}} manufactured goods, and engineering development of designs for studying variation. There are three machining parameters i. e., Spindle speed, Feed rate and Depth of cut. Experiments are done by varying one parameter and keeping other two fixed so maximum value of each parameter was obtained. Taguchi orthogonal array is designed with three levels of turning parameters with the help of software Minitab 16. In the first run nine experiments are performed and material removal rate (MRR) is calculated. When experiments are repeated in second run again MRR is calculated. Taguchi method stresses the importance of studying the response variation using the signal–to–noise (S/N) ratio, resulting in minimization of quality characteristic variation due to uncontrollable parameter. The metal removal rate was considered as the quality characteristic with the concept of "the larger-the-better. S/N ratio values are calculated by taking the help of software Minitab 16.

That’s why, some new materials are used for landing gears as refractory titanium (as Ti- 5 - 5 - 5 - 3). The machining of this material leads to high cutting forces and temperatures. So, it is necessary to use low cutting conditions on the industrial machining process. In order to increase the productivity, it is possible to increase the initial temperature of the workpiece. Hot machining is a new research track. The principle consists in heating material before machining it, in order to take advantage of its mechanical properties reduction.
