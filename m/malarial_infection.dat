25|$|The most {{dangerous}} <b>malarial</b> <b>infection</b> {{is in the}} brain and is called cerebral malaria. In cerebral malaria, the PfEMP1 proteins involved are DC8 and DC13. They are named after the number of domain cassettes they contain, and are capable of binding not only endothelial cells of the brain, but also in different organs including brain, lung, heart, and bone marrow. Initially, it was assumed that PfEMP1 binds to ICAM1 in the brain, but DC8 and DC13 were found incompatible with ICAM1. Instead DC8 and DC13 specifically bind to EPCR using CIDRα sub-types such as CIDRα1.1, CIDRα1.4, CIDRα1.5 and CIDRα1.7. However, it was later shown that DC13 can bind to both ICAM1 and EPCR. EPCR is thus a potential vaccine and drug target in cerebral malaria.|$|E

Labeled and unlabeled P. falciparum antigen was also prepared. IgG did not nonspecifically bind to malaria-damaged platelets. Binding studies with 3 H-malarial antigen demonstrated platelets have saturable binding sites for malarial antigen. Increasing concentrations of malarial antigen displaced the 125 I-IgG antimalarial antibody from the platelets. The binding of 125 I-IgG and 125 I-F(ab') 2 was similar and this excluded significant immune complex binding.

The etiology and pathogenesis of the renal lesions, however, was not understood perfectly, and the possibility that persons with the nephrotic condition have a lower resistance to P. malariae infection was not disproved completely [1, 8]. For these reasons, more detailed studies were undertaken to establish the factors responsible for the initiation and perpetuation of renal lesions, to provide additional evidence of their association with <b>malarial</b> <b>infections</b> and, especially, to investigate whether these lesions are compatible with an immune-complex pathogenesis as described in other diseases...|$|R

Malaria infections confirmed by microscopy were monitored over a six-year period. School performance was assessed by two specially designed, school grade−specific, test papers for Sinhala language and mathematics. The scores for Sinhala language and mathematics for each school term test for the year 1997 were obtained. <b>Malarial</b> <b>infections</b> were a major predictor of children’s performance in language and mathematics after controlling for parent’s education, monthly family income, and house type. The education of the father predicted language scores but not mathematics scores.

50|$|He {{proposed}} in 1949 that genetic disorders in humans living in malaria-endemic regions provide a phenotype with immunity to blood-borne haemophiles. He noted that mutations expressed in red blood cells, such as sickle-cell anemia and various thalassemias, were prevalent only in tropical regions where malaria has been endemic and were favourable traits for natural selection that protected individuals from receiving <b>malarial</b> <b>infection.</b> This concept {{of resistance to}} malaria was eventually confirmed by A.C. Allison in 1954.|$|E
5000|$|However, convincing {{evidence}} indicates, {{in areas with}} persistent malaria outbreaks, individuals with the heterozygous state have a distinct advantage (and this is why individuals with heterozygous alleles are far more common in these areas). Those with the benign sickle trait possess a resistance to <b>malarial</b> <b>infection.</b> The pathogen that causes the disease spends part of its cycle in the red blood cells and triggers an abnormal drop in oxygen levels in the cell. In carriers, this drop is sufficient to trigger the full sickle-cell reaction, which leads to infected cells being rapidly removed from circulation and strongly limiting the infection's progress. These individuals have a great resistance to infection and have a greater chance of surviving outbreaks. However, those with two alleles for SCA may survive malaria, but will typically die from their genetic disease unless {{they have access to}} advanced medical care. Those of the homozygous [...] "normal" [...] or wild-type case will have a greater chance of passing on their genes successfully, in that there is no chance of their offspring's suffering from SCA; yet, they are more susceptible to dying from <b>malarial</b> <b>infection</b> before {{they have a chance to}} pass on their genes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Chronic hepatosplenomegaly, {{which is}} known to have a complex aetiology, is common amongst {{children}} who reside in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Two of the more common infectious agents of hepatosplenomegaly amongst these children are <b>malarial</b> <b>infections</b> and schistosomiasis. The historical view of hepatosplenomegaly associated with schistosomiasis is that it is caused by gross periportal fibrosis and resulting portal hypertension. The introduction of ultrasound examinations into epidemiology studies, used in tandem with clinical examination, showed a dissociation within endemic communities between presentation with hepatosplenomegaly and ultrasound periportal fibrosis, while immuno-epidemiological studies indicate that rather than the pro-fibrotic Th 2 response that is associated with periportal fibrosis, childhood hepatosplenomegaly without ultrasound-detectable fibrosis is associated with a pro-inflammatory response. Correlative analysis has shown that the pro-inflammatory response is also associated with chronic exposure to <b>malarial</b> <b>infections</b> and there is evidence of exacerbation of hepatosplenomegaly when co-exposure to malaria and schistosomiasis occurs. The common presentation with childhood hepatosplenomegaly in rural communities means that it is an important example of a multi-factorial disease and its association with severe and subtle morbidities underlies the need for well-designed public health strategies for tackling common infectious diseases in tandem rather than in isolation...|$|R
