5|$|In January 1993, {{following}} {{an order from}} UPS Airlines, Boeing launched a freighter variant, the 767-300F, which entered service with UPS on October 16, 1995. The 767-300F featured a main deck cargo hold, upgraded landing gear, and strengthened wing structure. In November 1993, the Japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed orders for the , an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) variant based on the 767-200ER. The first two , featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance radar and other <b>monitoring</b> <b>equipment,</b> were delivered in 1998 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.|$|E
5|$|Metro {{awarded a}} $44.1 million {{contract}} {{to a joint}} venture of Atkinson and Dillingham companies to build the tunnel's 3rd Avenue segment as well as Pioneer Square station. Excavation of the station from street level began in March 1987, and the project's twin tunnel boring machines reached James Street from Union Station in September. In June 1987, Atkinson-Dillingham and Metro were fined $80,000 after drilling at the station severed three electric power transmission lines, causing a day-long power outage in downtown Seattle, affecting the City Hall and Public Safety Building. Work in the tunnel station was also blamed for shaking in the City Hall and Public Safety Building, requiring <b>monitoring</b> <b>equipment</b> {{to be set up}} by Metro.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions on Mauna Loa {{are almost}} always preceded and {{accompanied}} by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, the monitoring {{of which was the}} primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century. Following the invention of modern <b>monitoring</b> <b>equipment,</b> the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by {{more than a year of}} seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.|$|E

5|$|Two highway {{bridges and}} a railway bridge were damaged by {{flooding}} near the Guatemala border. Passing very near Socorro Island on June21, Adrian produced peak winds of 45mph (72km/h) there, potentially damaging weather <b>monitoring</b> <b>equipment.</b> Along the southern coastline of Chiapas, four people were swept away and drowned {{by a large}} wave, while farther inland in northwestern Durango, two men died and a five-year-old girl went missing after attempting to cross a river in a pick-up truck. Along the central coastline of Michoacán, a powerful hailstorm demolished many homes and left around 2,000 people homeless. A 1.2mi (2km) stretch of coastal road was ruined {{in the city of}} Tecomán. The outer bands of the hurricane produced heavy rainfall peaking at 15.75in (400mm) in the municipality of Coyutla; minor flooding was reported across Coahuila and Colima.|$|E
5|$|The main site, {{known as}} H1, was {{established}} on Hermite Island. This was {{the location of}} the control room from which the bomb would be detonated, along with the equipment to monitor the firing circuits and telemetry. It was also {{the location of the}} generators that provided electric power, and recharged the batteries of portable devices, and ultra-high-speed cameras operating at up to 8,000 frames per second. Other camera equipment was set up on Alpha Island and Northwest Island. Most of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>equipment</b> was positioned on Trimouille Island, closer to the explosion. Here, there were a plethora of blast, pressure and seismographic gauges. There were also some 200 empty petrol tins for measuring the blast, a technique that Penney had employed on Operation Crossroads. There were thermometers and calorimeters for measuring the flash, and samples of paints and fabrics for determining the effect on them. Plants would be studied to measure their uptake of fission products, particularly radioactive iodine and strontium. Stores were unloaded at beachhead H2 on Hermite Island, from whence the RAAF had built a road to H1. A stores compound was established at Gladstone Beach on Trimouille Island, known as T3.|$|E

25|$|The US Navy {{dispatched}} {{aircraft carrier}} USS Ronald Reagan and other vessels which flew {{a series of}} helicopter operations. A spokesman for U.S. 7th Fleet naval personnel stated that <b>monitoring</b> <b>equipment</b> indicated that the warship {{had been exposed to}} radiation. Separate hand-held equipment also picked up the contamination on 17 crew members, who had participated in rescue operations. Commander Jeff Davis said that the exposure was low enough that after the crew washed with soap and water, follow-up tests were negative. Davis characterized the exposure as comparable to routine civilian activities and reiterated the US Navy's commitment to the relief operation. As a precaution, the aircraft carrier was repositioned farther offshore, away from the downwind direction of the plant and decontaminated. Several helicopters were decontaminated after returning from flights. One helicopter made a landing at Fukushima Airport after experiencing rotor icing and exposed some Australian and New Zealand search and rescue team members to low levels of radiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{control point}} {{is the place where}} the {{supervisor}} can best monitor the status of the diver and progress of the dive. For scuba dives this is commonly on deck of the dive boat where there is {{a good view of the}} surface above the operational area, or on the shore at a nearby point where the divers can be seen when surfaced. For surface supplied diving, the view of the water is usually still necessary, and a view of the line tenders handling the umbilicals is also required, unless there is live video feed from the divers and two-way audio communications with the tenders. The control position also includes the gas panel and communications panel, so the supervisor can remain as fully informed as practicable of the status of the divers and their life support systems during the dive. For bell diving and saturation diving the situation is more complex and the control position may well be inside a compartment where the communications, control and <b>monitoring</b> <b>equipment</b> for the bell and life-support systems are set up.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{nitrogen}} emission is {{a problem}} facing the delicate balance within the ecosystems that contain the Bay checkerspot in many areas. At Coyote Ridge the problem is well documented by conservation biologist Stuart Weiss. Faced with a declining population of Bay checkerspots at Coyote Ridge, Weiss searched for a cause. He found a link {{to a combination of}} pollution from the freeway below the ridge and, again, a cutback in cattle grazing locally. Weiss documented how nitrogen oxide emissions from cars enriched the nutrient-poor serpentine soil. This {{is a prime example of}} the nitrogen effect explained above. Aside from helping decrease nitrogen, the cattle also help to control invasive grasses by eating them. Any question about whether nitrogen emissions from cars traversing U.S. Route 101, 110,000 vehicles daily, is significant evaporates when faced with monitoring statistics from Weiss. His <b>monitoring</b> <b>equipment</b> has confirmed that 15 to 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre is deposited on Coyote Ridge annually. Some of the particles stick to the plant and ground and are washed into the soil, and others are directly absorbed by the plants themselves. By contrast, pollution from power plants and vehicles drops only about four to five pounds of nitrogen per acre per year on the Jasper Ridge preserve.|$|E
