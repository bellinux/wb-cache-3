To validate the proposed architecture we adopted a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) approach. HIL is a powerful development tool.

The model is needed to evaluate the realized hardware (ECU and inverter needed to operate the motor) and to validate the force feedback control algorithms before the real implementation of the complete SBW system.

40|$|Recent popularization of {{electric}} vehicles is remarkable. Some {{of the leading}} automobile manufacturers are launching partially or fully electrified vehicles {{to compete for the}} preoccupancy of the market, and many research groups around the world are working on the vehicle electrification and its related issues. Also each of the governments all over the world is planning the county's transportation electrification target, which is expected to be sharply increasing in the near future. One of the major reasons for the recent revisiting of EVs is the increasing concern for the environmental issues. EVs are zero-emission vehicles, which means that they do not emit carbon oxides, nitrogen oxides, and carbon hydrates, which are known to be causing environmental problems. In addition, but more important point is that EVs are said to be more energy efficient than the conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The well-to-wheel efficiency of EVs is fairly comparable to that of ICEVs, however, the price is much cheaper, and the tank-to-wheel efficiency of EVs overwhelms that of ICEVs. However, the merits of the vehicle electrification do not remain only in the environmental or energy perspectives. By using electric motors in the drivetrain, the vehicle motion control can be changed. From the motion control point of view, it is widely known that, compared to conventional vehicles mounting internal combustion engines, electric vehicles have several significant advantages in vehicle dynamic performance {{for the sake of the}} excellence {{of electric}} motors in control. Utilizing the advantages of using electric motor, many motion control strategies for EVs, such as anti-slip traction control, and roll and yaw stability control, are introduced. These control methods turned out to be reasonably effective that EVs can run more safely than the ICEVs in poor road conditions. In addition to these properties, vehicle electrification enables EVs to excel the conventional ICEVs in terms of vehicle motion, by assigning EVs two kinds of inputs [...] the steering and the direct yaw moment [...] while the conventional vehicles have only one input [...] the steering. However, most of these research works are based on the four-wheeled vehicle chassis structure with the conventional <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> <b>system,</b> which has not been changed from the beginning of the massive production of the Ford Model T in 1908. It is originally designed and optimized for an internal combustion engine to transmit all power to the four driving wheels. Consequently it is clear that to use the conventional chassis structure for the independent motor driven EVs is a waste of ability, which is the motivation for this thesis. This thesis is on the study and proposal of a novel structure of EVs for advanced motion control. Despite the underlying importance, however, it seems that there has been no attempt to provide an appropriate and unique structure for the independent motor driven EVs. In this work, followed by the studies on wheel placements and their effects on the vehicle behavior, a novel chassis structure using caster wheels and independent driving motors is proposed. Provided with four wheels the system is designed to be statically stable, and with caster wheels on the front axle the proposed system is able to use the two kinds inputs [...] the steering and the direct yaw moment [...] effectively for two-dimensional motion control. The consequent unique advantages of the system are shown with experimental results. Considering the advantages shown in this work, the proposed system could be an attractive alternative for the future EV's structure for better dynamic performances. This thesis first introduces the background and the motivation of the work in chapter 1, and covers the fundamentals of vehicle dynamics in chapter 2, which underlie the observations and discussions throughout this work. In chapter 3, wheel placements and their effects on the vehicle dynamics are studied. Some criteria to evaluate the system stability and compatibility are introduced and used, and the results of the evaluations are discussed. Based on the study, a novel structure for EVs using caster wheels and independent driving motors is proposed in chapter 4. The system is analyzed with its corresponding mathematical model, and the advantages of the system are shown with the experimental results. Finally, conclusive remarks are made, and future works are shown in chapter 5. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電気系工学専...|$|E
40|$|The Steer-By-Wire (SBW) {{paradigm}} for vehicle control offers many advantages over traditional use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems</b> but {{comes at the}} cost of loss of proprioception (“road feel”). To this end, haptic interfaces for SBW systems have been proposed to restore the intimacy of interactive control back to the driver. However, the degree of realism for the interaction is dependent on the fidelity of the underlying computational vehicle dynamics model. Hence we focus on quantitative comparative testing of the role of vehicle dynamics modeling fidelity for haptic SBW tasks. Additionally the SBW paradigm can simplify implementation of shared/collaborative control (steering) of the underlying mechanical system (vehicle). Possibilities range from sharing of control between multiple individual users or between user and automation technology. Performance evaluation of 3 modes of shared control vs. individual control of driving was carried out and preliminary analysis of results is presented in the paper. 1...|$|R

40|$|Sun, Jian-QiaoThe {{implementation}} of control {{systems in the}} automotive industry enabled by electronic actuators {{is referred to as}} X-by-wire technique. The application of steerby- wire technique in agriculture machine simplifies manufacture, decreases machine costs and increases machine flexibility. Previous study of Applied Controls Laboratory focused on vehicle velocity control through electrical signals, which leads to drive-by-wire agriculture machines without tactile feedback. Current research focuses on the tactile feedback control of steer-by-wire vehicles where the research goal is to improve the steering maneuverability comparable to traditional <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems.</b> A DC motor is regulated according to the movement status of the steering wheel to produce a smooth feedback force to the operator. A prototype windrower provided by Case New Holland LLC is modulated, developed and tested for the research where a conventional <b>steering</b> input <b>system</b> is modified by being mounted with a steering input sensor and a DC geared motor. The <b>steering</b> input <b>system,</b> including the <b>steering</b> wheel, the steering column, the mounted sensor and the DC geared motor is mathematically modeled. The permitted angle of a steering wheel has been made up to 720 degrees in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions whose big movement range brings a nonlinearity property into the steering mechanism. Furthermore, an H-bridge circuit has been designed and added to the control unit to enable the DC geared motor to turn in both directions. To produce the desired feedback force, two cascaded controllers have been designed. The first is a hybrid controller with multiple control branches developed to regulate the DC motor to produce the desired feedback force. Each control branch is a proportional integral (PI) controller. The working ranges of each branch of the controller are decided according to the angle and angular velocity of the steering wheel. The stability of the designed closed loop controller is proved by Routh stability criterion and extensive simulations have been performed to verify the stability of the controller. The second is a current sense controller which is designed by the root locus method to regulate the electrical current of the DC geared motor that varies due to environmental changes. Verified by simulation, an accurate control of the feedback force can be achieved. University of Delaware, Department of Mechanical EngineeringM. S. M. E...|$|R

40|$|The space {{industry}} has predominantly relied on high gain reflector dish antenna apertures for performing communications, but is constantly investing in phase array antenna concepts to provide increased signal flexibility at reduced system costs {{in terms of}} finances and system resources. The problem with traditional phased arrays remains the significantly greater program cost and complexity added to the satellite by integrating arrays of antenna elements with dedicated amplifier and phase shifters to perform adaptive beam forming. Liquid Crystal Reflectarrays (LiCRas) offer some of the electrical beam forming capability of a phased array system with the component and design complexity in lines with a traditional reflector antenna aperture but without {{the risks associated with}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> <b>systems.</b> The final solution is believed to be a hybrid approach that performs in between the boundaries set by the two current disparate approaches. 	Practical reflectarrays have been developed since the 90 ’s as a means to control reflection of incident radiation off a flat structure that is electrically curved based on radiating elements and their reflection characteristics with tailored element phase delay. In the last decade several methods have been proposed to enable tunable reflectarrays where the electrical shape of the reflector can be steered by controlling the resonating properties of the elements on the reflector using a DC bias. These approaches range from complex fast switching MEMS and ferroelectric devices, to more robust but slower chemical changes. 	The aim of this work is to investigate the feasibility of a molecular transition approach in the form of liquid crystals which change permittivity based on the electrical field they are subjected to. In this work, particular attention will be paid to the impact of space environment on liquid crystal reflectarray materials and reflector architectures. Of particular interest are the effects on performance induced by the temperature extremes of space and the electromagnetic particle environment. These two items tend to drive much of the research and development for various space technologies and based on these physical influences, assertions can be made toward the space worthiness of such a material approach and can layout future R&D needs to make certain LC RF devices feasible for space use. Moreover, in this work the performance metrics of such a technology will be addressed along with methods of construction from a space perspective where specific design considerations must be made based on the extreme environment that a typical space asset must endure.

40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of the kinetics of the transesterification reaction is crucial to compare different routes or routes with different catalysts or reaction accelerators. The use of ultrasound is considereda method for accelerating the biodiesel production. However, little effort has been done and is {{reported in the literature}} about how and under what conditions the use of ultrasound really speeds up the process, or the conditions under which its use is unnecessary or even harmful, burdening the process. Two dissimilar energy injections into a typical route were tested: ultrasound (@ 1 MHz and no heating) and <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> (with heating), both applied in an 8 : 1 ratio of soybean oil and methanol, adding 1 % of KOH as catalyzer. As results, during the first 10 minutes of reaction ultrasound showed unbearable effect on the transesterification, whilst <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> and heating achieved almost 70 % of conversion ratio. However, during the following 10 minutes, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> and heating got nothing more than 80 % of conversion, a considerable less efficient process than ultrasound assisted one, which achieved more than 90 %. The straightforward explanation is that ultrasound continually inserts energy in a slower rate, what can result in a more stable conversion scenario. On the other hand, <b>mechanical</b> <b>steering</b> and heating provides more energy at a glance, but cannot push the final conversion rate beyond a limit, as the transesterification is a double-way chemical process.
