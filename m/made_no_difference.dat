5|$|In the 1920s, {{however, the}} son, Clarence, {{repeated}} {{the story and}} published a book in the United States, My Uncle George V, in which he claimed {{he was born in}} London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor's meeting with Mrs. Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon's enlistment papers, marriage certificate, officer's commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to be suffering from delusions, did not jail him but bound him over for three years on the condition that he made no claim that he was Albert Victor's son. Haddon breached the conditions and was jailed for a year. Dismissed as a crank, he died a broken man. Even if Haddon's claim had been true, as with other royal illegitimacies, it would have <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> to the royal line of succession.|$|E
5|$|The letters {{first learned}} by a child, {{commonly}} their own name, {{may come to}} have lasting positive associations. Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their mother tongue alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman. Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, {{there should be no}} name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet. Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic. The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principle cause of the name-letter effect. In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause. They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet {{at the same time as}} the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later. They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.|$|E

25|$|Miners {{had long}} {{believed}} that they were treated poorly. For example, in 1894 a Leadville mine owner instructed the superintendent of the mine to delay a payday for the miners so that a dividend could be paid to stockholders. The WFM had advocated the eight-hour day since its founding convention in 1893. Some miners had the shorter hours, and public employees and building trades workers in Denver had won the eight-hour day as early as 1890. Yet in 1896, hoisting engineers in Leadville were required to work twelve-hour shifts. Mines were more dangerous as they were dug deeper; it was increasingly recognized that poor working conditions as well as longer hours could be correlated with poor health. In 1889 two Leadville workmen were sent to Denver to testify in favor of a mine inspection bill. Although it passed, it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> that year because the legislature failed to fund it.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{comparatively}} investigate the effects of 5 -azacytidine-C (5 -Aza), trichostatin-A (TSA), and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on mRNA expressions of Na/I symporter (NIS), thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R), and radioiodine (RAI) uptake in cancer (B-CPAP) and normal (Nthy-ori 3 - 1) thyroid cell lines. Cell lines were treated with 10 ng/mL of TSA, 5 μM of 5 -Aza, and 1 μM of ATRA, according to the MTT (methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium) test results. Additionally, recombinant thyroid stimulating hormone (rTSH) was also applied, with a selected dose of 100 ng/mL. Following the treatment, NIS, Tg, TPO, and TSH-R mRNA levels were detected by real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RAI uptakes were measured by using a well counter as the counts/cell number. 5 -Aza increased TSH-R mRNA expression in both of the cell lines and decreased TPO, NIS, and Tg mRNA levels in the cancer cell line. In the normal thyroid cell line, 5 -Aza increased TPO mRNA levels 2 -fold and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> in NIS and Tg mRNA levels. TSA treatment repressed NIS and Tg mRNA levels, and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>differences</b> on other thyroid specific genes investigated in the cancer cell line. In the normal thyroid cell line, TSA increased TSH-R mRNA levels in 72 hours and created <b>no</b> important <b>differences</b> in other genes. ATRA repressed the TSH-R mRNA levels in the normal thyroid cell line and increased the TPO and Tg mRNA levels slightly in both cell lines. Furthermore, in short-term treatment, ATRA repressed NIS gene expression slightly, but in the long term, this repression turned to basal levels. 5 -Aza, TSA, and ATRA did not make any differences in RAI uptake in the cancer cell line, but rTSH increased RAI uptake significantly. In the normal thyroid cell line, TSA and ATRA decreased RAI uptake (to 1 / 10 and 1 / 2, respectively), but 5 -Aza and rTSH increased RAI uptake significantly (2 - and 4 -fold, respectively). We have shown an increase in TSH-R gene expression and radioiodine uptake with 5 -Aza. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to support our findings and the potential clinical use of this agent. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc...|$|R
