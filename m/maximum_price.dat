At the same time, the <b>maximum</b> <b>price</b> increased to NOK870, though all ticket prices were changed {{to include all}} taxes, after requirements from the authorities. A new, cheapest ticket was introduced at NOK345, including taxes.

Maryland Steel financed the construction with a credit plan which called for a 5% down payment in cash followed by nine monthly installments for the balance.

25|$|One of {{the primary}} {{concerns}} was the price of coffee, Colombia's largest export and {{the main source of}} its foreign exchange. The American Office of Price Administration (OPA) attempted to have the <b>maximum</b> <b>price</b> of coffee frozen at the level existing on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, Colombia objected on the basis that the cost of producing and transporting coffee had increased due to wartime conditions, and, if the price was not adjusted to factor in these conditions, the economy would decline. The OPA relented, and agreed to raise prices immediately and to adjust them in the future based on increased production and transportation costs.|$|E

Weir (president of National Steel Corporation), and Charles M. White (president of Republic Steel). The three met with Putnam on December 13, who attempted to determine what the employers' bargaining position was. Although Putnam ruled out price relief based on a rise in wages, {{for the first time}} he and OPS director DiSalle indicated that the government would permit the steel manufacturers to seek the <b>maximum</b> <b>price</b> increase allowed by the Capehart Amendment. Cyrus Ching, now head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, sent two of his top aides to meet with union officials to determine the union's bargaining strategy and timeline. The aides met with Murray and the union's collective bargaining committee on December 14, but made no headway. WSB director Feinsinger, however, began paving the way for a relaxation of Wage Regulation 6. On December 8, Feinsinger told the press that the Board was already working on a revision to the regulation which would permit merit pay increases. Five days later, Feinsinger let it be known that a number of economic issues (such as increased pension contributions) might be removed from the calculation of the basic wage rate in order to relieve the pressure on the negotiating parties.|$|E

25|$|Most {{buffer stock}} schemes work {{along the same}} rough lines: first, two prices are determined, a floor and a ceiling (minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>price).</b> When the price drops close to the floor price (after a new rich vein of silver is found, for example), the scheme {{operator}} (usually government) will start buying up the stock, ensuring that the price does not fall further. Likewise, when the price rises close to the ceiling, the operator depresses the price by selling off its holding. In the meantime, it must either store the commodity or otherwise {{keep it out of}} the market (for example, by destroying it). If a basket of commodities is stored, their price stabilization can in turn stabilize the overall price level, preventing inflation. This scenario is illustrated on the right. Taking the market for wheat as an example, here, in years with normal harvests (S1) the price is within the allowed range and the operator does not need to act. In bumper years (S3), however, the prices begins to fall, and the government must buy wheat to prevent the price from collapsing; likewise, in years with bad harvests (S2), the government must sell its stock to keep prices down. The result is far less fluctuation in price. Price stability then leads to greater joint welfare (the sum of consumer and producer surplus.|$|E
