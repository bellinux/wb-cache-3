40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} of parents' compliance with follow-up measurements after their child tested positive at a screening to assess problems in social development, {{as well as to}} find demographic, screening-related, and child-specific factors associated with parental compliance. DESIGN: Two-stage screening design. SETTING: Utrecht, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A random population of 31, 724 children were screened at well-baby clinics at age 14 to 15 months (<b>screen</b> <b>1).</b> Three hundred sixty-four children underwent screen 2 (255 children who scored positive at <b>screen</b> <b>1</b> [population screening] and 109 children younger than 36 months who were identified by surveillance because of suspected problems in their social development). Main Exposure A 2 -stage screening was applied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Compliance with recommendations of having either a second <b>screening</b> (after <b>screen</b> <b>1)</b> or clinical evaluation (after screen 2). RESULTS: Of 370 children who tested positive at <b>screen</b> <b>1,</b> parents of 255 children (69 %) complied with screen 2. Three groups were distinguished after screen 2 (n = 173) : early compliance (clinical evaluation within 6 months) (68 %), late compliance (clinical evaluation after 6 months) (14 %), and noncompliance (no clinical evaluation) (18 %). Late compliance and noncompliance were more common in parents of younger children and children who were identified via population screening. Parents of children with either relatively high cognitive skills and/or low scores on <b>screening</b> <b>measures</b> were less inclined to comply. CONCLUSIONS: Study results suggest higher effectiveness of surveillance over population screening. Screening may well be applied as a second step after surveillance to identify children who need further clinical evaluation...|$|R
