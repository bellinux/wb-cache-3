This paper argues that the government might offer DC plan members a <b>minimum</b> <b>return</b> <b>guarantee,</b> funded by risk based premia.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} role of strategic behavior in financial markets and highlights the effects of such behavior on portfolio choice, trading behavior and asset prices. In Chapter 1 I study portfolio choice of strategic fund managers {{in the presence of}} a peer-based underperformance penalty. While the penalty generates herding behavior, correlated trading among managers is exacerbated when a strategic setting is considered. The equilibrium portfolios are driven by the least restricted manager, who may vary according to the realization of returns. I compare model predictions to evidence from the Colombian pension fund management industry, where six asset managers are in charge of portfolio allocation for the mandatory contributions of the working population. These managers are subject to a peer based underperformance penalty, known as the <b>Minimum</b> <b>Return</b> <b>Guarantee</b> (MRG). I study trading behavior by managers before and after a change in the strictness of the MRG in June 2007. The evidence suggests that a tighter MRG results in more trading in the direction of peers, a behavior that is more pronounced for underperforming managers. I show that these findings are consistent with the qualitative and quantitative predictions of the theoretical model. In Chapter 2 I explore the limits to the allocational role of stock prices in a strategic setting. Stock prices are thought to help firms' managers make more efficient real investment decisions, because they aggregate information about fundamentals that is not otherwise known to managers. In this chapter I identify a limitation to this view. I show that if informed traders internalize that firms use prices as signal, stock price informativeness depends on the quality of managers' prior information. In particular, managers with low quality information would like to learn about their own fundamental by relying on the information aggregated in the stock price. However, in this case, the profitability of trading falls for informed speculators, who therefore reduce their trading volume, reducing the informativeness of prices. As a result, stock prices are not as useful to guide capital towards the most productive use, leading to inefficient investment decisions. Using a sample of U. S. publicly traded companies between 1990 - 2010, I document a positive correlation between the quality of managerial information and stock price informativeness. Contrary to the conventional view that less informed managers should rely more on stock prices when making investment decisions, I find no differences in the sensitivity of investment to stock price for different levels of managerial information. The evidence suggests that while firms do learn from prices, the learning channel and its effects on real investment are limited...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the free}} {{movement}} of persons (or more precisely of employees and their families) {{is considered to be}} one of the major pillars of the EU's internal market, there still isn't real pension portability. This has to do with the characteristics of a quilt (or patchwork) the different member-states of the EU form in the area of pension schemes. Considering the differences with regard to - the rules of affiliation : obligatory, voluntary, mixed, sectoral, [...] .; - the level of organization: national, industry-wide, enterprise or individual; - the actors such as pension funds, insurers, banks or mutual funds, [...] .; - the booking rules and their evolution towards the IAAS norms; - the level of coverage: going from nearly 100 % of the population to nearly 0 % of the population; - the diversity in fiscal treatment of occupational pensions in the different stages (going from EEE (exemption, exemption, exemption) to TTT (taxation, taxation taxation), regardless the Commission's idea of the EET model; - the prudential control: going from the prudent man principle to the strict state supervision; - the level of participation of the employees: managing, voting right, supervising, [...] . - the risk bearing with regard to the shift from Defined Benefit to Defined Contribution, the idea of a legally binding <b>minimum</b> <b>return</b> <b>guarantee</b> in DC plans, the longevity risk, the obsolete mortality tables in quite a lot European countries, [...] .; - the cost structure: from strictly regulated to no rules; - the financing techniques: repartition, capitalization, closed or open capitalization, mixed systems, [...] .; - the role of the government: organizing, controlling, managing, regulating, [...] .; - [...] . Bearing all these differences in mind and knowing that the social aspects of pensions are still a national prerogative, it is clear that coordination of occupational pensions towards a unified pension portability platform is a burdensome task. Not only the limited scope of the 1998 directive is already a clear indication, but also the different national strategy reports laid in September 2002 point in that direction. Furthermore the Commission's first evaluation of national strategies for adequate and sustainable pensions of the 17 th of December 2002 gives little to none options for fast solutions. We have to look elsewhere. Currently there are two major paths: 1. What can we expect from the European Court of Justice after the Danner case, knowing that the PEPGO test case is going full steam ahead ? 2. What can we expect from the so called "Bolkenstein directive" ? I believe both options are rather slim. Fiscally, the theory on the national coherency still stands and prudentially, some countries have smartly seen their way out of the directive. So the question we have to ask is the following: can the method of open coordination form a solution towards the pension portability problem ? Legally, I consider open coordination not to be an option when it comes to solving the portability question. Politically however, it might be a first step towards the right direction. However I strongly believe the anglo-saxon occupational pension model is taking the overhand in continental European. This makes me believe that we have to start broadening the social competences of the EU within the EU. Apart from looking at the fiscal, financial, prudential and competition elements in the debate on portability the social aspects should be taken into consideration. These aspects are not a mere consequence or subsidiary of the other elements. Things are often presented otherwise. We should recognize that the portability of occupational pensions form an element in the social pension problem of the net replacement income ratio for the future elder in Europe. By recognizing that occupational pensions have an imminent social goal: bringing insured welfare to ALL pensioners in Europe, we can move ahead. Improving the private market for pension providers or installing a fiscal uniformity within the EU should therefore not be a goal on its own, but a derivative of social policy.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to define an actuarial model to measure the Economic Capital of a life insurance company; the model is developed under Solvency II context, based on option pricing theory. In order to asses a life insurance company Economic Capital it is necessary to involve coherent risk measures already used in the assessment of banking Solvency Capital Requirements, according to Basel II standards. The complexity of embedded options in life insurance contracts requires to find out operational solutions consistent with Fair Value principle, as defined in the International Accounting Standards (IAS).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} tackles {{the current}} life insurance industry challenge to price and hedge <b>minimum</b> rate of <b>return</b> <b>guarantees</b> (MRRG) embedded in recurring-contribution life insurance contracts {{in a practical}} manner. The key contribution to the literature is to outline a practical approach to quantify and project the impact of dynamic hedging strategies for such options. MRRGs are typically very long-dated {{and as a result}} the validity of using typical financial economics options pricing models under incomplete market conditions remains a debate. However, life insurers need robust, practical solutions to assist them to manage market risk exposures for day-to-day solvency and income statement management. Literature specific to the topic of MRRG pricing and hedging over recurring-contribution life insurance products is sparse but Schrager and Pelssers’ significant contribution (Schrager and Pelsser 2004) provided a basis on which this dissertation was built. Schrager and Pelsser show these options to be analogous to Asian options written over a stochastically-weighted average of the underlying unit fund price. This dissertation demonstrates the effects of stochastic interest rates on MRRGs increase with maturity, as shown by Schrager and Pelsser. Consequentially, users {{should be aware of the}} effect and limitations of their choice of interest rate model when pricing MRRGs. Sensitivities for the various maturity terms of MRRG benefits are shown and provide readers with insight into the factors driving the dynamics of such options. A simple dynamic hedging program is outlined and projected under real-world evolutions on a daily basis, thus allowing the effectiveness of the hedging program to be tested.

(2) Cost cutting policy (fixed and distribution costs). (3) Different floor options (minimum guaranteed from 4 to 0 percent). The ROE sensitivity is estimated through a Monte Carlo simulation, where we assume that the portfolio is invested in three total return market indices. The typical portfolio in the simulations is structured as follows: 5 -year treasury bonds, 5 -year corporate bonds, equity; and we neglect foreign exchange risk. A 10 -year single premium policy, with a reimbursement only at maturity is considered.

40|$|Present low {{interest}} rates environment brings about numerous economic effects. Insurance companies are also strongly affected, since traditional insurance products often provide <b>guaranteed</b> <b>returns</b> to policyholders. As <b>guaranteed</b> <b>returns</b> are related to market interest rates, {{the question about the}} optimality of currently applied <b>guaranteed</b> <b>returns</b> becomes increasingly compelling in the insurance sector. This paper examines optimality of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>returns</b> from a solvency aspect. With the applied theoretical approach it is possible to identify multiple optima, from which the "best" is defined as the efficient one. In this framework, some theoretical properties of optimal <b>guaranteed</b> <b>returns</b> are described and existence criteria for the efficient optimum are derived. The paper aims at contributing to the literature also by highlighting a price sensitivity related effect of the choice of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>returns</b> in the insurance sector...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between the level of a <b>return</b> <b>guarantee</b> in an equity–linked pension scheme and the proportion of an investor’s contribution needed to finance this guarantee. Three types of schemes are considered: investment guarantee, contribution guarantee and participation surplus. The evaluation of each scheme involves pricing an Asian option, for which relatively tight upper and lower bounds can be calculated in a numerically efficient manner. We find a negative (and for two contract specifications also concave) relationship between the participation in the surplus return of the investment strategy and the guarantee level in terms of a <b>minimum</b> rate of <b>return.</b> Furthermore, the introduction of a possibility of early termination of the contract (e. g. due to the death of the investor) has no qualitative and very little quantitative impact on this relationship...|$|R

This paper addresses the performance comparisons of three different patch antennas. The first is a conventional rectangular patch over Rogers RT Duroid 5880 substrate operating at 7. 5 GHz, In the second stage the patch antenna possesses a step at the corners and as a result the designed antenna operates at 7. 8 GHz with <b>minimum</b> <b>return</b> loss and with increased band width of 63. 61 %. The third structure that is being proposed maintain more steps at the corners and operates at 7. 5 GHz with <b>minimum</b> <b>return</b> loss and bandwidth increase of 74. 98 % is achieved.

40|$|A {{new state}} space {{approach}} is proposed {{to model the}} time- dependence in an extreme value process. The generalized extreme value distribution is extended to incorporate the time-dependence using a state space representation where the state variables either follow an autoregressive (AR) process or a moving average (MA) process with innovations arising from a Gumbel distribution. Using a Bayesian approach, an efficient algorithm is proposed to implement Markov chain Monte Carlo method where we exploit a very accurate approximation of the Gumbel distribution by a ten-component mixture of normal distributions. The methodology is illustrated using extreme returns of daily stock data. The model is fitted to a monthly series of <b>minimum</b> <b>returns</b> and the empirical results support strong evidence for time-dependence among the observed <b>minimum</b> <b>returns.</b> Extreme values, Generalized extreme value distribution, Markov chain Monte Carlo, Mixture sampler, State space model, Stock returns...|$|R
