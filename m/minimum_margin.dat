5000|$|Many {{boosting}} algorithms rely on {{the notion}} of a margin to give weights to examples. If a convex loss is utilized (as in AdaBoost, LogitBoost, and all members of the AnyBoost family of algorithms) then an example with higher margin will receive less (or equal) weight than an example with lower margin. This leads the boosting algorithm to focus weight on low margin examples. In nonconvex algorithms (e.g. BrownBoost), the margin still dictates the weighting of an example, though the weighting is non-monotone with respect to margin. There exists boosting algorithms that provably maximize the <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> (e.g. see [...] ).|$|E
50|$|Margin buying {{refers to}} the buying of {{securities}} with cash borrowed from a broker, using the bought securities as collateral. This {{has the effect of}} magnifying any profit or loss made on the securities. The securities serve as collateral for the loan. The net value—the difference between the value of the securities and the loan—is initially equal to the amount of one's own cash used. This difference has to stay above a <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> requirement, the purpose of which is to protect the broker against a fall {{in the value of the}} securities to the point that the investor can no longer cover the loan.|$|E
50|$|Once the offsets are applied, the net P&L for the Portfolio can be {{determined}} under each market move scenario. For example, 90% of the profit on a Russell 3000 index ETF long position {{can be used to}} offset the loss on a S&P 500 index ETF short position. This corresponds with the 90% offset allowed for securities in the Broad Based Indexes product group. There are over 28 product groups in total, each with its own offset percentage. Note that (non-index) single stock positions do not obtain any P&L offsets and therefore a portfolio of these positions has a <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> requirement of 15%.|$|E

50|$|The Hunt {{brothers}} had {{invested heavily in}} futures contracts through several brokers, including the brokerage firm Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, later Prudential-Bache Securities and Prudential Securities. When the price of silver dropped below their <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> requirement, they were issued a margin call for $100 million. The Hunts were unable to meet the margin call, and, with the brothers facing a potential $1.7 billion loss, the ensuing panic was felt {{in the financial markets}} in general, as well as commodities and futures. Many government officials feared that if the Hunts were unable to meet their debts, some large Wall Street brokerage firms and banks might collapse.|$|E
50|$|Short selling {{refers to}} the selling of {{securities}} which the trader does not own and borrowed from a broker, using the cash as collateral. This {{has the effect of}} reversing any profit or loss made on the securities. The initial cash deposited by the trader, together with the amount obtained from the sale, serve as collateral for the loan. The net value—the difference between the cash amount and the value of loan security — is initially equal to the amount of one's own cash used. This difference has to stay above a <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> requirement, the purpose of which is to protect the broker against a raise {{in the value of the}} borrowed securities to the point that the investor can no longer cover the loan.|$|E
5000|$|The {{state of}} Victoria in Australia allows {{for only a}} 3 km/h {{tolerance}} for mobile speed cameras and 2 km/h for fixed cameras {{on the basis that}} although the increased risk is lower there are very many more drivers involved which creates a substantial risk across the road network. An alternative view is that police devices are accurate to 1 km/h, and that a 2-3 km/h tolerance is the <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> that police require to defeat any challenge in court regarding the accuracy of their speed measurement equipment. [...] Speed tolerance in New South Wales was an election issue in 2011, following a move by the budget committee of the previous Labor state government to abolish the 3 km/h margin in order to increase revenue.|$|E
40|$|Some factors {{relating}} to inadvertent speed and Mach number increases in transport operation are discussed with {{the object of}} indicating {{the manner in which}} they might vary with different qualities of the airplane and the <b>minimum</b> <b>margins</b> required to guard against reaching unsafe values. The speed increments and the margins required under several assumed conditions are investigated. The results indicate that, on a percentage basis, smaller margins should be required of high-speed airplanes than of low-speed airplanes to prevent overspeeding in inadvertent maneuvers. The possibility of exceeding placard speed in prolonged descents is illustrated by computations for typical transport airplanes. Equations are suggested that allow estimates to be made of the necessary speed margins...|$|R

40|$|For the TerraSAR-X mission a new staring {{spotlight}} mode {{has been}} implemented delivering very high azimuth resolution. Detailed performance analyses {{have been conducted}} in order to optimize the commanding parameters for this mode. Compared to the previously available TerraSAR-X imaging modes, staring spotlight requires operating the instrument with <b>minimum</b> <b>margins</b> and {{at the edge of}} the specifications the radar has been designed for. Therefore an additional step – a global acquisition simulation and analysis – is introduced during the operationalization to ensure the suitability of the derived commanding parameters on a global scale. The paper gives an overview about SAR performance analyses conducted for the mode optimization and implementation phases and presents a novel global performance assessment approach, which is in general applicable for the verification of operational SAR modes. Additionally, measurement results and exemplary acquisitions are shown...|$|R
50|$|The {{club was}} founded in 1946 {{following}} a 'challenge' match between Hedgestown and the Man Of War. Both sides had difficulty fielding a full team, {{so they decided to}} amalgamate. Johnny Jones was a founder member of the club. In 1954 the club won its first trophy - the Nugent Cup for the Fingal Junior League. Eleven years later, the club won its next trophy - the Jubilee Cup - when it defeated Starlights in Ballyboughal. This win sparked a renewed enthusiasm and juvenile teams were formed. These juveniles were eventually to form the nucleus of the team which won many competitions in the Fingal League and achieved the club's crowning glory in 1979, the Dublin Junior Football Championship. After years of heartache and disappointment in the later stages of the Championship, Man O' War won their only Dublin Championship when defeating Fingallians by the <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> in Rush, having trailed for most of the match.|$|E
40|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid to the theoretical explanation of the empirical success of AdaBoost. The most influential work is the margin theory, which is essentially an upper bound for the generalization error of any voting classifier in terms of the margin distribution over the training data. However, Breiman raised important questions about the margin explanation by developing a boosting algorithm arc-gv that provably generates a larger <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> than AdaBoost. He also gave a sharper bound in terms of the <b>minimum</b> <b>margin,</b> and argued that the <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> governs the generalization. In experiments however, arc-gv usually performs worse than AdaBoost, putting the margin explanation into serious doubts. In this paper, we try to give a complete answer to Breiman’s critique by proving a bound in terms of a new margin measure called Equilibrium margin (Emargin). The Emargin bound is uniformly sharper than Breiman’s <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> bound. This result suggests that the <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> is not crucial for the generalization error. We also show that a large Emargin implies good generalization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaBoost usually has a larger Emargin and a smaller test error than arc-gv, which agrees well with our theory. ...|$|E
40|$|Margin theory {{provides}} one of {{the most}} popular explanations to the success of AdaBoost, where the central point lies in the recognition that margin is the key for characterizing the performance of AdaBoost. This theory has been very influential, e. g., it has been used to argue that AdaBoost usually does not overfit since it tends to enlarge the margin even after the training error reaches zero. Previously the <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> bound was established for AdaBoost, however, Breiman (1999) pointed out that maximizing the <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> does not necessarily lead to a better generalization. Later, Reyzin and Schapire (2006) emphasized that the margin distribution rather than <b>minimum</b> <b>margin</b> is crucial to the performance of AdaBoost. In this paper, we first present th...|$|E
