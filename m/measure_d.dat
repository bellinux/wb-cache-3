40|$|This paper details an {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} clamping effect associated with thick-film piezoelectric elements printed on a substrate. The clamping effect reduces the <b>measured</b> piezoelectric coefficient, <b>d</b> 33, of the film. This reduction {{is due to the}} influence of the d 31 component in the film when a deformation of the structure occurs, by either the direct or indirect piezoelectric effect. Theoretical analysis shows a reduction in the <b>measured</b> <b>d</b> 33 of 62 %, i. e. a standard bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT) - 5 H sample with a manufacturer specified d 33 of 593 pC/N would fall to 227. 8 pC/N. To confirm this effect, the d 33 coefficients of five thin bulk PZT- 5 H samples of 220 µm thickness were measured before and after their attachment to a metallized 96 % alumina substrate. The experimental results show a reduction in d 33 of 74 % from 529 pC/N to 139 pC/N. The theoretical analysis was then applied to existing University of Southampton thick-film devices. It is estimated that the <b>measured</b> <b>d</b> 33 value of 131 pC/N of the thick-film devices is the equivalent of an unconstrained d 33 of 345 pC/N...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} model which describes oxygen isotope exchange during burial and recrystallization of deep-sea carbonate {{is used to}} obtain information on how sea surface temperatures have varied in the past by correcting <b>measured</b> <b>d</b> 18 O values of bulk carbonate for diagenetic overprinting. Comparison of bulk carbonate and planktonic foraminiferal d 18 O records from ODP site 677 A indicates that the oxygen isotopic composition of bulk carbonate does reflect changes in sea surface temperature and d 18 O. At ODP Site 690, we calculate that diagenetic effects are small, and that both bulk carbonate and planktonic foraminiferal d 18 O records accurately reflect Paleogene warming of high latitude surface oceans, biased from diagenesis {{by no more than}} 1 °C. The same is likely to be true for other high latitude sites where sedimentation rates are low. At DSDP sites 516 and 525, the effects of diagenesis are more significant. <b>Measured</b> <b>d</b> 18 O values of Eocene bulk carbonates are more than 2 ? lower at deeply buried site 516 than at site 525, consistent with the model prediction that the effects of diagenesis should be proportional to sedimentation rate. Model-corrections reconcile the differences in the data between the two sites; the resulting paleotemperature reconstruction indicates a 4 °C cooling of mid-latitude surface oceans since the Eocene. At low latitudes, the contrast in temperature between the ocean surface and bottom makes the carbonate d 180 values particularly sensitive to diagenetic effects; most of the observed variations in <b>measured</b> <b>d</b> 18 O values are accounted for by diagenetic effects rather than by sea surface temperature variations. We show that the data are consistent with constant equatorial sea surface temperatures through most of the Cenozoic, {{with the possible exception of}} the early Eocene, when slightly higher temperatures are indicated. We suggest that the lower equatorial sea surface temperatures for the Eocene and Oligocene reported in other oxygen isotope studies are artifacts of diagenetic recrystallization, and that it is impossible to reconstruct accurately equatorial sea surface temperatures without explicitly accounting for diagenetic overprinting...|$|R

40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} measurements of piezoelectric coefficients on thin films {{are required to}} perform thin film process development and compare different manufacturing techniques and quality especially in MEMS applications. State of the art measurements are performed by double-beam laser interferometry since many years, however the variety of parameter ranges and test conditions {{make it difficult to}} compare measurement results. Films on a substrate exhibit effective piezoelectric coefficients due to substrate clamping and the coefficient also depends on feature size and substrate thickness. This was shown by FEM simulations for the case of d 33 J measurements by DBLI [1] and latest simulation and measurement results show that a considerable reduction of the <b>measured</b> <b>d</b> 33 J was obtained for small electrodes and an increase for large electrodes. The <b>measured</b> <b>d</b> 33 J value at large electrodes is even larger than the true d 33 J of the film and for small feature sizes it is lower. A feature size chosen equivalent to the substrate thickness exhibits the most exact number for the effective coefficient d 33 J [2]. Furthermore nonlinearity and hysteresis of ferroelectric films requires the definition of measurement parameters to obtain comparable procedures regarding hysteresis, poling conditions, and other property nonlinearities, voltage and frequency dependency of coefficients, and large and small signal responses. For easier comparison of films a large signal coefficient (d 33,ls) is introduced as the average slope of a displacement vs. voltage measurement over the full operating voltage range. For thin film measurements it reflects the potential displacement in typical actuator applications in comparison to small-signal coefficients and allows better comparison of materials for actuation...|$|R
