5|$|Female taiko {{performance}} has {{also served as}} a response to gendered stereotypes of Japanese women as being quiet, subservient, or a femme fatale.

5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{associated with}} the Churches of Christ embrace the methods of modern Biblical criticism but not the associated anti-supernaturalistic views. <b>More</b> <b>generally,</b> the classical grammatico-historical method is prevalent, which provides a basis for some openness to alternative approaches to understanding the scriptures.|$|E
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>generally,</b> Neferhotep's time on {{the throne}} was likely prosperous as there are many private monuments datable to his reign {{and that of his}} brother, and {{especially}} in sculpture some remarkably high quality art works were produced.|$|E
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>generally,</b> it {{has been}} proven that every {{complete}} bipartite graph requires a number of crossings that is (for sufficiently large graphs) at least 83% of the number given by the Zarankiewicz bound.

50|$|Craniofrontonasal {{dysplasia}} (craniofrontonasal syndrome, craniofrontonasal dysostosis, CFND) is a {{very rare}} X-linked malformation syndrome caused by mutations in the ephrin-B1 gene (EFNB1).

On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts are made to kill them. The widespread use of insecticides has failed to exterminate any insect pest, but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to refine patterns of body movement by practicing, or <b>more</b> <b>generally</b> by repetition. A number of brain areas are involved, including the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and especially the cerebellum, which functions as a large memory bank for microadjustments of the parameters of movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of a convexset implies that the intersection of two convexsets is a convex set. <b>More</b> <b>generally,</b> the intersection {{of a family of}} convex sets is a convex set. In particular, the intersection of two disjoint sets is the empty set, which is convex.|$|E

5|$|The same {{statements}} hold <b>more</b> <b>generally</b> for {{constraint satisfaction}} problems (or for relational structures, in other words). The only assumption needed is that constraints can involve only a bounded {{number of variables}} (all relations are of some bounded arity, 2 {{in the case of}} graphs). The relevant parameter is then the treewidth of the primal constraint graph.|$|E
5|$|A Trip to the Moon {{was named}} one of the 100 {{greatest}} films of the 20th century by The Village Voice, ranked 84th. The film remains the best-known of the hundreds of films made by Méliès, and the moment in which the capsule lands in the Moon's eye {{remains one of the most}} iconic and frequently referenced images in the history of cinema. It is widely regarded as the earliest example of the science fiction film genre and, <b>more</b> <b>generally,</b> as one of the most influential films in cinema history.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs refrained from egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. <b>More</b> <b>generally,</b> however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal. It is still unknown as to how the decision to restrain reproduction occurs or what minimum threshold of fertility in the queen is needed to reduce worker reproduction.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{liberalization}} of sexuality in American film had increased during the 1920s, the pre-Code era is either dated {{to the start of}} the sound film era, or <b>more</b> <b>generally</b> to March 1930, when the Hays Code was first written. Over the protests of NAMPI, New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision in Mutual Film vs. Ohio by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the next year, and eight individual states had a board by the advent of sound film.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated <b>more</b> <b>generally</b> into abstract musical contexts.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt to}} revive the RDF 1.5 concept, today known <b>more</b> <b>generally</b> as {{bistatic}} radar, was made in March 1940 when a modified set was mounted in Bristol Blenheim L6622. This set was tuned to the transmissions of the new Chain Home Low transmitters, dozens of which were being set up along the UK coastline. These experiments did not prove successful, with a detection range {{on the order of}} , and the concept was abandoned for good.|$|E
50|$|Males fly <b>more</b> and are <b>generally</b> <b>more</b> active by {{spending}} {{most of their time}} locating mates. Pyronia tithonus is a protandrous species, meaning the males emerge before the females. As a result, females usually only mate once, so they have more time available for resting, nectar feeding, host plant selection and oviposition.|$|R
