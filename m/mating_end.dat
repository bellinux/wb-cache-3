40|$|The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) {{system was}} used as a basis for {{describing}} a methodology for the management of reproduction in small ruminant flocks. The seven principles of the HACCP system are: 1. Conduct a hazard analysis 2. Identify critical control points 3. Establish critical limits for each control point 4. Establish monitoring procedure 5. Establish corrective actions 6. Establish a record keeping procedure 7. Establish verification procedures. The first principle of HACCP requires a description of the production system. The small ruminant reproduction process was subdivided into four sub-processes with a total of 33 phases. The ewe management cycle consists of 12 phases and the ram management cycle, replacement ewe cycle and replacement ram cycle each consists of seven phases. The reproductive process was described by a flow diagram. The hazards were categorized as management, environmental, nutritional, genetic, predatory, physiological and disease factors that could affect reproductive performance. The second principle requires the establishment of Critical Control Points (CCP). Seventeen CCPs in the reproductive process were established and monitoring and diagnostic procedures for each of the critical control points was described together with suggested corrective actions. The resulting HACCP plan formed the basis of consultations with 30 commercial small stock enterprises. Each of the Critical Control Points was applied to at least three and up to 30 of the flocks over the period of the trial to establish the practicality and validity of the procedures which were described as standard operating procedures. Data forms were designed for the structured collection of data regarding the process as well as the CCPs. The Critical Control Points and forms that were selected in this project were as follows: CC 1. Ewe selection. Prior to Ewe preparation. Ewe selection data form CC 2. Ram selection. Prior to Phase two of ram preparation. Ram selection data form CC 3. Ewe preparation. Prior to start of <b>mating</b> (<b>end</b> of flushing period). Ewe preparation data form CC 4. Ram preparation. Prior start of <b>mating</b> (<b>end</b> of flushing period). Ram preparation data form CC 5. Joining. Start of mating period. Joining data form CC 6. <b>Mating.</b> <b>End</b> of mating period. Mating data form CC 7. Scan. > 35 days after mating. Scan data form CC 8. Rescan. ≥ 30 days after initial scanning. Rescan data form CC 9. Pregnant. Prior to start of lambing. Pregnancy management data form CC 10. Lambing. End of lambing period. Lambing data form CC 11. Marking. After neonatal period. Marking data form CC 12. Weaning. Separation of lambs from ewes. Weaning data form CC 13. Ewe replacement. At ewe selection. Replacement maiden data form CC 14. Ram replacement. At ram selection. Replacement ram data form CC 15. Genital soundness. Prior to ram selection. Ram genital soundness data form CC 16. Ram recovery. About 8 weeks after mating. Ram recovery data form CC 17. Last day of lambing. About 146 days after end of joining. Last day of lambing data form. In addition to the specific procedures described in the seventeen CCP's three CCP's were described that can be performed to assist in monitoring the general health and welfare of the flock at strategic points in the management cycle: CC 18 Body condition score CC 19 Helminthic status CC 20 Nutritional status. Qualitative aspects of the critical control point as well as certain quality control questions were described as a generic quality control form. This generic form is modified annually to reflect hazard issues that need to be followed up the following year. Specific questions are entered on the form which is diarised for the next year. The use of these generic forms assisted in the process of continuous improvement by ensuring that adjustments to the Flock Health and Production Plan are made to prevent repeating management failures. Examples of the use of the CCP's are described on the basis of data that was collected from the flocks that participated in the project. Upon conclusion a questionnaire was completed by 12 / 25 of the flock managers who participated. The results of the survey indicated that there was general acceptance of a HACCP – based management system for the management of reproduction in the small ruminant enterprises by the flock managers that responded to the questionnaire. Flock managers agreed that the program must be adapted to their individual needs, would not be a problem to implement but needed to be simple and many would need assistance. Training and information was considered important aspects. There was general consensus that financial results should form part of the program and that comparisons within the group on an anonymous basis is accepted. The two responses that showed the least variance were the needs to reduce production risk and to be informed of potential hazards. Flock managers disagreed the most in their response about the range of control points they would implement. This correlates with the expressed need to have individually adapted programs. Flock managers were not very positive about the benefits of a quality control and certification system. Predation proved {{to be the most important}} hazard followed by parasites and stock theft, all three being highly variable as indicated by a large variance. The HACCP-based methodology should be applied in and extended form to all aspects of the flock production system to assist in improving sustainability.

50|$|BNC {{connectors}} {{are most}} commonly made in 50 and 75 ohm versions, matched {{for use with}} cables of the same characteristic impedance. The 75 ohm types can sometimes be recognized by the reduced or absent dielectric in the <b>mating</b> <b>ends</b> but this {{is by no means}} reliable. There was a proposal in the early 1970s for the dielectric material to be coloured red in 75 ohm connectors, and while this is occasionally implemented, it did not become standard. The 75 ohm connector is dimensionally slightly different from the 50 ohm variant, but the two nevertheless can be made to mate. The 50 ohm connectors are typically specified for use at frequencies up to 4 GHz and the 75 ohm version up to 2 GHz. A 95 ohm variant is used within the aerospace sector, but rarely elsewhere. It is used with the 95 ohm video connections for glass cockpit displays on some aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Mates {{appear to}} assort on {{political}} attitudes {{more than any}} other social, behavioral, or physical trait, besides religion. Yet the process by which ideologically similar <b>mates</b> <b>end</b> up together remains ambiguous. Mates do not appear to consciously select one another based on ideology, nor does similarity result from convergence. Recently, several lines of inquiry have converged on the finding that olfactory processes have an important role in both political ideology and mate selection. Here we integrate extant studies of attraction, ideology, and olfaction and explore the possibility that assortation on political attitudes may result, in part, from greater attraction to the scent of those with shared ideology. We conduct a study in which individuals evaluated the body odor of unknown others, observing that individuals are more attracted to their ideological concomitants. Similarity between spouses is common across do-mains, but in humans, long-term mates correlatemore highly (between 0. 60 and 0. 75) on social and political attitudes than almost any other trait, with the ex...|$|R
