This paper investigates global states shared by all such observations. A necessary and sufficient condition characterizing these states is first given. Then, an algorithm that computes shared global states is described...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Worst-case {{execution}} time analysis is the fundament of real-time system design, {{and is therefore}} an area which has been subject to great scientific interest for a long time. However, traditional worst-case {{execution time}} analysis techniques assume that the underlying hardware is a <b>monoprocessor</b> <b>system,</b> and this class of hardware platforms is getting less suitable for modern embedded applications, which demand {{more and more in}} terms of computational power. For multiprocessor systems, traditional worst-case analysis tools do not produce correct results and can consequently not be used. To solve this problem, we have previously proposed a technique for achieving predictability on multiprocessor systems-on-chip using a shared TDMA bus. One of the main benefits with our approach is that existing, traditional worstcase execution time analysis techniques can, after some smal...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePerformance {{boosting}} {{has been}} a highly important goal in system designs in the past decades. Not until recently, energy efficiency becomes another critical feature being pursued {{in a wide variety}} of products, especially for battery powered devices. Various studies have been conducted for energy efficient systems techniques. The most adopted ones are Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) and Dynamic Power Management (DPM). However, all the previous research have disregarded an important aspect of these devices, namely rechargeability of the batteries. Several studies have explored the problem of scheduling real-time tasks in a <b>monoprocessor</b> rechargeable <b>system.</b> This paper summarizes the state of art research results of uniprocessor real-time systems under energy constraints. Then, we extend our work to deal with the problem of scheduling real-time tasks in a <b>monoprocessor</b> rechargeable <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the {{limitations}} of models considering fixed (worst case) task execution times have been acknowledged for large application classes within soft real-time systems. A more realistic model considers the tasks having varying execution times with given probability distributions. Considering such a model with specified task execution time probability distribution functions, an important performance indicator {{of the system is}} the expected deadline miss ratio of the tasks and of the task graphs. This article presents an approach for obtaining this indicator in an analytic way. Our goal is to keep the analysis cost low, in terms of required analysis time and memory, while considering as general classes of target application models as possible. The following main assumptions have been made on the applications which are modelled as sets of task graphs: the tasks are periodic, the task execution times have given generalised probability distribution functions, the task execution deadlines are given and arbitrary, the scheduling policy can belong to practically any class of non-preemptive scheduling policies, and a designer supplied maximum number of concurrent instantiations of the same task graph is tolerated in the system. Experiments show the efficiency of the proposed technique for <b>monoprocessor</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Systems {{controlled}} by embedded computers become indispensable {{in our lives}} {{and can be found}} in avionics, automotive industry, home appliances, medicine, telecommunication industry, mecatronics, space industry, etc. Fast, accurate and flexible performance estimation tools giving feedback to the designer in every design phase are a vital part of a design process capable to produce high quality designs of such embedded systems. In the past decade, the limitations of models considering fixed task execution times have been acknowledged for large application classes within soft real-time systems. A more realistic model considers the tasks having varying execution times with given probability distributions. No restriction has been imposed in this thesis on the particular type of these functions. Considering such a model, with specified task execution time probability distribution functions, an important performance indicator of the system is the expected deadline miss ratio of tasks or task graphs. This thesis proposes two approaches for obtaining this indicator in an analytic way. The first is an exact one while the second approach provides an approximate solution trading accuracy for analysis speed. While the first approach can efficiently be applied to <b>monoprocessor</b> <b>systems,</b> it can handle only very small multi-processor applications because of complexity reasons. The second approach, however, can successfully handle realistic multiprocessor applications. Experiments show the efficiency of the proposed techniques. Report code: LiU-Tek-Lic- 2002 : 58...|$|R
40|$|Robotic {{manipulators}} pose {{a challenging}} problem to control system theory. Classical controllers, {{such as the}} well know PID controller still used in present day industrial robots, are inadequate for high performance manipulators. This problem motivated {{the emergence of a}} new class of controllers based on different concepts, namely non-linear and adaptative controllers. Unfortunately, these complex algorithms require powerful computer structures. While <b>monoprocessor</b> <b>systems</b> may be non-economical, multi-microprocessor architectures are still in a research stage and the total computional efficiency is far from desirable. To surpass these limitations new controller structures were devised. Some are based on the reformulation of the overall control concepts. In this line of thought methods like sliding controllers and learning controllers are being actively investigated. In the former the algorithms are easy to implement using standard hardware and applications have already been reported. With respect to learning controllers, they are still in a research stage; nevertheless, preliminary results indicate that a considerable computational reduction can be achieved by a more intelligent use of the microprocessor memory. Alternative strategies based on a more sound allocation of the computing tasks were also suggested~: Techniques such as multirate sampling, preview schemes and dedicated compilers have achieved promising results. This chapter focuses on the aforementioned control methods having in mind its real-time implementation on microprocessor-based structures. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Embedded {{systems have}} become {{indispensable}} in our life: household appliances, cars, airplanes, power plant control systems, medical equipment, telecommunication systems, space technology, they all contain digital computing systems with dedicated functionality. Most of them, if not all, are real-time systems, i. e. {{their responses to}} stimuli have timeliness constraints. The timeliness requirement has to be met despite some unpredictable, stochastic behaviour of the system. In this thesis, we address two causes of such stochastic behaviour: the application and platform-dependent stochastic task execution times, and the platform-dependent occurrence of transient faults on network links in networks-on-chip. We present three approaches {{to the analysis of}} the deadline miss ratio of applications with stochastic task execution times. Each of the three approaches fits best to a different context. The first approach is an exact one and is efficiently applicable to <b>monoprocessor</b> <b>systems.</b> The second approach is an approximate one, which allows for designer-controlled trade-off between analysis accuracy and analysis speed. It is efficiently applicable to multiprocessor systems. The third approach is less accurate but sufficiently fast in order to be placed inside optimisation loops. Based on the last approach, we propose a heuristic for task mapping and priority assignment for deadline miss ratio minimisation. Our contribution is manifold in the area of buffer and time constrained communication along unreliable on-chip links. First, we introduce the concept of communication supports, an intelligent combination between spatially and temporally redundant communication. We provide a method for constructing a sufficiently varied pool of alternative communication supports for each message. Second, we propose a heuristic for exploring the space of communication support candidates such that the task response times are minimised. The resulting time slack can be exploited by means of voltage and/or frequency scaling for communication energy reduction. Third, we introduce an algorithm for the worst-case analysis of the buffer space demand of applications implemented on networks-on-chip. Last, we propose an algorithm for communication mapping and packet timing for buffer space demand minimisation. All our contributions are supported by sets of experimental results obtained from both synthetic and real-world applications of industrial size...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAFDX (Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet) {{standardised}} as ARINC 664 is a {{major upgrade}} for avionics systems. For current aircrafts, it implements a FIFO scheduling policy and allows the transmission of sporadic flows between avionics functions distributed {{on a set of}} end systems. The certification imposes to guarantee that the end-to-end delay of any frame transmitted on the network is upper-bounded and that no frame is lost due to buffer overflow. This guarantee is obtained thanks to a worst-case analysis which is based on either network calculus or trajectory approach. However it leads to an over-dimensioning of the network. For future aircraft, it is envisioned to use a Fixed Priority scheduling policy in order to better use network resources (QoS AFDX). Existing AFDX switches implement two priority levels. A worst-case analysis of such a network exists, based on the Trajectory approach. Thus, the remaining issue is to assign efficiently the available priorities to the flows. The contribution of this paper deals with this issue. It proposes to assign the priorities to the flows using the well-know Optimal Priority Assignment algorithm (OPA) which was first defined for <b>monoprocessor</b> preemptive <b>systems.</b> The proposed solution is applied on two case studies. The overall worst-case delay is reduced by 30 % on a small configuration and 20 % on a realistic one...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAFDX (Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet) {{standardised}} as ARINC 664 is a {{major upgrade}} for avionics systems. The certification imposes to guarantee that the end-toend delay of any frame transmitted on the network is upperbounded and that no frame is lost due to buffer overflow. This guarantee is obtained thanks to a worst-case analysis assuming a FIFO scheduling policy of flows on each output port. For future aircraft, it is envisioned to modify AFDX switch and to use a Fixed Priority scheduling policy of flows (QoS AFDX using IEEE 802. p mechanisms). A worst-case analysis of such a network has been proposed, based on the Trajectory approach. But the remaining issue is to efficiently assign available priorities to the avionics flows inside the network without modifying the application knowledge. The objective is then to minimise overall the worst case end to end delay of flows and consequently to minimise needed buffer size at switch level. The main contribution of this paper deals with the assignment of priorities to the flows using the well-know Optimal Priority Assignment algorithm (OPA) which was first defined for <b>monoprocessor</b> preemptive <b>systems.</b> The schedulability test is then based on the worst case delay analysis of each flow allocated on the AFDX QoS network computed by the trajectory approach.

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays {{industrial}} <b>monoprocessor</b> and multipro-cessor <b>systems</b> {{make use}} of hardware floating-point units (FPUs) to provide software acceleration and better precision due to the necessity to compute complex software applications. This paper presents the design of an IEEE- 754 compliant FPU, targeted {{to be used with}} ARM Cortex-M 1 processor on FPGA SoCs. We face the design of an AMBA-based decoupled FPU in order to avoid changing of the Cortex-M 1 ARMv 6 -M architecture and the ARM compiler, but as well to eventually share it among different processors in our Cortex-M 1 MPSoC design. Our HW-SW implementation can be easily integrated to enable hardware-assisted floating-point operations transparently from the software application. This work reports synthesis results of our Cortex-M 1 SoC architecture, as well as our FPU in Altera and Xilinx FPGAs, which exhibit competitive numbers compared to the equivalent Xilinx FPU IP core. Additionally, single and double precision tests have been performed under different scenarios showing best case speedups between 8. 8 x and 53. 2 x depending on the FP operation when are compared to FP software emulation libraries.
