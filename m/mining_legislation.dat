The aim of the assessment is to determine how well Nigeria mining companies comply with some key provisions of <b>mining</b> and mineral <b>legislation</b> and also to determine the influence of these <b>legislations</b> on the <b>mining</b> industries. For the purpose of this study, the Mining Act of 2007; The Mining Regulations of 2011; The explosives Act of 1964 and Explosives Regulations of 1967 which are the major legislations governing the activities of mining in Nigeria were reviewed, some specific provisions were extracted and compliance to theses extracted provisions were assessed.

The results indicate that the mining industries assessed comply with most of the requirements on safety and health and also with royalty payments.

40|$|Tanzania is a {{relatively}} new mining country, and mining has become a hotly debated issue in the country.

The study argues that since there was poor coordination between the lawmakers when new land and mining laws were put in place, the legislations disagree on central issues like conflict resolution.

40|$|The coal {{industry}} in Queensland operates {{in a very}} complex regulatory environment with a matrix of Federal and State laws covering the environment, health and safety, taxation and royalties, tenure, and development approvals. The Queensland Government in 2012 recognised the validity of certain industry concerns and passed two Acts being the Environmental Protection (Greentape Reduction) Amendment Act 2012 (the Greentape Act) and the <b>Mines</b> <b>Legislation</b> (Streamlining) Amendment Act 2012 (the Streamlining Act).

Accordingly there is a great level of activity and change that has occurred or which is on the horizon.

40|$|Historically, {{the mining}} {{industry}} {{has had a}} high incidence of work related injury and disease, and of disasters involving multiple fatalities. It also faces OHS challenges far exceeding those confronting most other industry sectors. <b>Mine</b> safety <b>legislation</b> can {{play an important role in}} meeting those challenges. Although regulation is never likely to be the entire answer, good regulation not only brings laggards up to a minimum legal standard, it also encourages, rewards and facilitates leaders in going beyond them. Bad regulation, in contrast, constrains good enterprises from taking the initiative to improve OHS, while failing to deter bad ones. This book describes <b>mine</b> safety <b>legislation</b> in the “mining states” and analyses its strengths and weaknesses. It also examines the broader policy questions of how best to design, implement and enforce mine safety regulation. It argues that substantial reform will be necessary not only in setting standards, but also in their implementation, if further OHS improvements are to be achieved. This implies substantial changes in the way the mine safety inspectorates go about their tasks: in how they administer and enforce the law; and in the circumstances in which they choose to prosecute. It also requires the nurturing of a degree of trust between employers and workers (individually and collectively) and between both these parties and the mines inspectorates, that has been substantially lacking in recent years...|$|R
