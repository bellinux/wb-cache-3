5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more <b>moldable,</b> but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E

25|$|The main use {{of calcium}} sulfate {{is to produce}} plaster of Paris and stucco. These {{applications}} exploit the fact that calcium sulfate which has been powdered and calcined forms a <b>moldable</b> paste upon hydration and hardens as crystalline calcium sulfate dihydrate. It is also convenient that calcium sulfate is poorly soluble in water and does not readily dissolve in contact with water after its solidification.|$|E
2500|$|Baekeland {{then began}} experimenting to {{strengthen}} wood by impregnating {{it with a}} synthetic resin, rather than coating it. [...] By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to phenol and formaldehyde, Baekeland produced a hard <b>moldable</b> material which he named [...] "Bakelite". It was the first synthetic thermosetting plastic ever produced, and Baekeland speculated on [...] "the thousand and one ... articles" [...] {{that it could be}} used to make. Baekeland considered the possibilities of using a wide variety of filling materials, including cotton, powdered bronze, and slate dust, but was most successful with wood and asbestos fibers.|$|E
2500|$|New {{processes}} that sped {{the production of}} chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness. A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate. Known as [...] "Dutch cocoa", this machine-pressed chocolate {{was instrumental in the}} transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, Joseph Fry learned to make chocolate <b>moldable</b> by adding back melted cacao butter. Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestlé with the liquor. In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.|$|E
2500|$|Sole of boot (alu ~ aluq sg aluk dual alut pl [...] in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, atungar in Cup'ig) is {{the bottom}} of a boot, in contact with the ground. The nat'raq (in Yup'ik, nateraq in Unaliq-Pastuliq dialect) a special oversole of skin boot used to prevent {{slipping}} on ice. Yup'ik soles are traditionally made of bearded seal skin which is usually chewed to make it <b>moldable.</b> The sealskin materials used for skinboot soles are nat'rarkaq (in Yup'ik) [...] "sole material for skin boots, made from the tanned skin of the bearded seal", atungagkar (in Cup'ig) [...] "sealskin material to be used for making bootsoles", arinacir(ar) (in Cup'ig) [...] "aged sealskin used for skinboot soles or as a mat", meqcirer (in Cup'ig) [...] "sealskin aged to remove hair and stretched on stakes over ground (hide is then used for making boot soles)". Boot soles were occasionally cut from old kayak covers that had been made from bearded seal skins. Siberian Yupik, Alaskan Yup'ik, and Iñupiaq boot soles are particularly thick, sometimes reaching a depth of five centimeters.|$|E

The bone putty requires no kneading prior to application and does not soften appreciably at body temperature.|$|E
50|$|Henry L. Haskell {{formed the}} Haskell Manufacturing Company in 1916 to {{manufacture}} plywood. The multi-layered veneer wood panels were called haskelite. The thinner three-layered plywood could be molded into any shape desired. It {{was used in}} the construction of canoes, boats, trucks, buses, automobiles, and airplanes. The first plane made with <b>moldable</b> plywood was constructed with Haskelite, and was the Curtiss two-place fighter Whistling Bill.|$|E
50|$|Thinner <b>moldable</b> plywood {{was used}} to make watercraft. One model was the Haskell canoe. It was made from a type of plywood Haskell produced, {{consisting}} of veneers of birch {{on the outside and}} a redwood core. The unseamed canoe was made from a single piece of plywood; thousands were sold in the US. There was no ribs used in the building of the canoe.|$|E

50|$|Wake Forest University {{engineers}} are using multiwalled carbon nanotubes {{to enhance the}} brightness of field-induced polymer electroluminescent technology, potentially offering a step forward {{in the search for}} safe, pleasing, high-efficiency lighting. In this technology, <b>moldable</b> polymer matrix emits light when exposed to an electric current. It could eventually yield high-efficiency lights without the mercury vapor of compact fluorescent lamps or the bluish tint of some fluorescents and LEDs, which has been linked with circadian rhythm disruption.|$|E
50|$|It {{was invented}} in 1875 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, who had also invented dynamite. Unlike dynamite, {{gelignite}} does not suffer from the dangerous problem of sweating, the leaking of unstable nitroglycerine from the solid matrix. Its composition makes it easily <b>moldable</b> and safe to handle without protection, {{as long as it}} is not near anything capable of detonating it. One of the cheapest explosives, it burns slowly and cannot explode without a detonator, so it can be stored safely.|$|E
5000|$|These are <b>moldable</b> {{plastics}} {{often used}} in rapid prototyping and rapid manufacturing (direct digital manufacturing) applications. Polyphenylsulfone is a heat and chemical-resistant suited for automotive, aerospace, and plumbing applications. Polyphenylsulfone has no melting point, reflecting it its amorphous nature, and offers tensile strength up to 55 MPa (8000 psi). Its commercial name is Radel. [...] In plumbing applications, polyphenylsulfone fittings {{have been found to}} sometimes form cracks prematurely or to experience failure when improperly installed using non-manufacturer approved installation methods or systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{plastic resin}} is {{commonly}} used as an oxygen barrier in food packaging. It is better than other plastics at keeping air out and flavors in, is highly transparent, weather resistant, oil and solvent resistant, flexible, <b>moldable,</b> recyclable, and printable. Its drawback {{is that it is}} difficult to make and therefore more expensive than other food packaging. Instead of making an entire package out of EVOH, manufacturers keep costs down by coextruding or laminating it as a thin layer between cardboard, foil, or other plastics.|$|E
50|$|Uses of kenaf fibre include {{engineered}} wood, insulation, clothing-grade cloth, soil-less potting mixes, animal bedding, packing material, {{and material}} that absorbs oil and liquids. It is also useful as cut bast fibre for blending with resins for plastic composites, as a drilling fluid loss preventative for oil drilling muds, for a seeded hydromulch for erosion control. Kenaf {{can be made}} into various types of environmental mats, such as seeded grass mats for instant lawns and <b>moldable</b> mats for manufactured parts and containers. Panasonic {{has set up a}} plant in Malaysia to manufacture kenaf fibre boards and export them to Japan.|$|E
