40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether low-grade systemic inflammation might contribute to the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (sHT) and autoimmune thyroiditis. BACKGROUND: sHT patients are characterized by peripheral endothelial dysfunction and low-grade inflammation. METHODS: In 53 sHT and 45 healthy subjects, we studied the forearm blood flow (strain-gauge plethysmography) response to intrabrachial acetylcholine (Ach) (0. 15 - 15 microg/min. dl) with and without local vascular COX inhibition by intrabrachial indomethacin (50 microg/min. dl) or nitric oxide synthase blockade by N-mono <b>methyl</b> <b>arginine</b> (L-NMMA) (100 microg/min. dl) or the antioxidant vitamin C (8 mg/min. dl). The protocol was repeated 2 h after systemic nonselective COX inhibition (100 mg indomethacin) or selective COX- 2 blockade (200 mg celecoxib) oral administrations. RESULTS: sHT patients showed higher C-reactive protein and IL- 6 values. In controls, vasodilation to Ach was blunted by L-NMMA and unchanged by vitamin C. In contrast, in sHT, the response to Ach, reduced in comparison with controls, was resistant to L-NMMA and normalized by vitamin C. In these patients, systemic but not local indomethacin normalized vasodilation to Ach and the inhibition of L-NMMA on Ach. Similar results were obtained with celecoxib. When retested after indomethacin administration, vitamin C no longer succeeded in improving vasodilation to Ach in sHT patients. Response to sodium nitroprusside was unchanged by indomethacin or celecoxib. CONCLUSIONS: In sHT patients, low-grade chronic inflammation causes endothelial dysfunction and impaired nitric oxide availability by a COX- 2 -dependent pathway leading to increased production of oxidative stress...|$|E

40|$|An ADP-ribosyltransferase was {{purified}} ∼ 500 -fold {{from the}} supernatant fraction of turkey erythrocytes. The enzyme hydrolyzed [carbonyl- 14 C]NAD to ADP-ribose and [carbonyl- 14 C]nicotinamide {{at a low}} rate. Nicotinamide formation from NAD was enhanced by <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester > D-arginine ∼ L-arginine > guanidine; lysine, histidine, and citrulline were ineffective. Incubation of [adenine-U- 14 C]NAD and <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester or <b>arginine</b> with the purified enzyme resulted {{in the formation of}} new compounds that contained 14 C, reacted with ninhydrin, and quenched background fluorescence of thin-layer plates viewed in ultraviolet light. Their mobilities on thin-layer chromatograms were indistinguishable from those of ADP-ribosylarginine methyl ester and ADP-ribosylarginine formed during incubation of choleragen with NAD and <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester or <b>arginine,</b> respectively [Moss, J. & Vaughan, M. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2455 - 2457]. The purified transferase also catalyzed the incorporation of label from [adenine- 14 C]-NAD into lysozyme, histones and polyarginine. When the 14 C-labeled lysozyme was incubated with snake venom phosphodiesterase, the radioactivity was released and, on thin-layer chromatograms, exhibited a mobility indistinguishable from that of 5 ′-AMP, as would be expected of an ADP-ribosylated protein, but not of a poly(ADP-ribosylated) product. The purified transferase activated rat brain adenylate cyclase and, {{as is the case with}} choleragen, activation was absolutely dependent on NAD. The presence in the avian erythrocyte of a protein that, like choleragen and Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin, apparently activates adenylate cyclase and possesses ADP-ribosyl transferase activity is consistent with the view that the mechanisms through which the bacterial toxins produce pathology are not entirely foreign to vertebrate cells, at least some of which may possess and employ an analogous mechanism for activation of adenylate cyclase...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the possible role of nitric oxide (NO) {{in the development of}} the withdrawal contractures of guinea pig isolated ileum after acute activation of mu- and kappa-opioid receptors. After a 4 -min in vitro exposure to morphine (mu-opioid receptor preferring, but not selective, agonist), [D-Ala 2 -N-methyl-Phe 4 -Gly 5 -ol-]enkephalin (DAMGO; highly selective mu-opioid receptor agonist), or trans(+/-) - 3, 4 -dichloro-N-methyl-N- 2 (1 -pyrrolidynyl) cyclohexyl-ben zeneacetamide (U 50 - 488 H; highly selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist), the guinea-pig isolated ileum exhibited a strong contracture after the addition of naloxone. L-N(G) -nitro <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester (3 - 300 microM) injected 10 min before the opioid receptor agonists was able dose dependently to reduce the naloxone-induced contraction after exposure to mu- and kappa-opioid receptor agonists whereas D-N(G) -nitro <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester at the same concentrations did not affect it. The inhibitory effect of L-N(G) -nitro <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester on morphine, DAMGO and U 50 - 488 H withdrawal was dose dependently reversed by L-arginine (3 - 300 microM) but not by D-arginine. Finally, glyceryl trinitrate on its own (3 - 300 microM) significantly increased the naloxone-induced contraction after exposure to mu- and kappa-opioid receptor agonist and it was also able to reverse the inhibition of opioid withdrawal caused by L-N(G) -nitro <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester. These results provide evidence that NO has a role in the development of opioid withdrawal and that mu- or kappa-opioid receptors are involved...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{arginine}} methylation often modulates protein–protein interactions. To isolate {{a sufficient}} quantity of proteins enriched in <b>methyl</b> <b>arginine(s)</b> from natural sources for biochemical studies is laborious and difficult. We describe here an expression system that produces recombinant proteins that are enriched in ω-NG,NG-asymmetry dimethylarginines. A yeast type I arginine methyltransferase gene (HMT 1) {{is put on}} a plasmid {{under the control of}} the Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase promoter for constitutive expression. The protein targeted for post-translational modification is put on the same plasmid behind a T 7 promoter for inducible expression of His 6 -tagged proteins. Sbp 1 p and Stm 1 p were used as model proteins to examine this expression system. The 13 arginines within the arginine-glycine-rich motif of Sbp 1 p and the RGG sequence near the C terminus of Stm 1 p were methylated. Unexpectedly, the arginine residue on the thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS) of the fusion proteins can also be methylated by Hmt 1 p. Sbp 1 p and Sbp 1 p/hmt 1 were covalently attached to solid supports for the isolation of interacting proteins. The results indicate that arginine methylation on Sbp 1 p exerts both positive and negative effects on protein–protein interaction...|$|R
40|$|Highly purified, polymyxin-released, low {{molecular}} weight Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) catalyzed the hydrolysis of NAD to ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. This NAD glycohydrolase activity was stimulated by dithiothreitol and was independent of cellular components. Nicotinamide formation was enhanced by <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester > d-arginine ≅ l-arginine ≅ guanidine. A 20 -fold increase in activity was noted with <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester, and maximal activity again required dithiothreitol. When the reaction was initiated with toxin, a delay was observed before a constant rate was established. The reaction products found after incubation of [adenine-U- 14 C]NAD and l-[3 H]arginine or unlabeled <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester with the enterotoxin had mobilities on thin-layer chromatograms similar to the reaction products obtained after incubation of choleragen with these substrates and {{are consistent with the}} formation of ADP-ribose-l-arginine and ADP-ribose-l-arginine methyl ester, respectively. Both toxins, which catalyze the NAD-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase, thus appear to possess NAD glycohydrolase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities. Although the activities of both toxins are dependent on dithiothreitol, Escherichia coli enterotoxin exhibited optimal activity in Tris (Cl−) (pH 7. 5) and was inhibited by high concentrations of potassium phosphate (pH 7. 0) or low pH (sodium acetate, pH 6. 2). It appears that the optimal assay conditions as well as the kinetic constants for the reactants differ from those previously noted with choleragen. It is probable therefore that although the two toxins catalyze similar reactions, they differ in primary structure. The presence of transferase and glycohydrolase activities in structurally distinct toxins that activate adenylate cyclase strengthens our hypothesis that the ADP-ribosylation of arginine is a model for the NAD-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase; activation may result from ADP-ribosylation of the cyclase itself or of a protein that regulates its activity...|$|R
40|$|Erythropoiesis {{requires}} {{tight control}} of expansion, maturation, and survival of erythroid progenitors. Because activation of phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) {{is required for}} erythropoietin/stem cell factor-induced expansion of erythroid progenitors, we examined {{the role of the}} PI 3 K-controlled Forkhead box, class 0 (FoxO) subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors. FoxO 3 a expression and nuclear accumulation increased during erythroid differentiation, whereas untimely induction of FoxO 3 a activity accelerated differentiation of erythroid progenitors to erythrocytes. We identified B cell translocation gene I (BTG 1) /antiproliferative protein 2 as a FoxO 3 a target gene in erythroid progenitors. Promoter studies indicated BTG 1 as a direct target of FoxO 3 a. Expression of BTG 1 in primary mouse bone marrow cells blocked the outgrowth of erythroid colonies, which required a domain of BTG 1 that binds protein <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> transferase 1. During erythroid differentiation, increased arginine methylation coincided with BTG 1 expression. Concordantly, inhibition of methyl transferase activity blocked erythroid maturation without affecting expansion of progenitor cells.

40|$|Abstract. A Janus- 2 (JAK- 2) binding protein, JBP 1, {{has been}} found to {{function}} as an <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> transferase and is now designated PRMT 5. Co-injection of plasmids encoding this protein together with oncogenic (Val 12 -containing) ras-p 21 protein into Xenopus laevis oocytes results in strong inhibition of oncogenic p 21 -induced oocyte maturation. This inhibition appears to be dependent on the methyl transferase function since a partially active R 368 A mutant shows diminished ability to inhibit Val 12 -p 21 -induced oocyte maturation, and an almost totally inactive GAGRG (365 - 369) deletion mutant fails to inhibit Val 12 -p 21 -induced maturation. In contrast, PRMT 5 (JBP 1) does not inhibit insulin-induced oocyte maturation. Since insulin-induced maturation depends on activation of cellular ras-p 21, PRMT 5 does not appear to inhibit the wild-type p 21 protein. We also find that <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> transferase inhibitors strongly block oncogenic ras-p 21 -activated, but not insulin-activated, wild-type ras-p 21 -induced oocyte maturation. Thus signaling by oncogenic p 21 appears to involve methyltransferases uniquely. Surprisingly, the active site peptide, Gly-Arg-Gly, strongly suppresses insulin-induced maturation but has no effect on Val 12 -p 21 -induced maturation. This peptide may therefore be useful in defining steps in the wild-type ras pathway...|$|R
40|$|Arginine {{methylation}} of histones is one {{mechanism of}} epigenetic regulation in eukaryotic cells. Methylarginines {{can also be}} found in non-histone proteins involved in various different processes in a cell. An enzyme family of nine protein arginine methyltransferases catalyses the addition of <b>methyl</b> groups on <b>arginines</b> of histone and non-histone proteins, resulting in either mono- or dimethylated-arginine residues. The reversibility of histone modifications is an essential feature of epigenetic regulation to respond to changes in environmental factors, signalling events, or metabolic alterations. Prominent histone modifications like lysine acetylation and lysine methylation are reversible. Enzyme family pairs have been identified, with each pair of lysine acetyltransferases/deacetylases and lysine methyltransferases/demethylases operating complementarily to generate or erase lysine modifications. Several analyses also indicate a reversible nature of arginine methylation, but the enzymes facilitating direct removal of <b>methyl</b> moieties from <b>arginine</b> residues in proteins have been discussed controversially. Differing reports have been seen for initially characterized putative candidates, like peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 or Jumonji-domain containing protein 6.

Post-transcriptional regulation is emerging as {{an important component of}} circadian networks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, but the molecular mechanisms linking the circadian clock to the control of RNA processing are largely unknown. Here we show that PROTEIN <b>ARGININE</b> <b>METHYL</b> TRANSFERASE 5 (PRMT 5), which transfers <b>methyl</b> groups to <b>arginine</b> residues present in histones 7 and Sm spliceosomal proteins 8, 9, links the circadian clock to the control of alternative splicing in plants. Mutations in PRMT 5 impair several circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana and this phenotype is caused, at least in part, by a strong alteration in alternative splicing of the core-clock gene PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 (PRR 9). Furthermore, genome-wide studies show that PRMT 5 contributes to the regulation of many pre-messenger-RNA splicing events, probably by modulating 5 ′-splice-site recognition. PRMT 5 expression shows daily and circadian oscillations, and this contributes to the mediation of the circadian regulation of expression and alternative splicing of a subset of genes. Circadian rhythms in locomotor activity are also disrupted in dart 5 - 1, a mutant affected in the Drosophila melanogaster PRMT 5 homologue, and this is associated with alterations in splicing of the core-clock gene period and several clock-associated genes. Our results demonstrate a key role for PRMT 5 in the regulation of alternative splicing and indicate that the interplay between the circadian clock and the regulation of alternative splicing by PRMT 5 constitutes a common mechanism that helps organisms to synchronize physiological processes with daily changes in environmental conditions...|$|R

When unstarved bacteria were labeled with L-[methyl- 3 H]methionine, a labeled species of 73, 000 molecular weight which was methylated in response to stimulation by L-serine was identified. Under appropriate electrophoretic conditions, the 73, 000 molecular weight species was resolved into two bands, both of which responded to stimulation by L-serine, L-arginine, and alpha-aminoisobutyrate (AIB) with an increased incorporation of <b>methyl</b> label. <b>Arginine,</b> which elicited the strongest chemotactic response in the capillary assay, also stimulated the greatest methylation response.

Nevertheless, TAME stabilizes cyclin B 1 in Xenopus extract by two mechanisms. First, it reduces the kcat of the APCCdc 20 /cyclin B 1 complex without affecting the Km, slowing the initial ubiquitination of unmodified cyclin B 1.

The authors suggested that NO could be a universal activator of eggs and {{the present study was}} set up to test this hypothesis. Intracellular NO and Ca 2 + levels were monitored simultaneously in eggs of the mouse or the urochordate ascidian Ascidiella aspersa. Eggs were either fertilized or sperm extracts microinjected. Sperm-induced Ca 2 + rises were not associated with any global, or local, change in intracellular NO, although we were able to detect NO produced by the addition of a NO donor. Furthermore, the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro [...] <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester had no effect on sperm-induced Ca 2 + release but did block completely ionomycin-induced NO synthase activation. Therefore, we suggest that the current data provide evidence that NO has no role in the fertilization of these two chordate eggs...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Sage via the DOI in this recordThe nitric oxide synthase (NOS) -independent pathway of nitric oxide (NO) production in which nitrite (NO 2 (-)) is reduced to NO may have therapeutic applications for those with cardiovascular diseases in which the NOS pathway is downregulated. We tested the hypothesis that NO 2 (-) infusion would reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) and increase skeletal muscle blood flow (BF) and vascular conductance (VC) during exercise {{in the face of}} NOS blockade via L-NAME. Following infusion of L-NAME (10 mg kg(- 1), L-NAME), male Sprague-Dawley rats (3 - 6 months, n = 8) exercised without N(G) -nitro-L <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester (L-NAME) and after infusion of sodium NO 2 (-) (7 mg kg(- 1); L-NAME + NO 2 (-)). MAP and hindlimb skeletal muscle BF (radiolabeled microsphere infusions) were measured during submaximal treadmill running (20 m min(- 1), 5...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{inhibition}} of high-affinity isoforms of the Na+,K+-ATPase by nanomolar levels of ouabain {{has been proposed}} to enhance the actions of vasoconstrictor agents that act via a Ca+ 2 -dependent mechanism. The present study tested this hypothesis by evaluating the effects of ouabain (6 and 18 g/kg, i. v.) on the vasopressor actions of phenylephrine and norepinephrine in anesthetized, reflex-blocked rats. In separate groups of animals, dose-response curves for increases in diastolic pressure produced by phenylephrine were generated after the administration of saline (control), ouabain (18 g/kg), L-omega-N-nitro <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester (L-NAME, 3 mol/kg) and angiotensin II (15 ng/kg per min). Treatment with ouabain (18 g/kg) produced an in-crease in diastolic pressure of 19 ± 3 mm Hg but did not significantly alter the potency or maximal response produced by phenylephrine. In contrast, treat-ment with angiotensin II and L-NAME, agents known to enhance the actions of -adrenoceptor agonists, increased the potency of phenylephrine. In ani-mals in which the pressor actions of norepinephrine were evaluated before an...|$|R
50|$|Like HDACs, Histone Methyltransferases (HMTs) alter histones, {{but these}} enzymes are {{involved}} in the transfer of <b>methyl</b> groups to <b>Arginine</b> and Lysine amino acids of histones. There are a wide number of activities and histone alterations that are related with depression. Chronic stress was found to decrease the levels of a number of HMTs, such as G9a, in the NAc of susceptible mice. Conversely, in resilient mice, these HMTs have increased activity. In addition to this HMT activity, it is seen that H3K9 and H3K27 have less methylation when depressive behavior is seen. The hippocampus also has a number of histone methylation changes: H3K27-trimethylation is decreased in response to stress, while H3K9-trimethylation and H3K4-trimethylation are increased in response to short term stress, but decreased in response to long term stress. Although more work needs to be done with HMTs, it is generally seen that stress that leads to depression like behavior leads to a decrease in methylation and a decrease in the activity of HMTs.|$|R
40|$|Plasmin {{incubated}} with partially purified C[unk] inactivator {{produced a}} decrease in inhibitory activity which {{was related to the}} time of incubation and to the concentration of plasmin. This effect of plasmin was not influenced by the purity of the inhibitor preparations. Soybean trypsin inhibitor and tosyl <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester (TAMe), substances which block the active enzymic center of plasmin, prevented the plasmin-induced inactivation. Double diffusion analysis of the functionally deficient, plasmin-treated C[unk] inactivator using a specific antibody, showed a reaction of identity with the untreated inhibitor. Agarose and acrylamide gel immunoelectrophoresis of a plasmin, inhibitor mixture showed the appearance of an additional precipitin band with immunologic reactivity {{similar to that of the}} untreated inhibitor. These results demonstrate that plasmin alters both the functional and immunoelectrophoretic properties of C[unk] inactivator, and that the active proteolytic site of plasmin is necessary for this interaction. Since C[unk] inactivator has been shown to inhibit several different proteolytic enzymes including C[unk], kallikrein, PF/Dil, and plasmin, this investigation provides a theoretical relationship between the fibrinolytic, kallikrein, and complement systems which may have pathophysiologic relevance to various human disease states...|$|R
40|$|Circadian clocks allow organisms {{to adjust}} {{multiple}} physiological and developmental processes {{in anticipation of}} daily and seasonal changes in the environment. At the molecular level these clocks consist of interlocked feedback loops, involving transcriptional activation and repression, but also post-translational modifications. In a recently published work we provided evidence that PRMT 5, a protein <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> transferase, {{is part of a}} novel loop within the circadian clock of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana by regulating alternative splicing of key clock mRNAs. We also found evidence indicating that PRMT 5 has a role in the regulation of alternative splicing and the circadian network in Drosophila melanogaster, although the clock connection in the latter is more elusive and seems to be at the output level. We conclude that alternative precursor messenger RNA (premRNA) splicing is part of the circadian program and could be a main actor in the fine-tuning of biological clocks. Here, we embrace the alternative splicing process as part of the circadian program and discuss the possibility that this mechanism is of fundamental relevance for the fine-tuning of biological clocks...|$|R
40|$|Genistein, a phytoestrogen, {{possesses}} cardioprotective effects. Responses to genistein (0. 1 - 100 μM) {{were assessed}} in 9, 11 -dideoxy- 9 α, 11 α-methanoepoxy prostaglandin F 2 α (U 46619) -contracted porcine coronary arterial rings, with significant relaxations at high concentrations. At concentrations with little relaxation, genistein (0. 3 - 3 μM) {{did not affect}} relaxation produced by bradykinin and the calcium ionophore, A 23187. In contrast, sodium nitroprusside- and cromakalim-induced relaxations were enhanced by genistein (3 μM). Nω-nitro-L- <b>arginine</b> <b>methyl</b> ester (L-NAME) (300 μM) or Triton X- 100 (0. 5 %) {{did not affect the}} enhancement of relaxation by genistein. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin 23 (30 μM), had no effect on sodium nitroprusside-elicited relaxation. In summary, genistein relaxed porcine coronary artery at relatively high concentrations. At a physiologically relevant concentration (3 μM), it is devoid of significant vascular effect, but enhanced endothelium-independent relaxations. This effect of genistein does not involve the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway and the endothelium, and is mediated through a mechanism different from tyrosine kinase inhibition. © 2003 Elsevier B.
