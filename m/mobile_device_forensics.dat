50|$|Most recently, <b>mobile</b> <b>device</b> <b>forensic</b> tools {{have been}} {{developed}} for the field. This is in response both to military units' demand for fast and accurate anti-terrorism intelligence, and to law enforcement demand for forensic previewing capabilities at a crime scene, search warrant execution, or exigent circumstances.

50|$|Generally, {{because it}} is {{impossible}} for any one tool to capture all evidence from all <b>mobile</b> <b>devices,</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>forensic</b> professionals recommend that examiners establish entire toolkits consisting of a mix of commercial, open source, broad support, and narrow support forensic tools, together with accessories such as battery chargers, Faraday bags or other signal disruption equipment, and so forth.|$|R

This paper reports on a comparison of results produced by a selection of software based recovery methods available in three <b>mobile</b> <b>device</b> <b>forensic</b> toolkits. The results provide the first empirical evidence that there is considerable variation in results between toolkits in terms of the proportion of data recovered from different devices by different toolkits.

40|$|Abstract- Cloud {{computing}} is {{a relatively}} new concept that offers the potential to deliver scalable elastic services to many. The notion of pay-per use is attractive and in the current global recession hit economy it offers an economic solution to an organization’s IT need. Computer forensic {{is a relatively}} new discipline born out of the increasing use of computing and digital storage devices in criminal acts (both traditional and hi-tech). As per the survey of BI Intelligence there are 1. 4 billion Smartphone in use by December 2013. With the increased availability of these powerful devices, there is also a potential increase for criminals to use this technology as well. Criminals could use smart phones for number of activities such as committing fraud over e-mail, harassment through text messages, communications related to narcotics etc. The data stored on smart phones could be extremely useful to analysts through the course of an investigation. Indeed <b>mobile</b> <b>devices</b> are already showing themselves to have a larger volume to probative information that is link to an individual with just basic call history, contact and text message data; smart phone contains even more useful information, such as e-mail, browser history and chat logs. <b>Mobile</b> <b>devices</b> probably have more probative information that can be linked to an individual per byte examined than most computers and this data is harder to acquire in a forensically proper fashion.

40|$|Abstract—In {{an effort}} to {{ultimately}} develop a network-based <b>mobile</b> <b>device</b> resource monitor, we demonstrate the feasibility of remotely detecting the types of applications (i. e., CPU intensive, I/O intensive or non-CPU intensive) actively executing on a <b>mobile</b> <b>device.</b> The distinguishing characteristic of this method is its uncanny ability to remotely infer the types of applications executing on a <b>mobile</b> <b>device</b> {{when there is no}} native network traffic being generated from it. To do this, we inconspicuously solicit network traffic from the <b>mobile</b> <b>device</b> by pinging it. Then we capture the timestamps of the ICMP replies, calculate the average inter-packet spacing, and finally use a Neural-Fuzzy Classifier (NFC) that has been previously trained on CPU intensive, I/O intensive, and non-CPU intensive correlated network traffic to discern between the three application types. The NFC acts as a dynamic threshold by grouping the training patterns into clusters and uses these clusters to create membership functions to separate future patterns of each type. We evaluate several Android and Apple devices, and we show that our approach is feasible for Android <b>mobile</b> <b>devices.</b> The key to this method is CPU throttling (when the on-demand governor is used), which scales the CPU performance according {{to the needs of the}} presently executing applications in {{an effort to}} save power. We exploit CPU throttling to extract embedded delays from solicited ICMP network traffic. Our results show that our method is at least 95 % effective in remotely detecting the types of applications executing on Android <b>mobile</b> <b>device.</b> Keywords—Android, <b>mobile</b> <b>devices,</b> security, network <b>forensics,</b> application fingerprinting I...|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of mobile communication and computing devices, in particular smart mobile phones, is almost paralleled {{with the increasing}} number of <b>mobile</b> <b>device</b> <b>forensics</b> tools in the market. Each mobile forensics tool vendor, on one hand claims to have a tool that is best in terms of performance, while on the other hand each tool vendor seems to be using different standards for testing their tools and thereby defining what support means differently. To overcome this problem, a testing framework based on a series of tests ranging from basic forensics tasks such as file system reconstruction up to more complex ones countering antiforensic techniques is proposed. The framework, which is an extension of an existing effort done in 2010, prescribes a method to clearly circumscribe the term support into precise levels.
