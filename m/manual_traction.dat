Method: A total of 30 participants were recruited for this study by placing advertisements {{in and around the}} University of Johannesburg, Doornfontein Campus. Participants had to meet the requirements of the inclusion criteria and were excluded if they were found to be unfit for this particular study. The 30 participants were asked to draw a number out of a bag which therefor randomly divided them into three groups of 10 participants each. Procedure: Participants in group A received <b>manual</b> cervical <b>traction</b> alone as their treatment. Participants in group B received cervical spine adjustments alone as their treatment. Finally, participants in group C were treated by performing <b>manual</b> cervical spine <b>traction</b> after the cervical spine adjustment. Each participant was treated a total of six times over a two week period. Measurements were taken on the first, fourth and a seventh consultation. Results: Regarding the Subjective readings, there was an improvement with regards to the Numerical Pain Rating Scale values for all three groups, but the combination group of <b>manual</b> cervical spine <b>traction</b> performed post cervical spine adjustment, showed the greatest improvement over the trial period on intra-group analysis.

No statistical significant changes were found on inter group analysis. Regarding the Objective readings, there was an improvement in pressure algometer readings for all three groups, but the cervical spine adjustment group showed the greatest improvement over the trial period on intra-group analysis. No statistical significant changes were found on inter group analysis. There was an improvement in Cervical Range of Motion readings for all three groups, but the combination group of <b>manual</b> cervical spine <b>traction</b> performed post cervical spine adjustment showed the greatest improvement for flexion, extension and bilateral rotation on intra-group analysis.

40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Introduction: The {{most common}} chronic pain {{condition}} in modern society is neck pain (Jensen and Harms-Ringdahl, 2007). Chronic neck pain {{is a common}} complaint for many, from young patients to older patients with stressful work situations. According to Graham, Gross and Goldsmith (2006) neck disorders are common, disabling to various degrees and costly. Various structures in the cervical spine capable of transmitting pain include facet joints, intervertebral discs, nerve root dura, ligaments, and muscles (Manchikanti, Singh, Rivera and Pampati, 2002). According to Rochester (2009) chiropractors treat patients with chronic neck pain by using spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) to address a segmental joint hypomobility within the cervical spine as determined by joint motion palpation and endplay assessment. Traction is commonly used {{for the treatment of}} the spine by various physical therapists. It may be included as part of a chiropractic treatment protocol. According to Hooper (1996) traction involves the application of both manual and mechanical forces to draw adjacent body parts away from each other resulting in decompressed irritated tissues, realign parts, and relaxing tight structures. There are several types of cervical traction. The short and medium term improvement for chronic neck pain as well as the comparative effect of <b>manual</b> cervical <b>traction</b> versus mechanical cervical traction in combination with spinal manipulative therapy has not yet been established. Aim: This particular research study aimed to compare the short to medium term efficacy of <b>manual</b> cervical <b>traction</b> with mechanical cervical traction combined with spinal manipulative therapy with regards to decreased pain and improvement of cervical spine ranges of motion in patients with chronic neck pain. Methodology: Participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were eligible to participate in this study. Advertisements were placed on notice boards around the campus of the University of Johannesburg and participants were recruited from the use of advertisements as well as word of mouth to partake in this research study. Thirty participants who suffered from chronic neck pain, volunteered for this comparative research study. This study was a randomized comparative study, where participants were randomly selected to be either in Group 1 or in Group 2. Group 1 received <b>manual</b> cervical <b>traction</b> whereas Group 2 received mechanical cervical traction. Both groups received spinal manipulative therapy to the restricted motion segments found in the cervical spine. Participants received seven trial sessions, with six treatments, over a period of two weeks. At the final 7 th visit, one month after the sixth visit, no treatment was performed. Subjective and objective measurements were recorded at each visit. The subjective measurements of this particular study consisted of the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and the Vernon-Mior Neck Disability Index to evaluate the participants’ sensitivity to pain and disability. The objective measurements of this study included the Cervical Spine Range of Motion instrument to assess the participants’ cervical spine movement. Results: Both groups demonstrated a statistically significant improvement over time with regards to pain and disability, as well as increased range of motion to the cervical spine. The greatest percentage improvement with regards to range of motion was in lateral flexion and rotation of the cervical spine. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it could be concluded that either <b>manual</b> cervical <b>traction</b> or mechanical cervical traction in combination with spinal manipulative therapy can be used effectively in the treatment of chronic neck pain as part of a chiropractic treatment protocol.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionExcimer {{laser energy}} is often {{required}} to extract chronically indwelling pacemaker and defibrillator leads from the vasculature and myocardium. This technique can {{be associated with}} vascular and right ventricular (RV) injuries. We sought to develop a safer, more effective method by applying site-specific delivery of electrosurgical energy (EE). MethodsUtilizing a polyacrylamide gel model to simulate soft tissue density, active and passive fixation defibrillator and pacemaker leads were implanted and manually extracted with and without EE delivered to the cathode. The amount of force required for complete removal was measured using a force transducer. The procedure was then repeated in an acute pig model to demonstrate proof of safety. Post mortem gross and histologic specimens were collected from the implantation site. ResultsIn the gel model, the force required for extraction, using <b>manual</b> <b>traction</b> in the active (83. 7 g) and passive (74. 6 g) fixation ICD leads, was reduced by 37. 8 % and 33. 5 %, respectively with EE (both p < 0. 01). The force required for extraction, using <b>manual</b> <b>traction</b> in the active (85. 2 g) and passive (71. 9 g) fixation pacemaker leads, was reduced by 64. 4 % and 42. 6 %, respectively with EE (both p < 0. 01). In an acute implantation pig model using an active fixation lead, delivery of EE to the cathode (n = 6) reduced the force required to manually extract the lead (140 g +/− 32. 5 versus 82 g +/− 14. 7, p = 0. 03). Post mortem analysis of the RV displayed formation of an epicardial hemorrhagic lesion that was also present after <b>manual</b> <b>traction</b> and EE. There was absence of pericardial effusion, perforation, and ventricular arrhythmia. ConclusionsSite-specific delivery of EE to areas of exposed metal along the lead decreased the force necessary for lead extraction in an in vitro and in vivo model.

40|$|Abstract Background Similar upper {{extremity}} symptoms can present with varied physiologic etiologies. However, {{due to the}} multifaceted nature of musculoskeletal conditions, a definitive diagnosis using physical examination and advanced testing is not always possible. This report discusses the diagnosis and case management of a patient with two episodes of similar {{upper extremity}} symptoms of different etiologies. Case Presentation On two separate occasions a forty-four year old female patient presented to a chiropractic office with a chief complaint of insidious right-sided upper extremity symptoms. During each episode she reported similar pain and parasthesias from her neck and shoulder to her lateral forearm and hand. During the first episode the patient {{was diagnosed with a}} cervical radiculopathy. Conservative treatment, including <b>manual</b> cervical <b>traction,</b> spinal manipulation and neuromobilization, was initiated and resolved the symptoms. Approximately eighteen months later the patient again experienced a severe acute flare-up of the upper extremity symptoms. Although the subjective complaint was similar, it was determined that the pain generator of this episode was an active trigger point of the infraspinatus muscle. A diagnosis of myofascial referred pain was made and a protocol of manual trigger point therapy and functional postural rehabilitative exercises improved the condition. Conclusion In this case a thorough physical evaluation was able to differentiate between radicular and referred pain. By accurately identifying the pain generating structures, the appropriate rehabilitative protocol was prescribed and led to a successful outcome for each condition. Conservative manual therapy and rehabilitative exercises may be an effective treatment for certain cases of cervical radiculopathy and myofascial referred pain. </p...|$|R

A comprehensive literature search of clinical trials of chronic neck pain treated with manual therapies up to December 2006 was conducted. Trials that scored above 60 % on the PEDro Scale were included. Change scores were analyzed for absolute, percentage change and effect size (ES) whenever possible. Nine trials were identified: 6 for spinal manipulation, 4 for spinal mobilization or non-manipulative manual therapy (2 overlapping trials), and 1 trial using ischemic compression. No trials were identified for massage therapy or <b>manual</b> <b>traction.</b> Four manipulation trials (five groups) reported mean immediate changes in 100 -mm VAS of − 18. 94 (9. 28) mm.

The study lasted 11 weeks, with 1 week baseline period, 6 weeks intervention period and 4 weeks control period. In the intervention period, 2 treatments per week were given, totalling 10 treatments. The outcomes were Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) for self reported functionality, Pain Numeric Rating Scale (PNRS) for pain and "Get Up and Go" for function. Results: After 6 weeks of intervention, function was improved in HOOS compared to the baseline period. PNRS showed improvement for pain and "Get Up and Go" showed improvement for walking ability. But the improvements in PNRS and "Get Up and Go" were {{too small to be}} clinically important. One month after the intervention was finished the improvement were maintained. Conclusions: The results indicate that the combination of traction mobilization and training therapy had impact on self reported functionality for both patients. The treatment also appeared to have impact on pain reduction and walking ability...|$|E
40|$|ABsTRAcT: <b>Manual</b> <b>traction</b> {{reduction}} without anesthesia {{and immediate}} immobilization in a spica cast {{were used to}} treat eighty-five children {{ranging in age from}} birth to ten years old who had closed femoral-shaft fractures and no associated injuries. Up to two centimeters of overriding, 30 degrees of anterior angulation, and 15 degrees of medial angulation were accepted. Any angulation in excess of these amounts, or lateral or posterior angulation, was corrected by wedging the cast at the fracture site. Further telescop-ing of the fracture fragments in the cast was attributed to the child pressing the foot against the bottom of the cast and was prevented by removing the sole of the cast. Of the seventy-five children examined two to eigh-teen years after fracture, none had any residua...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLaparoscopic surgery {{has been}} used {{extensively}} since it was first applied in the 1980 s. The advantages are generally accepted and include less pain, smaller incisions, faster recovery, and shorter hospital stays. However, several limitations associated with standard laparoscopic surgery (SLS) have become apparent and include the loss of tactile sensation, problems with the removal of bulky and intact specimens, and the restriction of visualization of the entire operating field. These problems with SLS helped to inspire the development of laparoscopically assisted surgery followed by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS). In a hand-assisted laparoscopic procedure, an incision {{is made in the}} patient’s abdomen. Then, a uniquely designed appliance is introduced into the abdominal cavity through the incision to maintain pneumoperitoneum. With the inserting hand, surgeons can provide <b>manual</b> exposure, <b>traction,</b> palpation, and dissection because of the feedback of tactile sensation. HALS has gained acceptance {{for a wide range of}} abdominal procedures in general surgery and urology and is now feasible for complicated surgeries such as splenectomy, nephroureterectomy, and colectomy. It has been demonstrated in numerous specialties that HALS is a safe and efficacious technique that combines the benefits of laparoscopy with the advantages of a conventional laparotomy. Standard laparoscopic surgery also has limitations in gynecological surgery. A patient may have high risks with conventional laparoscopic surgery when she has deep invasive endometriosis, multiple or massive myoma, or dense pelvic adhesions from prior surgery. HALS overcomes many of the aforementioned limitations, has less conversion to open surgery, and broadens the indications for minimally invasive surgery, not only for benign tumors but also for pelvic malignancies...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim: Since 1998, {{the effect}} of {{traction}} on the H- reflex has been investigated by Hiraoka and the other researchers. Some {{of them have been}} done on lower extremity and the other on the upper extremity. The effect of traction was assessed by H reflex amplitude. Different results have been achieved. The new method which has been used since 2000, {{the effect of}} cervical traction on the H reflex was carried out by measuring H reflex slope. In this experiment the effect of <b>manual</b> cervical <b>traction</b> has been studied on the H slope of the upper extremity. Now we have sought to extend this work by examining the effects of cervical traction with 3 kg force on the H slope of the lower extremity  Materials and Methods: This study was administered to sixteen healthy men with a mean age 23. 12 of years and SD= 2. 55. The parameters of H reflex were recorded before and after of cervical traction. All data were analyzed with SPSS (V: 11. 5).      Results: The results showed that, {{there were no significant differences}} between before and after the application of cervical traction in H reflex parameters, ratio of H max/M max amplitude and M slope. But H slope and ratio of H slope /M slope were increased significantly after the application of traction (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The present study showed that traction with 3 Kg force can increase motor neuron excitability of soleus muscle and this result is against the previous study. This could be due to the application of the new method (H slope), which is more precise...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{highlight}} {{research studies}} examining rehabilitation for hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), {{as well as}} the outcome measures used to assess treatment efficacy, published in 2013. DesignA systematic search was performed in Medline, CIHAHL and Embase databases from January to December 2013. The search was limited to 2013, human studies, and English. Rehabilitation intervention studies included were prospective controlled designs. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. First, individual articles were rated for quality. Second, articles were grouped based on outcome: OA disease markers, pain, physical function (self-reported, performance), and health. ResultsOf 503 titles reviewed, 36 studies were included. The outcome measures related to OA disease markers were organized into subthemes of anthropometrics, biomechanics and physiology. The quality of evidence was of moderate, high, and low quality for anthropometric, biomechanical and physiological measures respectively. These studies supported the use of diet for weight loss combined with exercise. Bodies of evidence that showed the efficacy of exercise and passive strategies (thermal/electrical modalities, <b>traction,</b> <b>manual</b> therapy) for reducing pain were of low and moderate quality respectively. The evidence supporting diet and exercise, physiotherapy, and passive strategies to improve physical function was of moderate quality. Evidence supporting exercise to improve psychological factors was of moderate quality. ConclusionsExercise combined with diet for weight loss should be the mainstays of rehabilitation for people with knee and hip OA to provide benefit to OA disease markers, pain, physical function, and health...|$|R
