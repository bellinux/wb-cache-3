500|$|The next {{development}} was {{the introduction of}} surface milling, which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year. Once an area had been drained, all vegetation {{was removed from the}} surface, and a thin layer of peat was removed by a mechanical harvester. It was stockpiled on the moors, and later loaded into wagons by a Hymec loader, to be bagged at the works. Most peat by this time was used for compost or in growbags. The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods, and the mesh-sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it. A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun, but by 1989, solid steel wagons were being fabricated, reusing the frames from the original wagons. All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990, with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards. Trains of the new wagons were much heavier, particularly when loaded with milled peat, and the existing locomotives were inadequate. Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives, and three machines were ordered from Schöma of Germany. Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990, and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991. Each consisted of a CHL-60G <b>master</b> <b>unit,</b> rated at [...] with a bonnet and cab, and a CHL-60T slave unit, looking more like a flat-bed truck, with a second hydraulic motor. They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced, with the four-axle arrangement ensuring that the axle loading was low enough for the existing track, and they were very popular with their operators. By the late 1990s, they were wearing out, and enquiries were made, with a view to purchasing replacements. Alan Keef designed a Bo-Bo locomotive for use on the moors, but the cost was too great, and the company rebuilt two of the Schoma locomotive and slave units. The work included replacing the original 5-cylinder engines with 6-cylinder models, improving the sanding gear and driver's seating arrangements, and fitting a more reliable air-conditioning system for the cab. Lack of funds prevented the third Schoma being upgraded. They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005, and on Hatfield Moors until 2006. They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased, and were still there in 2008.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{droop control}} {{strategy}} is only considered the frequency stability during the islanded operation mode of microgrid. So a cooperative control strategy based on two-layer hierarchical control structure is proposed in this paper. In islanded operation mode, Single master operation (SMO) or multi master operation (MMO) is decided by microgrid management system(MMS). When power changes during islanded operation, the <b>master</b> <b>unit(s)</b> with v/f control can balance the energy {{production and consumption}} quickly. Based on detecting instantaneous power of master unit(s),The secondary control of MMS sets renewed reference values of instantaneous power of slave unit(s) with PQ control. After that the output power of <b>master</b> <b>unit(s)</b> will return into zero. The simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed cooperative control strategy not only implements no-error frequency control and voltage stability control, but also provides enough spinning reserve margin for <b>master</b> <b>unit(s)</b> to keep the system energy balance all the time...|$|R

50|$|An {{industrial}} {{version of}} the Snow Trac was called a Trac Master, and later renamed a Snow Master. The Trac/Snow Master was equipped with a longer and wider track that made it more suitable for the deepest soft snow conditions. Optional hydraulic implements were available for the Trac/Snow Masters for grooming ski trails. Implements for grooming were capable of being mounted on both the front and {{the rear of the}} Snow Master and were powered by an auxiliary hydraulic pump that was an option on the Snow <b>Master</b> <b>units.</b> Shipping records show that Japan was a popular destination for Snow Masters and many are still in use by private owners in the northern regions of Japan. Snow Trac and Snow <b>Master</b> <b>units</b> were used during the Olympic Games Sapporo, Japan as trail groomers and for transportation.|$|R
2500|$|Occasionally, {{the second}} unit may have its {{prime-mover}} and traction alternator removed {{and replaced by}} concrete and/or steel ballast and the power for traction obtained from the <b>master</b> <b>unit.</b> As a 16-cylinder prime-mover generally weighs in the [...] range, and a [...] traction alternator generally weighs in the [...] range, this would mean that [...] would be needed for ballast.|$|E
2500|$|These {{products}} were technological breakthroughs. They were multi-user systems. Each workstation {{looked like a}} typical terminal, but contained its own Intel 8080 microprocessor (later versions used a Z80) and 64KB of RAM (comparable, but lower in power than the original IBM PC which came out in 1981). Disk storage was centralized in a <b>master</b> <b>unit</b> and shared by the workstations, and connection was via high-speed dual coaxial cable [...] "928 Link". Multiple OIS masters could be networked to each other, allowing file sharing among hundreds of users. The systems were user-friendly and fairly easy to administer, with the latter task often performed by office personnel, {{in an era when}} most machines required trained administrators.|$|E

5000|$|Submeters {{take many}} forms. For example, Central heating in {{apartment}} blocks in Belgium, Germany and Switzerland is sometimes submetered with liquid filled calibrated vials, known as heat cost allocators, attached {{to each of}} the heating radiators. The metering company visits the apartments about once a year and reads the liquid level and replaces the vials. Some apartment owners have replaced the vials with electronic submeters that transmit temperature readings via radio to a <b>master</b> <b>unit</b> in each apartment. The <b>master</b> <b>unit</b> in turn transmits collated readings to the utility company, thereby saving both labour costs and inconvenience to both tenant and landlord. The <b>master</b> <b>unit</b> displays a number representing the current total of [...] "heating value".|$|E
50|$|A {{group of}} devices are {{connected}} via Bluetooth technology {{in an ad}} hoc fashion. A piconet starts with two connected devices, and may grow to eight connected devices. Bluetooth communication always designates one of the Bluetooth devices as a main controlling unit or <b>master</b> <b>unit.</b> Other devices that follow the <b>master</b> <b>unit</b> are slave units. This allows the Bluetooth system to be non-contention based (no collisions). This means that after a Bluetooth device {{has been added to}} the piconet, each device is assigned a specific time period to transmit and they do not collide or overlap with other units operating within the same piconet.|$|E
50|$|At {{least two}} {{units of the}} same type will be powered up, {{receiving}} {{the same set of}} inputs, performing identical computations and producing identical outputs in a nearly-synchronous manner. The outputs are typically physical outputs (individual ON/OFF type digital signals, or analog signals), or serial data messages wrapped in suitable protocols depending upon the nature of their intended use. Outputs from only one unit (designated as the master or on-line unit, via application logic) are used to control external devices (such as switches, signals, on-board propulsion/braking control devices, etc.) or simply to provide displays. The other unit is a hot-standby or a hot spare unit, ready to take over if the <b>master</b> <b>unit</b> fails. When the <b>master</b> <b>unit</b> fails, an automatic failover to the hot spare occurs within a very short time and the outputs from the hot spare, now the <b>master</b> <b>unit,</b> are delivered to the controlled devices and displays. The controlled devices and displays may experience a short blip or disturbance during the failover time. However, they can be designed to tolerate/ignore the disturbances so that the overall system operation is not affected.|$|E
