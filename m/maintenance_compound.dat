50|$|The Orbost and {{district}} community started {{a project in}} 2002 to construct a live steam powered replica, albeit somewhat larger than the original to meet safety regulations and carry additional passengers for commercial reasons, the Paddle Steamer Curlip II {{with the assistance of}} grants from the Federal and Victorian State Governments. Construction was started in earnest by shipwright Bill Jones in August 2006, and with the assistance of roughly 200 volunteers (a core group of 10 performing the majority of the work), she was finally completed and launched on the Snowy River in late November 2008. The vessel is operated by a not for profit organisation, P S Curlip Inc, who offered regular cruises and private charters on the lower reaches of the river and its estuary, until 2015. Paddle Steamer Curlip had its survey status revoked in 2015-16 due to the inability of the management to provide regular slipping and <b>maintenance,</b> <b>compounded</b> by the infestation and attack by Teredo Navalis, the marine shipworm, that attached to and bored holes in the vessel's underwater hull.|$|R

40|$|Papillary thyroid cancers are {{the most}} common thyroid malignancy. They usually carry a {{favorable}} prognosis, although patients with invasive or metastatic tumors that no longer trap radioiodine do less well. There is mounting experimental support for a central role of mutations leading to constitutive activation of MAP kinase effectors in the pathogenesis of this disease. Thus activating mutations of the tyrosine receptor kinases RET and NTRK, and of the intracellular signaling effectors RAS and BRAF are present in a mutually exclusive fashion in more than 70 % of cases. These mutations are believed to arise at early stages of cancer development, and may be important in tumor <b>maintenance.</b> Hence, <b>compounds</b> that inhibit kinase activity of effectors signaling distally along this pathway may prove effective in treating advanced forms of the disease...|$|R
40|$|SummaryHigh-throughput {{screening}} (HTS) {{of chemical}} libraries {{has become a}} critical tool in basic biology and drug discovery. However, its implementation and the adaptation of high-content assays to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have been hampered by multiple technical challenges. Here we present a strategy to adapt hESCs to HTS conditions, resulting in an assay suitable for the discovery of small molecules that drive hESC self-renewal or differentiation. Use of this new assay {{has led to the}} identification of several marketed drugs and natural compounds promoting short-term hESC <b>maintenance</b> and <b>compounds</b> directing early lineage choice during differentiation. Global gene expression analysis upon drug treatment defines known and novel pathways correlated to hESC self-renewal and differentiation. Our results demonstrate feasibility of hESC-based HTS and enhance the repertoire of chemical compounds for manipulating hESC fate.

50|$|Ready-mix {{lightweight}} {{joint compound}} is a pre-made {{form of joint}} compound designed for fast application and easy <b>maintenance.</b> The <b>compound</b> is a complex combination often including water, limestone, expanded perlite, ethylene-vinyl acetate polymer, attapulgite, and other ingredients. The delicate mixture of compounds gives it a creamy texture that spreads easily onto drywall surfaces and then hardens as the moisture evaporates. Drying type compound {{takes a long time}} to dry out and is used to fill holes or gaps and shrinks as it drys, possibly producing cracks in thick applications. Ready-mix joint compound is usually more forgiving than the setting type of joint compound. It can be used for as long a period of time as needed, and does not dry up unless left unattended for a long period of time, but must be kept from freezing. This type of compounds should be used at temperatures above 55 F and all of the materials should be a similar temperature.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} presenting independently established discriminative stimuli in compound can substantially increase operant responding maintained by food reinforcement or shock avoidance. Recently, this phenomenon was also shown to occur with cocaine self-administration. The present study further assessed the generality of these stimulus-compounding effects by systematically replicating them with heroin self-administration. Rats' nose-poke responses produced intravenous heroin (0. 025 mg/kg per infusion) on a variable-ratio schedule when either a tone or a light was present. In the absence of these stimuli, responding was not reinforced. Once discriminative control by the tone and light had been established, the stimuli were presented in compound under extinction (with heroin discontinued) or maintenance conditions (with heroin available during test-stimulus presentations). In extinction, the tone-light compound increased responding approximately threefold compared to tone or light alone. Under <b>maintenance</b> conditions, <b>compounding</b> increased heroin intake approximately twofold. These effects closely matched those obtained earlier with cocaine. This consistency across pharmacological classes and across drug and nondrug reinforcers further confirms that (a) self-administered drugs support conditioning and learning {{in a manner similar}} to that supported by other reinforcers; and (b) multiple drug-related cues interact in lawful and predictable ways to affect drug seeking and consumption...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of minimizing thermal stresses over drying and <b>maintenance</b> of relevant <b>compounds,</b> selection of proper drying condition is necessary to maintain the quality of the processed fruit. The aim of this project is to study the effect of drying parameters i. e. temperature, air velocity and geometry on moisture content and papain enzyme activity of dried papaya. Slices (0. 5 x 1. 5 x 1. 5 cm) and cubes (1. 0 cm 3) of papaya were treated in tray drier at temperature (40, 50 and 60 Â°C) and air velocity (0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 m/s). Temperature was found to be significantly influencing the drying performance and quality retention for both slices and cubes. However, geometry was the most significant factor played as a controlling effect on moisture content, in which larger surface exposure helps temperature to take action strongly. Slices suffered higher water loss and enzyme degradation compared to cubes of papaya. Models obtained for moisture content and enzyme activity through response surface methodology were significant with R 2 = 0. 93 and 0. 80 respectively...|$|R
50|$|Following South Africa's {{withdrawal}} from the Commonwealth in 1961, its priorities shifted toward internal security and diversifying national arms procurement outside traditional suppliers such as the United Kingdom. To that end, 100 Centurion Mk 3s and 10 Centurion-based recovery vehicles were sold off to Switzerland in 1961. The remaining Centurions were largely relegated to reserve roles {{as a result of}} <b>maintenance</b> problems <b>compounded</b> by parts shortages and a tendency to overheat in the hot African climate. In 1972, the South African Army retrofitted some of its Centurions with the engines and transmission of American-made M48 Patton tanks in an attempt to improve technical performance. The upgraded Centurions were designated Skoikaan and proved unpopular due to their high fuel consumption and poor operating range.Tanks reentered the mainstream of South African military doctrine in 1975, following Operation Savannah, which saw the lightly armoured South African forces in Angola threatened by large formations of Soviet tanks supplied to the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and their Cuban allies. Operation Savannah was followed by further modifications and trials under Project Semel, and the South African government was obliged to finance {{the creation of a new}} private sector enterprise, the Olifant Manufacturing Company (OMC), to refurbish the Centurions. During this period South Africa managed to restore its tank fleet to its original size by purchasing a number of surplus Centurion hulls from Jordan and India. The passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 418, which imposed a mandatory arms embargo on the country, forced South Africa to purchase the hulls without turrets or armament. OMC upgraded each Centurion with a 29-litre Continental turbocharged diesel engine and a new transmission adopted from the M60 Patton. The refurbished Centurions were also armed with a South African variant of the Royal Ordnance L7 105mm main gun. They were accepted into service with the South African Armoured Corps as the Olifant Mk1A in 1985.|$|R
30|$|Microtubules play {{a crucial}} role in {{cellular}} processes such as cell motility, intracellular trafficking, cell division, and cell <b>maintenance.</b> Thus, current <b>compounds</b> targeting microtubules are being developed as cancer chemotherapeutic agents (Bollag et al. [1995]). The microtubule targeting compounds engage at the mitotic spindle checkpoint where they block cell cycle progression at mitosis ultimately leading to apoptosis (Bhat and Setaluri [2007]). Nevertheless, epothilones were originally described as natural product fungicidal macrolides (Hofle and Reichenbach [2005]). However, later studies revealed the microtubule polymerization property at submicromolar concentrations and soon their potency was verified to replace paclitaxel (Goodin et al. [2004]). Epothilone arrests cells at the mitotic G 2 /M transition phase (a rapid cell growth and protein synthesis period) at low nanomolar concentrations eventually leading to apoptosis during mitosis (Harle and Bechthold [2009]). Since the discovery of such cytotoxic potential bearing microtubule-stabilizing agents, total synthesis has been a challenge to most organic chemists (He et al. [2001]). The reason is an adequate supply of epothilones as healing agents for clinical studies. Similar class of microtubules stabilizing anticancer drugs such as discodermolide (ter Haar et al. [1996]), elutherobin (Long et al. [1998]), sarcodictyins A and B (Hamel et al. [1999]), and laulimalide (Mooberry et al. [1999]) have been reviewed by Karl-Heinz Altmann in [2001].|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cetuximab {{improves}} the overall survival {{of patients with}} squamous cell carcinoma {{of the head and}} neck (SCCHN), in combination either with radiation therapy or with chemotherapy. However, only a minority of patients seem to benefit from cetuximab. This paper will review the different strategies developed either to overcome epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resistance or to inhibit the other relevant activated molecular pathways. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent trials have investigated the possibility of including anti-EGFR therapies in the multimodal curative treatment of SCCHN in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, concomitant chemoradiation or as <b>maintenance</b> therapy. Second-generation <b>compounds</b> (pan-HER or dual EGFR/HER- 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors) have been designed in an attempt to overcome the postulated resistance to anti-EGFR treatments in SCCHN. Alternative targeted therapies have also been developed to inhibit the other activated molecular pathways. Some of these new treatments have shown either promising activity in preclinical models or interesting preliminary activity in early phase II trials. Phase III trials are now required to validate the findings. SUMMARY: Despite an aggressive multimodal approach, more than 50 % of patients with SCCHN will relapse. It is therefore essential that targeted agents continue to be evaluated in this disease in the hope of improving outcome...|$|R
40|$|Attempting {{to locate}} a {{malfunctioning}} wire in a complex bundle of wires or in a cable that is concealed behind a wall is as difficult as {{trying to find a}} needle in a haystack. The result of such an effort can also be costly, time-consuming, and frustrating, whether it is the tedious process of examining cable connections for the Space Shuttle or troubleshooting a cable television hookup. Furthermore, other <b>maintenance</b> restrictions can <b>compound</b> the effort required {{to locate a}}nd repair a particular wiring problem. For example, on the Space Shuttle, once a repair is completed, all systems that have a wire passing through any of the connectors that were disconnected during troubleshooting are affected and, therefore, must undergo retesting, an arduous task that is completely unrelated to the original problem. In an effort to streamline wire inspection and maintenance, two contractors supporting NASA's Kennedy Space Center invented the Standing Wave Reflectometer (SWR) in 1999. In doing so, they leveraged technology that was first developed to detect problems that could lead to aircraft accidents, such as the one that resulted in the catastrophic failure of TWA flight 800 in 1996. The SWR performs a non-intrusive inspection that verifies the condition of electrical power and signal-distribution systems inside the Space Shuttle orbiters. Such testing reduces processing delays and ensures safe operation of these systems...|$|R
40|$|Deafness affects about 250 million people, and {{genetics}} contributes to {{approximately half of}} the cases. Environmental influences include exposure to noise, ototoxic drugs, physical trauma, and systemic diseases, such as hypothyroidism. This thesis presents functional analysis of a Mendelian cause of human deafness, mutations in the unconventional myosin MYO 15, and a genetically complex disorder, susceptibility to hearing impairment due to hypothyroidism. Mutations in the motor or tail domain of MYO 15 cause congenital deafness and vestibular dysfunction. These domains are required for stereocilia elongation and WHIRLIN transport. Some isoforms of MYO 15 contain a proline-rich region of unknown function. We generated a mouse model of a human mutation that eliminates these isoforms. These mutants have profound deafness but lack severe vestibular abnormalities, and have unique cochlear stereocilia pathology. Initial elongation occurs but is not maintained, implicating the proline-rich region in hair bundle preservation. There is no evidence of allelic complementation for hearing or hair bundle <b>maintenance</b> in <b>compound</b> heterozygotes with different combinations of mutant alleles, proving functional importance of the full length MYO 15 isoform. Thyroid hormone (TH) has pleiotropic effects on cochlear development, and genomic variation influences the severity of the hearing problem. Prop 1 df and Pou 1 f 1 dw mutant mice lack pituitary thyrotropin, which causes severe TH deficiency and variable hearing impairments. DW-Pou 1 f 1 dw mutants have multiple cochlear abnormalities and are profoundly deaf. In contrast, DF-Prop 1 df mutants have mild hearing impairment and few permanent abnormalities. Transfer of these embryos to surrogates demonstrated that their susceptibility to hearing impairment is intrinsic to the fetus. A genome scan conducted on hearing progeny of an F 1 intercross between DW-Pou 1 f 1 dw carriers and Mus castaneus identified a single locus on chromosome 2, modifier of dw hearing, Mdwh, that rescues hearing despite persistent hypothyroidism. A known modifier in this region is neither necessary nor sufficient to rescue DW hearing, suggesting that Mdwh is a novel protective locus. Microarray analysis identified cochlear gene expression changes caused by hypothyroidism in Pou 1 f 1 dw mice that are positional candidates for the modifier gene. Identification of the protective modifier will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of hypothyroidism-induced hearing impairment and may lead to rational therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIncreases in the {{production}} of terpene-and phenolic-like compounds in plant species under abiotic stress conditions have been interpreted in physiological studies as a supplementary defense system due to their capacity to limit cell oxidation. From an ecological perspective however, these increases are only expected to confer competitive advantages if they do not imply a significant cost for the plant, that is, growth reduction. We investigated shifts of isoprene emissions, {{and to a lesser extent}} phenolic compound concentration, of Quercus pubescens Willd. from early leaf development to leaf senescence under optimal watering (control: C), mild and severe water stress (MS, SS). The impact of water stress was concomitantly assessed on plant physiological (chlorophyll fluorescence, stomatal conductance, net photosynthesis, water potential) functional (relative leaf water content, leaf mass per area ratio) and growth (aerial and root biomass) traits. Growth changes allowed to estimate the eventual costs related to {{the production}} of isoprene and phenolics. The total phenolic content was not modified under water stress whereas isoprene emissions were promoted under MS over the entire growing cycle despite the decline of P n by 35 %. Under SS, isoprene emissions remained similar to C all over the study despite the decline of Pn by 47 % and were thereby clearly uncoupled to Pn leading to an overestimation of the isoprene emission factor by 44 %. Under SS, maintenance of isoprene emissions and phenolic compound concentration resulted in very significant costs for the plants as growth rates were very significantly reduced. Under MS, increases of isoprene emission and <b>maintenance</b> of phenolic <b>compound</b> concentration resulted in moderate growth reduction. Hence, it is likely that investment in isoprene emissions confers Q. pubescens an important competitive advantage during moderate but not severe periods of water scarcity. Consequences of this response for air quality in North Mediterranean areas are also discussed...|$|R
