50|$|Nerve {{growth factor}} (50 ng/ml) induced {{functional}} differentiation in PC12 cells has been reported. The {{studies have been}} carried out showing mitochondria mediated apoptosis in PC12 cells exposed to <b>monocrotophos.</b> A significant induction in reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxides, and the ratio of glutathione disulfide/reduced glutathione was observed in cells exposed to selected doses of <b>monocrotophos.</b> Following the exposure of PC12 cells to <b>monocrotophos,</b> the levels of protein and mRNA expression of caspase-3, caspase-9, BAX, p53, p21, PUMA, and cytochrome-c were significantly upregulated, whereas the levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1 were downregulated. TUNEL assay, DNA laddering, and micronuclei induction show that long-term exposure of PC12 cells to <b>monocrotophos</b> at higher concentration (10−5 M) decreases the number of apoptotic events due to {{an increase in the number}} of necrotic cells. Monocrotophos-induced translocation of BAX and cytochrome-c proteins between the cytoplasm and mitochondria confirmed the role of <b>monocrotophos</b> in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria mediated apoptosis induction was confirmed by the increased activity of caspase cascade. These apoptotic changes could be correlated with elevated levels of expression of selected cytochrome P450s (CYP1A1/1A2, 2B1/2B2, 2E1) in PC12 cells exposed to <b>monocrotophos</b> (10−5 M).|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{insecticides}} <b>monocrotophos,</b> cypermethrin and their ready -made mixtures applied against {{sugar beet root}} weevil (B. punctiventris G e r m) adults at different temperatures were studied. The experiments were conducted in laboratory conditions at three different temperatures: 14, 20 and 25 °C. In 1996 and 1997, the adults used in experiments were collected in Bačka Topola fields with sugar beet as previous crop. The adults were exposed to insecticides by method of insecticide soaked blotting paper and fed with sugar beet cotyledons. The mortality of adults, depending on product was observed every half an hour, starting from 0. 5 up to 28 hrs of exposition. Applying probit analyses, ld-p and lt-p lines were constructed, which reflected the changes of toxity depending on insecticides and temperatures. According to position and slope (b) of ld-p lines in 1996, higher toxity of cypermethrin than of <b>monocrotophos</b> was found. The response was more homogeneous to cypermethrin than to <b>monocrotophos.</b> Ld-p lines for mixture run closer to ld-p line for cypermethrin independent of temperature. In 1997, at 14 °C and 25 °C, higher toxity of cypermethrin than of <b>monocrotophos</b> was observed, the effect of mixture was additive. No mortality was induced with <b>monocrotophos</b> at 20 °C. The reason could be in sugar beet root weevil population sensitivity decrease to <b>monocrotophos</b> in 1997, or the insects derived from two different populations exposed to different selection pressure (species, volume and exposition length to insecticides).
