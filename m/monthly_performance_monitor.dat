40|$|Objective To verify if in male elite junior {{soccer players}} a minimum 1 -month {{performance}} decrease {{is accompanied by}} a mood profile and hormone levels typical of non-functional over-reaching (NFOR). Design A prospective case-control study using a <b>monthly</b> <b>performance</b> <b>monitor</b> with a standardised field test to detect the performance changes. Players with a performance decrease lasting at least 1 month were compared with control players without a performance decrease on mood scores and pre-exercise and post-exercise levels of stress hormones. Setting Sporting field and sports medical laboratory. Participants Ninety-four young elite soccer players were monitored during the 2006 - 2008 seasons. Twenty-one players were invited to the laboratory, seven of whom showed a significant performance decrease. Main outcome measures Performance change over time, scores on the profile of mood states and premaximal and postmaximal exercise serum levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone (GH) and cortisol. Results Players with a performance decrease showed psychological and hormonal changes typical of the non-functional state of over-reaching. Scores were higher on depression and anger, whereas the resting GH levels and ACTH levels after maximal exercise were reduced. ACTH and GH were capable of classifying all but one player correctly as either NFOR or control. Conclusions Performance-related criteria in field tests are capable of identifying players with worsened mood and adaptations of the endocrine system that fit the definition of NFOR. Performance, mood and hormone levels may therefore be considered as valid instruments to diagnose NFOR in young elite soccer players...|$|E

The relative difference between the intervention and control groups based on the monthly difference in visit rates increased significantly in both level (+ 6. 5; 95 % CI = 1. 4, 11. 6) and trend (1. 0 % per month; 95 % CI = 0. 2, 1. 8) following the intervention for experienced patients attending the clinic within 3 days of their scheduled appointments. The decrease in the percentage of experienced patients with a medication gap greater than 14 days approached statistical significance (− 11. 3 %; 95 % CI = − 22. 7, 0. 1), and the change seemed to persist over 11 months after the intervention.

40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{is marked}} by impairments in social-emotional situations, executive functioning, and behavioral regulation. These symptoms {{may be related to}} deficits in <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring,</b> i. e., the ability to observe and evaluate one's own behavior and performance which is necessary for the regulation of future behavior. The present literature review investigated electroencephalic correlates of <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> in ASD. Event-related potentials (ERPs) considered in this review included internal <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> components (error-related negativity, error positivity), external <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> components (feedback-related negativity, feedback-P 3), and observational <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> components (observer error-related negativity, observer feedback-related negativity). The majority of studies point to reduced internal <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> in ASD. External <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> in reward-processing paradigms, where rewards are independent of performance, seems to be intact in ASD. So far, no studies have investigated the observer error-related negativity in ASD. Available data on the observer feedback-related negativity are inconclusive, since only two studies with differential study results investigated this construct in ASD. In general, results suggest that individuals with ASD have problems with internal <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> and with learning from external, abstract feedback. In contrast, the processing of external, concrete feedback seems to be largely intact in ASD...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Public and Development Management)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Governance, 2014. Theoretical models link {{organizational}} {{learning and}} <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Organizations with strong <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems and structures {{which are used}} in organizational learning are able to achieve improved performance, adaptability, and sustainability. This is of particular importance to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which are in a resource competitive, and donor-driven environment. However, few published cases have presented practical examples {{of the use of}} <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> for organizational learning. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess how <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> was used by staff for organizational learning at Building Local Capacity for Delivery of HIV Services in Southern Africa (BLC), a Management Sciences for Health (MSH) project in South Africa. A case study approach was selected. The methodology included open-ended interviews with seven staff members in the project, and document and data review. The documents reviewed included the project monitoring and evaluation framework, MSH-South Africa strategic plan, MSH-South Africa learning plan, and the results of an organization learning assessment conducted in 2012. Themes and sub-themes were identified and used to conduct directed content analysis using Atlas Ti Software. The key findings of the study were:  <b>Performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> and organization learning is valued by Management Sciences for Health. It is included explicitly as part of country strategic road maps, and projects are supported to develop <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> plans and organizational learning plans.  The MSH-BLC project has strong systems and structures for <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and novel plans for organizational learning. However, these are donor-focused and Staff felt they have limited scope to influence and review them.  The Staff felt that there is multiple <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> practices but few of them use these for learning purposes. A learning plan was developed to J. Govender – MM PDM Research Report 2014 4 improve this, and there is an ongoing restructuring process to enhance information sharing across the project.  Staff felt that they have limited opportunities and the culture does not permit them to critique <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> information, make mistakes, or allow for space to review and think about performance information.  Staff had varied levels of <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> and learning capacity. In conclusion, the current project culture and utilisation of <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> presents opportunities for learning, but are not used optimally. Recommendations made are to adapt the <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> plan, strengthen implementation of current systems through leadership, and establish measures to encourage review and reflection on performance information. Additional research is recommended in the areas of: evaluative thinking and its use in organizational sustainability; determinants of organizational learning in NGO sector; assessing whether learning translates to individual and organizational success; and a review on the success rate of organizations that have <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> and organizational learning systems...|$|R

This paper will discuss {{the application of a}} <b>Performance</b> <b>Monitor</b> in a unit operation where the objective of optimization against constraints is the job of an MPC controller. The responsibility of the <b>Performance</b> <b>Monitor</b> is to keep the regulatory loops optimized so the MPC controller can do its job of optimization against the constraints. It was decided by the plant that prior to installation of the MPC controller, the loop <b>performance</b> <b>monitoring</b> system should be installed. This would allow for all loops to be optimized and performing with the best response possible so that subsequent step testing and modeling for the MPC controller would be as accurate as possible. <b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>MONITOR</b> FUNCTIONS The purpose of the <b>performance</b> <b>monitor</b> is to keep the plant optimized by identifying areas that could be improved and providing the advanced tools to further diagnose and optimize those areas.
