500|$|A {{second test}} on 19 July was a partial success, with the Zeus passing within [...] of the target. The control system {{ran out of}} {{hydraulic}} fluid during the last 10 seconds of the approach, causing the large <b>miss</b> <b>distance,</b> but the test was otherwise successful. The guidance program was updated to stop the rapid control cycling {{that led to the}} fluid running out. A third attempt on 12 December successfully brought the missile to very close distances, but the second missile of the planned two missile salvo failed to launch due to an instrument problem.

2500|$|The LS-85 radar using [...] day/night shift {{crews of}} 5 men each became {{operational}} on November 1, 1967; and trial missions of Commando Club by Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs {{were led by}} Col. John C. Giraudo (355th Fighter Wing commander). [...] F-105 Commando Club missions included the November 15, 1967, 357th Tactical Fighter Squadron bombing of Yên Bái Air Base in Route Package 5 ("no BDA possible") and the defeated November 18 raid of 16 F-105s of the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing—preceded by 4 F-105 Wild Weasels—on Phúc Yên Air Base (JCS Target 6). [...] The latter mission's loss of 2 Wild Weasels to MiGs and then some of the bombers to SAM sites that tracked the USAF jamming resulted in temporary suspension of Commando Club until electronic countermeasures were improved. [...] Through November 16, LS-85 had effected a direct hit (zero <b>miss</b> <b>distance)</b> {{as well as a}} [...] miss: the Commando Club CEP for [...] "14 runs was 867 feet" [...] while other Skyspot sites for 1967 missions averaged [...] error at ranges ≤. [...] LS-85 accuracy was improved during the suspension period, another UHF radio was added at the summit, and the radio relay's secondary task of surveilling for MiGs was eliminated.|$|E
30|$|Simulation {{study on}} the {{proposed}} approach demonstrated that the tolerance to <b>missing</b> pairwise <b>distance</b> is {{in the region of}} 8 % to 30 % depending on the number of nodes in the cluster and the pattern of <b>missing</b> <b>distances.</b> In cases where the <b>missing</b> pairwise <b>distances</b> are the largest distances, the tolerance is lower compared to randomly <b>missing</b> pairwise <b>distances.</b> This is because the higher loss of pairwise distances at the furthest nodes leads to failure to resolve their positions.|$|R
30|$|It can be {{observed}} that the results are comparable with the prediction from the simulation study. The error performance is dominated by external factors such as varying wind conditions {{and the presence of}} bursty noise associated with the traffic. Therefore, the error performances of both the RandInit and MDSInit approaches are almost identical. Where the <b>missing</b> <b>distances</b> are set with largest distances, the tolerance to the level of <b>missing</b> <b>distances</b> is significantly lower as the error from the furthest node increases the average error.|$|R

50|$|A {{government}} investigation {{revealed that}} the failed intercept at Dhahran had been caused by a software error in the system's handling of timestamps. The Patriot missile battery at Dhahran had been in operation for 100 hours, by which time the system's internal clock had drifted by one-third of a second.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{application}} of massively parallel processors to multiple satellite propagation and the calculation of <b>miss</b> <b>distances</b> between objects (COMBO). Unlike serial computations, we do not pre-filter the data but rather sort the data set {{in a way that}} dramatically cuts the number of comparisons required in order to be assured of a complete catalog-to-catalog comparison. The same general algorithm allows two logical sets to be compare to each other. Run time for this demonstration code on an 8 K Connection Machine is about one second per time step, including propagation, complete catalog-to-catalog calculation of <b>miss</b> <b>distances,</b> plotting satellite positions, and recording of the <b>miss</b> <b>distances</b> to a file. Propagation of the objects is performed with an analytic propagator, using J 2 only at present, though the code may easily be extended to other propagators. We demonstrate a second application of parallel computing to the problem of debris propagation resulting from a satellite breakup. The spread of such debris into n pieces is simulated by replicating the element set for the original satellite n times, then altering each to represent a distribution of velocities to the center of mass...|$|R

50|$|Because {{the damage}} effects of {{explosive}} weapons decrease with distance {{due to an}} inverse cube law, even modest improvements in accuracy (hence reduction in <b>miss</b> <b>distance)</b> enable a target to be attacked with fewer or smaller bombs.

50|$|The {{test was}} {{conducted}} by the Northern Fleet. A R-13 missile with a thermonuclear warhead was fired from submarine K-102. When the submarine reached the specified point in the Barents Sea, she could not establish her position due to cloudiness and snowfall. A R-13 missile without a nuclear warhead was fired first, which missed the aiming point by a wide margin. However, {{it was decided to}} continue the test in spite of bad weather. The second missile performed better and its <b>miss</b> <b>distance</b> was less than the previous one, and detonated at 1000 meters height, yielding 1.45 megatons.|$|E
5000|$|Third, {{there is}} a manual [...] "man-in-the-loop" [...] {{guidance}} option, in which the WSO looks at a backseat TV display {{in order to see}} the seeker's view (sent to him through a RF command guidance datalink) and uses the backseat stick to control the bomb {{all the way to the}} target. With a skilled WSO that has a [...] "sensitive hand", this guidance method is probably the most accurate one employed today for air-dropped munitions, and has no measurable <b>miss</b> <b>distance.</b> Its main drawback is that it allows for only one bomb to be guided at a time.|$|E
50|$|Accurate AOA {{is further}} {{important}} where the platform should preferably maneuver when dispensing decoys {{to increase the}} <b>miss</b> <b>distance.</b> This is however more applicable to fast jets where their high speed tends to negate the separation caused by the decoy's ejection velocity. A turn towards approaching missiles to establish/increase the angle between the decoy and the platform is especially important in cases where a missile approaches from the rear between the five or seven 'o clock sectors.

50|$|Spartan interceptions {{were under}} {{control of the}} ACC. Data from the PARs in its area was {{forwarded}} to the ACC, where tracking information was developed {{over a period of}} several seconds. The most appropriate launch site within the network was then selected, and launch commands sent to that MDC. The MDC then tracked the Spartan on its MSR while the ACC sent updated information from the PAR. In some cases the MSR would also be used to develop tracking information on the targets, especially in the last stages of the interception where it would be used to reduce the <b>miss</b> <b>distance.</b> For Sprint operations, the ACC's PAR data was used to cue the MSR onto the target, and the MSC would then complete the interception on its own.|$|E
50|$|Drones {{are capable}} of being {{recovered}} following a training exercise. A parachute is deployed by remote control or if the remote control link is severed and a flotation kit can be added for sea-based recovery. If recovery of the drone is required, special telemetry warheads are used on the defensive missile in place of explosives. This telemetry warhead is desirable since it allows for extensive analysis {{of the performance of}} the defensive missile, including <b>miss</b> <b>distance</b> information that determines if a real warhead would have damaged the target. A direct hit would likely destroy the drone. Gunnery systems would use non-explosive dummy munitions. Since gunnery systems are aimed in front of a moving target so it will fly through the blast-fragments, dummy munitions do not have to directly hit a target. Analysis of radar data would determine if actual explosive munitions would have damaged the target drone.|$|E
3000|$|An {{experimental}} study of sensor self-localization in the free-space outdoor environment was conducted using acoustic ranging by Kwon et al. in [34]. In addressing the issue of <b>missing</b> and noisy <b>distance</b> measurements, a weighting function that was coupled with a soft constraint of minimum distances were introduced. The key difference in their approach is in that a gradient descent algorithm was applied {{in the process of}} minimization, and that a multiple restart scheme was used to avoid local minima. Separately, an alternative method of addressing <b>missing</b> <b>distances</b> within a 3 D environment was studied by Birchfield [35], which iteratively uses a subset of points (up to 4 for 3 D) with the highest availability of distance measurements to derive an estimate of local coordinates, until all the coordinates based on relative distances are obtained.

30|$|Each data-point of the {{simulation}} results is obtained by averaging over 10 random geometrical configurations. This {{relatively small number}} of random trials contributed to the non-smoothness in the data, but this sufficiently illustrates the trend of relationship between the parameters. Figure 3 shows the result under ideal measurement conditions, while Figure 4 shows the result where the distances are corrupted with Gaussian noise of zero mean and 5 [*]m standard deviation. Both the MDSInit and RandInit approaches are shown to have comparable minimization performance in terms of error from the actual distances, while the MDSInit approach has a lower tolerance to incomplete pairwise distances. Where the distances are corrupted by Gaussian noise (Figure 4 (a)), the error performance is dominated by the noise, demonstrating that the error performance is very similar in both approaches. The spikes in the error charts are due to a node's coordinate being resolved inaccurately, hence biasing the average error. As the missing pairwise measurements are those with the furthest distances, this occurred in the random arrangements where a single node was located much further away {{than the rest of the}} nodes, hence sharing most of the <b>missing</b> <b>distances.</b> This is verified by the results in Figure 5 obtained using ideal distance measurements, but with <b>distances</b> set to <b>missing</b> in a random manner as opposed to the largest <b>distances.</b> When <b>missing</b> <b>distances</b> are set as missing in a random manner, there is a smaller probability that any one node would suffer a much higher loss of measurements, hence the higher missing pairwise tolerances in both the approaches.|$|R
