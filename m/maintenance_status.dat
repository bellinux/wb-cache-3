5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, it was {{proposed}} in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re-equipped with 4-inch guns but post-war defence cuts meant that this plan was abandoned. Instead, the fort was reduced to care and <b>maintenance</b> <b>status</b> and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930. The continuing development of artillery firepower meant that the forts and batteries further downriver took on an increased responsibility for the forward defences of the Thames. The forts on Gravesend Reach were relegated to a second line of defence.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{assessments}} of Belfasts damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct {{damage to the}} outer hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms, {{the shock of the}} explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing the keel to hog (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and <b>Maintenance</b> <b>status,</b> becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.|$|E

She was at Salonika in January and February. Prince George left the Mediterranean at the end of February and paid off at Chatham Dockyard in March to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels.

5|$|The {{converted}} Victorious {{was commissioned}} as a repair ship on 22 February 1916 {{and arrived at}} Scapa Flow to replace the converted merchant ship Caribbean, which had been lost in September 1915, as repair ship for the Grand Fleet. Victorious performed this role there until March 1920 when she was renamed Indus II and transferred to Devonport for a refit to prepare her for service with the Indus Establishment. She arrived at Devonport on 28 March 1920 and paid off into a care and <b>maintenance</b> <b>status</b> while she awaited {{the beginning of her}} refit. Plans for the refit, however, were cancelled; work began to convert her into a harbor depot ship but, in April 1922, that conversion was cancelled before it could be completed and she was placed on the disposal list that month. Indus II was sold for scrapping on 19 December 1922, but the sale was cancelled on 1 March 1923. She was again sold on 9 April 1923 and was towed from Devonport to Dover to be scrapped.|$|E

40|$|In {{an age of}} globalised manufacturing, Big Data can be {{harnessed}} {{to improve}} decision making in the maintenance of products. The manufacturing sector is plagued with outdated legacy systems and data. Some manufacturers are using predictive-maintenance and condition-monitoring analytics on their assets to keep operations “up and running” by identifying problems before they occur. However, Big Data is a virtually untapped asset for the Power Generation Industry. A lot of data related to product manufacturing and services in this sector has been collected for years, but have not been analysed and used.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{rational}} educational decisions assumes that parental resources {{as well as}} <b>status</b> <b>maintenance</b> motives are relevant for educational decisions. A large body of previous research examines these mechanisms for standard educational decisions at the conventional transition points. There is reason to assume, however, that the same decision parameters affect non-standard educational transitions as well. Secondary education in the Netherlands is divided into four hierarchical tracks and students are allocated {{to one of these}} tracks at the age of 12 years. In the Dutch educational system upward and downward intra-secondary transitions between the different tracks are possible during secondary education. The analyses of this article show that upward mobility to a large extent is driven by <b>status</b> <b>maintenance</b> motives but that downward track mobility is not influenced by parental background when initial track placement is taken into account. While effects of parental resources decrease, the <b>status</b> <b>maintenance</b> motive does not change in relevance over time. ...|$|R
500|$|The {{authors of}} the Library of Congress Country Study on Zaire commented in 1992-93 that: [...] "The <b>maintenance</b> <b>status</b> of {{equipment}} in the inventory has traditionally varied, depending on a unit's priority and {{the presence or absence}} of foreign advisers and technicians. A considerable portion of military equipment is not operational, primarily as a result of shortages of spare parts, poor maintenance, and theft. For example, the tanks of the 1st Armored Brigade often have a nonoperational rate approaching 70 to 80 percent. After a visit by a Chinese technical team in 1985, most of the tanks operated, but such an improved status generally has not lasted long beyond the departure of the visiting team. Several factors complicate maintenance in Zairian units. Maintenance personnel often lack the training necessary to maintain modern military equipment. Moreover, the wide variety of military equipment and the staggering array of spare parts necessary to maintain it not only clog the logistic network but also are expensive.|$|E

40|$|Several {{theoretical}} approaches {{assume that}} the motive for <b>status</b> <b>maintenance,</b> that is the desire to avoid intergenerational status downward mobility, explains educational decisions and effects of the families’ social status hereon. Not much is known about whether this assumption is empirically valid, and it is completely an open question which of the parents’ social status provides the reference point when evaluating educational options {{with respect to their}} suitability for <b>status</b> <b>maintenance.</b> We utilize data from the Mannheim Educational Panel Study to test whether the beliefs about how likely secondary school degrees ensure the maintenance of the mothers’ and fathers’ status explain the decision between school tracks leading to these degrees in Germany. We compare the explanatory power of altogether nine measures, assuming the reference status to be determined by different models about how the families’ status is mentally represented. Results have shown that the motive for <b>status</b> <b>maintenance</b> exerts in all versions significant effects on educational decisions. However, it proved to be strongest when the fathers’ status was assumed to define success in avoiding intergenerational status demotion. After controlling for the effect of this measure, direct effects of the families’ educational and occupational status were substantially reduced, but not completely explained. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology, Washington State UniversityThe {{process of}} {{transitioning}} from prison {{to the community}} poses unique challenges {{for those who have}} been convicted of sexually-based offenses. Due to the realities associated with the unique challenges facing these individuals, the community supervision process fluctuates along the correctional care continuum. The five focal concerns - Social Reintegration, Community Reentry, <b>Status</b> <b>Maintenance,</b> Statutory Compliance, and Risk Management - identified and subsequently studied by the current study represent checkpoints along the correctional care continuum. By examining the chronological field notes (chronos) composed by CCOs, the current study shows that community corrections officers most frequently note issues related to those focal concerns at the control end of the correctional care continuum [...] Risk Management and <b>Status</b> <b>Maintenance.</b> The qualitative findings suggest that CCOs routinely note the concrete aspects of the supervision process such as housing or condition enforcement, while abstract realities such as relationships or social anxiety are noted less frequently. The frequency at which CCOs note or record these issues in the chronos is significantly related to correctional outcomes [...] technical violations and new convictions. Specifically, increases in the number of chrono entries addressing Community Reentry, <b>Status</b> <b>Maintenance,</b> and Risk Management are significantly linked to increases in technical violations, while increases in the number of chrono entries related to <b>Status</b> <b>Maintenance</b> is significantly related to an increased likelihood of recidivism. Overall, the current study shows that all five focal concerns are included in some way in the community supervision process, that control-oriented focal concerns are prioritized, and that prioritizing, or more frequently noting, specific focal concerns is significantly linked to correctional outcomes.
