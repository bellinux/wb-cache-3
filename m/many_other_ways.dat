5|$|Tubman {{was celebrated}} in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> {{throughout}} {{the nation in the}} 20th century. Dozens of schools were named in her honor, and both the Harriet Tubman Home in Auburn and the Harriet Tubman Museum in Cambridge serve as monuments to her life. In 1937 the gravestone for Harriet Tubman Davis was erected by the Empire State Federation of Women's Clubs; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. In 1944, the United States Maritime Commission launched the SS Harriet Tubman, its first Liberty ship ever named for a black woman. In 1978, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp in honor of Tubman which made her the first African-American woman to be honored on a US Postage stamp. In March 2013, President Barack Obama signed a proclamation creating Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument on the Eastern Shore.|$|E
5|$|Jainism {{is perhaps}} the only {{religion}} {{in the world that}} requires all its adherents to follow a strict vegetarian diet. Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use. Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.|$|E

25|$|The {{technological}} advances opened up <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> of advertising that competed with the chindon'ya. Since 1910 {{they had to}} compete with newspapers. Around 1920 balloons and airplanes carried large banners through the air, and around that time neon signs appeared in Tokyo. With the appearance of sound film in Japan in 1929 about 3000 street advertisers in Japan lost their jobs. A strike in 1930 had no effect and did not improve the situation. In response to the economic environment, the groups reduced their size to 4 to 5 people, and became known as chindon'ya. For many {{this was the last}} step before unemployment and poverty, and hence the chindon'ya were considered to be of very low social status. The great depression in 1930 reduced the chindon'ya in Japan even more, and during World War II street performances were forbidden altogether.|$|E
25|$|The {{civil war}} {{years of the}} Anarchy have been {{occasionally}} used in historical fiction. Stephen, Matilda and their supporters feature in Ellis Peters's historical detective series about Brother Cadfael, set between 1137 and 1145. Peters's depiction {{of the civil war}} is an essentially local narrative, focused on the town of Shrewsbury and its environs. Peters paints Stephen as a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler, despite his execution of the Shrewsbury defenders after taking the town in 1138. In contrast, Ken Follett's historical novel The Pillars of the Earth and the TV mini-series based on it depict Stephen as a conniving villain. Although Follett begins his book with Austin Poole's account of the White Ships sinking to set the historical scene for the subsequent events, in <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> Follett uses the war as a location for a story about essentially modern personalities and issues, a feature reproduced in the epic costume TV adaptation.|$|E

Live strigoi were described as living witches with two hearts or souls, sometimes both. Strigoi {{were said to have}} the ability to send out their souls at night to meet with other strigoi and consume the blood of livestock and neighbours. Similarly, dead strigoi were described as reanimated corpses that also sucked blood and attacked their living family. Live strigoi became revenants after their death, but there were also <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> of a person becoming a vampire. A person born with a caul, an extra nipple, a tail, or extra hair was doomed to become a vampire. The same fate applied to the seventh child in any family if all of his or her previous siblings were of the same sex, as well as someone born too early or someone whose mother had encountered a black cat crossing her path. If a pregnant woman did not eat salt or was looked upon by a vampire or a witch, her child would also become a vampire. So too would a child born out of wedlock. Others who were at risk of becoming vampires were those who died an unnatural death or before baptism. Finally, a person with red hair and blue eyes was seen as a potential strigoi.|$|E
