The {{degradation}} of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} in sludge in aerobic fermentation process is affected by many factors, and the pile body pH value {{is one of the}} important factors. Through the test of <b>mixing</b> <b>lime</b> pile body regulating pH value (7. 7, 8. 2, 9), the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation effect was researched under the different pH conditions and the same of the other aerobic fermentation conditions. The results showed that, pH= 7. 7 test device (not <b>mixing</b> <b>lime)</b> on PAHs degradation effect was best, worst was the pH= 8. 2 test device, the sludge {{degradation of}} the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons effect is negative effect...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This {{study is}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of lime as a modifier and also a replacement of stone filler in the road paving asphalt concrete mixtures. The control optimum Asphaltic Concrete (AC) <b>mix</b> without <b>lime</b> and the modified AC <b>mixes</b> with <b>lime</b> in varying percentage as substitute to crushed stone filler by the same amount in the mineral aggregate were prepared in laboratory for fabrication of the test specimens. Design asphalt content was obtained 5. 8 % from Marshall Method of mix design. The same asphalt content was used for AC control mix and modified AC <b>mixes</b> with <b>lime</b> in 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, 2. 0 % and 2. 5 % for preparation of test specimens. Marshall Stability and Indirect tensile strength tests were conducted on unconditioned and conditioned test specimens of AC <b>Mix</b> without <b>lime</b> and modified AC <b>mixes</b> with <b>lime</b> for evaluation of loss of stability and Tensile Strength Ratio. The results obtained from modified AC <b>mixes</b> with <b>lime</b> shows a reduction in loss of stability and increase in tensile strength ratio. The increase in tensile strength ratio was found 3. 3 %, 5. 3 %, 6. 5 % and 8. 1 % and loss of stability are 14. 8 %, 28. 1 %, 45. 0 % and 51. 5 % against the addition of 1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, 2. 0 % and 2. 5 % lime respectively in modified AC mixes. The tensile strength ratio and loss of stability are the parameters for assessing the effect of water susceptibility of AC mixes. Results of this study shows that the addition of lime up to 2. 5 % in AC mixes produced with Bolaganj stone aggregate increased the resistance to adverse effect of water...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of using hedmanite (rockwool natural fibers) as filler in improving the performance of asphalt concrete pavements, and to compare hedmanite with lime (as filler) modified mixes and the conventional asphalt mix containing crushed stone filler. In this study, optimum asphalt content was obtained by Marshall method and was used in all the modified mixes. The engineering properties, including resilient modulus, stability loss, split tensile strength, fatigue and permanent deformation, were determined. Results indicated that certain percentages of both hedmanite and lime are effective in improving the resilient modulus, while the Marshall stability loss and tensile strength loss were higher in hedmanite <b>mixes</b> than in <b>lime</b> <b>mixes.</b> <b>Lime</b> modified <b>mixes</b> showed better resistance to fatigue and rutting than hedmanite modified mixes.

Experiments were made <b>mixing</b> <b>lime</b> with other materials to provide a hydraulic mortar, but there was still no equivalent of the Roman concrete.
