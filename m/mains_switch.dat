5000|$|Special [...] "octal" [...] {{connectors}} {{with either}} 8 or 11 pins, {{almost identical to}} octal relay sockets or tube sockets, were used to connect power supplies to some tube audio amplifiers, transmitters and tranceivers (especially in amateur radio models). Female sockets were installed on the power supply and male sockets (with exposed pins) on the radio equipment. Cable assemblies with mating connectors were also readily available. These connections transferred anode positive voltage (typically 600 VDC for Heathkit, 800 VDC for Collins), grid negative bias (-130 VDC), 6.3 and 12.6 VAC for heaters (filaments), and control functions (remote <b>mains</b> <b>switching).</b>|$|R

50|$|The Ancient Lights {{create a}} portal {{through to the}} theatre. Martin reveals that Luke's theory on the Ancient Lights is true. Martin insinuates that in the old universe, they used to control all lifeforms. The Ancient Lights survived the Big Bang and needed Martin Trueman to rule the world because, he was the 'Chosen One'. Sarah Jane tries {{to talk him out}} of it but to no avail. Rani and Luke try to shut down the {{broadcast}} by flicking the <b>mains</b> <b>switch</b> off, but it is protected by the Ancient Lights' energy. Rani is an Aries and eventually becomes possessed, leaving only people with the star-sign of Taurus, which includes Sarah Jane and Clyde, not under Trueman's control. However Luke, who was not born and so does not have a star-sign, realises he can stop the power of the Ancient Lights by breaking Trueman's circle. Realising that he has been beaten, Trueman cannot bear to return to his former life and instead chooses to become one with the stars, disappearing in a trail of golden dust. In the aftermath, the unaware Earth authorities begin a search for Trueman, and Sarah Jane declares the date will be Luke's equivalent to a birthday.|$|E

He {{most likely}} {{came into contact}} with a metal ceiling batten which was floating at main's voltage due to contact with live electrical wiring. The wiring had been unusually placed during construction of the building, and subsequently a screw used to attach fibreboard to the batten had penetrated its sheath, creating a dangerous hazard for anyone entering the roof space with the <b>mains</b> power <b>switched</b> on. Barnes had no specific safety training, with his employer believing that his previous experience as an apprentice carpenter was adequate.|$|R

40|$|Energy {{fraud is}} when the {{consumer}} deliberately tries to deceive the utility. A common practice is to tamper with the meter so that a lower reading of power use is shown than is the case. This paper develops an automated energy fraud detection scheme for power utilities. In the scheme, when the <b>mains</b> is <b>switched</b> ON, input and output signals are compared to check for any discrepancies. When no discrepancy is recorded, a green LED will be ON until a discrepancy occurs. When a discrepancy is recorded, a red LED at the substation turns ON to notify the operator after which the consumer data will recorded. The nearest substation is then notified after all the data have been taken and the mains are turned OFF. The scheme saves {{time as well as}} helping to maximize profit margin for power utilities working in electrical distribution network. The scheme also assists utility companies to keep a constant eye on its customers...|$|R

The proposed topology, based on the half-bridge series resonant inverter, uses only two diodes to rectify the <b>mains</b> voltage. The <b>switch</b> operates in soft commutation mode {{and serves as a}} high frequency generator. switch-off transitions. Moreover, this topology doubles the output voltage, and therefore, the current in the load is reduced for the same output power. As a consequence, the converter efficiency is significantly improved.

40|$|Abstract: {{with the}} rapid {{progress}} of the Internet of Things (IoT) home automation has acquired more people&# 039;s attention. The IoT push has reduced the costs and power requirements of devices which means that Wi-Fi based home automation will become more attractive. However, current home automation systems have several drawbacks including high cost, not being of a Do It Yourself (DIY) nature, and there is currently no safe way for a simple IoT device to join a LAN without the addition of extra user interface hardware. The simplest IoT devices, for example a <b>mains</b> power <b>switch,</b> could contain just a cheap Wi-Fi interface and very limited computing capability. Such devices are already available for under US 23 but are not usable in the IoT context as they lack the ability to join a Wi-Fi network in a secure DIY manner. This paper describes a novel three stage network joining protocol which allows such IoT devices to securely join a Wi-Fi network even if they completely lack a user interface. The protocol is implemented using a WPA 2 based LAN, an Android phone and a Raspberry Pi which represents an IoT device lacking any form of keyboard and display. The method allows cost reductions for simple IoT devices and is suitable for immediate adoption by manufacturers of IoT devices...|$|R
40|$|Electronic and {{electrical}} appliances used in most {{homes in the}} country are designed to operate at a nominal 230 V AC, which ought to be acceptable within certain tolerable upper and lower limits. Excessive fluctuations beyond these limits may cause the appliance to malfunction or get irreparably damaged. Most protective devices are imported as well as expensive. The circuit presented is a relatively cheap automatic <b>mains</b> voltage <b>switch</b> (AVS) protector that senses undesirable and harmful fluctuations in mains voltages and disconnects the appliance whenever the mains voltage supply goes above or below pre-settable and safe tolerable limits or ‘window’. The appliance is automatically reconnected when mains power returns to normal within that ‘window’. The design features anti-surge protection, a transformerless power supply for the circuitry, a window comparator for the detection of low and excessively high mains voltages to the load and a switching relay capable of switching high currents, ideal for compressor-based appliances. A delay section for control of spurious low voltage drops as well as mains stability is incorporated. The design provides a safe operating voltage range of 180 V to 250 V and offers practically the same functions as those of the imported brands. Basically, the design consists of various circuit building blocks and circuit techniques that would be of interest to the electronic hobbyist...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{advances}} in electronics and communication technology have {{given rise to}} the development of several home automation technologies and systems. Current home automation systems have several drawbacks including high cost, not being of a Do It Yourself (DIY) nature, and there is currently no safe way for a simple Internet of Things (IoT) device to join a Local Area Network (LAN) without the addition of extra user interface hardware. The simplest IoT devices, for example a <b>mains</b> power <b>switch,</b> could contain just a cheap Wi-Fi interface and very limited computing capability. Such devices are already available for under US $ 4 but are not usable in the IoT context as they lack the ability to join a Wi-Fi network in a secure DIY manner. The ability to securely join IoT Devices to Wi-Fi networks is an on-going area of research. This thesis describes a novel three-stage network joining protocol, which that allows IoT devices to securely join a Wi-Fi network even if they completely lack a user interface. This protocol can eliminate a central controller for a home automation system and allow users to purchase off the shelf devices from a range of manufactures and control them by a PC or mobile device in a very simple manner. This new method will significantly reduce costs as the system and does not require expert configuration or a central controller. This in turn may help revitalize the home automation industry, which has not seen great penetration into suburban homes. The protocol is implemented using a WPA 2 based LAN, an Android phone and a Raspberry Pi which represents an IoT device lacking any form of keyboard and display. The method allows cost reductions for simple IoT devices and is suitable for immediate adoption by manufacturers of IoT devices...|$|R
50|$|Where the {{operating}} conditions {{do not require}} otherwise, the pulse group operation is recommended. Here, whole mains voltage shafts are switched to the load or blocked. For example, a controller requires 60% output (via a 4-20 mA signal, which corresponds to 0-100%). The thyristor power controller switches 60% of the solid waves to the load while blocking 40%. The operating mode is {{to be regarded as}} unproblematic. Only {{in the case of a}} too weakly designed network, it is possible for illuminating installations which are connected to the same network to have undesired luminance fluctuations (flicker effect).Some operating conditions require switching in each half-wave and thus very fast operation. Examples are control sections with very fast behavior or a required current limitation with low element resistance in the cold state. In this operating mode, the controller changes the phase angle α of the thyristor ignition timing. A half wave corresponds to 180 ° el. (electrical degree). The actuator can adjust the phase angle of 0 ° el. (maximum power) up to 180 ° el. (no power). In a 50 Hz <b>mains</b> the controller <b>switches</b> every 20 ms and shows very fast behavior. As a result of the voltage flanks during switch-on, disadvantages such as EMC interference potential or control voltage output also result in ohmic loads. This situation must be counteracted by means of line filters or the corresponding plant size with compensating systems.|$|R
