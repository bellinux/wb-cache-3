25|$|Acid gases: {{carbon dioxide}} (CO2), {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H2S) and mercaptans such as <b>methanethiol</b> (CH3SH) and ethanethiol (C2H5SH).|$|E
25|$|The main use of {{hydrogen}} sulfide is as {{a precursor to}} elemental sulfur. Several organosulfur compounds are produced using hydrogen sulfide. These include <b>methanethiol,</b> ethanethiol, and thioglycolic acid.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) {{studies have demonstrated}} that oral doses of MSM are absorbed into the blood and cross the blood/brain barrier. An NMR study has also found detectable levels of MSM normally present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that it derives from dietary sources, intestinal bacterial metabolism, and the body's endogenous <b>methanethiol</b> metabolism.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{secondary}} methanols bearing ferrocenyl and a hetaryl substituent was tested in reactions with Lawesson’s reagent (LR) {{aimed at the}} preparation of respective <b>methanethiols.</b> The study showed that in boiling toluene after only few minutes the starting alcohols were consumed and unexpectedly, {{depending on the type}} of hetaryl substituent, tetra-substituted ethane or disubstituted methane derivatives were obtained in good to excellent yields. The presence of the ferrocene moiety is crucial for the observed reaction courses...|$|R
40|$|The {{high-level}} {{ab initio}} {{investigation of the}} influence of the structural factors (the presence of the highly electronegative F atom and the lone pair – lone pair interactions of the adjacent oxygen and fluorine atoms) on the acidity and basicity of FOH was carried out in the present work together with the G 2 study of the acidities of CH 3 -nFnOH and CH 3 -nFnSH (n = 0 - 3) families and identification of the key factors responsible for the behavior of the geometries and energetics of these species and their heterolytic and homolytic dissociation products. It was found that hyperconjugation is the main effect in charge for methanols and <b>methanethiols.</b> For FOH and, also, FSH the trends in acidity and basicity upon fluorination of the parent compounds, H 2 O and H 2 S, could be rationalized in terms of field-inductive, polarizability, and (counteracting) lone pair – lone pair repulsion effects. Another aim {{of the present study was}} theoretical investigation of the nature of bonding in DMSO – anion complexes and critical performance test of the IEF-PCM solvation method on calculating absolute pKa values of substituted phenols in dimethyl sulfoxide and acetonitrile. The combined hydrogen bonding and electrostatic charge-dipole interaction was proposed to be the base of complex formation between DMSO and the anions. It was shown that the combination of scaled B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 +G** gas-phase acidities with the IEF-PCM method provides reliable absolute pKa values in DMSO and MeCN. Finally, theoretical investigation of interactions of a strong base (K 2 O) with acids of different strength (HClO 4, HCl, and HF), and strong acid (HClO 4) with bases ranging from K 2 O to H 2 O was carried out regarding the nature and extent of proton transfer between those partners. It was shown that spontaneous, unassisted proton transfer can take place in the gas-phase reactions between strong neutral Brønsted acids and bases. Käesolevas töös uuriti kõrgetasemeliste ab initio meetoditega oluliste struktuursete faktorite (suure elektronegatiivsusega F aatomi olemasolu ning kõrvutiasetsevate hapniku ja fluori aatomite vabade elektronpaaride vaheline interaktsioon) mõju FOH molekuli happelisusele ja aluselisusele. G 2 meetodit kasutades arvutati CH 3 -nFnOH ja CH 3 -nFnSH (n = 0 - 3) seeriate happelisused ning selgitati välja võtmefaktorid, mis avaldavad mõju nii nende OH ja SH hapete kui ka nende heterolüütilise ja homolüütilise dissotsiatsiooni produktide geomeetriale ja energeetikale. Leiti, et hüperkonjugatsioon on metanoolide ja metaantioolide jaoks peamine mõjuv faktor. FOH ning samuti FSH korral saab happelisuse ja aluselisuse muutumist lähteühendite H 2 O ja H 2 S fluoreerimisel selgitada induktsiooni, polariseeritavuse ja (vastutoimiva) vabade elektronpaaride omavahelise tõukumise efektidega. Teiseks uurimisteemaks oli DMSO ja anioonide vahelise komplekseerumise iseloomu väljaselgitamine ning IEF-PCM meetodi ennustusvõime hindamine asendatud fenoolide pKa väärtuste arvutamisel dimetüülsulfoksiidis ja atsetonitriilis. Pakuti välja vesiniksidemete moodustumise ja elektrostaatilise laeng–dipool vastasmõju kombinatsioon kui arvestatav mõjufaktor DMSO ja anioonide kompleksimoodustamise kirjeldamisel. Näidati, et skaleeritud B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 +G** gaasifaasi happelisuste kombineerimine IEF-PCM meetodiga annab usaldusväärseid absoluutse pKa väärtusi DMSO ja MeCN keskkonnas. Samuti uuriti käesolevas töös tugeva aluse (K 2 O) interaktsiooni erineva tugevusega hapetega (HClO 4, HCl ja HF) ning tugeva happe (HClO 4) interaktsiooni alustega alates K 2 O-st kuni H 2 O-ni, et selgitada välja partneritevahelise prootoniülekande iseloom ja ulatus. Näidati, et spontaanne iseeneslik prootoni üleminek võib toimuda gaasifaasi reaktsioonides tugevate neutraalsete Brønstedi hapete ja aluste vahel...|$|R
25|$|The {{remaining}} trace (<1% volume) compounds give flatus its smell. Historically, compounds such as indole, skatole, ammonia {{and short}} chain fatty acids {{were thought to}} cause the smell of flatus. More recent evidence proves that the major contribution to the smell of flatus comes {{from a combination of}} volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). It is known that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan, MM (also known as <b>methanethiol,</b> MT), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) are present in flatus. The benzopyrrole volatiles indole and skatole have a mothball smell, and therefore probably do not contribute greatly to the characteristic smell of flatus.|$|E
500|$|The {{dispersal}} of spores {{is different from}} most [...] "typical" [...] mushrooms that spread their spores through the air. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass on their tip which has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of carrion to attract flies and other insects. Odorous chemicals in the gleba include <b>methanethiol,</b> hydrogen sulfide, linalool, trans-ocimene, phenylacetaldehyde, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl trisulfide. The latter compound {{has been found to}} be emitted from fungating cancerous wounds. The mature fruiting bodies can be smelled from a considerable distance in the woods, and at close quarters most people find the cloying stink extremely repulsive. The flies land in the gleba and in doing so collect the spore mass on their legs and carry it to other locations. An Austrian study demonstrated that blow-flies (species Calliphora vicina, Lucilia caesar, Lucilia ampullacea and Dryomyza anilis) also feed on the slime, and soon after leaving the fruit body, they deposit liquid feces that contain a dense suspension of spores. The study also showed that beetles (Oeceoptoma thoracica and Meligethes viridescens) are attracted to the fungus, but seem to have less of a role in spore dispersal as they tend to feed on the hyphal tissue of the fruiting body.|$|E

2500|$|The pathway utilising {{cysteine}} {{is called}} the [...] "transsulfuration pathway", while the pathway utilising hydrogen sulfide (or <b>methanethiol)</b> is called [...] "direct-sulfurylation pathway".|$|E
2500|$|As an {{essential}} amino acid, methionine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, who must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins. [...] In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis {{belongs to the}} aspartate family, along with threonine and lysine (via diaminopimelate, but not via α-aminoadipate). The main backbone is derived from aspartic acid, while the sulfur may come from cysteine, <b>methanethiol</b> or hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hydroxyl}} activating {{group is}} then replaced with cysteine, <b>methanethiol</b> or hydrogen sulfide. A replacement reaction is technically a γ-elimination {{followed by a}} variant of a Michael addition. All the enzymes involved are homologues {{and members of the}} Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family, which is a subset of the PLP-dependant fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP (pyridoxal phosphate), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates.|$|E
50|$|DMS is {{also taken}} up by marine bacteria, but not as rapidly as <b>methanethiol.</b> Although DMS usually {{consists}} of less than 25% of the volatile breakdown products of DMSP, the high reactivity of <b>methanethiol</b> makes the steady-state DMS concentrations in seawater approximately 10 times those of <b>methanethiol</b> (~3 nM vs. ~0.3 nM). Curiously, there have never been any published correlations between the concentrations of DMS and <b>methanethiol.</b> This is {{probably due to the}} non-linear abiotic and microbial uptake of <b>methanethiol</b> in seawater, and the comparatively low reactivity of DMS. However, a significant portion of DMS in seawater is oxidized to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).|$|E
50|$|In surface seawater, <b>methanethiol</b> is {{the primary}} {{breakdown}} product of the algal metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Marine bacteria appear to obtain most of the sulfur in their proteins by the breakdown of DMSP and incorporation of <b>methanethiol,</b> {{despite the fact that}} <b>methanethiol</b> is present in seawater at much lower concentrations than sulfate (~0.3 nM vs. 28 mM). Bacteria in environments both with and without oxygen can also convert <b>methanethiol</b> to dimethyl sulfide (DMS), although most DMS in surface seawater is produced by a separate pathway. Both DMS and <b>methanethiol</b> can be used by certain microbes as substrates for methanogenesis in some anaerobic soils.|$|E

The chemical components responsible for the change in the odor of urine show as soon as 15 minutes after eating asparagus.|$|E
