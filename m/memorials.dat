5|$|As {{a result}} of all these processes, large numbers of <b>memorials,</b> more than for any other conflict, were built across the world during the inter-war period. It is {{estimated}} that France built around 176,000 war <b>memorials,</b> including around 36,000 in the local communes. Most of the local commune <b>memorials</b> were built by 1922, but those in the towns and cities typically required more protracted negotiations, and their construction stretched into the 1930s. The 1920s were particularly busy for construction of <b>memorials</b> in Britain, although the trend tailed off in 1930s, with the last inter-war memorial unveiled at the town of Mumbles in 1939. The commissioning of Australian war <b>memorials</b> similarly reduced after the mid-1920s. Over 3,500 Romanian <b>memorials</b> were erected. Many German <b>memorials</b> were built during the 1930s. Russia was unusual in building very few war <b>memorials</b> to the events of World War I, mainly as {{a result of}} the devastation of the Civil War and the political views of the subsequent Bolshevik government.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{interest}} in the war <b>memorials</b> diminished considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, reflected in a reduced level of ceremonies and a simplification of the commemorative events around <b>memorials.</b> In the post-war years, for example, the separate official and veterans ceremonies at the Verdun <b>memorials</b> blended into one; in 1956, German and French ceremonies were also united into a single event. Attendance at events like Anzac Day diminished. Many <b>memorials</b> slowly deteriorated: {{in some cases the}} original inter-war funding had never included maintenance, in other cases the materials used to construct the <b>memorials</b> were not durable. In some towns and cities, the <b>memorials</b> were moved to less prominent locations as part of urban renewal projects, or hidden by new buildings. World War I <b>memorials</b> were commonplace in many countries and were paid little attention.|$|E
5|$|Ceremonies came to {{surround}} many memorials; many <b>memorials</b> were formally opened or unveiled in public ceremonies, {{while others were}} used for recurring ceremonies on commemorative days. <b>Memorials</b> in Britain and France were typically opened in civic ceremonies involving local dignitaries, veterans and the next-of-kin of fallen servicemen. Some <b>memorials</b> acquired daily ceremonies; in 1928 it became customary to play the Last Post bugle call at the Menin Gate memorial each evening, for example, and this practice spread to many other similar <b>memorials</b> in France.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{some of the}} {{political}} tensions of earlier generations faded, allowing new <b>memorials</b> to be built. In the Republic of Ireland, new war <b>memorials</b> were built, trips organised to war <b>memorials</b> in Europe, and the National War Memorial Gardens were restored and finally officially opened in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{symbolism}} included in <b>memorials</b> was political in tone, and politics {{played an important}} part in their construction. Many <b>memorials</b> were embroiled in local ethnic and religious tensions, with <b>memorials</b> either reflecting the contribution of particular groups to the conflict or being rejected entirely by others. In several countries it proved difficult to produce <b>memorials</b> that appealed to and included the religious and political views of all of a community. The Fascist governments that came to power in Italy and Germany during the inter-war period made the construction of <b>memorials</b> a key part of their political programme, resulting in a number of larger memorial projects with strong national overtones being constructed in the 1930s. While few <b>memorials</b> embraced a pacifist perspective, some anti-war campaigners used the <b>memorials</b> for rallies and meetings. Many of the political tensions of the inter-war period had diminished {{by the end of the}} 20th century, allowing some countries to commemorate the events of the war through <b>memorials</b> for the first time since the end of the war. In the centennial of World War I, the memory of the war has become a major theme for scholars and museums.|$|E
5|$|National {{governmental}} {{bodies and}} charities were rapidly formed to produce <b>memorials</b> for these sites. The British government, for example, {{set up the}} Battle Exploits Committee in 1919 to create national battlefield <b>memorials,</b> alongside {{the work of the}} IWGC. Initially their intent was to celebrate the more heroic aspects of the fighting, and to avoid the flavour of <b>memorials</b> to the fallen that were being built elsewhere; by 1921, however, the committee had entered into a partnership with IWGC and adopted the same focus on the sacrifice of the fallen soldiers. The Canadian Battlefields <b>Memorials</b> Commission (CBMC) was similarly established in 1920 to produce war <b>memorials</b> for the major battlefields involving Canadian forces.|$|E

5|$|Various {{different}} {{mechanisms for}} commissioning {{the construction of}} war <b>memorials</b> emerged during the inter-war period. In most of the nations involved in the conflict, the <b>memorials</b> erected in towns and cities were usually commissioned by local community leaders and other civic groups, with relatively little or no central state involvement. Some national organisations emerged, including the British War <b>Memorials</b> Committee and the Canadian War <b>Memorials</b> Fund, but these focused on narrow, limited projects, {{rather than trying to}} coordinate a national response. The local processes and committees could result in multiple <b>memorials</b> being created for the same community or event: the site of Verdun was commemorated by three different <b>memorials,</b> for example, while some British towns saw rival <b>memorials</b> created by competing groups in the community.|$|E
5|$|World War I <b>memorials</b> {{commemorate the}} events and the {{casualties}} of World War I. These war <b>memorials</b> include civic <b>memorials,</b> larger national monuments, war cemeteries, private <b>memorials</b> {{and a range of}} utilitarian designs such as halls and parks, dedicated to remembering those involved in the conflict. Huge numbers of <b>memorials</b> were built in the 1920s and 1930s, with around 176,000 erected in France alone. This was a new social phenomenon and marked a major cultural shift in how nations commemorated conflicts. Interest in World War I and its <b>memorials</b> faded after World War II, and did not increase again until the 1980s and 1990s, which saw the renovation of many existing <b>memorials</b> and the opening of new sites. Visitor numbers at many <b>memorials</b> increased significantly, while major national and civic <b>memorials</b> continue to be used for annual ceremonies remembering the war.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, most war <b>memorials</b> were {{relatively}} conservative in design, aiming to use established styles {{to produce a}} tragic but comforting, noble and enduring commemoration of the war dead. Classical themes were particularly common, taking the prevailing styles of the late 19th century and typically simplifying them to produce cleaner, more abstract <b>memorials.</b> Allegorical and symbolic features, frequently drawing on Christian imagery, were used to communicate themes of self-sacrifice, victory and death. Some <b>memorials</b> adopted a medievalist theme instead, looking backwards to a more secure past, while others used emerging realist and Art Deco architectural styles to communicate the themes of the war.|$|E
5|$|Britain and Australia {{had both}} sent forces to {{participate}} in the Second Boer War of 1899 to 1902, which spurred an increased focus on war <b>memorials.</b> The Boer War had involved 200,000 British volunteers alone, and attracted considerable press coverage. Numerous war <b>memorials</b> were erected on their return, either by local community leaders or by the local Lord Lieutenant, acting on behalf of the county regiments; these were often situated in quiet locations to allow for peaceful reflection by visitors. Australia had honoured its volunteers by placing individual plaques inside buildings, creating outdoor memorial tablets and erecting obelisks in public places. Although the Boer War encouraged a shift away from <b>memorials</b> portraying heroic commanding officers, as had been popular earlier in the 19th century, towards depicting ordinary soldiers, annual ceremonies surrounding the <b>memorials</b> were not common and no official memorial day emerged. Boer War <b>memorials</b> in both countries were widely felt to lack a suitable quality of design and execution, echoing contemporary concerns in the US about the statues erected to commemorate the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} source of symbolism on <b>memorials,</b> however, is Christian imagery and icons. Religious imagery permeated many war <b>memorials,</b> even the secular. The {{most important of these}} symbols was the Christian cross, a widely used symbol of hope and suffering. The cross could take multiple forms, from Catholic designs in France, to Orthodox crosses in eastern Europe. Celtic crosses were popular in Britain and Ireland, partially because they avoided Catholic connotations, although they were considered vulgar by more classical architects such as Blomfield. In France, les croix des bois, wooden crosses, became popular symbols at <b>memorials</b> after Roland Dorgelès's novel of the same name. German <b>memorials</b> made extensive use of the image of the Virgin Mary tending her son Christ, following {{in the tradition of the}} pietà. The crucifixion was also a widely used symbol, as seen in Derwent Wood's Canada's Golgotha, although Christ himself was relatively rarely typically seen on British <b>memorials.</b>|$|E

5|$|In some countries, {{particularly}} Germany and England, <b>memorials</b> used {{a medieval}} style, reaching {{back to a}} more distant past.

Other <b>memorials</b> deliberately chose medieval themes and symbols, such as the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster, where {{the language of the}} inscriptions was deliberately archaic, and the tomb itself made from a medieval chest, decorated with a crusader's sword.
