The county noted that the towns' inability to pay for the road made the new road a financial burden for the county.

5|$|On 2 March 1737, penniless, Johnson {{left for}} London {{with his former}} pupil David Garrick. To <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse,</b> Johnson {{received}} word that his brother had died on the day they left. However, their prospects were not completely hopeless, as Garrick was set to inherit a large sum the next year. Also, Garrick had connections in London, and the two would stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris, who lived on Exeter Street. Johnson did not stay there long, and set out for Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish Irene. During that time, he wrote to Cave on 12 July 1737 and proposed a translation for Paolo Sarpi's The History of the Council of Trent (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later.|$|E

He immediately asked for reinforcements, but was denied by General Krukowiecki. Forced to fight alone, Dembiński did not reinforce the first line with his reserve 3rd Infantry Division and instead sent forward only a token force: half a battalion to man Fort 58 and support Fort 57. To <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse</b> for the Poles, General Umiński, {{the commanding officer}} of the southern sector, focused entirely on the skirmishes around Królikarnia and did not notice {{what was happening in}} Wola. Around 7:00 he reinforced Królikarnia with almost six battalions of infantry (ca. 2,800 men) and three guns. Forts 54 and 55 received no reinforcements.|$|E

To <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse</b> (from Khrushchev's perspective), Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, which, under heavy pressure, he declined. Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak.

500|$|Tasmania took a 42-run {{lead and}} Western Australia made 7/303 before declaring, with Halcombe not being {{required}} to bat. Halcombe went on to bowl two overs without incident in the second innings of the match as Tasmania ended at 1/42 when time ran out. Much anticipation surrounded his return to his home town of Adelaide the following week for a match against South Australia, {{with one of the}} umpires being Hele. Halcombe spoke in an interview to Adelaide's Advertiser in which he declared that he was adamant that his bowling was [...] "quite legal". Halcombe asserted that only one of the eight deliveries that he bowled under a slow motion camera could be considered to be of a doubtful nature. Halcombe again passed Hele's scrutiny unscathed, but his bowling failed to worry the South Australians, who plundered 100 runs from 13 overs for the loss of only one wicket. To <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse,</b> Halcombe made a pair as his team crashed to defeat by an innings and 234 runs. Debate over the legality of his action continued during the season, with former umpire Bob Crockett supporting his no-balling while former Test captain Joe Darling disagreed.

Lisa claims that the only way to restore him is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns. The family returns to Mr. Burns' mansion, where Homer drives a stake through Mr. Burns' heart.

500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse.</b> [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

2500|$|Harvard University {{international}} relations professor Stephen Walt wrote an [...] to his congressman outlining reasons he {{urged him to}} vote against intervention in Syria. [...] Walt's first argument against intervention was that the United States lacks any vital strategic interests in Syria. [...] After acknowledging that Assad government is a [...] "brutal dictatorship," [...] {{he points out that}} this has not bothered previous presidents in the past. [...] Indeed, intervening in Syria could make matters worse and harm US interests by creating a failed state and [...] "igniting a struggle for power among competing sectarian factions," [...] some of which [...] "are deeply hostile to America and sympathetic to al Qaeda... U.S. intervention could help bring some of our worst enemies to power." [...] Walt's second reason is that moral case for intervening in Syria fails to be compelling. [...] Although Syrians are suffering, air strikes would not alter that, but could <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse.</b> [...] Walt argues that [...] "recent scholarly research on civil wars shows that outside intervention tends to increase civilian killings and doesn't shorten the length of wars." [...] He suggests focusing on helping refugees instead. [...] Third, Walt rebuts the argument {{that it is necessary to}} go to war over Assad's use of chemical weapons, particularly when other regimes that used chemical weapons in the past were not then punished by the United States. [...] Walt argues that [...] "chemical weapons have only been used a handful of times over the past 80 years, mostly because they are less effective than conventional arms in most battlefield situations." [...] Fourth, Walt argues that intervention is not necessary to maintain US credibility because [...] "if we refrain from using force when vital interests are not involved or when doing so would only <b>make</b> <b>things</b> <b>worse,</b> it says nothing about our willingness to use force when it is truly necessary and when it can achieve clear and well-defined objectives." [...] Finally, Walt argues that [...] "wise leaders do not go to war without robust international and domestic support," [...] which President Obama does not have.|$|E
