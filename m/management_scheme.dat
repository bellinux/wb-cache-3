5|$|The Power Delivery Specification defines six fixed power {{profiles}} for {{the power}} sources. PD-aware devices implement a flexible power <b>management</b> <b>scheme</b> by interfacing with the power source through a bidirectional data channel and requesting {{a certain level of}} electrical power, variable up to 5A and 20V depending on supported profile. The power configuration protocol uses a 24MHz BFSK-coded transmission channel on the VBUS line.|$|E
30|$|In general, the communication-based energy <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> can {{be divided}} into {{centralized}} and decentralized energy <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> [22, 23]. These schemes are explained as follow.|$|R
30|$|For sound {{operation}} of a microgrid in both grid-connected mode and stand-alone mode, proper energy management strategies are very important. These energy <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> determine output powers and/or voltages of each DG source, which are then fed to the control system of interfacing converters as the control tracking references. Details of the converter control schemes will be explained in Section  4, while {{a review of the}} energy <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> are provided here. In general, power <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> in microgrids can be classified into communication-based and communication-less schemes.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} {{in the design of}} switches/routers is the efficient and fair use of the shared bottleneck bandwidth among different Internet flows. In particular, to provide fair bandwidth sharing, different buffer <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> are developed to protect the well-behaved flows from the misbehaving flows. However, most of the existing buffer <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> cannot provide accurate fair bandwidth sharing while being scalable. The key to the scalability and fairness of the buffer <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> is the accurate estimation of certain network resources without keeping too much state information...|$|R
5|$|In 2001, {{the site}} {{was brought to the}} {{attention}} of the CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois, pointing out the biodiversity of the new plant life. The association performed the first inventories. In the meantime, she contacted the five owners to consider a land management proposal. The commune of Bavay, the Bellignies quarry (SECAB) and a third owner sold her the property in 2003. The CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois became the owner / operator of 85 percent of the site. The association implemented the first environmental resources management actions at the site and developed its first environmental <b>management</b> <b>scheme</b> In 2009, the association obtained the agreement establishing the regional nature reserve at the site for a period of 20 years.|$|E

40|$|Queue <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> at the routers and {{congestion}} avoidance schemes {{at the end}} points cooperate to provide good congestion solutions in computer networks. While queue <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> are still being developed, research on {{congestion avoidance}} {{has come a long}} way to serve the bandwidth requirement of the networks. Because of considerable lack on the evaluation research work, there is no consensus on the choice of the queue management algorithms over these networks. Evaluation of queue <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> such as RED, RIO, SFB, SRR and BLUE are presented for high speed network testbed. Performance results are presented for several important metrics of interests such as Delay, Packet drop rate, and Throughput. The presented work supports further research work on the design and deployment issues of queue <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> for high speed networks...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{saving and}} high {{reliability}} are two key {{concerns in the}} design of real time systems. However, high reliability and low energy consumption are conflicting objects, and they are generally contrasted with temporal correctness. In this paper, we propose comparing reliability-ignorant and reliability-aware power <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> with statistical model checking approach using UPPAAL-SMC. The power <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> and the relevant components are modeled in the form of stochastic timed automata. And the analysis objectives are expressed as verification queries. With the model and queries as inputs, UPPAAL-SMC returns the probability of system failure and the expected value of energy consumption. In this analysis, we have considered three reliability-ignorant power <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> and two reliability-aware power <b>management</b> <b>schemes.</b> Based on the comparative study, we provided guidelines for choosing the suitable scheme for a given system. One thing that should be emphasized is that our methodology {{is not limited to the}} schemes involved in this paper. The modeling and evaluating procedure can be applied to analyse other energy <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> in practical application...|$|R

25|$|Carlisle {{was subject}} to {{the decline in the}} textile {{industry}} experienced throughout Britain as new machinery made labour unnecessary. In 1916, during the First World War, the government took over the public houses and breweries in Carlisle because of drunkenness among construction and munitions workers from the munitions factory at Gretna. This experiment nationalised brewing. As the Carlisle Board of Control, and subsequently the Carlisle & District State <b>Management</b> <b>Scheme,</b> it lasted until 1971.|$|E
25|$|The ISS {{employs a}} total of four CMGs as primary {{actuating}} devices during normal flight mode operation. The objective of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative {{to the surface of the}} Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of gravity gradient, atmospheric drag, solar pressure, and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum <b>management</b> <b>scheme</b> (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.|$|E
500|$|To {{measure the}} true effects of any traffic <b>management</b> <b>scheme</b> it is {{normally}} necessary {{to establish a}} baseline, or [...] "do nothing" [...] case, which estimates the effects on the network without any changes other than normal trends and expected local changes. Notably this was not done for the London Congestion Charging Scheme, {{which has led to}} claims that {{it is not possible to}} determine the extent of the actual influence of the scheme. Regardless of the scheme's impact, in a retrospective analysis Transport for London (TfL) estimated there would have already been a significant reduction in traffic as a consequence of parking policies and increased congestion due to traffic management and other interventions that had the effect of reducing highway capacity. In 2006, the last year before the zone was expanded, TfL observed that traffic flows were lower than in any recent year, while network traffic speeds were also lower than in any recent year.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to this {{digital rights}} <b>management</b> <b>scheme</b> was {{extremely}} negative. Critics {{felt that the}} changes would infringe on consumers' first-sale rights for games purchased on physical media, as games would only be licensed to users rather than sold, and the disc itself would only be used to install the game and not confer ownership of its license or permission to resell. Microsoft also stated that publishers could impose restrictions or activation fees on second-hand copies of games. Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi explained that the system was built with digital distribution in mind, but that Microsoft wanted to maintain the availability of games on physical media. He also noted that Microsoft was not [...] "giving in" [...] to publishers' objections to used games, but rather trying to balance the needs of consumers and the industry, and that the trading and sharing abilities of the platform added a level of flexibility not seen on other online distribution platforms at the time.|$|E

The diverse range of management situations must therefore lead to properly adapted financial set-ups. The planned generalization of the implementation of forest <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> will involve introducing economies of scale and reducing unit management costs.

Exploitation of wildlife resources (such as elephant ivory, sea turtles or primates) are restricted supposedly on the ground of sustainable management. Alleged filibustering of the Revised <b>Management</b> <b>Scheme</b> and diversification of arguments outside of conservation by the anti-whaling side is alleged to be a sign that anti-whaling countries no longer adhere to this principle (of sustainable management and exploitation of natural resources).

40|$|Abstract—In secure group-oriented applications, key <b>management</b> <b>schemes</b> are {{employed}} to distribute and update keys such that unauthorized parties cannot access group communications. Key management, however, can disclose {{information about the}} dynamics of group membership, such as the group size {{and the number of}} joining and departing users. This is a threat to applications with confidential group membership information. This paper investigates techniques that can stealthily acquire group dynamic information from key management. We show that insiders and outsiders can successfully obtain group membership information by exploiting key establishment and key updating procedures in many popular key <b>management</b> <b>schemes.</b> Particularly, we develop three attack methods targeting tree-based centralized key <b>management</b> <b>schemes.</b> Further, we propose a defense technique utilizing batch rekeying and phantom users, and derive performance criteria that describe security level of the proposed scheme using mutual information. The proposed defense scheme is evaluated based on the data from MBone multicast sessions.
