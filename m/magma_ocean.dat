5|$|The lighter-coloured {{regions of}} the Moon are called terrae, or more {{commonly}} highlands, because they are higher than most maria. They have been radiometrically dated to having formed 4.4billion years ago, and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar <b>magma</b> <b>ocean.</b> In contrast to Earth, no major lunar mountains {{are believed to have}} formed as a result of tectonic events.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{collected}} from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques. They {{range in age from}} about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust. As such, they represent samples from a very early period {{in the development of the}} Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar <b>magma</b> <b>ocean).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Magma</b> <b>oceans</b> are {{integral}} parts of planetary formation as they facilitate {{formation of a}} core through metal segregation and an atmosphere and hydrosphere through degassing. <b>Magma</b> <b>oceans</b> may survive for millions to {{tens of millions of}} years, interspersed by relatively clement conditions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Magma</b> <b>oceans</b> are periods during Earth's or any planet's {{accretion}} {{where it}} is, either {{in whole or}} in part, molten. In the early solar system, energy to melt objects came largely from the decay of radioactive aluminum-26. As planets grew larger, the energy was supplied from large or giant impacts. During its formation, the Earth likely suffered a series <b>magma</b> <b>oceans</b> resulting from giant impacts, the final one being the Moon-forming impact.|$|R
40|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of <b>magma</b> <b>oceans</b> is discussed in great detail, and among the many new items introduced were high-pressure phase equilibrium experiments, calculations of depth of impact-produced melting, models incorporating crystal growth rates with degree of crystallinity and convection, and models of hard turbulent convection. It was agreed that before we can point to some present-day observable parameters and confidently establish {{the existence}} of <b>magma</b> <b>oceans,</b> we must learn much more about their phase equilibria and solidification dynamics...|$|R
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field lines, which Io crosses, couple Io's atmosphere and neutral cloud to Jupiter's polar upper atmosphere by generating an electric current {{known as the}} Io flux tube. This current produces an auroral glow in Jupiter's polar regions known as the Io footprint, as well as aurorae in Io's atmosphere. Particles from this auroral interaction darken the Jovian polar regions at visible wavelengths. The location of Io and its auroral footprint with respect to Earth and Jupiter has a strong influence on Jovian radio emissions from our vantage point: when Io is visible, radio signals from Jupiter increase considerably. The Juno mission, currently in orbit around Jupiter, should help {{to shed light on}} these processes. The Jovian {{magnetic field}} lines that do get past Io's ionosphere also induce an electric current, which in turn creates an induced magnetic field within Io's interior. Io's induced magnetic field is thought to be generated within a partially molten, silicate <b>magma</b> <b>ocean</b> 50 kilometers beneath Io's surface. Similar induced fields were found at the other Galilean satellites by Galileo, generated within liquid water oceans in the interiors of those moons.|$|E

25|$|A natural {{outcome of}} the giant impact event is that the {{materials}} that reaccreted to form the Moon must have been hot. Current models predict that {{a large portion of}} the Moon would have been molten shortly after the Moon formed, with estimates for the depth of this <b>magma</b> <b>ocean</b> ranging from about 500km to complete melting. Crystallization of this <b>magma</b> <b>ocean</b> would have given rise to a differentiated body with a compositionally distinct crust and mantle and accounts for the major suites of lunar rocks.|$|E

40|$|A summary is {{presented}} of theoretical and speculative {{research on the}} physics of igneous processes involved in asteroid differentiation. Partial melting processes, melt migration, and their products are discussed and explosive volcanism is described. Evidence {{for the existence of}} asteroidal <b>magma</b> <b>oceans</b> is considered and processes which may have occurred in these oceans are examined. Synthesis and inferences of asteroid heat sources are discussed under the assumption that asteroids are heated mainly by internal processes and that the role of impact heating is small. Inferences of these results for earth-forming planetesimals are suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of the Earth's core {{is a consequence of}} planetary accretion and processes in the Earth's interior. The mechanical process of planetary differentiation is likely to occur in large, if not global, <b>magma</b> <b>oceans</b> created by the collisions of planetary embryos. Metal-silicate segregation in <b>magma</b> <b>oceans</b> occurs rapidly and efficiently unlike grain scale percolation according to laboratory experiments and calculations. Geochemical models of the core formation process as planetary accretion proceeds are becoming increasingly realistic. Single stage and continuous core formation models have evolved into multi-stage models that are couple to the output of dynamical models of the giant impact phase of planet formation. The models that are most successful in matching the chemical composition of the Earth's mantle, based on experimentally-derived element partition coefficients, show that the temperature and pressure of metal-silicate equilibration must increase as a function of time and mass accreted and so must the oxygen fugacity of the equilibrating material. The latter can occur if silicon partitions into the core and through the late delivery of oxidized material. Coupled dynamical accretion and multi-stage core formation models predict the evolving mantle and core compositions of all the terrestrial planets simultaneously and also place strong constraints on the bulk compositions and oxidation states of primitive bodies in the protoplanetary disk.

25|$|The first {{important}} {{event in the}} geologic evolution of the Moon was the crystallization of the near global <b>magma</b> <b>ocean.</b> It is not known with certainty what its depth was, but several studies imply a depth of about 500km or greater. The first minerals to form in this ocean were the iron and magnesium silicates olivine and pyroxene. Because these minerals were denser than the molten material around them, they sank. After crystallization was about 75% complete, less dense anorthositic plagioclase feldspar crystallized and floated, forming an anorthositic crust about 50km in thickness. The majority of the <b>magma</b> <b>ocean</b> crystallized quickly (within about 100 million years or less), though the final remaining KREEP-rich magmas, which are highly enriched in incompatible and heat-producing elements, could have remained partially molten for several hundred million (or perhaps 1 billion) years. It appears that the final KREEP-rich magmas of the <b>magma</b> <b>ocean</b> eventually became concentrated within the region of Oceanus Procellarum and the Imbrium basin, a unique geologic province that {{is now known as}} the Procellarum KREEP Terrane.|$|E
25|$|The first rocks {{brought back}} by Apollo 11 were basalts. Although the mission landed on Mare Tranquillitatis, a few millimetric {{fragments}} of rocks {{coming from the}} highlands were picked up. These are composed mainly of plagioclase feldspar; some fragments were composed exclusively of anorthositic plagioclase. The identification of these mineral fragments led to the bold hypothesis that {{a large portion of}} the Moon was once molten, and that the crust formed by fractional crystallization of this <b>magma</b> <b>ocean.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{crystallization}} of {{the lunar}} <b>magma</b> <b>ocean</b> proceeded, minerals such as olivine and pyroxene would have precipitated and sank to form the lunar mantle. After crystallization was about three-quarters complete, anorthositic plagioclase would have begun to crystallize, and because of its low density, float, forming an anorthositic crust. Importantly, elements that are incompatible (i.e., those that partition preferentially into the liquid phase) would have been progressively concentrated into the magma as crystallization progressed, forming a KREEP-rich magma that initially should have been sandwiched between the crust and mantle. Evidence for this scenario comes from the highly anorthositic composition {{of the lunar}} highland crust, {{as well as the}} existence of KREEP-rich materials.|$|E
40|$|There are sound {{theoretical}} {{reasons to}} suspect that the terrestrial planets melted when they formed. For Earth, the reasons stem largely from the hypothesis that the moon formed {{as a result of the}} impact of a Mars-sized planetesimal with the still accreting Earth. Such a monumental event would have led to widespread heating of the Earth and the materials from which the moon was made. In addition, formation of a dense atmosphere on the Earth (and possibly the Moon) would have led to retention of accretional heat and, thus, widespread melting. In other words, contemporary theory suggests that the primitive Moon and terrestrial planets had <b>magma</b> <b>oceans...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent work {{suggests}} that a large degree of melting is required to segregate metal from silicates, suggesting a connection {{with the formation of}} <b>magma</b> <b>oceans.</b> At low pressures metallic liquids do not wet silicate minerals, preventing the metal from aggregating into large masses that can sink. At high pressures, above 25 GPa, the dihedral angles of grains in contact with oxygen-rich metallic liquids may be reduced enough to allow percolation of metal, but this has not been confirmed. Physical models of core formation and accretion may therefore involve the formation of <b>magma</b> <b>oceans</b> and the segregation of metal at both high and low pressures. Models of core formation involving different pressure regimes are discussed as well as chemical evidence bearing on the models. Available geophysical data is ambiguous. The nature of the 670 km boundary (chemical difference or strictly phase change) between the upper and lower mantle is in doubt. There is some evidence that plumes are derived from the lower mantle, and seismic tomography strongly indicates that penetration of subducting oceanic crust into the lower mantle, but the tomography data also indicates that the 670 km discontinuity is a significant barrier to general mantle convection. The presence of the D' layer {{at the base of the}} lower mantle could be a reaction zone between the mantle and core indicating core-mantle disequilibrium, or D' layer could be subducted material. The abundance of the siderophile elements in the mantle could provide clues to the importance of high pressure processes in Earth, but partition coefficients at high pressures are only beginning to be measured...|$|R
40|$|Highly siderophile {{elements}} (HSEs) {{are strongly}} depleted in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) but {{are present in}} near-chondritic relative abundances. The conventional {{explanation is that the}} HSEs were stripped from the mantle by the segregation of metal during core formation but were added back in near-chondritic proportions by late accretion, after core formation had ceased. Here we show that metal-silicate equilibration and segregation during Earth's core formation actually increased HSE mantle concentrations because HSE partition coefficients are relatively low at the high pressures of core formation within Earth. The pervasive exsolution and segregation of iron sulfide liquid from silicate liquid (the "Hadean matte") stripped <b>magma</b> <b>oceans</b> of HSEs during cooling and crystallization, before late accretion, and resulted in slightly suprachondritic palladium/iridium and ruthenium/iridium ratios...|$|R
25|$|The {{relative}} age of intercrater plains {{material has}} a bearing on its origin. If very old, intercrater plains material may consist of anorthosite {{derived from a}} <b>magma</b> <b>ocean</b> such as may have existed on the Moon (Wood and others, 1970). If emplaced during later stages of mercurian evolution, it may consist of basin ejecta or lava flows. However, planetwide, the morphologic evidence for an impact origin rather than a volcanic one is not compelling. Whether or not either hypothesis is eventually substantiated, the emplacement of intercrater plains material likely began during {{an early stage of}} intense accretionary bombardment (Guest and O’Donnell, 1977) and lasted until the time of formation of intermediate plains material.|$|E
25|$|Oceans, seas, {{lakes and}} other bodies of liquids can be {{composed}} of liquids other than water, for example the hydrocarbon lakes on Titan. The possibility of seas of nitrogen on Triton was also considered but ruled out. There {{is evidence that the}} icy surfaces of the moons Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, Titan and Enceladus are shells floating on oceans of very dense liquid water or water–ammonia. Earth is often called the ocean planet because it is 70% covered in water. Extrasolar terrestrial planets that are extremely close to their parent star will be tidally locked and so one half of the planet will be a <b>magma</b> <b>ocean.</b> It is also possible that terrestrial planets had magma oceans at some point during their formation as a result of giant impacts. Hot Neptunes close to their star could lose their atmospheres via hydrodynamic escape, leaving behind their cores with various liquids on the surface. Where there are suitable temperatures and pressures, volatile chemicals that might exist as liquids in abundant quantities on planets include ammonia, argon, carbon disulfide, ethane, hydrazine, hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, neon, nitrogen, nitric oxide, phosphine, silane, sulfuric acid, and water.|$|E
25|$|Following the February 2000 encounter, Galileos {{mission at}} Jupiter was {{extended}} {{for a second}} and final time with the Galileo Millennium Mission. The focus of this extended mission was joint observation of the Jovian system by both Galileo and Cassini, which performed a distant flyby of Jupiter en route to Saturn on December 30, 2000. Discoveries during the joint observations of Io revealed a new plume at Tvashtar and provided insights into Io's aurorae. Distant imaging by Galileo during the Cassini flyby revealed a new red ring plume deposit, similar to the one surrounding Pele, around Tvashtar, one of the first of this type seen in Io's polar regions, though Galileo would later observe a similar deposit around Dazhbog Patera in August 2001. Galileo performed three additional flybys of Io, on August 6 and October 16, 2001 and January 17, 2002, during the Galileo Millennium Mission. Both encounters in 2001 allowed Galileo to observe Io's polar regions up-close, though imaging from the August 2001 flyby was lost due to a camera malfunction. The data from the magnetometer confirmed that Io lacked an intrinsic magnetic field, though later analysis of this data in 2009 did reveal evidence for an induced magnetic field generated by the interaction between Jupiter's magnetosphere and a silicate <b>magma</b> <b>ocean</b> in Io's asthenosphere. During the August 2001 flyby, Galileo flew through the outer portions of the newly formed Thor volcanic plume, allowing for the first direct measurement of composition of Io's volcanic material. During the October 2001 encounter, Galileo imaged the new Thor eruption site, a major new lava flow at Gish Bar Patera, and the lava lake at Pele. Due to a safing event prior to the encounter, nearly all of the observations planned for the January 2002 flyby were lost.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, {{allowing}} elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed <b>magma</b> <b>oceans.</b> However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation.

They compare an Eulerian method based on double-diffusive convection against a Lagrangian, particle-based method. Through a series of increasingly complex benchmark tests, the authors show the superiority of the particle method when it comes to model the advection of compositional interfaces with sharp density and viscosity contrasts.

500|$|Modeling of Io's {{interior}} composition {{suggests that}} the mantle is composed of at least 75% of the magnesium-rich mineral forsterite, and has a bulk composition {{similar to that of}} L-chondrite and LL-chondrite meteorites, with higher iron content (compared to silicon) than the Moon or Earth, but lower than Mars. To support the heat flow observed on Io, 10–20% of Io's mantle may be molten, though regions where high-temperature volcanism has been observed may have higher melt fractions. However, re-analysis of Galileo magnetometer data in 2009 revealed the presence of an induced magnetic field at Io, requiring a <b>magma</b> <b>ocean</b> [...] below the surface.
