The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with <b>most</b> <b>teams</b> meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded but many of the clubs survive to this day.|$|E

5|$|During the 1939–40 season {{football}} was stopped following Britain's {{declaration of war}} and was not resumed {{until the end of}} World War II. This was because most British men were sent to the army. Stockport played only two matches in the 1939–40 season before war was declared, losing both and being bottom of the league. Regional league competitions were set up; appearances in these tournaments do not count in players' official records. Due to teams having a depleting number of players <b>most</b> <b>teams</b> resigned from football, the clubs that were left to compete used guest players to make up their numbers. The FA Cup was also suspended and replaced with the Football League War Cup.|$|E
5|$|In second practice, Hamilton {{was again}} quickest {{but was also}} caught out again.

Ferrari looked to be significantly closer to Mercedes, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen finishing second and third respectively, less than 0.4 seconds behind Hamilton.

5|$|Football {{games last}} {{for a total of}} 60 minutes in {{professional}} and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes. The two-halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are also followed by a short break. Prior {{to the start of the}} game, the referee and team captains for each team meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or kick off the ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. <b>Most</b> <b>teams</b> choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.|$|E
