5|$|It is {{uncertain}} if Swift allowed Faulkner {{to publish the}} works {{in order to allow}} an Irish publisher to compete against an English publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to Motte in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's legal right to publish the works but <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> admonish the attitude and action of Motte as a publisher for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that Faulkner would be allowed to reprint the copyrighted material.|$|E
5|$|While Cope and Marsh dueled for fossils in the American West, {{they also}} tried {{their best to}} ruin each other's {{professional}} credibility. Humiliated by his error in reconstructing the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus, Cope tried to cover up his mistake by purchasing every copy he could find of the journal {{in which it was}} published. Marsh, meanwhile, <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> publicize the story. Cope's own rapid and prodigious output of scientific papers meant that Marsh had no difficulty in finding occasional errors with which to lambast Cope. Marsh himself was not infallible; he put the wrong skull on a skeleton of Apatosaurus and declared it a new genus, Brontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Meyer added {{elements}} {{to reinforce the}} aging of the characters. Kirk's unhappiness about his birthday is compounded by McCoy's gift of reading glasses. The script stated that Kirk was 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk's age. Bennett remembers that Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle-aged version of himself, and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk. Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy; the producer did not know that Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and was fond of the actor. Meyer <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> emphasize Kirk's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli; new cases, in Holmes' case, and starship adventures in Kirk's.|$|E

5|$|Rather {{than trying}} to release the game {{in tandem with the}} movie, Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> give the {{developers}} as much time as they needed to finish the game. GoldenEye 007 was developed through two and a half years, the first year of which was spent developing the engine and producing art assets. The game was released on a 96Mb cartridge on 25 August 1997, nearly two years after the film. Additionally, every cartridge of the game contains a fully functional ZX Spectrum emulator with ten Rare developed games. This function was originally made as an experimental side project by Rare staff and was deactivated in the final build of the game, but has since been unlocked through fan-made patches.|$|E
5|$|Tenebraes {{score is}} very {{different}} to those the band had produced for Argento previously. The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music, and he decided on a more electronic sound for Tenebrae. Simonetti described the score as an electronica/rock hybrid, with the main theme including disco elements. So {{it would not be}} difficult to accommodate Argento's preference for long takes, Simonetti, Pignatelli and Morante <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> play each song for 3–4 minutes. Recording the score, Simonetti used the Roland Jupiter-8, Roland Vocoder Plus and Minimoog synthesizers, as well as a piano, electric piano, the Oberheim DMX digital drum, a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and Roland MC-4 music sequencer. Pignatelli played bass and fretless guitar, while Morante played electric and acoustic guitar.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} probe, The Voyage Home {{required}} no new starship designs. The USS Saratoga, the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan. The Bird-of-Prey model from The Search for Spock was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for The Voyage Homes action sequences. The {{inside of the}} Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock, but the designers <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, {{rather than relying on}} ambient or rigged lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock, the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When The Voyage Home called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage.|$|E
5000|$|Epic Records {{does not}} own the video {{despite the fact}} that this song was to be re-released on Bethany Joy Galeotti's debut album. The video was shot before she officially signed with them.

2500|$|In January 2007, {{the band}} {{recorded}} three nights of performances in San Francisco, California, for their second live album, They've Actually Gotten Worse Live!, released November 20, 2007. The live album is {{described on the}} press release as [...] "their sloppiest, drunkest, funniest, best sounding recording ever … and they even <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> not <b>to</b> play any songs off their 1995 live album I Heard They Suck Live." ...|$|R
5|$|Andrea Martin {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Apu's mother, recording her part in New York City. She {{wanted to get the}} voice perfect, so in between takes she listened to tapes of Hank Azaria reading lines for Apu, <b>to</b> make <b>sure</b> her voice could realistically be Apu's mother's. During the flashback to Apu's childhood, the animators <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> not <b>to</b> show Manjula, as they wished to reveal her {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|R
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} were in any case completed {{by the start of}} September 1066, and had possibly begun already in March or April. While he brought with him Elisiv, his daughters, and his son Olaf, he left behind Tora and <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> have his oldest son Magnus hailed as king. Gathering his fleet at Solund in the Sognefjord, Harald departed Norway in August, and landed first in Shetland and thereafter in Orkney (both under Norwegian control). In both places he was joined by several important lords, chieftains, and soldiers, including the Earls of Orkney, Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson. He next went to Dunfermline, where he met with Tostig's ally Malcolm III of Scotland (and according to some sources, with Tostig) who allocated him a couple thousand Scottish soldiers. According to most contemporary sources, Harald and Tostig met at Tynemouth on 8 September, Harald with a total force of, at the most, around 10–15,000 men on 240–300 longships, and Tostig with a mere 12 ships with soldiers. Not mentioned in the sagas, but accounted for by John of Worcester, Tostig had departed from his exile in Flanders already in May or June. He had then raided villages along the southern coast of Britain from the Isle of Wight to Sandwich. As Harold Godwinson gathered a large army in response, Tostig sailed north to meet with Harald, while Harold Godwinson remained in the south in expectation of invasion by William of Normandy, who for a long time had openly claimed the English throne.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the lords}} of Zalpa lived on. Huzziya I, {{descendant}} of a Huzziya of Zalpa, took over Hatti. His son-in-law Labarna I, a southerner (of Hurma) usurped the throne but <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> adopt Huzziya's grandson Hattusili {{as his own}} son and heir.|$|E

50|$|Despite their respectable background, {{the twins}} {{turned to a}} life of crime. They <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> never <b>to</b> go {{poaching}} together, and often escaped their frequent encounters with the constabulary by providing alibis for each other. Despite this, they did spend time in prison where they attracted the attention of Sir Edward Henry who used twins, including the Foxes, to prove that an individual could be identified by his fingerprints. Their crimes made national and international news.|$|R

25|$|Tiresias was {{a priest}} of Zeus, {{and as a}} young man he {{encountered}} two snakes mating and hit them with a stick. He was then transformed into a woman. As a woman, Tiresias became a priestess of Hera, married and had children, including Manto. After seven years as a woman, Tiresias again found mating snakes; depending on the myth, either she <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> leave the snakes alone this time, or, according to Hyginus, trampled on them and became a man once more.|$|E
25|$|The gang's later train robberies had {{a lighter}} touch. The gang held up {{passengers}} only twice, choosing {{in all other}} incidents to take only {{the contents of the}} express safe in the baggage car. John Newman Edwards <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> highlight such techniques when creating an image of James as a kind of Robin Hood. Despite public sentiment toward the gang's crimes, {{there is no evidence that}} the James gang ever shared any of the robbery money outside their personal circle.|$|E
25|$|At the 1945 annual league meeting, held on September 7, it {{was noted}} that the backers of the Maroons {{franchise}} were in discussion to sell to a group from Philadelphia fronted by Canadiens board member Len Peto. The league governors were prepared to approve the transfer, provided the Philadelphia group could prove they had the necessary funds for a hockey team. They also <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> clarify that the Maroons franchise rights would expire in April 1947 unless something was done with them.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the first}} large {{gathering}} of fans occurred in April 1967. When Leonard Nimoy appeared as Spock as grand marshal of the Medford Pear Blossom Festival parade in Oregon, {{he hoped to}} sign hundreds of autographs but thousands of people appeared; after being rescued by police [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> never <b>to</b> appear publicly again in Vulcan guise", the actor wrote. Another was in January 1968, when more than 200 Caltech students marched to NBCs Burbank, California studio to support Star Treks renewal.|$|R

25|$|After {{six weeks}} of {{observations}} and wire-taps (the spies <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> plant the Cuban's rooms with microphones), the Cuban embassy unexpectedly ordered its delegates to return to La Habana. SIDE did not obtain any relevant information about their suspicions that the Cubans were assisting and supporting Argentine leftists groups, but the agency realised that women are a very useful tool in the espionage world.

25|$|The {{reports for}} the 1957–1958, 1975–1976, 1999, and 2004 {{excavations}} were all published in journals, some in English {{and some in}} Hebrew. It {{was not until the}} Tel Kabri Expedition of Tel Aviv University under Kempinski that stand-alone excavation reports for Tel Kabri were published, and then Kempinski <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> publish a report for each year – a practice that has continued with the ongoing excavations by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project of The George Washington University and the University of Haifa.

25|$|The four Klan {{members in}} the car, Collie Wilkins (21), FBI {{informant}} Gary Rowe (34), William Eaton (41) and Eugene Thomas (42) were quickly arrested: within 24 hours, President Lyndon Johnson appeared on national television to announce their arrest. In order to avoid bad press, President Johnson <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> focus on the positive work of the FBI agents' solving {{of the murder of}} Viola Liuzzo, in an attempt to divert scrutiny away from the fact that one {{of the men in the}} car, Gary Thomas Rowe, Jr., was an FBI informant and thus was protected by the FBI.|$|E
50|$|However, Kalakani's {{nine months}} rule was soon {{replaced}} by Nadir Khan on 13 October 1929. Amanullah Khan attempted {{to return to}} Afghanistan, but he had little support from the people.

60|$|It {{may have}} been imagination, yet I <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> Merritt seemed <b>to</b> shrink and grow smaller before he pitched a ball.

60|$|Double Caches.--Some persons, {{when they}} know that their {{intentions}} are suspected, make two caches: the one with a few things buried in it, and concealed with little care; the other, containing those that are really valuable, and very artfully <b>made.</b> Thieves are <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> discover the first, and are likely enough to omit a further search.|$|R
25|$|Stability {{returned}} with the rule of Zahir al-Umar, a powerful Arab sheikh who ruled the Galilee, and later much of the Levantine coast and Palestine. He transformed Nazareth from a minor village into a large town by encouraging immigration to it. Nazareth played a strategic role in Zahir's sheikhdom because it allowed him to wield control over the agricultural areas of central Galilee. He <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> ensure Nazareth's security for other reasons as well, among them strengthening ties with France by protecting the Christian community and to protect one of his wives who resided in Nazareth.|$|E
25|$|On 13 May Henry quickly {{brought an}} army of 4,000 French and Swiss {{infantry}} and 700 French cavalry under Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron to Amiens.

This army soon began to expand {{from all over the}} kingdom but the main the reinforcement was from the English - via the Triple alliance, Elizabeth had sent 2,000 English troops to France under the command of Sir Thomas Baskerville with another 1,500 English raised in Rouen. Most were veterans from the fighting in Flanders and most of whom had fought at Turnhout earlier in the year.|$|E
25|$|Many media {{accounts}} {{have linked}} this story with Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress that involved Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, the first Muslim {{elected to the}} US Congress. Ellison's desire to use a Qur'an at the ceremonial reenactment of his oath, while symbolically important, was never a judicial issue. The swearing-in was en masse and involved no texts whatsoever. Both of the main figures taking issue with Ellison, Dennis Prager and US Representative Virgil Goode of Virginia, <b>made</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> clarify {{that they were not}} asking for him to be banned from serving if he insisted on using a Qur'an instead of a Bible at his reenactment photo-op.

In accordance with his rights, he divorced Charlotte but kept this a secret until after his sister Sophie's wedding. As soon as these festivities were over, Charles Louis published the divorce documents and declared himself to be married to Louise von Degenfeld, though many questioned the legality of the divorce.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 Guy Deutscher characterised Alma's musical {{creativity}} as {{a central}} part of her imagination. In her first years of life, Alma was the subject of her father's language experiments related to his professional research.
