5|$|In 1957, McClintock {{received}} {{funding from}} the National Academy of Sciences to start research on indigenous strains of <b>maize</b> in Central America and South America. She was interested in studying the evolution of <b>maize</b> through chromosomal changes, and being in South America would allow her {{to work on a}} larger scale. McClintock explored the chromosomal, morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various races of <b>maize.</b> After extensive work in the 1960s and 1970s, McClintock and her collaborators published the seminal study The Chromosomal Constitution of Races of <b>Maize,</b> leaving their mark on paleobotany, ethnobotany, and evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|McClintock's {{cytogenetic}} research {{focused on}} developing ways to visualize and characterize <b>maize</b> chromosomes. This particular {{part of her}} work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to visualize <b>maize</b> chromosomes, and showed {{for the first time}} the morphology of the 10 <b>maize</b> chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the microspore as opposed to the root tip. By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on the characterization of triploid <b>maize</b> chromosomes triggered scientific interest in <b>maize</b> cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.|$|E
5|$|Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American {{scientist}} and cytogeneticist who {{was awarded the}} 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader {{in the development of}} <b>maize</b> cytogenetics, the focus of her research {{for the rest of her}} life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in <b>maize.</b> She developed the technique for visualizing <b>maize</b> chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for <b>maize,</b> linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.|$|E

5|$|Platform E6 is {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of the Group E plaza. It is roughly built from irregularly sized, poorly cut stones. The platform faces east towards Pyramid E1 and has four access stairways. The platform once supported perishable residences; these were built from <b>maize</b> stalks bound together with clay, as evidenced by the imprint of the <b>maize</b> stalks in the fragments of clay wall recovered during excavations. The platform itself was once covered with stucco.|$|E
5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. <b>Maize,</b> potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on many cultures. <b>Maize</b> and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
5|$|Along with <b>maize</b> and beans, squash {{has been}} {{depicted}} in the art work of the native peoples of the Americas for at least 2,000 years. For example, cucurbits are often represented in Moche ceramics.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{agriculture}} was {{the major}} profession {{in most of the}} provinces in Zambia. <b>Maize,</b> mixed beans, rice, sorghum, soya beans, sunflower, sweet potatoes and wheat were the major crops in the provinces. Among all provinces, Central had the maximum area, , constituting 20.64 per cent, while Luapula had the smallest area at 3.06 per cent of the total area. <b>Maize</b> production was maximum in Eastern (22.5%), mixed beans (51.66%) in Northern, sorghum in Southern (40.62%), sunflower in Eastern (70.2%), soya beans (45.06%), sweet potatoes (28.5%) and wheat (49.51%) in Central Province.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid <b>maize</b> (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial <b>maize</b> seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{she made}} an {{extensive}} study of the cytogenetics and ethnobotany of <b>maize</b> races from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as other scientists confirmed the mechanisms of genetic change and genetic regulation that she had demonstrated in her <b>maize</b> research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed, including the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic transposition; {{she is the only}} woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.|$|E

5|$|Relatively {{minor damage}} {{occurred}} in North Korea, previously impacted by Typhoon Prapiroon earlier in September. Rainfall peaked at 147mm (5.79in) in Kaesong. Saomai somewhat exacerbated the unprecedented {{damage caused by}} Prapiroon, and damaged <b>maize</b> crops which were set to be harvested in the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine. A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried <b>maize,</b> black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped <b>maize</b> kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|E

5|$|The three {{principal}} kingdoms of Cuscatlan, Izalco, and Chaparrastique {{engaged in}} regular warfare, and smaller groups occasionally rebelled against their larger neighbours. There was flourishing trade, with cacao {{as the principal}} commodity, although <b>maize,</b> cotton, and balsam were also traded.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{most of the}} Chiquitos tribes practiced swidden agriculture, growing <b>maize</b> and yuca on a small scale. After {{contact with}} the Spanish, cocoa and rice also were cultivated. Hunting and fishing {{provided}} additional nutrition in the dry season. The Jesuits introduced cattle breeding.|$|E
25|$|In North America and Central America, a tortilla {{is a type}} of thin, unleavened flatbread, {{made from}} finely ground <b>maize</b> (corn). In Guatemala and Mexico, there are three colors of <b>maize</b> dough for making tortillas: white <b>maize,</b> yellow <b>maize</b> and blue <b>maize</b> (or black <b>maize).</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Maize</b> is {{preferred}} in formal, scientific, and international usage because it refers specifically {{to this one}} grain, unlike corn, which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region. <b>Maize</b> is used by agricultural bodies and research institutes such as the FAO and CSIRO. National agricultural and industry associations often include the word <b>maize</b> in their name even in English-speaking countries where the local, informal word is something other than maize; for example, the <b>Maize</b> Association of Australia, the Indian <b>Maize</b> Development Association, the Kenya <b>Maize</b> Consortium and <b>Maize</b> Breeders Network, the National <b>Maize</b> Association of Nigeria, the Zimbabwe Seed <b>Maize</b> Association. However, in commodities trading, corn consistently refers to <b>maize</b> and not other grains.|$|E
25|$|<b>Maize</b> is a {{major source}} of starch. Cornstarch (<b>maize</b> flour) {{is a major}} {{ingredient}} in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. <b>Maize</b> is also {{a major source of}} cooking oil (corn oil) and of <b>maize</b> gluten. <b>Maize</b> starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from <b>maize</b> is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. <b>Maize</b> is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of <b>maize</b> for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, <b>maize</b> is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. <b>Maize</b> meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.|$|E
25|$|After the 1949 famine, the MCB {{promoted}} <b>maize</b> {{production and}} exports, but when world prices {{fell in the}} 1950s, it abandoned the import and export trade, and the Nyasaland administration discouraged <b>maize</b> production in agriculturally unsuitable areas. By 1960, government intervention in <b>maize</b> marketing was limited to purchasing sufficient <b>maize</b> for the government’s own use and for a small food reserve. The deregulation of <b>maize</b> marketing was later extended to other types of food produce in 1959.|$|E
25|$|The nixtamalization {{process was}} very {{important}} in the early Mesoamerican diet, as unprocessed <b>maize</b> is deficient in free niacin. A population depending on untreated <b>maize</b> as a staple food risks malnourishment, and {{is more likely to}} develop deficiency diseases such as pellagra. <b>Maize</b> also is deficient in essential amino acids, which can result in kwashiorkor. <b>Maize</b> cooked with lime provided niacin in this diet. Beans, when consumed with the <b>maize,</b> provided the amino acids required to balance the diet for protein.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1980s, smallholders grew local, open-pollinated {{types of}} <b>maize,</b> using seed {{reserved}} from previous crops. With adequate rain, this needed 80 to 120 days to develop fully. The hybrid <b>maize</b> {{introduced in the}} 1980s, ripened after as little as 75 days in similar conditions with sufficient fertilizer. Local <b>maize</b> benefited from fertilizer, but hybrid <b>maize</b> yielded up to 4 tonnes per hectare only if sufficient fertilizer was applied. Growing hybrid <b>maize</b> required reasonable sale prices and low fertilizer costs for farmers. However, farm incomes started to declining after 1976, and from 1981 to 1986 {{the real value of}} Malawi <b>maize</b> producer prices fell to 40% to 60% of those of other Central and East African states. Even with low fertilizer prices, hybrid <b>maize</b> growing was difficult for smallholders.|$|E
25|$|The {{indigenous}} crops {{were replaced}} slowly by other more productive crops developed in Mexico: <b>maize,</b> beans and additional varieties of squash. <b>Maize,</b> or corn, was a relative latecomer to the United States. The oldest known evidence of <b>maize</b> in Mexico dates from 6,700 BCE. The oldest evidence of <b>maize</b> cultivated in the United States is about 2,100 BCE at several locations in Arizona and New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|<b>Maize</b> and cornmeal (ground dried <b>maize)</b> {{constitute}} a staple food {{in many regions}} of the world.|$|E
25|$|<b>Maize</b> {{is central}} to Mexican food. Virtually every dish in Mexican cuisine uses <b>maize.</b> In the form of grain or cornmeal, <b>maize</b> is the main {{ingredient}} of tortillas, tamales, pozole, atole and all the dishes based on them, like tacos, quesadillas, chilaquiles, enchiladas, tostadas and many more. In Mexico even a fungus of <b>maize,</b> known as huitlacoche is considered a delicacy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Maize</b> is {{the basis}} of most Mexican cuisine, with some {{exception}} in the culinary traditions of northern Mexico, where wheat is taking the place of <b>maize</b> as the cereal base. The primary way in which <b>maize</b> is consumed in Mexico is the tortilla, {{but it is also a}} necessary input for the preparation of almost all types of tamales, atoles and snacks. The <b>maize</b> used for tortillas can be ripe and dry, but it is also consumed fresh and mature (<b>maize),</b> or soft and fresh (xilote).|$|E
25|$|Crosses {{between a}} {{particular}} teosinte variety and <b>maize</b> yield fertile offspring that are intermediate in phenotype between <b>maize</b> and teosinte. QTL analysis has also revealed some loci that when mutated in <b>maize</b> yield a teosinte-like stem or teosinte-like cobs. Molecular clock {{analysis of these}} genes estimates their origins to some 9000years ago, well in accordance with other records of <b>maize</b> domestication. It is believed that {{a small group of}} farmers must have selected some maize-like natural mutant of teosinte some 9000 years ago in Mexico, and subjected it to continuous selection to yield the <b>maize</b> plant as known today.|$|E
25|$|Domestication {{of plants}} such as <b>maize,</b> rice, barley, wheat etc. {{has also been a}} {{significant}} driving force in their evolution. Some studies have looked at the origins of the <b>maize</b> plant and found that <b>maize</b> is a domesticated derivative of a wild plant from Mexico called teosinte. Teosinte belongs to the genus Zea, just as <b>maize,</b> but bears very small inflorescence, 5–10 hard cobs, and a highly branched and spread-out stem.|$|E
25|$|In Southern Africa, <b>maize</b> is {{commonly}} called mielie (Afrikaans) or mealie (English), words {{derived from the}} Portuguese word for <b>maize,</b> milho.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Paul Mangelsdorf {{suggested}} that domesticated <b>maize</b> {{was the result}} of a hybridization event between an unknown wild <b>maize</b> and a species of Tripsacum, a related genus. This theory about the origin of <b>maize</b> has been refuted by modern genetic testing, which refutes Mangelsdorf's model and the fourth listed above.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Maize</b> Genetics Cooperation Stock Center, {{funded by}} the USDA Agricultural Research Service and located in the Department of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is a stock center of <b>maize</b> mutants. The total {{collection}} has nearly 80,000 samples. The bulk of the collection consists of several hundred named genes, plus additional gene combinations and other heritable variants. There are about 1000 chromosomal aberrations (e.g., translocations and inversions) and stocks with abnormal chromosome numbers (e.g., tetraploids). Genetic data describing the <b>maize</b> mutant stocks as well as myriad other data about <b>maize</b> genetics can be accessed at , the <b>Maize</b> Genetics and Genomics Database.|$|E
25|$|<b>Maize</b> is {{the most}} widely grown grain crop {{throughout}} the Americas, with 361 million metric tons grown in the United States in 2014 (Production table). Approximately 40% of the crop—130 million tons—is used for corn ethanol. Genetically modified <b>maize</b> made up 85% of the <b>maize</b> planted in the United States in 2009.|$|E
25|$|<b>Maize</b> {{reached the}} Southwest via an unknown route from Mexico. Its {{diffusion}} was relatively rapid. One {{theory is that}} the <b>maize</b> cultivation was carried northward from central Mexico by migrating farmers, most likely speakers of a Uto-Aztecan language. Another theory, more accepted among scholars, is that <b>maize</b> was diffused northward from group to group rather than migrants. The first cultivation of <b>maize</b> in the Southwest came during a climatic period when precipitation was relatively high. Although <b>maize</b> cultivation spread rapidly in the Southwest, the hunter-gatherers living in the region did not immediately adopt it as their primary source of nutrition, but rather integrated <b>maize</b> cultivation as one element, initially a minor element, in their foraging strategy. Hunter-gatherers usually exploit a broad spectrum of food sources to minimize risk in the event that one or more of their principal sources of food fails.|$|E
