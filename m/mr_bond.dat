25|$|Particularly {{significant}} was Daniel Bond, {{whose career}} {{started as a}} painter and japanner in Boulton's Soho Manufactory, but who is recorded as exhibiting landscapes at the Society of Artists of Great Britain in London by 1761. He was to exhibit over forty works in London over following decades and it is with him that emerges the distinctive Birmingham School of landscape painting, whose influence was to last into the mid 19th century. Bond taught drawing and had a wide influence within the town – a pupil of his exhibited A Drawing of Landscape after <b>Mr</b> <b>Bond</b> of Birmingham at the Free Society of Artists in London as early as 1763. Among Bond's other pupils was Edward Barber, who also {{established himself as a}} drawing master within Birmingham, and whose elder brother Joseph Barber had established his own academy of drawing in Great Charles Street by 1780, which was continued after his death in 1811 by his son Vincent Barber. Among Joseph Barber's pupils was Samuel Lines, who established another academy in nearby Newhall Street in 1807. It is through these networks of teaching that the Birmingham tradition of landscape was developed and sustained, with notable later figures including Thomas Baker and Thomas Creswick – a pupil of both Lines and Barber, who was to become a notable Royal Academician in the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E

Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years. Other 1980s effects also took place, with Bond smoking low-tar cigarettes and becoming increasingly health conscious.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} film, Eon Productions {{produced}} a one-hour colour television programme titled Welcome to Japan, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> first aired on 2 June 1967 in the United States on NBC. Bond regulars Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn appeared playing respectively [...] "Miss Moneypenny" [...] and [...] "Q". Kate O'Mara appears as Miss Moneypenny's assistant. The programme shows clips from You Only Live Twice and the then four existing Bond films, and contained a storyline of Moneypenny {{trying to establish}} the identity of Bond's bride.|$|E

500|$|In the 1980s, the Bond {{series was}} {{initially}} revived with new novels by John Gardner, although initially he almost turned the series down. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner {{went on to}} write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote – Licence to Kill and GoldenEye – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner stated that he wanted [...] "to bring <b>Mr</b> <b>Bond</b> into the 1980s", although he retained {{the ages of the}} characters as they were when Fleming had left them. Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years. In 1996, Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health. With the influence of the American publishers, Putnam's, the Gardner novels showed {{an increase in the number}} of Americanisms used in the book, such as a waiter wearing [...] "pants", rather than trousers, in The Man from Barbarossa. James Harker, writing in The Guardian, considered that the Gardner books were [...] "dogged by silliness", giving examples of Scorpius, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and Win, Lose or Die, where [...] "Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher".|$|E
500|$|In 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) {{approached}} Gardner {{and asked}} him to revive Ian Fleming's James Bond series of novels. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels, and the novelizations of two Bond films. Gardner stated that he wanted [...] "to bring <b>Mr</b> <b>Bond</b> into the 1980s", although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years.

James Harker, writing in The Guardian, considered that the Gardner books were [...] "dogged by silliness", giving examples of Scorpius, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and Win, Lose or Die, where [...] "Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher". Whilst Gardner's Bond novels received a mixed reaction from the critics, they were popular and a number appeared in The New York Times Best Seller list, bringing the author commercial success. Gardner had an ambivalent view on being the Bond author, once saying that [...] "I'm very grateful to have been selected to keep Bond alive. But I'd much rather be remembered for my own work than I would for Bond", while saying on another occasion that [...] "I remain proud that my contribution to the Bond saga played a great part in its development". In the mid-1990s, after discovering he had esophageal cancer, Gardner officially retired from writing Bond novels and Glidrose Publications quickly chose Raymond Benson to continue the literary stories of James Bond.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997 Phillip and Robert King {{published}} {{a collection of}} bridge-related short stories entitled Your Deal, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> was published by B. T. Batsford (...) [...] The title piece is a short story featuring James Bond, who is assigned by M to defeat a villain named Saladin who is threatening to explode nuclear bombs in several major cities. Bond impersonates real-life bridge expert Zia Mahmood in order to combat Saladin at the bridge table. The short story includes bridge game charts {{in a similar fashion}} to that used by Ian Fleming in Moonraker, in which Bond similarly plays a high-stakes game of bridge against that novel's villain. The book, despite being issued by a major publisher and containing undisguised references to the Bond characters, contains no reference to Ian Fleming Publications, suggesting the use of Bond, M and Miss Moneypenny is unofficial, and rendering this story likely apocryphal. Its placement in the Bond canon, therefore, is unknown. The story contains a cultural reference to Star Trek, however, which sets it outside of Fleming's timeline. It {{should not be confused with}} the 1987 John Gardner Bond novel, No Deals, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Alexander Leathes Donaldson was {{admitted}} an Attorney at Westminster in 1865, {{and to the}} local Bar in 1873; John Burkinshaw {{was admitted}} an Attorney at Westminster in 1863, and to the local Bar in 1874. When <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> retired his place on the Legislative Council was given to Mr. Burkinshaw; in 1893 it went to Mr. Donaldson, in 1896 back to Mr. Burkinshaw, Mr. Donaldson having retired in 1895. Mr. Burkinshaw continued to be on Council until 1902, when he retired….These two gentlemen built up the leading European practice of their day, and their jack-in-the-box possession of {{a seat on the}} Legislative Council undoubtedly gave the Firm great influence.

60|$|The {{conversation}} now {{fell upon}} the theatre. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe {{was determined to}} have a theatre. He believed it was reserved for him to revive the drama. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe piqued himself upon his patronage of the stage. He certainly had a great admiration of actresses. There {{was something in the}} management of a great theatre which pleased the somewhat imperial fancy of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe. The manager of a great theatre is a kind of monarch. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe longed to seat himself on the throne, with the prettiest women in London for his court, and all his fashionable friends rallying round their sovereign. He had an impression that great results might be obtained with his organising energy and illimitable capital. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe had unbounded confidence in the power of capital. Capital was his deity. He was confident that it could always produce alike genius and triumph. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe was right: capital is a wonderful thing, but we are scarcely aware of this fact until we are past thirty; and then, by some singular process, which we will not now stop to analyse, one's capital is in general sensibly diminished. As men advance in life, all passions resolve themselves into money. Love, ambition, even poetry, end in this.|$|E

50|$|Southwest of Swift Hall and {{connected}} to it by a beautiful stone cloister is the Joseph Bond Chapel.

5000|$|Chris {{comes back}} from Bonds' pub with another stick of {{dynamite}} and they question George again with Price in the room. The suspect is charged and Caroline asks Alex for a drink. She asks Alex {{to spy on}} her fellow male workers and when she refuses Caroline says she's glad the only thing Alex shares with her daughter is her name because she would be ashamed to have Alex as a daughter. In revenge Alex goes to sleep with Danny but when reaching his office discovers him having sex with someone else. Gene suspects that George's father, David Bonds, is the actual bomber and brings him in for questioning. George confesses to protect his father. As George is being booked, Hunt pulls out a plastic bag and tosses it to <b>Mrs</b> <b>Bonds</b> and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bonds</b> ducks under a desk thinking it to contain dynamite. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bonds</b> was the actual bomber (having previously been an explosive expert serving in North Africa during the Second World War). At Danny's party to celebrate the wedding however Alex notices Bonds' son acting suspicious. Alex and Gene shout to everyone to run and Bonds shouts [...] "we are all prostitutes", a reference to his favorite song by The Pop Group, before blowing himself up.

60|$|Dinner and Lord Catchimwhocan were {{announced}} at the same moment; Captain Armine found himself seated next to the Count Mirabel. The dinners at <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe's were dinners which his guests came to eat. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe had engaged for his club-house the most celebrated of living artists, a gentleman who, it was said, received a thousand a-year, whose convenience was studied by a chariot, and amusement secured by a box at the French play. There was, therefore, at first little conversation, save criticism on the performances before them, and that chiefly panegyrical; each dish was delicious, each wine exquisite; and yet, even in these occasional remarks, Ferdinand {{was pleased with the}} lively fancy of his neighbour, affording an elegant contrast to the somewhat gross unction with which Lord Castlefyshe, whose very soul seemed wrapped up in his occupation, occasionally expressed himself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have several}} gentlemen waiting,' said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe; 'I am sorry I cannot take this {{opportunity}} of cultivating your acquaintance, Captain Armine, but I should esteem it a great honour if you would dine with me to-day.

Also, the AF2011A1 is seen dual-wielded by Milla Jovovich as Alice in the trailer of Resident Evil: The Final Chapter.

But unless otherwise determined by a court of law, which the Georgia Legislature is not, he is entitled to express them." ...|$|R
60|$|Ferdinand {{remained}} {{talking for}} some time with Lord Fitzwarrene. By degrees the great saloon had become somewhat thinner: some had stolen away to the House, where a division was expected; quiet men, who just looked in after dinner, had retired; and the play-men were engaged in the contiguous apartments. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe approached Ferdinand, and Lord Fitzwarrene took this opportunity of withdrawing.|$|E
60|$|They ascended a {{magnificent}} staircase, and entered a sumptuous and crowded saloon, {{in which the}} entrance of Count Mirabel and his friends made no little sensation. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bond</b> Sharpe glided along, dropping oracular sentences, without condescending to stop to speak to those whom he addressed. Charley Doricourt and Mr. Blandford walked away together, towards a further apartment. Lord Castlefyshe and Lord Catchimwhocan were soon busied with écarté.|$|E
