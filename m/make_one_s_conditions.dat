40|$|In {{the field}} of bioethics, freedom and {{autonomy}} assume the ability of self-regulation and determination. If one {{has the ability to}} <b>make</b> <b>one</b> <b>ś</b> own decisions, then one represents an autonomous and free person. Such a view of autonomy faces many difficulties, because it ultimately limits those who can be considered autonomous. The Orthodox theology of the one Hypostasis of Jesus Christ presents an alternative to such a notions of autonomy, freedom and personhood. A person can be said to possess freedom and autonomy not when she or he can make decisions for herself or himself, but when she or he is perfected in Christ. When people begin to live in communion with one another and with God, their freedom increases. In this essay, the author introduces the Orthodox theology of the two natures of Christ, united to the Divine Hypostasis of the Logos at the moment of the Incarnation, and its implications for human freedom and autonomy...|$|R

40|$|A simple, {{reproducible}} {{and quantitative}} method for evaluating certain non-specific immunological inhibitors {{in a variety}} of biological fluids is described. Human lymphocytes were stimulated with PHA in the presence of colchicine. Phytohaemagglutinin stimulated a large percentage of cells and colchicine's selective blockage of mitosis limited the stimulated cells to <b>one</b> <b>S</b> phase. These <b>conditions</b> effectively established a maximum amount of DNA synthesis within each culture. Quantification of suppression was then achieved by measuring a decrease from this maximum. The PHA-colchicine assay was successfully used to quantify inhibition by normal plasma, normal mouse sera, mouse neonate sera, murine Ehrlich's and sarcoma I ascitic fluids and an immunoregulatory alpha-globulin peptide preparation. Because of the ability to obtain a specific inhibitory activity for the suppressive factors, this assay was particularly suited for following the isolation of inhibitors during the fractionation of suppressive substances from complex fluids...|$|R

40|$|We show that, in {{frameworks}} of the economical 3 - 3 - 1 model, all fermions get masses. At {{the tree}} level, one up-quark and two down-quarks are massless, but the one-loop corrections give all quarks the consistent masses. This conclusion is in contradiction {{to the previous}} analysis in which, the third scalar triplet has been introduced. This result {{is based on the}} key properties of the model: First, there are three quite different scales of vacuum expectation values: ∼ O(1) TeV, v ≈ 246 GeV and u ∼ O(1) GeV. Second, there exist two types of Yukawa couplings with different strengths: the lepton-number conserving couplings h's and the lepton-number violating <b>ones</b> <b>s's</b> satisfying the <b>condition</b> in which the second are much smaller than the first ones: s ≪ h. With the acceptable set of parameters, numerical evaluation shows that in this model, masses of the exotic quarks also have different scales, namely, the U exotic quark (q_U = 2 / 3) gains mass m_U ≈ 700 GeV, while the D_ exotic quarks (q_D_ = - 1 / 3) have masses in the TeV scale: m_D_∈ 10 80 TeV.

40|$|Blood lactate {{concentration}} and mean power output were examined over {{a series of}} maximal intermittent exercise bouts with varying recovery patterns. Thirteen elite male cyclists completed four randomly assigned experimental conditions. Each exercise/recovery condition consisted of twelve 10 s maximal exercise bouts on a Monark cycle ergometer. Four different recovery patterns (30, 60, 90 and 120 s) followed the repeated 10 s all-out efforts. Results revealed that the mean power output averaged over the 12 trials was 12. 7, 13. 0, 13. 2 and 13. 4 W/kg, for the 30, 60, 90 and 120 <b>s</b> <b>conditions,</b> respectively. Blood lactate concentration during exercise were 9. 9, 9. 2, 6. 5 and 6. 0 mmol/ 1, for the 30, 60, 90 and 120 <b>s</b> <b>conditions,</b> respectively. The 30 and 60 <b>s</b> <b>conditions</b> yielded significantly lower mean power output values compared to the 90 and 120 <b>s</b> <b>conditions.</b> Following the repeated maximal 10 s efforts, blood lactate concentration was significantly greater in the 30 and 60 <b>s</b> recovery <b>conditions</b> compared to the 90 and 120 <b>s</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

A brief overview of some theorists??? views of why children need to play and the usual sequence {{of the development of}} play are presented. The benefits of play are described, focusing on the child's physical, emotional, cognitive, and social development. Special emphasis placed on the development and importance of imaginative play. The necessary role of the adult is explained. A description of some recent research is included which deals with children's thematic play. The sequence of the development of imaginative play is traced. The contribution which imaginative play can <b>make</b> to <b>one</b> 1 <b>s</b> development is also presented. The importance of systematized observation is stressed; suggestions are made regarding how to refine this skill. Observations made at several local schools are included. Implications for parents and teachers are discussed with suggestions for designing curriculum and providing children with many opportunities for play.

40|$|We {{attempt to}} {{elucidate}} the conditions required on Girard 2 ̆ 7 s candidates of reducibility (in French, 2 ̆ 2 candidats de reductibilité	 2 ̆ 2) {{in order to}} establish certain properties of various typed lambda calculi, such as strong normalization and Church-Rosser property. We present two generalizations of the candidates of reducibility, an untyped version in the line of Tait and Mitchell, and a typed version which is an adaptation of Girard 2 ̆ 7 s original method. As an application of this general result, we give two proofs of strong normalization for the second-order polymorphic lambda calculus under βη-reduction (and thus under β-reduction). We present two sets of conditions for the typed version of the candidates. The first set consists of conditions similar to those used by Stenlund (basically the typed version of Tait 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>conditions),</b> and the second set consists of Girard 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> original <b>conditions.</b> We also compare these conditions, and prove that Girard 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>conditions</b> are stronger than Tait 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>conditions.</b> We give a new proof of the Church-Rosser theorem for both β-reduction and βη-reduction, using the modified version of Girard 2 ̆ 7 s method.

We conclude by sketching the extension of the above results to Girard 2 ̆ 7 s higher-order polymorphic calculus Fω, and in appendix 1, to Fω with product types...|$|R
