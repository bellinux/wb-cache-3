40|$|AAA Interface Tool as {{developed}} by the Carnegie Mellon University MSL is a tool for simulating, programming and controlling mechanical assembly work in a novel way. For the assembly of small size components, a 3 D virtual <b>Minifactory</b> has been developed based on AAA Interface Tool. The assembly of 3 D MEMS structures goes beyond the actual capabilities of the virtual <b>minifactory.</b> The micro components are manufactured in a plane, from which {{they have to be}} collected, rotated by 90 ° and pushed into holders on another plane.

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the efforts to}} incorporate force sensing into the <b>minifactory</b> environment. The <b>minifactory</b> is a high-precision assembly system that makes use of low DOF robots to cooperatively perform higher DOF tasks. <b>Minifactory</b> targets the assembly of small mechatronic devices, many of which require high tolerance vertical insertion tasks. Force sensing provides a means for instantiating cooperative behaviors between robotic agents to perform such insertion tasks. Force sensing is a natural medium in which position and force information is acquired, allowing the compliancy needed to perform the task to be built into the behaviors of the robots performing the task. Integrating force sensing into the <b>minifactory</b> required that a custom force sensor be developed as well as control and communication systems to coordinate the action of two <b>minifactory</b> agents. Test results are presented from experiments in which two high-precision 2 -DOF robotic agents cooperatively perform contact and "peg-in-hole" tasks. These results document the first experimental confirmation of high-bandwidth (? 100 Hz) coordination between agents within the <b>minifactory</b> system...|$|E
40|$|On-demand {{small part}} {{assembly}} sets high standards on production lines: the focus lies {{on a high}} level of flexibility regarding the utilized tools and not on high throughput. This means that the production sequence varies over extended time spans, and thus needs adjustments depending on customer orders and processes. High level of flexibility also plays a crucial role in bio manufacturing engineering since single biological systems set highly different standards on automation and, therefore, the manual workplace is in many cases still the better choice. However, this manual work is often tedious and monotonous and could be perfectly replaced by automated systems, as long as flexibility can be guaranteed and manual intervention is still possible. Therefore, Fraunhofer IPA has developed a simulation tool in order to demonstrate the potential of flexible <b>minifactories,</b> so-called desktop factories (DTF), in the production of small parts {{as well as in the}} field of bio manufacturing engineering. Focus of the simulation is the design of <b>minifactories</b> for given processes, regarding their dimensions, number, types and arrangement of devices.

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} new {{end effector}} developments incorporating microscope vision and gripping mechanisms for {{pick and place}} assembly of small components in a <b>minifactory</b> environment. Instead of performing microassembly under a microscope, in <b>minifactory</b> each assembly agent is equipped with its own microscope. This arrangement facilitates flow-through manufacturing as opposed to work cell approaches. To this end, we have developed a series of new manipulator end effectors, each of which incorporates a long-range objective lens, coaxial illumination, folded optics, and a camera. Modular gripping and other mechanisms are mounted on a universal plate beneath the end effector. A first type uses vacuum and pressure to pick and place components of a lens assembly. A second type incorporates an off-the-shelf tweezer with electromagnetic actuation. The third type incorporates a novel rotation mechanism and MEMS-based gripper which can pick a part from a wafer, rotate it through an angle, and snap the part into a receptacle on a second wafer...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the integration of}} machine vision into the <b>minifactory</b> environment. <b>Minifactory</b> is an automated factory system being developed at the Microdynamic Systems Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University and is aimed toward the assembly of small mechatronic devices. Machine vision can aid assembly systems by {{eliminating the need for}} complicated part holding jigs, end effectors, and part feeding equipment. In addition, the position accuracy of a visually servoed robot can be made relatively insensitive to robot calibration errors. By using the visual control and communications systems described in this report, two high-precision 2 -DOF robotic agents were visually guided to precisely align parts of a sub-assembly. Test results show that open-loop look-and-move alignment of parts took an average of 3. 7 iterations and 3. 6 seconds while visual servoing alignment took an average of 1. 3 seconds. The standard deviation of the visual servoing alignment errors for the u and v axes were 4. 6 mand 5 m respectively. However, they were limited by tracker noise which was approximately 10 m peak to peak {{with a standard deviation of}} 2 mintheu axis of the image plane and 20 m peak to peak with a standard deviation of 6 minthev axis. Overall, the vision project’s greatest success was making two 2 -DOF agents transiently cooperate to function as a single 4 -DOF robot to perform visual servoing tasks...|$|E

Because many products will be very small and complex, or larger products will incorporate smaller complex subproducts, there will be an increasing need to provide technologies and systems for sensor-based micromanipulation and automated precision assembly. For the past several years we have been developing an architecture for tabletop precision assembly systems. Our goal is to improve the design, deployment, and reconfiguration of automated assembly systems for small mechatronic products requiring high precision.

This {{is especially true for}} a variety of precision mechatronic products. To meet new and changing market needs, the difficulties of integrating their systems must be significantly reduced. Since 1994, the Microdynamic Systems Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University has been developing an automation framework, called Agile Assembly Architecture (AAA). Additionally to the concept, a prototype instantiation, {{in the form of a}} modular tabletop precision assembly system termed <b>Minifactory,</b> has been developed. The platform, provided by the <b>Minifactory</b> and AAA, is able to support and integrate various precision manufacturing processes. These are needed to assemble a large variety of small mechatronic products. In this thesis various enhancements for a second generation agent-based micro assembly system are designed, implemented, tested and improved. The project includes devising methods for tray feeding of precision high-value parts, micro fastening techniques and additional work on visual- and force-servoing. To help achieving these functions, modular and reconfigurable robot end-effectors for handling millimeter sized parts have been designed and built for the existing robotic agents. New concepts for robot end effectors to grasp and release tiny parts, including image processing and intelligent control software, were required and needed to be implemented in the prototype setup. These concepts need to distinguish themselves largely from traditional handling paradigms, in order to solve problems introduced by electrostatic and surface tension forces, that are dominant in manipulating parts that are millimeter and less in size. In order to have a modular system, the factory the main part of this project was the initialization and auto calibration of the different agents. The main focus, of this research, is on improving the design, deployment and reconfiguration capabilities of automated assembly systems for precision mechatronic products. This helps to shorten the development process as well as the assembly of factory systems.   A strategic application for this approach is the automated assembly of small sensors, actuators, medical devices and chip-scale atomic systems such as atomic clocks, magnetometers and gyroscopes...|$|E

The problem is posed as one of sensor-based coverage, in which a complete exploration of the environment is produced without any initial information.
