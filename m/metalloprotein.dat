25|$|Vertebrate {{red blood}} cells consist mainly of hemoglobin, a complex <b>metalloprotein</b> {{containing}} heme groups whose iron atoms temporarily bind to oxygen molecules (O2) in the lungs or gills and release them throughout the body.

Structural characterization of <b>metalloproteins</b> and identification of metal coordination features including numbers and types of ligands and metal-ligand geometry, and mapping the structural and dynamic changes upon metal binding are significant for understanding biological functions of <b>metalloproteins.</b> NMR spectroscopy has long been used as an invaluable tool for structure and dynamic studies of macromolecules. Here we focus on the application of NMR spectroscopy in characterization of <b>metalloproteins,</b> including structural studies and identification of metal coordination spheres by hetero-/homo-nuclear metal NMR spectroscopy.

25|$|Three {{classes of}} RNR have similar {{mechanisms}} for {{the reduction of}} NDPs, but differ in the domain that generates the free radical, the specific metal in the <b>metalloprotein</b> structure, and the electron donors. All classes use free-radical chemistry. Class I reductases use an iron center with ferrous to ferric conversion to generate a tyrosyl free radical. Reduction of NDP substrates occurs under aerobic conditions. Class I reductases are divided into IA and IB {{due to differences in}} regulation. Class IA reductases are distributed in eukaryotes, eubacteria, bacteriophages, and viruses. Class IB reductases are found in eubacteria. Class IB reductases can also use a radical generated with the stabilization of a binuclear manganese center. Class II reductases generate a free radical by mechanisms involving 5’-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin (coenzyme B12) and have a simpler structure than class I and class III reductases. Reduction of NDPs or ribonucleotide 5’-triphosphates (NTPs) occurs under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Class II reductases are distributed in archaebacteria, eubacteria, and bacteriophages. Class III reductases use a glycine radical generated {{with the help of an}} S-adenosyl methionine and an iron sulphur center. Reduction of NTPs is limited to anaerobic conditions. Class III reductases are distributed in archaebacteria, eubacteria, and bacteriophages. Organisms are not limited to having one class of enzymes. For example, E. coli have both class I and class III RNR.|$|E

Bioinformatic tools have been developed to predict <b>metalloproteins</b> encoded by an organism based only on its genome sequence. Its function and the type of metal binder can also be predicted via a bioinformatics approach. Paracoccidioides complex includes termodimorphic pathogenic fungi that are found as saprobic mycelia in the environment and as yeast, the parasitic form, in host tissues. They are the etiologic agents of Paracoccidioidomycosis, a prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. Many <b>metalloproteins</b> are important for the virulence of several pathogenic microorganisms. Accordingly, the present work aimed to predict the cooper, iron and zinc proteins encoded by the genomes of three phylogenetic species of Paracoccidioides (Pb 01, Pb 03 and Pb 18). The <b>metalloproteins</b> were identified using bioinformatics approaches based on structure, annotation and domains. Cu-, Fe- and Zn-binding proteins represent 7 % of the total proteins encoded by Paracoccidioides spp. genomes. Zinc proteins were the most abundant <b>metalloproteins,</b> representing 5. 7 % of the fungus proteome, whereas copper and iron proteins represent 0. 3 % and 1. 2 %, respectively. Functional classification revealed that <b>metalloproteins</b> are related to many cellular processes. Furthermore, it was observed that many of these <b>metalloproteins</b> serve as virulence factors in the biology of the fungus. Thus, it is concluded that the Cu, Fe and Zn metalloproteomes of the Paracoccidioides spp. are of the utmost importance for the biology and virulence of these particular human pathogens...|$|R
