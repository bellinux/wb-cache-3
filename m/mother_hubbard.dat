60|$|She {{laughed with}} the childlike frankness of the native. She slipped a dry <b>Mother</b> <b>Hubbard</b> {{over her head}} and, letting down the wet one, stepped out of it. She wrung it out {{and was ready to}} go. She paused a moment irresolutely and then sauntered off. The night fell suddenly.|$|E
60|$|Neilson gave a gasp, for at {{that moment}} a woman came in. She was a native, a woman of {{somewhat}} commanding presence, stout without being corpulent, dark, for the natives grow darker with age, with very grey hair.

60|$|After this memorable event, I {{went to the}} hatter's, and the bootmaker's, and the hosier's, {{and felt}} rather like <b>Mother</b> <b>Hubbard's</b> dog whose outfit {{required}} the services of so many trades. I also went to the coach-office and took my place for seven o'clock on Saturday morning. It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated his mind upon me. When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards Pumblechook's, and, as I approached that gentleman's place of business, I saw him standing at his door.|$|R
60|$|Bateman {{shook hands}} with her. She had dark, splendid eyes and a red mouth tremulous with laughter; but her skin was brown, and her curling hair, {{rippling}} down her-shoulders, was coal black.

She was like a goddess of the Polynesian spring.|$|E
60|$|At {{first she}} thought them rubbish. But he laughed, and she laughed. They became {{to her a}} huge joke. Old King Cole she thought was Brangwen. <b>Mother</b> <b>Hubbard</b> was Tilly, her mother was the old woman {{who lived in a}} shoe. It was a huge, it was a frantic delight to the child, this nonsense, after her years with her mother, after the poignant folk-tales she had had from her mother, which always troubled and mystified her soul.|$|E
60|$|It was in {{consequence}} of this that he had his first violent scene with Ethel. Smarting with humiliation and unwilling {{to go back to}} the hotel, he went home that afternoon earlier than usual. He found Ethel dressing to go out. As a rule she lay about in a <b>Mother</b> <b>Hubbard,</b> barefoot, with a flower in her dark hair; but now, in white silk stockings and high-heeled shoes, she was doing up a pink muslin dress which was the newest she had.|$|E

Examples of some activities are: (1) The Gingerbread Man in which students obtain information about objects (gingerbread cookies) and events in their environment by looking, touching, smelling, listening, and tasting; (2) <b>Mother</b> <b>Hubbard's</b> Cupboard where students identify unique qualities of an object (dog milk bones) by comparing it with similar objects; (3) Old Mother Goose and the Golden Egg: A Communicating Activity in which graphs are used to analyze information; (4) There Was an Old Woman: A Comparing Activity where children try developing compare-and-contras...|$|R
