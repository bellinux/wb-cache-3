40|$|The National Residue Control Plan (NRCP) is a {{programme}} {{for examining}} foods of animal origin, such as meat, milk and honey, for residues and contaminants. Animal-based products {{from third countries}} are examined {{on the basis of}} the Import Control Plan (ICP). <b>Maximum</b> <b>quantities</b> and/or maximum levels which may not be exceeded have been established in many cases for residues of pharmacologically effective substances and environmental contaminants, such as heavy metals and dioxins, in foods of animal origin. The goal of food monitoring within the scope of the NRCP and ICP is to check for compliance with these <b>maximum</b> <b>quantities</b> and levels, to disclose the illegal use of prohibited or unauthorised substances and to identify the causes of increased levels of residues and contaminants. Sampling is carried out risk-oriented. […] The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the health risk of the residue findings. […] In the view of the BfR, the total number of exceedances continues to lie on a low level. The levels of heavy metals and other contaminants determined in the NRCP in offal, fatty tissue and muscle give no indication of an additional health risk to consumers in the opinion of the BfR. Even in cases in which the maximum levels for lead, cadmium or mercury were exceeded, no health impairment is to be expected given the typical eating habits of the German population. It must be emphasised, however, that the overall intake of lead and cadmium from all foods, both animal and plant-based, is high. As a basic principle, further efforts have to be made to minimise the levels of certain heavy metals and organochlorinated compounds (PCB and dioxins) ...|$|E
