5|$|Though the San Marino Football Federation {{formed in}} 1931, the {{federation}} did not establish a national team until 1986, {{when a team}} representing the Federation played Canada's Olympic team in an unofficial international.

5|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} record type are those achieved {{at a specific}} competition. For example, the Olympic records represent the best performances by athletes at the Summer Olympics.

Other record types include: stadium records, records by age range, records by disability, and records by institution or organisation.

5|$|This coup {{was soon}} {{followed}} {{by his first}} world title in 1942. Over the following three decades, Crane won almost two dozen <b>major</b> <b>championships,</b> including the World Crown in 1946, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1972, the Ballantine International Championship in 1965, the International Roundrobin championship in 1968, and the World Series of Billiards in 1978 at age 65. Of these triumphs, his win at the 1966 World Crown is the most celebrated. At that tournament, he ran 150 and out in the finals, never letting his opponent {{back to the table}} after an early safety battle; an accomplishment that has never been equaled. Crane also holds the record for the most runner-up finishes for the World Crown with 13.|$|E
5|$|Another rivalry {{leading up}} to the event was between The Undertaker and Batista over the World Heavyweight Championship. At the Royal Rumble in January, The Undertaker won the 2007 Royal Rumble match. As a result, he was given the right to a title match at WrestleMania for any of WWE's three <b>major</b> <b>championships</b> (ECW World, World Heavyweight, or WWE). On the February 5 episode of Raw, Undertaker teased all three World Champions (Bobby Lashley, Batista, and John Cena). Undertaker then chose World Heavyweight Champion Batista as his {{opponent}} to face at WrestleMania 23. At WrestleMania, The Undertaker defeated Batista to win the World Heavyweight Championship to extend his WrestleMania undefeated streak to 15-0. Their rivalry, however, did not end, as General Manager Theodore Long booked a Last Man Standing match—a match where the first person unable to respond to a ten count by the referee lost—between The Undertaker and Batista at Backlash.|$|E
