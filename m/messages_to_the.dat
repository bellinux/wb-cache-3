5|$|Bungie first {{introduced}} the Halo series publicly in 1999 by sending the Cortana Letters, {{a series of}} cryptic email <b>messages,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> maintainer of marathon.bungie.org, a fan site for one of Bungie's previous series, the Marathon Trilogy. The strategic use of cryptic messages in a publicity campaign was repeated in I Love Bees, a promotion for Halo 2. Although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be canon, Cortana speaks {{many of the same}} lines in Halo 3. According to C. J. Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics, the studio used the character here to give story clues without actually revealing the story.|$|E

5|$|E.V. Ramasamy also {{blamed the}} capitalists for their control of machineries, {{creating}} difficulties for the workers. According to his philosophy, rationalism, {{which has to}} lead the way for peaceful life to all, had resulted in causing poverty and worries to the people because of dominating forces. He stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self-respect or scientific knowledge. An example he gave was the West sending <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planets, while the Tamil society in India were sending rice and cereals to their dead forefathers through the Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the formal}} {{ceremony}} of granting assent in parliament {{has not been}} regularly used since the early 20th century.

A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the Royal Assent in person in parliament since 1875.|$|E

5|$|Outside the pays d'en haut, most warriors of the {{influential}} Iroquois Confederacy {{did not participate}} in Pontiac's War because of their alliance with the British, known as the Covenant Chain. However, the westernmost Iroquois nation, the Seneca tribe, had become disaffected with the alliance. As early as 1761, the Seneca began to send out war <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes, urging them to unite in an attempt to drive out the British. When the war finally came in 1763, many Seneca were quick to take action.|$|E
5|$|After {{confirming}} {{the development of}} a tropical depression, authorities in Costa Rica issued a green alert for coastal regions on September14. The following day, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Atlantic coast of the country. National television and radio stations broadcast warning <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public, and emergency crews were dispatched in case conditions were to warrant intervention. This helped with the effective and timely clearing of hospitals, as well as the evacuation of residents in high-risk zones. A tropical storm warning was posted for the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on September15, extending south from Puerto Cabezas to the adjacent islands. In Honduras, early storm warnings allowed several hundred residents to evacuate well ahead of Gert's arrival. Once it became evident that the storm would strike the Yucat√°n Peninsula, coastal areas from Belize northward to Cozumel, Mexico were placed under a tropical storm warning on September17 until Gert's landfall the next day.|$|E

The Vietnam People's Army responded by moving its troops to areas attacked by Kampuchea and, on 7 June 1977, Vietnam proposed high-level talks to discuss outstanding issues. On 18 June 1977, the Kampuchean Government replied by demanding that Vietnam remove all of its military units from the disputed areas, and create a demilitarised zone between the opposing forces.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{afternoon}} of 3 April, Moore considered conducting a further raid on Kaafjord the next day. He decided against doing so as the preliminary assessment of photos taken during the attack had concluded that Tirpitz was badly damaged. Moore was also aware that his aircrew were fatigued, and was reluctant to expose them to what would now be alert defences. Accordingly, he ordered that the fleet return to base, and it arrived at Scapa Flow in the afternoon of 6 April. King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent congratulatory <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fleet, but both Churchill and Cunningham were concerned that Tirpitz could be returned to service. Cunningham also regretted Moore's decision not to launch a further strike on 4 April.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of generations, the cheela come to worship the humans' {{spacecraft}} as a god, and their records of its satellites' movements cause them to develop writing. Several generations later, the cheela build an arena to accommodate thousands of worshippers. The humans notice this novel and very regular feature, conclude that intelligent beings inhabit the star, and use a laser to send simple messages. Cheela astronomers gradually realize that these are diagrams of the spaceships, its satellites and its crew ‚Äì impossibly spindly creatures, who communicate with frustrating slowness, and are apparently almost 10% {{as long as the}} cheela's great arena. A cheela engineer proposes to send <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> humans.

5|$|The Minister Steward (Shaofu Â∞ëÂ∫ú), {{also known}} as the Privy Treasurer and Small Treasurer, served the emperor exclusively, {{providing}} him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment. For this purpose he was given responsibility for the emperor's personal finances during Western Han, yet this responsibility was transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han. Although he was not a castrated eunuch, many of his subordinates were, since his ministry managed the imperial harem housing concubines. His secretaries were headed by a Prefect of the Masters of Writing (Shangshu ling Â∞öÊõ∏‰ª§). The secretaries were responsible for relaying all written <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> emperor, official correspondence with Excellencies, senior ministers, provincial authorities, common people who submitted memorials to the throne, and non-Han-Chinese peoples within and outside the empire. Since the Masters of Writing were not eunuchs, and thus not allowed into the imperial harem, Emperor Wu established an all-eunuch office of secretaries for the inner palace, which was abolished in 29 BC.|$|E
5|$|The Skidi {{people of}} Native Americans saw {{the stars of}} Corona Borealis {{representing}} a council of stars whose chief was Polaris. The constellation also symbolised the smokehole over a fireplace, which conveyed their <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gods, {{as well as how}} chiefs should come together to consider matters of importance. The Shawnee people saw the stars as the Heavenly Sisters, who descended from the sky every night to dance on earth. Alphecca signifies the youngest and most comely sister, who was seized by a hunter who transformed into a field mouse to get close to her. They married though she later returned to the sky, with her heartbroken husband and son following later. The Mi'kmaq of eastern Canada saw Corona Borealis as Mskegw«ím, the den of the celestial bear (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta Ursae Majoris).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted. Pedro de Alvarado camped in {{the centre of}} the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy. They managed to catch some locals and used them to send <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tz'utujil lords, ordering them to submit to the king of Spain. The Tz'utujil leaders responded by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche. Three days after Pedro de Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors. A short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain, although Alvarado did not name them in his letters; they confirmed Kaqchikel reports that further out on the Pacific plain was the kingdom called Izcuintepeque in Nahuatl, or Panatacat in Kaqchikel, whose inhabitants were warlike and hostile towards their neighbours.|$|E

5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way sensations of climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
5|$|While {{fighting}} the Lydians, Cyrus had sent <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ionians {{asking them to}} revolt against Lydian rule, which the Ionians had refused to do. After Cyrus completed the conquest of Lydia, the Ionian cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms {{as they had been}} subjects of Croesus. Cyrus refused, citing the Ionians' unwillingness to help him previously. The Ionians thus prepared to defend themselves, and Cyrus sent the Median general Harpagus to conquer Ionia. He first attacked Phocaea; the Phocaeans decided to entirely abandon their city and sail into exile in Sicily, rather than become Persian subjects (although many subsequently returned). Some Teians also chose to emigrate when Harpagus attacked Teos, {{but the rest of the}} Ionians remained, and were in turn conquered.|$|E
