After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E

25|$|During {{the twentieth}} century the {{relationship}} between science and spirituality has been influenced both by Freudian psychology, which has accentuated the boundaries between the two areas by accentuating individualism and secularism, and by developments in particle physics, which reopened the debate about complementarity between scientific and religious discourse and rekindled for <b>many</b> <b>an</b> interest in holistic conceptions of reality. These holistic conceptions were championed by New Age spiritualists in a type of quantum mysticism that they claim justifies their spiritual beliefs, though quantum physicists themselves on the whole reject such attempts as being pseudoscientific.|$|E
25|$|Steve Marriott {{was born}} on 30 January 1947 at East Ham Memorial Hospital, Plashet, East Ham, (London, E7), England to parents Kay and Bill Marriott who lived at Strone Road, Manor Park. Born three weeks {{premature}} and weighing just , he developed jaundice and was kept in hospital four weeks before being well enough to go home. Marriott came from a working-class background and attended Monega Junior School. His father Bill worked as a printer and later owned a jellied eels stall, called 'Bill's Eels', outside the Ruskin Arms hotel. For a short time he also sold pie and mash. Kay worked at the Tate & Lyle factory in Silvertown. Bill was an accomplished pub pianist and the life and soul of <b>many</b> <b>an</b> 'East End' night. Bill bought Marriott a ukulele and harmonica which Marriott taught himself to play. Marriott showed an early interest in singing and performing, busking at local bus-stops for extra pocket money and winning talent contests during the family's annual holiday to Jaywick Holiday camp near Clacton-on-Sea.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{well known}} local story and one version given by Robert Cunningham in 1740 in his manuscript, {{entitled}} the Right Honorable the Earl of Glencairn's family, is that MacBeth murders his cousin, King Duncan I. The king's son, Malcolm Canmore (big head in Gaelic) tries to reach temporary safe refuge in his castle of Corsehill (also Crosshill). MacBeth's men were almost upon Malcolm when he sees a peasant, Friskin (or Friskine), turning hay in a barn (or pasture) nearby. Friskin hides Malcolm who then escapes to England with Friskin as a retainer. King Harthacanute of England and Norway gave them protection. When Harthacanute died his successor King Edward the Confessor gave Malcolm an army which permitted him to conquer Scotland and kill King MacBeth. The grateful King Malcolm III (1031 to 1093) gave Friskine the thanedom or Baillery of Cunninghame and the family took this name, together with the motto of 'Over Fork Over' which they retain to this day. It is {{also said that the}} Cunninghams were 'Masters of the king's horses' and that they took their motto from this position in the 'punning way' which is typical of the armorial bearings and mottos of <b>many</b> <b>an</b> aristocratic family.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{principal}} causes for {{the dangers of}} the streets of London, Moreton lists the abuse of alcohol specifically geneva or gin. In the Gin Era of 1720–50 very cheap liquors were sold indiscriminately, often resulting in a debauch of spirit-drinking, whose effects were seen on the streets, in the workhouses, in the growing misery of the poor and in an increase of criminality and violent acts. Moreton argues that this wicked trade will be the doom of the English nation, and it represents a real threat to the entire community: suppose a man able to maintain himself and family by his trade, {{and at the same time}} to be a Geneva drinker. This fellow first makes himself incapable of working by being continually drunk; which runs him behindhand, so that he either pawns, or neglects his work, for which reason nobody will employ him. At last, fear of arrests, his own hunger, the cries of a family for bread, his natural desire to support an irregular life, and a propense hatred to labour, turn but too <b>many</b> <b>an</b> honest tradesman into an arrant desperate rogue. And these are commonly the means that furnish us with thieves and villains in general.|$|E
25|$|Australia started shakily, with Adam Gilchrist playing-and-missing and edging {{one shot}} over Andrew Strauss at third man, who miscued {{the path of}} the ball, as the Australians got eight off the first over bowled by Darren Gough. With Gilchrist finally taking one liberty too <b>many,</b> <b>an</b> easy catch was given, and Kevin Pietersen took it to remove arguably the most {{dangerous}} batsman in this format. On the next ball, Hayden was out, caught by Pietersen for 6. Symonds survived the next ball, but odds had improved for England, as the visitors were now 23 for 2. What followed was an Australian collapse – Michael Clarke went for a golden duck to Lewis, a slightly dubious decision, but that gave the English the needed momentum. Within the next four overs, Australia had lost four more wickets for eight runs, Symonds for 0, Hussey for 1, Ponting for 0, Martyn for 4, and despite a recovery from Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee, the required run rate ran away to 12 an over from the last 11 overs. Jon Lewis finished his spell with four wickets for 24 – a special international debut, even though it was only in a Twenty20 game. Despite a good recovery and a partnership of 36, Gillespie eventually holed out a catch to Marcus Trescothick off the hero of the match, Paul Collingwood, and England headed even further towards a victory. Eventually, McGrath was bowled by Harmison, ending the innings for 79 all out – exactly the same score that England succumbed to in the fourth innings chase against the Australians in the first Test of the last Ashes.|$|E
500|$|USB device {{communication}} {{is based on}} pipes (logical channels). A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity, found on a device, and named an endpoint. Because pipes correspond 1-to-1 to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A USB device could have up to 32 endpoints (16 IN, 16 OUT), though it is rare to have so <b>many.</b> <b>An</b> endpoint is defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called [...] "enumeration") and so is relatively permanent, whereas a pipe may be opened and closed.|$|E

500|$|Beyond this, Jack Warner {{was shaken}} by the 1936 murder of studio {{salesman}} Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in Berlin.

500|$|Urban cookshops that {{catered to}} workers or the {{destitute}} {{were regarded as}} unsavory and disreputable places by the well-to-do and professional cooks tended to have a bad reputation. Geoffrey Chaucer's Hodge of Ware, the London cook from the Canterbury Tales, {{is described as a}} sleazy purveyor of unpalatable food. French cardinal Jacques de Vitry's sermons from the early 13th century describe sellers of cooked meat as an outright health hazard. While the necessity of the cook's services was occasionally recognized and appreciated, they were often disparaged since they catered to the baser of bodily human needs rather than spiritual betterment. The stereotypical cook in art and literature was male, hot-tempered, prone to drunkenness, and often depicted guarding his stewpot from being pilfered by both humans and animals. In the early 15th century, the English monk John Lydgate articulated the beliefs of many of his contemporaries by proclaiming that [...] "Hoot ffir [...] and smoke makith <b>many</b> <b>an</b> angry cook." ...|$|E

Isaac Goldberg thought that [...] "Thespis looks forward far more often than it glances backward: [...] "It forecasts the characteristic methods, and now and then a character, of the later series. Its dialogue is comical, and, if anything, somewhat above the heads of the Gaiety audiences of 1871." ...|$|E

Returning to the mainland, the party paid off their boat and attempted to travel northwards to the most northerly tip of Scotland.
