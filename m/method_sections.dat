The corpus for this study consists of 51 selected RAs published mainly in university-based social science and humanity journals in Indonesia. The seven-move structure (SMS) model for RA <b>method</b> <b>sections</b> was employed. The results showed that, first, the SMS model can capture broad communicative units or moves in the Indonesian RA method section but not smaller communicative units or steps. Second, in terms of the occurrence of moves and steps, the Indonesian RA method section is generally similar to the ones in English. Third, the use of discourse and linguistic markers is quite frequent in the Indonesian RA <b>method</b> <b>sections.</b> It is believed that Indonesian writers will not find it rhetorically difficult to write the method section of RAs in English as far as they are well informed of common linguistic features of English academic texts...|$|E

Finally, suggestions on preparing the <b>methods</b> <b>sections</b> were given. The survey results show that an author may employ different approaches to writing the <b>methods</b> <b>section</b> within a paper, repeating published methods is more often than give citation only or rewrite complete using one’s own words. Authors are more likely to repeat the description of a method than simply to provide a citation.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition have drawn much attention in recent years, with high-profile studies frequently reporting extremely high (e. g.,>. 8) cor-relations between brain activation andpersonalitymeasures. We show that these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because <b>method</b> <b>sections</b> rarely contain much detail about how the correlationswere obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported findings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed.

To set the broader context, we consider classical methods for robust regression of overdispersed count data in section 2, before considering quantile regression, using classical methods and in terms of Bayesian implementation (section 3). Section 4 considers the Poisson log-normal representation for quantile count regression. The remaining sections involve data analysis: a simulation analysis involving contaminated count data (section 5), and finally, the ACS admissions analysis and results applying the HQRPLN <b>method</b> (<b>sections</b> 6 and 7).|$|E

30|$|In view of this, {{this paper}} proposes an image {{registration}} algorithm which combines visual saliency and SIFT {{based on the}} optimization of search space and feature space. After extracting the salient region of image, PCA method is used to establish the dimensionality reduction of SIFT feature, and finally, the robust registration of infrared image and visible lights is realized. The contents of this paper are as follows. Section 1 gives some registration methods between infrared image and visible lights and existing problems. Section 2 utilizes the theory of salient region detection and puts forward the detection method of salient region center of image based on entropy priority strategy. On this basis, Section 3 gives a SIFT feature extraction method based on PCA.

40|$|In neuroscience, the {{localisation}} of task associated brain activation is {{an essential}} topological concern. Via non-invasive techniques, such as fMRI, further theorizing and clinical practice can be guided. Carp (2012) demonstrated the variability present in the <b>method</b> <b>sections</b> in fMRI studies. This methodological variability between studies limits reliability (Bennet & Miller, 2010) and hinders reproducible research. Therefore the evaluation of methods in fMRI should include data-analytical stability measures (e. g. Qiu et al., 2006), which quantify the variability due to choices in the methods. Here, we aim to determine the data-analytical properties of two competing approaches to cluster-wise inference (Gaussian random field and permutation) and evaluate the reproducibility of both methods next to its validity. We focus on the type I error, the data-analytical stability following inferential decisions and additionally explore the distribution of p-values. We investigate differences between both procedures via simulations and end with an illustration using real data...|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid method is {{described}} for the staining of neural end {{feet in the}} central nervous system. In this technique, paraffin sections of routinely fixed central nervous tissue are dewaxed and mordanted in 10 % potassium dichromate at 58 °C for 1 - 2 hr, and impregnated for 45 min at 58 °C in a 2 % silver nitrate solution. Staining {{takes place in a}} silver gelatin reducer; the sections may be gold toned if necessary. By adding 2 % chromium fluoride to the chroming solution, it is possible to stain the mitochondria. By completely omitting the mordanting step, a general impregnation of neurofibrils is obtained.
