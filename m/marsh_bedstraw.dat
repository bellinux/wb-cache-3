2500|$|Wet {{woodland}} (also called carr) on the low-lying swampy limestone {{areas within}} Lough Leane's floodplain is about [...] in size. This {{is one of}} the most extensive areas of this woodland type in Ireland. The dominant canopy species here are alder (Alnus glutinosa), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), downy birch (Betula pubescens), and willow (Salix spp.). The areas that are periodically covered by water are rich in species including grasses, rushes, sedges, and flowers such as <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw,</b> meadow sweet, and water mint.|$|E
50|$|Galium elongatum (<b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw</b> or tall bedstraw) is {{a species}} of plants in the Rubiaceae. It is {{widespread}} across most of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East from Turkey to Palestine to Iran.|$|E
50|$|Open water {{habitats}} include rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs, ponds and, uniquely, turloughs). Common {{species of}} wet places include common reed, marsh willowherb, common <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw,</b> water avens, angelica, brooklime, marsh pennywort, water plantain, marsh cinquefoil, marsh marigold, watermint, yellow water lily, bulrush and the invasive species Canadian pondweed.|$|E
50|$|Galium uliginosum {{is easily}} {{confused}} with <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw,</b> Galium palustre, but is distinguished from this species by having bristly edges on its leaves, and not turning black when it dries out. The leaves {{are arranged in}} whorls of 6 to 10 around the stem, which is a characteristic feature of the bedstraw genus Galium.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic plants {{thriving}} {{in the shallow}} lake include bladderwort, common club-rush, and water lilies. The quagmire bordering the lake, dominated by peat moss and reed, also include sedges, marsh willowherb, common <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw,</b> mare's tail, gypsywort, bog-myrtle, white water-lily, milk parsley, broad-leaved pondweed, marsh cinquefoil, grey sallow, common club-rush, bur-reed, narrow leaf cattail, and broadleaf cattail.|$|E
50|$|Galium tinctorium, {{the stiff}} <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw,</b> is {{a species of}} plants in the Rubiaceae. It is {{widespread}} and common across {{the eastern part of}} North America, from Texas to Labrador and from Minnesota to Florida, plus eastern and central Mexico and the Dominican Republic. It is classed as a noxious weed {{in some parts of the}} northeastern United States.|$|E
5000|$|The moor has {{numerous}} {{areas of}} acidic flush characterised by {{an abundance of}} soft-rush (Juncus effusus), bog moss (Sphagnum recurvum) and star-moss (Polytrichum commune). There are also {{a smaller number of}} species-rich flushes supporting sharp-flowered rush (Juncus acutiflorus), common sedge (Carex nigra), star sedge (Carex echinata), <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium palustre), lesser spearwort (Ranunculus flammula) and marsh violet (Viola palustris).|$|E
50|$|Along streamsides, linear {{areas of}} poor-fen {{vegetation}} occur, including various rushes (Juncus spp.), ragged-robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), greater bird's-foot-trefoil (Lotus uliginosus), <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium palustre), sneezewort (Achillea ptarmica), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis), devil's-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), and lady-fern (Athyrium filix-femina). More open areas along these streamsides favour the uncommon ivy-leaved bellflower (Wahlenbergia hederacea) and bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella).|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} marshy areas and fens {{next to the}} river, damp {{grassland}} and drier, more acidic areas. The river bank has water voles, and damp areas are dominated by meadow foxtail and Yorkshire fog, with some marsh marigold and <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw.</b> Plants in drier areas include betony, and mature hedgerows have {{a wide variety of}} invertebrates. There are butterflies such as skippers, meadow browns, ringlets and marbled whites.|$|E
50|$|Wet {{woodland}} (also called carr) on the low-lying swampy limestone {{areas within}} Lough Leane's floodplain is about 1.7 km2 in size. This {{is one of}} the most extensive areas of this woodland type in Ireland. The dominant canopy species here are alder (Alnus glutinosa), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), downy birch (Betula pubescens), and willow (Salix spp.). The areas that are periodically covered by water are rich in species including grasses, rushes, sedges, and flowers such as <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw,</b> meadow sweet, and water mint.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is {{traditionally}} managed by a late summer hay cut, which allows wildflowers {{to set their}} seeds. There is then cattle grazing. The willow pollards are recut regularly {{to reduce the risk}} of splitting. There are earlier cuts every 3 years to help to increase the frequency of rarer species found in the field which include common knapweed, yellow rattle, cuckoo flower, bird's foot trefoil and <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw.</b> This helps remove nutrients at the peak of the hay growing season.|$|E
5000|$|Linmer Moss (...) {{is unusual}} within Delamere Forest {{in having a}} fen {{environment}} which is not dominated by Sphagnum species. The vegetation is predominantly tussock sedge and reedmace. Marsh fern and white sedge, which are rare in Cheshire, are found here; other species include cuckooflower, <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw,</b> marsh cinquefoil and Sphagnum squarrosum. The site has experienced rapid changes in water levels during its history, and contains the trunks of birch trees which died when the area flooded. It is now being colonised by alder and willow.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{woodland}} on clay, {{and although}} most {{of it has been}} coppiced at different times, it has a varied structure, and rich variety of flora and invertebrates. These factors, together with the presence of wild service trees, show that the woods are ancient. The main tree is oak, with and understorey which includes wych elm, crab apple and guelder rose. Flowers include primroses and bluebells, and in wetter areas there are ragged robin and <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw.</b> The woods have the largest British breeding colony of the nationally rare black hairstreak butterfly.|$|E
50|$|Freshwater marshes {{exist in}} many places around the shore but {{extensive}} reed-beds stretching out into the lake are rare. The margins of the marshes are mostly sedge dominated by such species as bottle sedge, bladder-sedge, tufted-sedge, common-sedge and occasionally water-sedge, water horsetail, marsh cinquefoil and bur-reeds also occur commonly. Also on the fringes occurs a more varied community characteristic of base-poor areas, with such species as marsh ragwort, lesser spearwort, devils-bit scaboius, <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw</b> and hoary willowherb, creeping bent, sweet vernal-grass, Yorkshire fog and purple moor-grass. Cuckooflower occurs commonly and bog violet and greater spearwort {{are to be found}} in places.|$|E
50|$|Galium palustre, {{the common}} <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw</b> or simply marsh-bedstraw, is a {{herbaceous}} annual plant {{of the family}} Rubiaceae. This plant is widely distributed, native to virtually every country in Europe, plus Morocco, the Azores, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Western Siberia, Greenland, eastern Canada, St. Pierre & Miquelon, {{and parts of the}} United States (primarily the Michigan and the Northeast, but with isolated populations in Tennessee, Montana, Washington and Oregon). The species is classified as a noxious weed in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire. It is considered naturalized in Kamchatka, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The Callows are a {{classified}} as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The Irish Wildlife Trust has a reserve on Bullock Island. Protection of the Callows is particularly important due to the many species of birds occurring on the Callows. Recorded are, amongst others, black-tailed godwit, corncrake, curlew, golden plover, lapwing, mute swan, redshank, sandpiper, whooper swan and wigeon. Mammals recorded include American mink, fox and otter. Grazing of cattle keeps alder and willow from spreading. Sections of Callow at higher elevation and therefore less prone to flooding have a greater diversity of plants, in particular clover, creeping buttercup, cuckoo flower, <b>marsh</b> <b>bedstraw,</b> marsh marigold, meadow grass, meadowsweet, sedge and water mint.|$|E
