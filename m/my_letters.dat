5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to <b>my</b> <b>letters</b> of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent <b>my</b> <b>letters</b> to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E
2500|$|I am {{often asked}} why I begin <b>my</b> <b>letters</b> this way. No matter whether I am writing to my lady or to my butcher, always I begin with these eleven words. Why, how else should I begin? What other {{greeting}} {{could be so}} glad? Look, brother, we are free! Rejoice with me, sister, {{there is no law}} beyond Do what thou wilt! ...|$|E
6000|$|P.S.--I open <b>my</b> <b>letter</b> {{again to}} tell you that Fletcher having [...] petitioned to {{accompany}} me into the Morea, I have taken him with me, [...] contrary to the intention expressed in <b>my</b> <b>letter.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "As she had {{mentioned}} her husband's {{name in the}} faith that I knew it, I added no mention of it to <b>my</b> <b>letter.</b> I sealed <b>my</b> <b>letter,</b> and, not trusting {{it out of my}} own hands, delivered it myself that day.|$|R

2500|$|I was {{interested}} {{to hear him}} express as his opinion what I had written him some time ago in one of <b>my</b> <b>letters,</b> {{to the effect that}} if Germany won it would change the course of our civilization and make the United States a military nation. He also spoke of his deep regret, as indeed I did to him in that same letter, that it would check his policy for a better international ethical code. [...] He felt deeply the destruction of Louvain , and I found him as unsympathetic with the German attitude as is the balance of America. He goes even further than I in his condemnation of Germany's part in this war, and almost allows his feeling to include the German people as a whole rather than the leaders alone. He said German philosophy was essentially selfish and lacking in spirituality. When I spoke of the Kaiser building up the German machine as a means of maintaining peace, he said, [...] "What a foolish thing it was to create a powder magazine and risk someone's dropping a spark into it!" [...] He thought the war would throw the world back three or four centuries. I did not agree with him. He was particularly scornful of Germany’s disregard of treaty obligations, and was indignant at the German Chancellor’s designation of the Belgian Treaty as being [...] "only a scrap of paper"....But although the personal feeling of the President was with the Allies, he insisted then and for many months after, that this ought not to affect his political attitude, which he intended should be one of strict neutrality. [...] He felt that he owed it to the world to prevent the spreading of the conflagration, that he owed it to the country to save it from the horrors of war.|$|E
60|$|I {{repeated}} {{the substance of}} <b>my</b> <b>letters</b> rather lamely, and she sat listening.|$|E
60|$|Out of {{this way}} of {{thinking}} and feeling about these two great things, about Literature and Life, there may have arisen a confusion as to which is which. But I do not wish to part them, and in their union I have found, since I learned <b>my</b> <b>letters,</b> a joy in them both which I hope will last till I forget <b>my</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|E

60|$|I {{considered}} again. The sound had {{not caught}} my ears. But I was then deeply absorbed in <b>my</b> <b>letters,</b> and I write {{with a heavy}} hand and a quill pen, scraping and scratching noisily over the paper. It was more likely that Madame Fosco would hear the scraping of my pen than that I should hear the rustling of her dress.
