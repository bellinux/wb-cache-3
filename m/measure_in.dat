5|$|Articulographs able to <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged {{so that the}} axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{contemporary}} national political {{issues have been}} influenced by events in Massachusetts, such as the decision in 2003 by the state Supreme Judicial Court allowing same-sex marriage and a 2006 bill which mandated health insurance for all Bay Staters. In 2008, Massachusetts voters passed an initiative decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana. Voters in Massachusetts also approved a ballot <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> 2012 that legalized the medical use of marijuana.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} non-SI units {{that had never}} been {{formally}} sanctioned by the CGPM have continued to be used across the globe in many spheres including health care and navigation. As with the units of <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> Tables 6 and 7, these have been catalogued by the CIPM in the SI Brochure to ensure consistent usage, but with the recommendation that authors who use them should define them wherever they are used.|$|E

5|$|A {{supporter}} of nine-man baseball teams, Adams favored a <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> 1856 which allowed for players {{from outside the}} Knickerbockers to join their intrasquad games when 17 or fewer team members appeared. No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13–11 vote, {{in favor of a}} rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).|$|E
5|$|As {{an effect}} of Waddington's intervention, Romania also agreed {{to resolve the issue}} of Jewish Emancipation. The {{government}} pledged itself to naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in Romania). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year, and such a <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E
5|$|At its 23rd meeting, held in 2007, the CGPM {{recommended}} that the CIPM should continue to investigate methods to provide exact fixed values for physical constants of nature that could then {{be used in the}} definitions of units of <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> place of the IPK, thus enabling the transition from explicit unit definitions to explicit constant definitions.|$|E

5|$|During its evolution, {{the metric}} system has adopted many units of measure. The {{introduction}} of SI rationalised both {{the way in}} which units of measure were defined and also the list of units in use. These are now catalogued in the official SI Brochure. The table below lists the units of <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> this catalogue and shows the conversion factors connecting them with the equivalent units that were in use {{on the eve of the}} adoption of SI.|$|E
5|$|From its beginning, {{the main}} {{features}} of the metric system were the standard set of interrelated base units and a standard set of prefixes in powers of ten. These base units are used to derive larger and smaller units that could replace {{a huge number of}} other units of <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> existence. Although the system was first developed for commercial use, the development of coherent units of measure made it particularly suitable for science and engineering.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of von Neumann's papers, the methods of {{argument}} he employed are considered even more significant than the results. In anticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of operators, von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite decomposition, and reformulated the problem of <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> terms of functions. In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory, he used the Haar theorem in the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem {{in the case of}} compact groups. In 1938, he was awarded the Bôcher Memorial Prize for his work in analysis.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} eighteenth century, {{proposals}} {{similar to those of}} the seventeenth century for a universal measure were made for a common international system of <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> the spheres of commerce and technology; when the French Revolutionaries implemented such a system, they drew on many of the seventeenth-century proposals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the seventeenth century Bishop John Wilkins, the first {{secretary}} of the Royal Society in England, was asked by the society to devise a universal standard of <b>measure.</b> <b>In</b> 1668, in his book An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language, on the possibility of an international language, he devoted a short section to physical measurement in which he proposed an integrated system of measurement based on a decimal system. While Wilkins did propose his system two years before Moulton, it was never promoted and lay undiscovered until 2007.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown, Jr., {{the son of}} Cooper's former {{opponent}} in the senatorial elections of 1946 and 1966, awarded Cooper the Governor's Distinguished Service Medallion in 1983. Later that year, Senators Walter Huddleston of Kentucky and Howard Baker of Tennessee introduced a bill to honor Cooper by renaming the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area to the Cooper National Recreation Area; Kentucky Congressman Hal Rogers sponsored a parallel <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> the House. As a senator, Cooper had been instrumental in securing congressional approval {{for the creation of}} Big South Fork. Opponents of the <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> both Kentucky and Tennessee (the recreation area spans the two states) cited a variety of reasons to retain the old name, and the proposal was eventually dropped at Cooper's request.|$|E

5|$|The {{city has}} started {{moving away from}} the {{automobile}} and towards mass transit. From 2004 to 2009, the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21%. In 2006, voters in King County passed proposition 2 (Transit Now) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five bus rapid transit lines called RapidRide. After rejecting a roads and transit <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> 2007, Seattle-area voters passed a transit only <b>measure</b> <b>in</b> 2008 to increase ST Express bus service, extend the Link light rail system, and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail service. A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea-Tac Airport began service on December 19, 2009, giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits. An extension north to the University of Washington opened on March 19, 2016; and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north, Des Moines to the south, and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023. Voters in the Puget Sound region approved an additional tax increase in November 2016 to expand light rail to West Seattle and Ballard as well as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah.|$|E
