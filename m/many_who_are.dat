25|$|Due to Southern Italy's lack of {{progress}} to bettering the area, it has {{a record number of}} emigration. This mentality stems from the sad truth that <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> native to Southern Italy find it more beneficial to emigrate rather than stay in the area and try to push for reforms. The most prevalent issue in Southern Italy is its inability to attract businesses and therefore create jobs. Between 2007 and 2014 943,000 Italians were unemployed. Of this, 70% were Italians from the South. Employment in the South is ranked the lowest compared to countries in the European Union. The emerging issues discourage living in Southern Italy as even obtaining a job in the area is close to impossible. Naturally, Italians from the South are also ranked the lowest in terms of money contributed into the economy of the Italy from immigrants. The most common jobs in Southern Italy lie in tourism, distribution, food industries, wood furniture, whole sale, vehicle sales, sales in mineral and artisan. As evident in the list of the most common jobs in Southern Italy, the economy of the South heavily relies on tourism. It attracts tourists through its rich historical background. One example of this is Rome, {{one of the most prominent}} and advanced ancient civilizations.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} of Behe's paper 'Design vs. Randomness in Evolution: Where Do the Data Point?', Denis Lamoureux criticised Darwin's Black Box as having become central to {{fundamentalist}} and evangelical anti-evolution critiques against biological evolution. Behe supports the historically incorrect misrepresentation that Darwin's views {{on the origin of}} life were atheistic, when On the Origin of Species repeatedly refers to a Creator in a positive and supportive context as impressing laws on matter. Though Behe has avoided committing himself to the view that God intervenes directly in nature to create purportedly irreducibly complex structures, Darwin's Black Box briefly speculates that divine intervention might have caused the direct creation of a cell from which all of life evolved, supporting creationist views of miraculous acts of creation, but ironically echoing Darwin's stated [...] "view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one". Behe's claim that the creation of an original first cell represents a [...] "gap" [...] in the laws of nature needing divine intervention appears to be the problematic God of the gaps position which is subject to the gaps being filled by scientific discoveries. Behe's thesis that irreducible structures are created in [...] "one fell swoop" [...] is opposed by other biochemists, including <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> devout Christians, and has no support from the fossil record.|$|E

2500|$|Presently, {{there is}} no [...] "Somali" [...] option amongst the tick-box answers to the {{ethnicity}} question in the UK Census. Respondents who identify as Somali can, however, indicate this through a write-in response option. Following lobbying from Somali and other groups, a new [...] "Arab" [...] tick-box {{was introduced in the}} 2011 Census. According to sociologists Peter J. Aspinall and Martha Judith Chinouya, qualitative findings indicate that [...] "groups from northern Africa, the Horn of Africa, and some parts of the eastern coastline and islands of Africa may not identify themselves as black African. It was felt that they don't see themselves as black or African and might describe themselves by nationality specifically (eg, Somali or Sudanese), perhaps Afro-Arabs, or Arab-African". Aspinall and Lavinia Mitton note that [...] "those from Somalia may consider themselves to be Arab-African rather than Black African because of their religion and physical features". The Policy Research Centre argued that [...] "the inclusion of Arab will help refine the British Muslim picture as many Arabic speaking British citizens who are Muslim, as well as <b>many</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not, could not find an appropriate category, and selecting from 3 or 4 near matches". However, it cautioned that [...] "the new Arab ethnic category will give us a clearer picture, but could confuse the Somali ethnic count this may lead to challenges in accurately sizing citizens of Somali heritage. Such respondents will have to choose between Arab as a linguistic choice and Black African as a geographical and/or racial choice. Moreover, because of such community drives to get Somalis more noticed, it is likely Somali responses under the Black section will be split between African and Other Black". Question testing with Somalis in Wales {{in the run-up to the}} census revealed inconsistent answering of the ethnicity question. Some Somali participants in the test ticked the [...] "African" [...] box, others wrote in [...] "Somali", and one person ticked both [...] "African" [...] and [...] "Arab". Some Somali participants in both Wales and England believed that there was a need for a Somali tick-box, whereas others felt that the African option was sufficient. No Somali, Egyptian, Berber, Kurdish or Iranian respondents chose to identify solely as Arab. Similarly, question testing with Somalis in Scotland found that [...] "Somalian" [...] was the most frequent write-in response under [...] "African", with few respondents choosing to write-in [...] "Black".
