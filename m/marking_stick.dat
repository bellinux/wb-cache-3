30|$|Surgical field preparation, routine double head draping was done, and presurgical {{photographs}} were taken. The key landmarks and surgical incision line was designed with <b>marking</b> <b>stick</b> and gentian violet dye solution. Local anesthetics were infiltrated on labium and nasal area with 2 % lidocaines with 1 : 100, 000 epinephrine. Injection of marked landmarks could make tattooing effect, to facilitate preserving landmarks effectively during surgical procedure. The incision on the medial segment was carried {{on with a}} no. 15 blade and redundant cleft marginal tissue was discarded. The skin on the medial segment was undermined from the skin and mucosa to separate orbicularis oris muscle for about 1  mm distal from cut edge. The incision on the lateral segment was carried on with a no. 15 blade, and excess marginal tissue was discarded. Dissection between skin and muscle on lateral element was done as same manner as medial side. The mucosal incision was closed with 5 - 0 Vicryl®. Upturned orbicularis oris muscle at the alar base of cleft side was approximated to anterior nasal spine with 4 - 0 PDS®. Orbicularis oris muscle was overlapped and sutured with 5 - 0 Ethilon®. Medial and lateral lip flaps were approximated at the junction of red vermilion and cutaneous roll and then submucosal closure was done with 5 - 0 Vicryl®. Skin was closed with 6 - 0 Ethilon®. Upper vermilion flap was rotated and was sutured with 6 - 0 Vicryl®. Lip was closed with 5 - 0 Vicryl®. Infraorbital nerve block anesthesia was done with 2 % lidocaine with 1 : 100, 000 epinephrine to reduce postoperative pain. Dressing was done using antibiotic ointment and Steri-strip®.|$|E

5000|$|The split tally was a {{technique}} which became common in medieval Europe, which was constantly short of money (coins) and predominantly illiterate, {{in order to}} record bilateral exchange and debts. A stick (squared hazelwood sticks were most common) was marked with a system of notches and then split lengthwise. This way the two halves both record the same notches and each party to the transaction received {{one half of the}} <b>marked</b> <b>stick</b> as proof. Later this technique was refined in various ways and became virtually tamper proof. One of the refinements was to make the two halves of the stick of different lengths. The longer part was called stock and was given to the party which had advanced money (or other items) to the receiver. The shorter portion of the stick was called foil and was given to the party which had received the funds or goods. Using this technique each of the parties had an identifiable record of the transaction. The natural irregularities in the surfaces of the tallies where they were split would mean that only the original two halves would fit back together perfectly, and so would verify that they were matching halves of the same transaction. If one party tried to unilaterally change the value of his half of the tally stick by adding more notches, the absence of those notches would be apparent on the other party's tally stick. The split tally was accepted as legal proof in medieval courts and the Napoleonic Code (1804) still makes reference to the tally stick in Article 1333. [...] Along the Danube and in Switzerland the tally was still used in the 20th century in rural economies.|$|R

25|$|There is some {{confusion}} about {{the purpose of a}} number of small stone and ceramic objects that are cigar-shaped and rasp-like. They are thought to be tools for creating pottery, of which bowls and jars seem to be the most common. The jars ranged from 12–44cm in diameter. The bowls were slightly smaller on average, ranging from 10–30cm. Many times these pots were decorated with a comb-like or rake pattern. These were likely used not only for the storage of food and water, but also for boiling and crafting sauces. The pottery appears to have been fired in a pit, typical of early ceramic practices. In fact, the pottery of Kintampo have been widely studied, in fact it is possibly the most studied later stone age ceramics in West Africa. Pieces of a substance known as daga has been found along with the stone artifacts. Daga is chunks of ceramics that have been visibly <b>marked</b> by <b>sticks</b> or other pole-like implements.

We were of all creeds and opinions, and generally tolerant of all, on every imaginable subject. Our bond, it seems to me, was not affirmative, but negative. We had individually found {{one thing or another}} to quarrel with in our past life, and were pretty well agreed as to the inexpediency of lumbering along with the old system any further. As to what should be substituted, there was much less unanimity. We did not greatly care--at least, I never did--for the written constitution under which our millennium had commenced. My hope was, that, between theory and practice, a true and available mode of life might be struck out; and that, even should we ultimately fail, the months or years spent in the trial would not have been wasted, either as regarded passing enjoyment, or the experience which makes men wise.|$|R
