Patterns of malformation and disease among veterans' children involved predominantly the central nervous, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of the elderly couples’ past marital history in determining their current wealth holdings and portfolio allocation using data from the first wave of the Health and Retirement Study. The results suggest that, for those who remarry after divorce, there is recovery from the negative shocks of <b>marital</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> which occur earlier in the life cycle. While the net cost of divorce in terms of household wealth accumulation is higher for men than it is for women, in the “long run” {{it turns out to be}} statistically insignificant for both gender groups. Therefore, the elderly couples’ marital history plays a minor role in explaining the dispersion in their wealth holdings near the end of the life cycle. However, the results also show that both the probability of owning a particular asset and the fraction of net worth allocated to that asset might significantly vary depending on the elderly couples’ marital experience. Most importantly, the couples in which the spouses have divorced before invest relatively heavily on non-housing assets rather than owner occupied housing. The further analysis of financial wealth only yields that the ownership and allocation of financial assets are not affected in a major significant way. wealth, portfolio allocation, elderly, marital history...|$|R

50|$|<b>Marital</b> <b>breakdown</b> {{refers to}} the common process whereby the {{relationship}} between a married couple erodes, such that they cannot ordinarily restore their relationship. There are many stages to the process, and each individual goes through the stages at different rates. It is a complex process involving psychology, personal finance, and often religion. It is the breach of domestic anticipation, often leading to a divorce or dissolution of the marital relationship. Often there are children, in-laws, and other individuals involved in the process. At the end of the process, there may be no relationship left, or there may be a long-term relationship at a distance.

40|$|Infertility {{is common}} in Africa, but {{virtually}} no data exist on HIV prevalence among infertile women. Mainly anthropological studies in Africa have shown that infertile women have higher risks of marital instability and possibly also have more sexual partners than fertile women. This {{study was conducted in}} a hospital in northwest Tanzania during 1994 and 1995. Women presenting themselves with infertility problems to the outpatient clinic were interviewed, examined and blood was drawn. Women who came to deliver in the hospital, excluding primiparae, were taken as a control group. The analysis was limited to women > or = 24 years. In total 154 infertile and 259 fertile women were included in the study. HIV prevalence was markedly higher among infertile women than among fertile women: 18. 2 % and 6. 6 % respectively (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for age, residence and occupation 2. 7; 95 %-confidence interval [CI]: 1. 4 - 5. 3). Data on past sexual behaviour showed that infertile women had more <b>marital</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> more lifetime sexual partners and a higher level of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Women with fertility problems appear to have higher HIV prevalence, which justifies more attention for such women in the context of AIDS programmes.

40|$|Background : Family {{structure}} and union dissolution {{has been one}} of the most thoroughly studied determinants of children's wellbeing worldwide. To date, however, few of these studies have examined sub-Saharan Africa, especially countries in West Africa where <b>marital</b> <b>breakdowns</b> are not uncommon. Objective : We attempt to examine the effects of a mother's divorce and widowhood on children's risk of mortality under age 5 and on their probability of entering primary school. Methods : Survival data analysis methods, specifically Kaplan-Meier and piecewise exponential models, are used for analysis, based on data come from the 2000 Migration and Urban Integration Survey of Burkina Faso. Results : Compared to those of intact families, children of divorced parents experience higher estimated mortality risks under age 5 and a lower probability of entering school, even after controlling for various other factors. This effect is large and significant during the first two years after the divorce. The death of the father is also found to greatly reduce a child's likelihood of entering school, but its effect on mortality is not significant. Conclusions : The results indicate that the family context plays an important role in determining two important aspects of children's welfare: their probabilities of dying before age 5 and of entering school. Comments : Children of divorced parents or a deceased father are living in precarious situations and their specific needs should be taken into account in policies in order to improve the wellbeing of all children. Attention must be directed to the first two years following the union dissolution...|$|R

This study is available via the UK Data Service QualiBank, an online tool for browsing, searching and citing the content of selected qualitative data collections held at the UK Data Service. Dennis Marsden's study Mothers Alone: Poverty and the Fatherless Family, also known as Fatherless Families, {{was carried out in}} 1965 - 1966. The study explores the lives and experiences of mothers living alone: unmarried, separated, divorced or widowed. The study posed two questions: what is poverty and who are the fatherless? The study asked about housing conditions, homelessness, diet and nutrition, family relations, marriage and <b>marital</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> and the levels and adequacy of community and national assistance. The interviewees were asked about detailed indicators of poverty and also the subjective, felt experience of poverty. The study examined problems families faced as a consequence of both low income and lack of fathers, the causes of their circumstances, and the adequacy of assistance provided by community and national sources. The study was developed from a pilot study done for a larger project, 'Poverty in the UK', by Peter Townsend. This is an enhanced qualitative data collection. All interviews were converted from paper to partially searchable Adobe PDF files. Additional relevant documents are included in the user guide, such as the questionnaire, the original letter sent to participants with assurances of consent and confidentiality, notes on methodology, and extracts from an interview with the author about conducting this research. Main Topics : Detailed questions were asked about living arrangements, marriage, factors that led to fatherlessness, and family structure. Also, physical conditions of housing, furniture, water supply and heating were described. Other topics covered included sources of income (work and benefits), health, food and diet and clothing. Regarding children, data were collected about their health and education. <br...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} to be a type of 2 ̆ 2 structuralist 2 ̆ 2 commentary upon selected provisions in Book I of the Louisiana Civil Code. Its sole purpose is to illustrate, both for pedagogical and doctrinal reasons, some of the analytical difficulties to which these code provisions might give rise when they are read in a close textual fashion. It should be emphasized that this study is a textual commentary and not a historical assessment of the sources or origins of the code texts – the latter analysis is outside the purview of the present endeavor. Accordingly, this article consists of a critical textual evaluation of the relevant code provisions of Book I of the Louisiana Civil Code, emphasizing internal inconsistencies, ambiguities, and inequities which point to a need for legislative reconsideration and redrafting. For example, it is difficult from a reading of Book I to identify the actual impediments to marriage. In addition, the provisions relating to putative marriage appear to lead, in certain circumstances, to an easily resolvable injustice to children born of such unions. Moreover, the first book of the Code contains outmoded provisions, such as article 120, which no longer reflect contemporary conceptions about the role {{of men and women in}} marriage. Articles 138, 141, and 160 establish the primacy of fault in regulating <b>marital</b> <b>breakdowns</b> and their financial consequences; it is submitted that, upon a close examination of the code provisions and the applicable case law, the role of fault not only is ill-defined but also needs to be reevaluated in light of the evolution of mores and the emergence of trends in other civilian jurisdictions. Finally, the issue of legitimacy and the presumption of paternity in article 184 are analyzed for their possible gender-based discriminatory effect. The gravamen of this article is not to advocate a particular view of marriage or of the role of a fault analysis in the breakdown of marriage, but rather to begin an inquiry into the structural and substantive cohesion of Book I of the Code. The language of article 138 makes the dissolution of marriage a reality; the question remains, however, whether the state, in the exercise of its legitimate regulatory power in this area, has articulated a set of norms which continue to be viable in contemporary society. While moral, religious, and psychological perceptions of marriage may conflict, it is incumbent upon the legislature to arrive at a workable reconciliation of these values by elaborating a set of coherent guiding principles...|$|R
