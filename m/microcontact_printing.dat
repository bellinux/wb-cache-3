40|$|Cell {{migration}} {{is an important}} biological function that impacts many physiological and pathological processes. Often {{migration is}} directed along various densities of aligned fibers of collagen, a process called contact guidance. However, cells adhere to other components in the extracellular matrix, possibly affecting migrational behavior. Additionally, changes in intracellular contractility are well known to affect random migration, but its effect on contact guidance is less known. This study examines differences in directed migration in response to variations in the spacing of collagen, non-specific background adhesion strength and myosin II-mediated contractility. Collagen was <b>microcontact</b> <b>printed</b> onto glass substrates and timelapse live-cell microscopy {{was used to measure}} migration characteristics. Increasing the number of lines a cell contacts or decreasing contraction led to decreases in directionality, but speed changes were context dependent. This suggests that while cell migration speed is a biphasic function of contractility, directionality appears to be a monotonic, increasing function of contractility. Thus, increasing the number of lines a cell contacts or decreasing contractility degrades the contact guidance fidelity...|$|R

5000|$|The {{criticism}} {{most often}} directed at DPN is the patterning speed. The {{reason for this}} {{has more to do}} with how it is compared to other techniques rather than any inherent weaknesses. For example, the soft lithography method, <b>microcontact</b> <b>printing</b> (μCP), is the current standard for low cost, bench-top micro and nanoscale patterning, so it is easy to understand why DPN is compared directly to <b>microcontact</b> <b>printing.</b> The problem is that the comparisons are usually based upon applications that are strongly suited to μCP, instead of comparing them to some neutral application. μCP has the ability to pattern one material over a large area in a single stamping step, just as photolithography can pattern over a large area in a single exposure. Of course DPN is slow when it is compared to the strength of another technique. DPN is a maskless direct write technique that can be used to create multiple patterns of varying size, shape, and feature resolution, all on a single substrate. No one would try to apply <b>microcontact</b> <b>printing</b> to such a project because then it would never be worth the time and money required to fabricate each master stamp for each new pattern. Even if they did, <b>microcontact</b> <b>printing</b> would not be capable of aligning multiple materials from multiple stamps with nanoscale registry. [...] The best way to understand this misconception is to think about the different ways to apply photolithography and e-beam lithography. No one would try to use e-beam to solve a photolithography problem and then claim e-beam to be [...] "too slow". Directly compared to photolithography's large area patterning capabilities, e-beam lithography is slow and yet, e-beam instruments can be found in every lab and nanofab in the world. The reason for this is because e-beam has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by photolithography, just as DPN has unique capabilities that cannot be matched by <b>microcontact</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E

Receptor activation leads {{to the formation of}} membrane-proximal protein microclusters. These clusters undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and organize multiprotein complexes thereby acting as molecular signaling platforms. Little is known about how the quantity and phosphorylation levels of microclusters are affected by costimulatory signals and the activity of specific signaling proteins. We combined micrometer-sized, <b>microcontact</b> <b>printed,</b> striped patterns of different stimuli and simultaneous analysis of different cell strains with image processing protocols to address this problem. First, we validated the stimulation protocol by showing that high expression levels CD 28 result in increased cell spreading. Subsequently, we addressed the role of costimulation and a specific phosphotyrosine phosphatase in cluster formation by including a SHP 2 knock-down strain in our system. Distinguishing cell strains using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester enabled a comparison within single samples. SHP 2 exerted its effect by lowering phosphorylation levels of individual clusters while CD 28 costimulation mainly increased the number of signaling clusters and cell spreading.

HaCaTs cells were cultured on the substrates for 24 hours and imaged with the “Widefield Surface Plasmon Resonance” (WSPR) microscope [1]. The WSPR system enables the examination of nanometric interfacial interactions of HaCaTs on patterned and un-patterned surface at lateral resolution down to 500 nm.

In this article we report a synthetic lectin that selectively binds to carbohydrates immobilized in a molecular monolayer.

The selectivity and affinity of the synthetic lectin was screened in competition experiments. In addition, the carbohydrate binding of the synthetic lectin was compared with the carbohydrate binding of the lectins concanavalin A and peanut agglutinin.

40|$|Cell {{migration}} is essential during {{a variety of}} physiological events, and as such it has been extensively studied {{in an attempt to}} unravel the details of its mechanisms. Cells receive information from the environment and migrate accordingly. Within the last few decades, different studies have evaluated the effect of different types of signals {{and the way in which}} they regulate cell migration. However, cells do not respond to individual cues, but they are constantly receiving information from a variety of signals in vivo. One particular scenario in which the concerted action of multiple signals is thought to be relevant is during the early stages of cancer invasion and metastasis. Different studies suggest that the architecture of the tissue surrounding the tumor guides the migration of the cells to blood vessels in the vicinity, initiating the metastatic cascade. Other evidence suggests the role of a variety of chemokines that can also direct cancer cell invasion. In that regard, the main goal of this research is to analyze the response of a highly metastatic cell line to contact guidance and chemotactic signals when they are presented simultaneously. To achieve this purpose we develop 2 different platforms that combine <b>microcontact</b> <b>printed</b> surfaces with the Dunn chemotaxis chamber and an agarose sphere assay.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presented several results which add to {{the general}} knowledge base regarding organothiolates monolayer spontaneously adsorbed at gold films. Common {{to the body of}} this work is the use of voltammetric reductive resorption and variants of scanning probe microscopy to gain insight into the nature of the monolayer formation process as well as the resulting interface. The most significant result from this work is the success of using friction force microscopy to discriminate the end group orientation of monolayer chemisorbed at smooth gold surfaces with micrometer resolution (Chapter 4). The ability to detect the differences in the orientational disposition is demonstrated by the use PDMS polymer stamp to <b>microcontact</b> <b>print</b> an adlayer of n-alkanethiolate of length n in a predefine pattern onto a gold surface, followed by the solution deposition of a n-alkanethiol of n {+-} 1 to fill in the areas on the gold surface intentionally not coated by the stamping process. These two-component monolayers can be discriminated by using friction force microscopy which detects differences in friction contributed by the differences in the orientation of the terminal groups at surfaces. This success has recently led to the detection of the orientation differences at nanometer scale. Although the substrates examined in this work consisted entirely of smooth gold films, the same test can be performed on other smooth substrates and monolayer materials...|$|R

The second and fourth order parameters of the heme as well as information on the angle between the absorption and emission dipoles of the heme, ç, were experimentally determined. The order parameters of the heme are related to the order parameters of the protein molecule using the known angle between the heme plane and the electrostatic dipole moment of the cyt c protein. The effect of the surface roughness of the substrates (glass and ITO) was also taken into account quantitatively using AFM data. Physically possible order parameters were obtained for the heme group in both solution adsorbed and íCP films, but not for the electrostatic dipole moment of the protein. In addition, the experimental values of 〈cos 2 ç 〉 for immobilized zinc-substituted cyt c are greater than the values of 〈cos 2 ç 〉 determined in viscous solutions, which could be an indication that the environment of the heme groups changes upon adsorption.

40|$|AbstractTo {{explore the}} role of the brush-like proteoglycan, aggrecan, in the shear {{behavior}} of cartilage tissue, we measured the lateral resistance to deformation of a monolayer of chemically end-attached cartilage aggrecan on a <b>microcontact</b> <b>printed</b> surface in aqueous NaCl solutions via lateral force microscopy. The effects of bath ionic strength (IS, 0. 001 – 1. 0 M) and lateral displacement rate (∼ 1 – 100 μm/s) were studied using probe tips functionalized with neutral hydroxyl-terminated self-assembled alkanethiol monolayers. Probe tips having two different end-radii (R ∼ 50 nm and 2. 5 μm) enabled access to different length-scales of interactions (nano and micro). The measured lateral force was observed to depend linearly on the applied normal force, and the lateral force to normal force proportionality constant, μ, was calculated. The value μ increased (from 0. 03 ± 0. 01 to 0. 11 ± 0. 01) with increasing bath IS (0. 001 – 1. 0 M) for experiments using the microsized tip due to the larger compressive strain of aggrecan that resulted from increased IS at constant compressive force. With the nanosized tip, μ also increased with IS but by a smaller amount due to the fewer number of aggrecan involved in shear deformation. The variations in lateral force as a function of applied compressive strain ɛn and changes in bath IS suggested that both electrostatic and nonelectrostatic interactions contributed significantly to the shear deformational behavior of the aggrecan layers. While lateral force did not vary with lateral displacement rate at low IS, where elastic-like electrostatic interactions between aggrecan dominated, lateral force increased significantly with displacement rate at physiological and higher IS, suggestive of additional viscoelastic and/or poroelastic interactions within the aggrecan layer. These data provide insights into molecular-level deformation of aggrecan macromolecules that are important to the understanding of cartilage behavior...|$|R

Applying these techniques to patterned samples and single molecules allow the optical properties of a sample to be investigated near to and below the diffraction limit, allowing emission properties to be correlated with those of topography. Optically active biological samples outside of their cellular environment are prone to photo-degredation and in measuring them a challenge {{is to ensure that}} optical measurements can be made before the onset of damage to the fluorophore. In this study two forms of fluorescence microscope have been utilised with scanning probe techniques of AFM and SNOM. These techniques have been used alongside <b>microcontact</b> <b>printed</b> arrays of fluorescent proteins and photosynthetic light harvesting complexes to address the accuracy of the printing technique and it's applicablity to biological components for future bionanotechnological applications. Furthermore, the periodicity associated with the arrays has been applied to the techniques to address the relative resolutions of the microscopes as well as the samples being a drive behind implimenting biologically friendly components/techniques to the microscopes (such as liquid cells). Larger structures from photosynthetic bacteria have also been addressed in this study in the form of chlorosomes which are model structures for light harvesting in low light conditions. Studies on the spectral properties of populations of 3 species have been conducted in this work with fluorescence microscopy and {{it has been shown that}} populations show small local variations in fluorescence. Furthermore it has been shown that the developed scanning fluorescence technique can be applied to photo senstitive samples successfully with only a small number of cases where spectral properties were affected by the measurement technique. Using high resolution microscopy techniques this research shows the surface patterning techniques in conjunction with biological samples to have mixed success depending on the sample. It also shows spectral measurements on newly discovered chlorosomes with little photo degredation. It further shows the role that the microscopy techniques have in analysing biological systems in different configurations on substrates...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to elucidate buried interfaces {{because of the lack}} of appropriate analytical techniques. In this thesis, it was shown that sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG) can be used to probe molecular structures of buried interfaces, leading to important understanding of polymer adhesion, two dimensional crystal structure, and pharmaceutical polymorphs on polymer surfaces. SFG was used to investigate the interface between the amine and aldehyde functionalized poly-p-xylyene surfaces to understand the mechanism for the Solventless Adhesive Bonding technique. It was found that the adhesion is due to the chemical reaction between the amine and aldehyde groups. STM image of a monolayer of 17 metadiester phthalates on graphite under a phenyloctane solution does not provide orientation information of these molecules. SFG results indicate that the C=O groups were tilting ~ 30 º away from the surface. This is due to the two different interactions: monolayer-phenyloctane solvent interaction and monolayer-graphite surface interaction. This new finding needs to be incorporated in future modeling of these systems. C=O groups are important surface interaction sites in polymers. SFG was used to study surface C=O groups of several poly-n-methacrylates in air and in water. In water, interfacial hydrogen bonds formed between polymer C=O groups and water molecules. The orientations of the C=O groups on various polymers were determined and discussed. The mechanism of polymer-induced heteronucleation of acetaminophen was also examined using SFG. Poly-methyl-methacrylate and poly-n-butyl-methacrylate were found to heteronucleate different polymorphs of acetaminophen from saturated solutions. Evidence of hydrogen bonding between the NH of the acetaminophen and the C=O of the polymers was observed for both PMMA and PBMA. The difference in orientation of the C=O groups of polymers when hydrogen bonded to the acetaminophen molecule is thought to be responsible for the polymorph selection. In addition, SFG was applied to study polymer/acetaminophen crystal interfaces to further understand polymer-acetaminophen interactions. Different crystal growth methods, solution and sublimation, were compared. The design and implementation of a SFG imaging system was also discussed.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death worldwide. Due to the {{extremely}} low natural regeneration rate of heart muscle, development of new therapeutics directed towards heart repair is challenging. A potential approach to regenerate damaged heart is offered by cardiac tissue engineering. Specifically, it aims at engineering cardiac muscle in vitro and implanting it into the site of injury so that it can be integrated into the host tissue and restore the heart’s function. To ensure the effectiveness of this technique, the engineered tissue needs to recapitulate structural and functional properties of the native myocardium. Myocardium consists of laminar sheets of uniaxially aligned cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) wrapped around the heart. Therefore, achieving high cardiomyocyte alignment in engineered muscle is crucial. In this study we aimed at stimulating cardiomyocyte alignment by mimicking their niche in the embryonic heart. We hypothesized that recapitulating the extracellular cues that guide myocardial development in the embryo can guide cardiac tissue organization in vitro. To test this hypothesis, we imaged the structure of fibronectin – the most abundant protein in embryonic heart’s extracellular matrix (ECM) – and derived a 2 D pattern from it that was then <b>microcontact</b> <b>printed</b> onto a substrate to guide cell alignment. We compared chick cardiomyocyte alignment on the biomimetic pattern and line patterns that have been extensively studied in the past. Results revealed a unique cell density-dependent response of cardiomyocytes to the biomimetic pattern that allowed us to elucidate the role of cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions in cardiomyocyte alignment on fibronectin patterns by looking at the effect of local pattern features on alignment and inhibiting N-cadherin-based cell-cell junctions. Further, to engineer more clinically relevant tissues, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into cardiomyocytes and seeded them onto the fibronectin patterns. Cardiac tissues produced with these cells showed significant differences compared to the chick tissues due to their immature phenotype. We showed that co-culture with cardiac fibroblasts (CFBs) as well as maturation of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) increased tissue alignment, indicating the important role of both of these factors in developing novel methods to engineer functional cardiac tissues...|$|R
40|$|Two {{complementary}} bottom-up {{approaches are}} presented for the controlled incorporation of "smart " planar defects into self-assembled colloidal photonic crystals (CPCs). The defect layer {{is based on}} a functional nanometer scaled thin film that is either prepared by layer-by-layer self-assembly and <b>microcontact</b> transfer <b>printing</b> or by spin-coating and sacrificial CPC infiltration. The developed methods allow for the integration of designed defect thin films from a huge variety of chemically diverse materials and can be employed at low-cost and large-scale. Optical spectra show a sharp transmission state within the photonic stop band, induced by the defect. The position of the defect wavelength is dependent on the optical thickness of the defect layer. Active tuning of the intragap defect state is performed by preparing defect layers from macromolecules responsive to external stimuli such as light, temperature, redox-cycling and mechanical pressure. The studies are supported by independently performed ellipsometry measurements and theoretical scalar wave approximation calculations. In addition, CPCs with functional biomolecular planar defects are presented. Through shifts of the defect mode, DNA conformational changes, the enantioselective intercalation of a chiral anti-cancer drug and enzyme activities are optically monitored. Incorporation of fluorescent dyes and quantum dots into defect CPCs leads to a clear modification of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra by photonic stopband and defect state.

40|$|TGF-β isoforms are {{important}} signalling molecules in wound repair in the skin. Transforming growth factor β 3 (TGF-β 3) has {{been implicated in}} scarless healing. In both animal and human models the application of exogenous TGF-β 3 causes {{a reduction in the}} inflammatory response and improves the architecture of the neodermis. Research into the influence of TGF-β on scarring has tended to focus on fibroblasts. However, keratinocytes {{play a major role in}} scarring both indirectly, as a result of their influence over the behaviour of fibroblasts and also by directly influencing wound contraction. Thus, experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of TGF-β 3 on the behaviours of a keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). Incubation with TGF-β 3 increased cell spreading and appeared to reduce cell-surface contacts indicated by both SPR imaging and a detachment assay. TGF-β 3 also caused a decreased cell alignment response to <b>microcontact</b> <b>printed</b> protein patterns, in part due to the deposition of laminin which is associated with the TGF-β induced cell migration. There is evidence that TGF-β isoforms differentially influence the outcome of wound healing. Similar to the results produce following addition of exogenous TGF-β 3, the neutralisation of TGF-β 1 and 2 has been shown to reduce scar formation in the adult wounds. During reepithelialisation keratinocytes experience a dynamic environment. Both extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors influence the progression of wound repair which includes both cell migration and proliferation. Few studies have examined collective cell behaviour in response to TGF-β isoforms and ECM coated substrates. Thus both wound closure and cell proliferation assays were conducted for different ECM proteins fibronectin, laminin and collagen type I and for TGF-β 1, 2 and 3. Rates of wound closure were significantly reduced on laminin coated substrates while cell proliferation rates were increased. TGF-β 2 and 3 induced significant increases in wound closure rates. This appeared to correspond with an increase in the number of cells independently migrating out from the wound margins. Only TGF-β 3 caused a significant decrease in cell proliferation over a 4 day period. Laminin 332 deposition is central to the reepithelialisation process and is known to be induced in response to TGF-β. Thus experiments were carried out to investigate HaCaT cell laminin 332 deposition in response to TGF-β 1, 2 and 3. Both an immunofluorescence staining technique and an ELISA based semi-quantification method was used. Following 4 day incubation all TGF-β isoforms significantly increased laminin 332 deposition; however TGF-β 2 and 3 caused the most significant increases. Integrin receptors enable cell-matrix interactions during wound repair. TGF-β is known to influence the expression of integrin subunits. Thus, experiments were carried out to compare the influence of each TGF-β isoform on the expression of subunits α 3, α 2, α 5, β 1 and β 4. All TGF-β isoforms significantly increased all subunit expression. TGF-β 3 caused the most significant increase in β 4 and both TGF-β 2 and 3 caused the most significant increase in α 2. While there were differences in cell responses to each isoforms, TGF-β 3 did not stand out from the other two isoforms. Interestingly, TGF-β 2 shared more similarities with TGF-β 3 than it did with TGF-β 1, in its role in enhancing wound closure and LN 332 deposition. These comparative studies have shown that differences exist in the way TGF-β isoforms influence HaCaT cell behaviour, namely migration, laminin deposition and integrin expression.
