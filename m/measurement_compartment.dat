The reliability of sediment flux estimations from such measurements are dependent upon the specific configuration of the <b>measurement</b> <b>compartments</b> and the analysis approach used. In this study, we analyse the uncertainty of these measurements by investigating the vertical cumulative distribution and relative sediment flux derived from both wind tunnel and field studies. Vertical flux data was examined using existing data in combination with a newly acquired dataset; comprising meteorological data and sediment fluxes from six different events, using three customized catchers at Ameland beaches in northern Netherlands. Fast-temporal data collected in a wind tunnel shows that the median transport height has a scattered pattern between impact and fluid threshold, that increases linearly with shear velocities above the fluid threshold. For finer sediment, a larger proportion was transported closer to the surface compared to coarser sediment fractions. It was also shown that errors originating from the distribution of sampling compartments, specifically {{the location of the}} lowest sediment trap relative to the surface, can be identified using the relative sediment flux. In the field, surface conditions such as surface moisture, surface crusts or frozen surfaces have a more pronounced but localized effect than shear velocity.

40|$|A {{direct effect}} on {{conformation}} of proteins {{is one of the}} existing hypotheses about a potential interaction mechanism of EMF with biological cell cultures and solutions. Effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure on the folding kinetics of bovine β-lactoglobulin protein in terms of reduced relaxation times in response to temperature changes were reported in literature. Experiments with protein solutions are very demanding regarding uncertainties due to various potential side effects caused by the experimental setup. In small volumes of protein solutions (i. e. for solutions in cuvettes) a large temperature gradient can exist leading to significant differences between the temperature distribution of the exposed and the non-exposed case. One of the main concerns is that the observed changes might be due to localized thermal effects induced by electromagnetic fields. Thus, strictly controlled experimental conditions including temperature measurements within the sample are required. In this study potential changes in protein conformation and on the folding kinetics of β-lactoglobulin are investigated using an experimental setup for simultaneously exposing and recording protein solutions. The setup is based on exposure devices for radio frequency (RF-EMF) and extremely low frequency pulsed magnetic fields (ELF-pMF) placed in the <b>measurement</b> <b>compartment</b> of a circular dichroism (CD) spectrophotometer. An optical temperature sensor monitors the temperature {{in the center of the}} volume relevant for the measurement of the protein solution.

While it is evident that current analytical techniques are frequently limited to averaged measurements or ex-situ analysis, the analytical challenges for in-situ multi-parametric characterization of living biological entities such as cells, microbes, bacteria or ensembles thereof remain significant. Hence, in analogy and complementary to Systems Biology concerned with deciphering complex molecular processes and their relation to biological functionalities, we view Systems Analytics as the toolbox enabling the quantitative determination of multiple molecular parameters to elucidate these interactions and relations. From the analytic chemistry point of view, we may describe individual cells as a <b>measurement</b> <b>compartment</b> with spatial/volume dimensions in the μm-nm/μL-nL range, and quantitative molecular dimensions in the mM-nM domain. The spatial dimensionality of molecular events within or at cellular compartments (e. g. vesicular processes) or at the cell surface (e. g. exo-or endocytosis) along with the magnitude of the local species concentration determine the need for quantitative analytical measurements at the micro- and nanoscale. We will discuss the diversity of measurement challenges at these compartments, which include the small dimensions of the involved samples and volumes, the complex and frequently changing background matrix, the sensitivity and/or discriminatory power of in-situ analytical techniques, and their temporal and/or spatial resolution to quantitatively monitor dynamic processes associated with cellular functions. In turn, individual optical/spectroscopic, electrochemical, and surface sensitive analytical techniques have already demonstrated their potential at the macro- and microscopic level, i. e. identifying which molecular species are present, their concentration, their location, and — ideally - the kinetics, dynamics of the involved molecular processes. In contrast to approaches utilizing individual analytical techniques, the development of generic multifunctional analytical platforms orchestrates a suite of complementary measurement techniques to cooperatively investigate complex biological systems, complemented by the development of (bio) sensing chemistries, synthetic molecular receptors, multivariate evaluation techniques, and micro/nanofabrication for functional system miniaturization. Thereby, we capitalize on the benefits of several analytical techniques addressing the conformational, electrochemical, and spectroscopic properties of the sample leading toward simultaneous rather than the classical sequential information acquisition process, aiming at maximizing the synchronicity between multiple methods in the temporal and spatial domain...|$|E

The compartment energy has been introduced by Lysen (1996) under the name “Trias Energica” after Charles de Montesquieu his “Trias Politica ” from 1752. This first three-step vision had not a sequence {{in the degree of}} sustainability.

In accordance to the Trias Energetica, the terms “Trias Hydrica ” (for water), “Trias Hylica ” (for materials) and “Trias Toponoma ” (for space-usage) are introduced.

The infusion protocol could thus allow kinetic modeling under conditions where a shunt surgery is not advisable and alternative less invasive blood sampling techniques are required, e.g., in longitudinal studies.

The accuracy of currently available CGM is yet unsatisfactory and {{may depend on}} the implemented calibration algorithms, which do not compensate adequately for the differences of glucose dynamics between the compartments. Here we propose and validate an innovative calibration algorithm {{for the improvement of}} CGM performance. Methods: CGM data from GlucoDay (A. Menarini, Florence, Italy) and paired reference PG have been obtained from eight subjects without diabetes during eu-, hypo-, and hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps. A cali-bration algorithm based on a dynamic global model (GM) of the relationship between PG and CGM in the interstitial space has been obtained. The GM is composed by independent local models (LMs) weighted and added. LMs are defined by a combination of inputs from the CGM and by a validity function, so that each LM represents to a variable extent a different metabolic condition and/or sensor–subject interaction. The inputs best suited for glucose estimation were the sensor current I and glucose estimations Ĝ, at different time instants [Ik, Ik- 1, Ĝk- 1] (IIG). In addition to IIG, other inputs have been used to obtain the GM, achieving different configurations of the calibration algorithm. Results: Even in its simplest configuration considering only IIG, the new calibration algorithm improved the accuracy of the estimations compared with the manufacturer’s estimate: mean absolute relative difference (MARD) = 10. 8 – 1. 5 % versus 14. 7 – 5. 4 %, respectively (P = 0. 012, by analysis of variance). When additional ex-ogenous signals were considered, the MARD improved further (7. 8 – 2. 6 %, P < 0. 05).

Current commercially available CGMS are minimally invasive and offer an estimation of plasma glucose from measurements in the interstitial fluidCGMS is a key component of the technical approach to build the artificial pancreas, aiming at closing the loop in combination with an insulin pump. Yet, the accuracy of current CGMS is still poor and it may partly depend on low performance of the implemented Calibration Algorithm (CA). In addition, the sensor-to-patient sensitivity is different between patients and also for the same patient in time. It is clear, then, that the development of new efficient calibration algorithms for CGMS is an interesting and challenging problem. The indirect measurement of plasma glucose through interstitial glucose is a main confounder of CGMS accuracy. Many components take part in the glucose transport dynamics. Indeed, physiology might suggest the existence of different local behaviors in the glucose transport process. For this reason, local modeling techniques may be the best option for the structure of the desired CA. Thus, similar input samples are represented by the same local model.

" For "extracellular fluid " esti-mations, this condition implies equal concentra-tion of the substance throughout all of the intra-and extravascular fluid outside of body cells. If the material employed is physically or chemically bound by non-diffusible components of serum, intravascular concentration will exceed extra-vascular concentration, and uniform distribution will not occur. Recent work performed in part at this labora-tory shows that the thiocyanate ion, heretofore used extensively for estimation of "extracellular fluid " volume, is actually bound to albumin in human serum and therefore is not uniformly dis-tributed throughout the compartment (2). If the concentration of serum albumin is known, its binding effect can be determined {{by means of a}} formula (2). However, {{it is not possible to}} determine the binding effect of extravascular albumin, since its concentration and distribution cannot be measured. Gilman, Philips and Koelle suggested the use of another ion, thiosulfate, for estimating "extra-cellular fluid " volume (3). The present study was undertaken to determine if this anion, like thiocyanate, was bound to any appreciable extent by non-diffusible components of human serum...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{external}} knee adduction torque {{has been}} proposed as a surrogate measure for medial compartment load during gait. However, a direct link between these two quantities has not been demonstrated using in vivo <b>measurement</b> of medial <b>compartment</b> load. This study uses in vivo data collected from a single subject with an instrumented knee implant to evaluate this link. The subject performed five different overground gait motions (normal, fast, slow, wide, and toe-out) with simultaneous collection of instrumented implant, video motion, and ground reaction data. For each trial, the knee adduction torque was measured externally while the total axial force applied to the tibial insert was measured internally. Based on data collected from the same subject performing treadmill gait under fluoroscopic motion analysis, a regression equation was developed to calculate medial contact force from the implant load cellmeasurements. Correlation analyseswere performed for the stance phase and entire gait cycle to quantify {{the relationship between the}} knee adduction torque and both the medial contact force and the medial to total contact force ratio. When the entire gait cycle was analyzed, R 2 for medial contact force was 0. 77 when all gait trials were analyzed together and between 0. 69 and 0. 93 when each gait trial was analyzed separately (p< 0. 001 in all cases). Formedial to total force ratio,R 2 was 0. 69 for all trials together and between 0. 54 and 0. 90 fo...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} bioavailability of arsenic, antimony, cadmium, {{and lead}} for the ingestion pathway {{was measured in}} 16 soils contaminated by either smelting or mining activities using a juvenile swine model. The soils contained 18 to 25 [*] 000 mg kg– 1 As, 18 to 60 [*] 000 mg kg– 1 Sb, 20 to 184 mg kg– 1 Cd, and 1460 to 40 [*] 214 mg kg– 1 Pb. The bioavailability in the soils was measured in kidney, liver, bone, and urine relative to soluble salts of the four elements. The variety of soil types, the total concentrations of the elements, {{and the range of}} bioavailabilities found were considered to be suitable for calibrating the in vitro Unified BARGE bioaccessibility method. The bioaccessibility test has been developed by the BioAccessibility Research Group of Europe (BARGE) and is known as the Unified BARGE Method (UBM). The study looked at four end points from the in vivo <b>measurements</b> and two <b>compartments</b> in the in vitro study (“stomach” and “stomach and intestine”). Using benchmark criteria for assessing the “fitness for purpose” of the UBM bioaccessibility data to act as an analogue for bioavailability in risk assessment, the study shows that the UBM met criteria on repeatability (median relative standard deviation value 0. 6) for As, Cd, and Pb. The data suggest a small bias in the UBM relative bioaccessibility of As and Pb compared to the relative bioavailability measurements of 3...|$|R
40|$|Summary: To {{evaluate}} and improve on the procedures {{used by a}} tissue bank in selecting donor menisci for transplantation {{this study was designed}} to fulfill four objectives: (a) define and quantify a set of independent parameters for describing the geometry of the medial and lateral menisci, (b) determine how well the sizing protocol of the tissue bank (i. e. two transverse roentgenographic measurements obtained from the injured knee or six transverse magnetic resonance imaging measurements obtained from the contralateral knee) predicts the four standard transverse parameters of the menisci, (c) determine if including one additional transverse roentgeno-graphic <b>measurement</b> for each <b>compartment</b> improves the ability of roentgenograms to predict transverse menis-cal parameters, and (d) determine if five magnetic resonance imaging measurements at three different meniscal cross sections of the contralateral knee predict the 15 standard cross-sectional parameters of the meniscus in the injured knee. A laser-based, noncontacting three-dimensional coordinate digitizing system was used to determine surface coordinates from which menisci were reconstructed in a computer. For each reconstructed meniscus, four parameters in the transverse plane and five cross sectional parameters in each of three regions (i. e., anterior, middle, and posterior) were defined, yielding a set of 19 standard parameters to describe the geometry. Through a correlation analysis, these standard parameters were shown to be largely unrelated to one another, thus confirm-ing that the parameters form an independent set describing the three-dimensional geometry of the menisci.

40|$|Introduction: Determine body {{composition}} changes in adiposity can assess an individual. Objective: The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate total body fat percentage based on two and four compartment models in obese Chilean school children, adjusting for differences in sex and puberty status. Methods: Sixty-one obese school children (33 boys and 28 girls) between 8 and 13 years of age were evaluated. Two <b>compartment</b> <b>measurements</b> of body fat percentage considered isotope dilution, plethysmography, radiographic absorptiometry and bioelectrical impedance; using the four compartment model as a benchmark. Results: Each method explained between 43 - 87 % of the variance in body fat percentage in Tanner stage I and II children and between 78 - 96 % in Tanner stage III and V children. In both groups of children methods differed significantly for stage I, with the exception of plethysmography. High R- 2 values were observed for girls in all Tanner stages. Each method explained between 34 - 92 % of the variance in body fat percentage for girls in stages I and II and between 63 - 93 % for stages III and V. In obese boys, R- 2 values were high for stages III and V. In girls and boys in Tanner stage III and V, the smallest differences were observed for isotopic dilution, and DXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan for stages I and II. Conclusions: For obese boys and girls, the two compartment model with isotopic dilution and DXA had the best precision and smallest differences in determining body fat percentage compared to the benchmarkDomeyko Project, University of Chile 	 FONDECYT 	 314034...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Previous {{studies showed that}} the accuracy of IgG subclasses (ISs) in differentiating membranous lupus nephritis (MLN) from primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) is, 80 %. This study hy-pothesized that diagnostic accuracy of ISs would be increased if renal <b>compartment</b> <b>measurements</b> and decision tree analysis are applied. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Renal biopsy specimens from 41 patients with MLN and 59 patients with PMN between October 2004 and March 2010 were examined, and immunofluorescence staining against IgG 1, IgG 2, IgG 3, and IgG 4 aswell as C 3, C 1 q, andC 4 was evaluated infive different renal compartments (glomerular capillarywalls, mesangium, tubules, interstitium, and blood vessels). From IS data, a decision tree to differentiate MLN from PMN was produced (IS decision tree) and its accuracy was {{compared with that of}} previous studies. Diagnostic accuracy of the IS decision tree was also compared with that of the complement decision tree as a reference. Results The demographic information and patterns of IS depositionwere similar to those of previous studies. The IS decision tree had, as decision markers, IgG 1 in the mesangium and IgG 2 and IgG 4 along the glomerular capillary wall. The IS decision tree showed higher accuracy (88 %) than that of previous studies (, 80 %) and also that of the complement decision tree (81 %). Conclusions Accuracy of ISs was increased due to the study methods, but the same methodology was less effective using complement measurements. Appropriate data analysis may enhance diagnostic value, but the analysis alone cannot achieve the ideal diagnostic value...|$|R
