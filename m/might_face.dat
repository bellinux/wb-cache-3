5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{destruction}} of the Quino checkerspot butterfly were raised by the community group Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter's approval for the project. Early the next year, an environmental impact report suggested that Bonita <b>might</b> <b>face</b> negative effects from the freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed the project that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected to it. A contractor for the project was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.|$|E
5|$|Johnson sought {{nomination}} by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. He remained {{very popular}} among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, {{just before the}} convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis {{and a few others}} still <b>might</b> <b>face</b> trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|The Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs (RWCP), {{the brainchild}} of Sarah Durant and Rosie Woodroffe (of the Zoological Society of London), was started in 2007 with the primary aim of {{ensuring}} better conservation measures for the cheetah and the wild dogtwo species with very low population densities. A joint initiative by the ZSL, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the IUCN Cat Specialist Group, the program has among its major goals {{a review of the}} conservation policies adopted by the South African countries, and study and action on illegal hunting and trade of the cheetah. In a 2007 publication, Durant emphasised the role of land management and improvement in connectivity across the range in cheetah conservation, in the lack of which the populations <b>might</b> <b>face</b> severe fragmentation.|$|E

5|$|This growing {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome <b>might</b> <b>face,</b> and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, {{on the part}} of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were exceptions to this (such as military rule of Sicily after the First Punic War), it was not until after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in parts of the west, such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{tried to}} enforce a controversial media law that would see Clarín lose licenses and be forced to sell most of its assets. The law was initially sanctioned as a competition law for the media, but critics pointed {{out that it is}} only being used to further the campaign against Clarín. The government had little interest in enforcing measures of the law that were not related to Clarín. Clarín launched a constitutional challenge against some articles of the law with the judiciary. The government released an anti-Clarín advertisement claiming it refused to obey the law and may be subverting democracy. The conflict led to disputes with the judiciary. Minister Julio Alak said that extending an injunction that allowed Clarín to keep its assets during the trial would be an insurrection, and it was rumored that judges who did not rule as the government wished <b>might</b> <b>face</b> impeachment. The court extended the inunction.|$|E

25|$|Sigmund Rascher was {{tasked with}} helping the Luftwaffe {{determine}} what was safe for their pilots—because aircraft were being built to fly higher than ever before.

Phase I of COMPTUEX included a detailed schedule of events (SOE) designed to provide specific task training and evaluation for the carrier strike group and warfare commanders. Phase II consisted of a real-world type exercise with no pre-planned SOE, {{and it was also}} known as the final battle problem.|$|E
30|$|There are {{approaches}} to detect AUs in static face images [14]; however, approaches on video analysis prove {{to have some}} advantages. FE results obtained from video analysis have higher confidence level than results from static face images. Indeed, neutral <b>faces</b> <b>might</b> contain some AUs that can be discriminated only by video analysis. For example, some upper neutral <b>faces</b> <b>might</b> appear to frown because of available wrinkles between two eyes.|$|R

25|$|In 1859 Besant vacated his Fellowship with Saint John's {{college to}} marry Margaret Elizabeth Willis, {{daughter}} of Rev. Robert Willis, {{a professor of}} natural philosophy at Cambridge. They had two sons and a daughter. In 1863 Besant published Elementary Hydrostatics, a textbook on fluid statics containing mathematical exercises such as students <b>might</b> <b>face</b> in examination. The book was reprinted several times, and revised in 1892. He also wrote Treatise on Hydromechanics (1867) covering fluid mechanics. His book Elementary Conics came out in 1901.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Imperial cult {{was based}} on a general polytheism that, by {{combining}} veneration for the paterfamilias and for the ancestor, developed a public celebration of the reigning Emperor as a father and divine leader. From time to time compulsory displays of loyalty or patriotism were required; those refusing the state cult <b>might</b> <b>face</b> a painful death. While polytheists might go along with little conviction, such a cult ran directly contrary to the dedicated Christian life, based on a confessed foundation of a single triune deity.|$|E
25|$|A {{landmark}} {{study of}} bison genetics that {{was performed by}} James Derr of the Texas A University corroborated this. The Derr study was undertaken {{in an attempt to}} determine what genetic problems bison <b>might</b> <b>face</b> as they repopulate former areas, and it noted that bison were faring well, despite their apparent genetic bottleneck. One possible explanation for this might be the small amount of domestic cattle genes that are now in most bison populations, though this is not the only possible explanation for bison success.|$|E

25|$|Figures such as agent Max Clifford {{have advised}} gay players {{to keep their}} {{sexuality}} a secret {{for the sake of}} their careers, saying that to be openly gay would potentially damage their playing prospects. This would also apply abroad, where even if accepted in England a gay player <b>might</b> <b>face</b> a new barrier if he wished to play in a country less accepting of homosexuality. Coming out would undoubtedly bring a gay player abuse from the terraces, and perhaps elsewhere too; this would affect some players more than others.|$|E
25|$|In early October 1917, Robertson asked Allenby {{to state}} his extra troop {{requirements}} to advance from the Gaza-Beersheba line (30 miles wide) to the Jaffa-Jerusalem line (50 miles wide), {{urging him to}} take no chances in estimating {{the threat of a}} German-reinforced threat. Allenby's estimate was that he would need 13 extra divisions (an impossible demand even if Haig's forces went on the defensive) and that he <b>might</b> <b>face</b> 18 Turkish and 2 German divisions. Yet, in private letters, Allenby and Robertson agreed that sufficient British Empire troops were already in place to take and hold Jerusalem.|$|E

Unsolicited e-mails were sent by Nick Williams, the acting inspector at the Metropolitan Police's Diamond Support Group, to Labour MPs.
