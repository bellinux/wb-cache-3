Even in lackluster films, however, he nevertheless often {{succeeded in making}} art of what <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> hackwork. Still, for all his tireless work in the studios, Manne's labor of love was his contribution to jazz as an American art form, {{to which he had}} dedicated himself since his youth and continued to work at almost to the last day of his life.|$|E
5|$|Pre-sejm (Polish: przedsejmowe) sejmiks were convened by {{the king}} who sent a writ (legacja królewska) to each sejmik, {{outlining}} the reasons the next Sejm would be held. Such sejmiks elected one to six deputies (poslowie), {{depending on the size}} and importance of the sejmik's territory, to the ordinary General Sejm (Polish: Sejm Walny) that was held every two years, and to any extraordinary General Sejm that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> at any time in an emergency. Sometimes pre-sejm sejmiks were referred to as electoral. In some cases, a sejmik could be called for two voivodeships – in that case it could elect more than 6 deputies. Deputies were given instructions on how to vote during the sejm proper, although on occasion the instructions could be vague, or even give the deputies full freedom. These sejmiks arose in the late 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the evening}} on October 23, {{a series of}} phone calls between Green and Farrar {{escalated}} into a confrontation. Farrar was convinced that Green was continuing to drink heavily while {{she should have been}} caring for the children, and he told Green that he knew she had poisoned him and that Social Services <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> to protect the children if she failed to get her life in order. After the last call between Green and Farrar, Farrar watched television alone in his apartment until about 12:30, when a neighbor's phone call alerted him to the fire.|$|E

5|$|In 1941 the U.S. Government {{announced}} {{an effort to}} increase cooperation between the different countries in North and South America, {{through the use of}} film. Nelson D. Rockefeller chaired the government committee, and requested the help of the Association of Motion Picture Producers. Y. Frank Freeman, the associations chairman, appointed Briskin the chair of the committee on South American Film Facilities. When the Motion Picture Defense Committee was expanded in 1941, Briskin continued {{to be one of the}} six producers. In April 1941, Harry Cohn promoted Briskin to Head of Production at Columbia. Briskin joined the Army Signal Corps as a reserve officer, commissioned as a major, and was put in charge of the film division of the War Committee. After the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, there was concern that film professionals in Hollywood who were officers in the armed forces reserves <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> to active duty. By May 1942, Briskin was acknowledged as the vice-chair of the Motion Picture Defense Committee. In that month, he and chair Nathan Levinson created a sub-committee in order to find more technicians to enlist in the Signal Corps. In June Briskin was rewarded with a six-year contract by Columbia, at a rate of $2000 per week, as well as stock options.|$|E

Finally, he decided to pursue this call, trusting that if God willed it, seemingly impassable doors would open.|$|R
25|$|In Western European terms, Spybuck's style <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> naïve art, but {{his works}} differs from most naïve artists' {{due to the}} {{influence}} of ethnographic patronage that guided his choice to include certain details and an infusion of a sense of humor and personality.
