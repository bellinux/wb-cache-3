Unlike CT64, the second version would be a short demo developed in a cross-platform engine with a single 3D playing mode.

40|$|Internal {{representations}} of the environment are often invoked to explain performance in tasks in which an organism must make a detour around an obstacle to reach a target and the organism can {{lose sight of the}} target along the path to the target. By simulating a detour task in evolving populations of robots (Khepera) we show that neural networks with <b>memory</b> <b>units</b> perform better than networks without <b>memory</b> <b>units</b> in this task. However, the content of the <b>memory</b> <b>units</b> need not be interpreted as an internal representation of the position of target. The <b>memory</b> <b>units</b> send a time-varying internally generated input to the network's hidden units that allows the network to generate the appropriate behavior even when there is no external input. Networks without <b>memory</b> <b>units</b> do not have this internal input and this explains their inferior performance. 1 Detour behavior Imagine a robot (an artificial organism) that must reach a target object located somewhere in the environment.

25|$|The TOSHIBA {{optical drive}} {{used in the}} unit can read Compact Discs and DVDs in {{addition}} to HD DVDs when connected to a host that supports reading these formats (such as a PC).

The operating system must have a UDF 2.5 driver to read data from HD DVDs. In addition a software player capable of playing HD DVD titles is required for playback of video. The 256MB internal <b>Memory</b> <b>Unit</b> on the drive which is used for storage of HD DVD features is also accessible by manually installing USB Mass Storage drivers. Once installed, this can be formatted for use as a storage device although it will no longer function on an Xbox 360 unless it is reformatted.|$|E
25|$|ENIAC was a one-of-a-kind {{design and}} was never repeated. The freeze on design in 1943 meant that the {{computer}} design would lack some innovations that soon became well-developed, notably the ability to store a program. Eckert and Mauchly started work on a new design, to be later called the EDVAC, which would be both simpler and more powerful. In particular, in 1944 Eckert wrote his description of a <b>memory</b> <b>unit</b> (the mercury delay line) which would hold both the data and the program. John von Neumann, who was consulting for the Moore School on the EDVAC, sat in on the Moore School meetings at which the stored program concept was elaborated. Von Neumann wrote up an incomplete set of notes (First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC) which were intended {{to be used as}} an internal memorandum—describing, elaborating, and couching in formal logical language the ideas developed in the meetings. ENIAC administrator and security officer Herman Goldstine distributed copies of this First Draft to a number of government and educational institutions, spurring widespread interest in {{the construction of a new}} generation of electronic computing machines, including Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) at Cambridge University, England and SEAC at the U.S. Bureau of Standards.|$|E

For the first time, our allocation scheme for stacks distributes the stack among multiple <b>memory</b> <b>units.</b> For global and stack data, the scheme is provably equal to or better than any other compiler scheme or set of programmer annotations. Results from our benchmarks show a 44. 2 % reduction in runtime from using our distributed stack strategy vs. using a unified stack, and a further 11. 8 % reduction in runtime from using a linear optimization strategy for allocation vs. a simpler greedy strategy; both in the case of the SRAM size being 20 % of the total data size. For some programs, less than 5 % of data in SRAM achieves a similar speedup...|$|R

Prior to the game's release in Japan in November 1999, Sega promoted {{the game with a}} website dedicated to ChuChu Rocket!, and a 15-second commercial advertising the game was solicited to television stations across the country, with the commercial also made available to download through the website. ChuChu Rocket! released in Japan on November 11, 1999 and {{climbed to the top of}} the Japanese sales charts in its first week on sale, selling 35,000 copies and knocking the PlayStation release of Chrono Trigger off the top spot.

Players who successfully beat the minigame were given a password which could be sent back to Famitsu.

ChuChu Rocket! was released in North America on March 7, 2000; a week later than had been announced earlier. It retailed for $29.99, lower than an average for a new Dreamcast game.
