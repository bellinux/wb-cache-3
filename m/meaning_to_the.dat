People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject's own words) can be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> person using them.|$|E
5|$|Madgulkar did {{not make}} any attempt to provide new {{interpretation}} or <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ramayana but told the same story in the simpler and poetic format. With inclusion of characters like Ahalya and Shabari, he included the sentiments of religious devotion (Bhakti) and also gave divine touch to the story while describing the marriage of Sita and Rama as a union of Maya and Brahman. He composed songs on all seven chapters or Kāṇḍa of Ramayana. Out of 56 songs, poet composed twelve songs on Balakanda, seven on Ayodhya Kanda, fourteen on Aranya Kanda, three on Kishkindha Kanda, four on Sundara Kanda, twelve on Yuddha Kanda and three on Uttara Kanda.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{hoped to}} produce a {{balanced}} depiction of religion, and he, Falchuk and series co-creator Ian Brennan worked {{to ensure that there}} was an equality between pro and anti-religious sentiments expressed. The episode features seven cover versions of songs, each of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100, marking the series' one-week debut high in the US. Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of the musical performances, with some complaining of the tangential relationship between the numbers and religion, and others appreciating that the Glee versions brought new <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> songs.|$|E

5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E
5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons. Noting that songs have a strong <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> franchise, he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series' albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form. He also wanted to create an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires, and this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as he felt it was simple to play on. At the same time, the team also wanted to create scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E

40|$|Can adults {{attribute}} different <b>meanings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cries {{produced by}} the newborns {{on the basis of}} physical-acoustic cues in different communication conditions? In order to test this hypothesis, 20 females were asked to evaluate (according to four scales: anguish, anger, annoyance, care-seeking) 24 cries from 12 healthy full-term newborns (4 - 7 h old) : 6 newborns previously exposed to tactile communication (Group 1); 6 newborns without communication (Group 2). Annoyance category was not reliable and it was excluded from analyses. The 20 females attributed a higher rate of anger and anguish <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cries from Group 2, and a higher rate of care-seeking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cries from Group 1. They attributed different <b>meanings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cries from Group 1, and undifferentiated <b>meanings</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cries from Group 2. Consistent with bivariate analyses, Dysphonic Cry was the strongest predictor of anger/anguish. Although the Hyperphonic Cry was quantitatively not relevant, its absence was the first predictor for care-seeking...|$|R

It is also smooth and analytic because the transition functions have these properties as well.|$|E
25|$|This {{proof is}} similar to the first one, but tries to give <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notion of {{polynomial}} with matrix coefficients that was suggested by the expressions occurring in that proof. This requires considerable care, since it is somewhat unusual to consider polynomials with coefficients in a non-commutative ring, and not all reasoning that is valid for commutative polynomials can be applied in this setting.|$|E

25|$|Some specialists say {{the word}} may have {{originated}} during the Great Portuguese Discoveries, giving <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sadness felt about those who departed on journeys to unknown seas and disappeared in shipwrecks, died in battle, or simply never returned. Those who stayed behind—mostly women and children—suffered deeply in their absence. However, the Portuguese discoveries only started in 1415 and since the word {{has been found in}} earlier texts, this does not constitute a very good explanation. The Reconquista also offers a plausible explanation.|$|E
25|$|In 1598 an Italian–English {{dictionary}} by John Florio was published. It was {{the first}} English dictionary to use quotations ("illustrations") to give <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> word; surprisingly, in none of these dictionaries so far were there any actual definitions of words. This was to change, to a small extent, in schoolmaster Robert Cawdrey's Table Alphabeticall, published in 1604.

25|$|The {{region was}} known to the Greeks as Pentapotamia, meaning the region of five rivers.

The five rivers, namely Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, flow via the Panjnad River into the Indus River and eventually into the Arabian Sea. Of the five great rivers of Punjab, four course through Pakistan's Punjab province.|$|E
25|$|Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) uses {{a series}} of kavanot, {{directions}} of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher <b>meaning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting {{the very fabric of}} reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.|$|E
