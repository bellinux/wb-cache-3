40|$|Two {{case studies}} of miniholes, rapid ozone decreases, noted in 1987 near {{the base of the}} Antarctic {{peninsula}} are studied using a digital filter. The results show a strong correlation of the total ozone <b>minihole</b> with a temperature <b>minihole</b> (a negative temperature perturbation), and a westward tilt with altitude of the temperature <b>minihole.</b> The ozone <b>minihole</b> is phase shifted both slightly to the east of a high in the geopotential height field and slightly to the west of a local low in the Ertel potential vorticity field...|$|E
40|$|Using {{seven years}} of data from tha SAM 2 (Stratospheric Aerosol Measurement 2) and TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) instruments, along with 70 mbar {{temperatures}} extracted from an NMC analysis, {{the effect of the}} austral spring polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) on the formation of total ozone miniholes is investigated. A total ozone <b>minihole</b> event is designated as the rapid decrease of more than 20 DU of total ozone over a time period of a day and a spatial extent of approximately 1000 by 1000 km. The severe decrease of total ozone during these <b>minihole</b> events could be explained in part by PSC being formed at altitudes of 10 to 24 km and preventing scattered UV radiation from ozone below the cloud from reaching the TOMS instrument. A result of the cloud's opaqueness is that the total ozone retrieval from TOMS data would underestimate the ozone column {{in the vicinity of the}} PSC. The approach to investigate the effect of PSC on total ozone was to use SAM 2 aerosol extinction values in conjunction with NMC stratospheric temperatures to determine if PSC are present during total ozone <b>minihole</b> events occurring during August and September, 1979 to 1986. The <b>minihole</b> events during these seven years were divided into two types: type 1, where the <b>minihole</b> region of 24 hour darkness from regions exposed to sunlight, and type 2, where the <b>minihole</b> occurred 5 to 10 degrees north of the terminator. The presence of PSC in a given region was ascertained by a maximum aerosol extinction greater than. 006 /km occurring with a temperature less than 189 K. It is found that PSC are consistently present with type 2 <b>minihole</b> events. This is contrasted with PSC rarely occurring in the same vicinity of type 2 miniholes. Also observed of that type 1 <b>minihole</b> events have minimum total ozone values which are on the average 3 to 10 DU smaller than type 2 miniholes. It can be concluded that care must be taken when trying to deduce a dynamical explanation of <b>minihole</b> events near the polar terminator and the role of PSC must be accounted for in type 1 <b>minihole</b> formation...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional model {{simulations}} {{are used}} to describe the January 31, 1989 ozone <b>minihole</b> over Stavanger, Norway. This <b>minihole</b> is typical of many transient events in the lower stratosphere that arise because of cyclonic-scale disturbances in the troposphere. Although the ozone reduction is a short-lived reversible dynamical event, through heterogeneous chemical processes there can be a significant transfer of chlorine from reservoir molecules to active radicals. This chemically perturbed air is defined as processed air, and it is found that a single event can produce enough processed air to reduce the HCl in the entire polar vortex. Chemical processing on clouds associated with transient events is shown to be a major source of processed air in the polar vortex in December before background temperatures are cold enough for more uniform heterogeneous conversion...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the statistical {{relationship between the}} total ozone column (TOC) and atmospheric blocking using 40 -yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) data for the 1978 - 98 period, with special emphasis on winter and the European and eastern Pacific sectors. Regional blocking occurrence {{is accompanied by a}} decrease of TOC within the anticyclonic circulation region and a distinctive ozone increase upstream and downstream (upstream and south) in the Pacific (European) sector. Blocking significantly enhances the likelihood of low TOC extremes, especially over the Scandinavian and the Alaska Peninsulas, where more than 50 % of winter blocks lead to TOC values in the lowest tail of the distribution. The relationship between ozone <b>miniholes</b> and blocking is confined to the high latitudes of both basins and is strong in Europe, where about half of the ozone <b>miniholes</b> occur simultaneously with blocking. Blocking-related ozone <b>miniholes</b> (blocking ozone <b>miniholes)</b> are also among the most intense and persistent. Although blocking activity does not drive the interannual variability of regional ozone <b>miniholes,</b> blocking ozone <b>miniholes</b> account for up to two-thirds of the total observed trend of ozone <b>miniholes</b> in Europe. The polar vortex is proposed as a feasible candidate for explaining the enhanced coupling of blocking and ozone <b>miniholes</b> in Europe and its long-term modulation. Blocking ozone <b>miniholes</b> are consistent with an almost purely dynamic origin caused by horizontal transport of ozone-poor air and vertical motions working together at different levels to reduce ozone content. Although the contribution of the former is dominant, accounting for two-thirds of ozone reduction in the 330 - 850 -K column, the effect of the latter becomes a distinctive feature of blocking ozone <b>miniholes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Localized rapid {{reductions}} in total ozone (<b>miniholes),</b> which were observed during the Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment, are studied with particular {{attention given to}} meteorological aspects. It is suggested that <b>miniholes</b> are forced by tropospheric weather features {{and that they are}} largely reversible distortions to the airflow around the vortex. The relationship between the <b>miniholes</b> and upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric synoptic-scale disturbances is studied.

Transitions from annihilation of matter to deflation in the collapse and from inflation to creation of matter in the birth of a universe are considered. The creation of a new universe takes place in another space-time since beyond the event horizon the time coordinate is inextensible for an external observer.

40|$|The {{impact of}} dynamic and {{chemical}} processes on the ozone {{distribution of the}} Northern Hemisphere is estimated using a multiannual simulation of the dynamic-chemical general circulation model ECHAM/CHEM. The simulation includes two contrasting winter situations, characterized by an instable and warm stratospheric polar vortex, the other by a stable and cold polar vortex. Ozone destruction induced by heterogeneous reactions on polar stratospheric clouds are found inside the polar vortex in both winter situations. Outside the polar vortex no heterogeneous reactions occur. Nevertheless a total ozone decrease is evident, as parts of the polar vortex are cut off and transport ozone reduced airmasses out of the polar vortex. A blocking situation and an ozone <b>minihole</b> simulated by the model were also analyzed. In both cases large scale lifting yields large total ozone decrease and stratospheric chlorine activation. Chemical ozone destruction results downstream of this local activation. (orig.) 122 refs.

40|$|A recent {{mathematical}} re-interpretation of the Schwarzschild {{solution to}} the Einstein equations implies global constancy {{of the speed of}} light c in fulfilment of a 1912 proposal of Max Abraham. As a consequence, the horizon lies {{at the end of an}} infinitely long funnel in spacetime. Hence black holes lack evaporation and charge. Both features affect the behavior of miniblack holes as are expected to be produced soon at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The implied nonlinearity enables the “quasar-scaling conjecture. “ The latter implies that an earthbound <b>minihole</b> turns into a planet-eating attractor much earlier than previously calculated – not after millions of years of linear growth but after months of nonlinear growth. A way to turn the almost disaster into a planetary bonus is suggested.

40|$|Abstract. An ozone mini-hole is a synoptic-scale area of {{strongly}} reduced column total ozone, which {{undergoes a}} growth-decay cycle {{in association with}} baroclinic weather systems. The tracks of mini-hole events recorded during the TOMS observation period over the Northern Hemisphere provide a database for building anomaly fields of various meteorological parameters, following each mini-hole center in a Lagrangian sense. The resulting fields provide, for the first time, a complete mean Lagrangian picture of the three-dimensional structure of typical ozone mini-holes in the Northern Hemisphere. Mini-holes are shown {{to be associated with}} anomalous warm anticyclonic flow in the upper troposphere and cold cyclonic anomalies in the middle stratosphere. Ascending air columns occur upstream and descent downstream of the mini-hole centers. Band-pass filtering is used to reveal the transient synoptic nature of <b>miniholes</b> embedded within larger scale circulation anomalies. Significant correlations between ozone and Ertel’s potential vorticity on isentropes (IPV) both near the tropopause and in the middle stratosphere are shown and then utilized by reconstructing the Lagrangian analysis to follow local IPV anomalies instead of ozone minima. By using IPV as a proxy for ozone, the geopotential anomaly dipolar structure in the vertical characteristic of mini-holes is shown to result from a superposition of two largely independent dynamical components, stratospheric and tropospheric, typically operating on different time scales. Hence, ozone mini-holes may be viewed primarily as phenomena of coincidence. Key words. Meteorology and atmospheric dynamics (middle atmosphere dynamics; synoptic-scale meteorology...|$|R
40|$|During the austral {{autumn of}} 1997, a {{sequence}} of record low ozone events with anomalous behavior occurred at subtropical latitudes to midlatitudes over southern South America, {{also known as the}} South Cone (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Southern Brazil). The extreme low ozone events took place in May and early June 1997, i. e., at a time of the year when according to the climatological studies for Northern Hemisphere ozone miniholes, the most significant events would not be expected (if such studies could be simply extrapolated to the Southern Hemisphere). The first and most prominent ozone <b>minihole,</b> with a quasi-stationary evolution, reached values near 200 DU, i. e., a negative anomaly near 90 DU, close to 40 °S. Simultaneously, extreme weather conditions were observed over the South Cone: three significant blocking events took place separated by short intervals. Both the behavior of the ozone layer over the region and the evolution of the blocking events were analyzed. As expected, the evolution of the total ozone column is shown to be linked to these perturbed weather conditions. Despite the apparently similar nature of the blocking events and of the ozone decrease during each of these events, the present study shows that the response of the UT/LS region is different in each case. The respective roles of the vertical displacement of the tropopause and the horizontal advection/divergence of ozone is discussed for the two most important events, showing how these two mechanisms combine in different ways to yield very low total ozone values. The vertical displacement of the tropopause, coupled {{to the size of the}} tropopause pressure gradient, appears to be the most efficient mechanism to modify the total ozone column amounts.
