5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on <b>motor</b> <b>fuels</b> and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E

40|$|The world’s most {{expensive}} <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> (gasoline, diesel and LPG) is sold most {{likely in the}} Republic of Turkey. This paper investigates the key {{issues related to the}} <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> prices in Turkey. First of all, the paper analyses the main reason behind high prices, namely <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> taxes in Turkey. Then, it estimates the elasticity of <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> demand in Turkey using an econometric analysis. The findings indicate that <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> demand in Turkey is quite inelastic and, therefore, not responsive to price increases caused by an increase in either pre-tax prices or taxes. Therefore, fuel market in Turkey is open to opportunistic behaviour by firms (through excessive profits) and the government (through excessive taxes). Besides, the paper focuses on the impact of high <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> prices on road transport associated activities, including the pattern of passenger transportation, motorization rate, fuel use, total kilometers travelled and CO 2 emissions from road transportation. The impact of <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> prices on income distribution in Turkey and Turkish public opinion about high <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> prices are also among the subjects investigated {{in the course of the}} study. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>fuel</b> {{taxes at}} {{state and federal}} levels have {{traditionally}} been earmarked for transportation investments, supporting road construction, maintenance, and operations, and increasingly public transit. Recently, elected officials {{have been reluctant to}} raise fuel taxes despite increases in the cost of transportation programs. Other forms of support, especially borrowing and local sales taxes are playing larger roles in transportation finance. Raising fuel taxes would be more effective, efficient and equitable than the alternatives that are increasingly more popular. It is difficult to find support among elected officials for proposals to raise taxes of any sort. Yet, from whatever direction I approach transportation policy, I uncover reasons that <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> taxes should be higher.

25|$|Electric {{lighting}} started displacing kerosene as an illuminant in {{the late}} 19th century, especially in urban areas. However, kerosene remained the predominant commercial end-use for petroleum refined in the United States until 1909, when it was exceeded by <b>motor</b> <b>fuels.</b> The rise of the gasoline-powered automobile in the early 20th century created a demand for the lighter hydrocarbon fractions, and refiners invented methods to increase the output of gasoline, while decreasing the output of kerosene. In addition, some of the heavier hydrocarbons that previously went into kerosene were incorporated into diesel fuel. Kerosene kept some market share by being increasingly used in stoves and portable heaters.|$|E
25|$|Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a {{value-added}} tax {{introduced by the}} Federal Government in 1991 {{at a rate of}} 7%, later reduced to the current rate of 5%. A Harmonized Sales Tax (HST; combined GST and provincial sales tax) is collected in New Brunswick (15%), Newfoundland (13%), Nova Scotia (15%), Ontario (13%), Prince Edward Island (15%), and, for a short time until 2013, British Columbia (12%). (Quebec has a de facto 14.975% HST: its provincial sales tax follows the same rules as the GST, and both are collected together by Revenu Québec.) Advertised and posted prices generally exclude taxes, which are calculated at time of payment; common exceptions are <b>motor</b> <b>fuels,</b> the posted prices for which include sales and excise taxes, and items in vending machines as well as alcohol in monopoly stores.

25|$|As of 2011, {{most of the}} U.S. {{car fleet}} was able to run on blends of up to 10% ethanol, and motor vehicle {{manufacturers}} produced vehicles designed to run on more concentrated blends. As of 2015, seven states – Missouri, Minnesota, Louisiana, Montana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington – required ethanol to be blended with gasoline in <b>motor</b> <b>fuels.</b> These states, particularly Minnesota, had more ethanol usage, and {{according to a source}} at Washington University, these states accumulated substantial environmental and economic benefits as a result. Florida required ethanol blends as of the end of 2010, but has since repealed it. Many cities had separate ethanol requirements due to non-attainment of federal air quality standards. In 2007, Portland, Oregon, became the first U.S. city to require all gasoline sold within city limits to contain at least 10% ethanol. Chicago has proposed the idea of mandating E15 in the city limits, while some area gas stations have already begun offering it.|$|E

25|$|One early {{example of}} {{inventory}} proportionality {{used in a}} retail application in the United States was for <b>motor</b> <b>fuel.</b> <b>Motor</b> <b>fuel</b> (e.g. gasoline) is generally stored in underground storage tanks. The motorists {{do not know whether}} they are buying gasoline off the top or bottom of the tank, nor need they care. Additionally, these storage tanks have a maximum capacity and cannot be overfilled. Finally, the product is expensive. Inventory proportionality is used to balance the inventories of the different grades of <b>motor</b> <b>fuel,</b> each stored in dedicated tanks, in proportion to the sales of each grade. Excess inventory is not seen or valued by the consumer, so it is simply cash sunk (literally) into the ground. Inventory proportionality minimizes the amount of excess inventory carried in underground storage tanks. This application for <b>motor</b> <b>fuel</b> was first developed and implemented by Petrolsoft Corporation in 1990 for Chevron Products Company. Most major oil companies use such systems today.|$|R
