Dietrich argues that other researchers have been misled by the literal resemblances of the glyphs, not realizing that they are abstract symbols for the stars (cf. western astronomical symbols).

5|$|During {{the first}} three decades of the 20th century, ethnic Chinese owned <b>most,</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> movie theaters in cities {{throughout}} the Dutch East Indies. Films from China were being imported by the 1920s, and a film industry began to emerge in 1928 {{with the arrival of}} the three Wong brothers from Shanghai—their films would dominate the market through the 1930s. These earliest films almost exclusively focused on the ethnic Chinese community, although a few examined inter-ethnic relations as a main theme. The later ban on the public use of Chinese language meant that imported films and television programs were required to be dubbed in English with subtitles in Indonesian. When martial arts serials began appearing on national television in 1988, they were dubbed in Indonesian. One exception was the showing of films from Hong Kong in Chinese—limited to ethnic Chinese districts and their surroundings—because of an agreement between importers and the film censor board.|$|E

5|$|Mycenaean {{palatial}} states, or centrally organized palace-operating polities, {{are recorded}} in ancient Greek literature and mythology (e.g., Iliad, Catalogue of Ships) and confirmed by discoveries made by modern archaeologists such as Heinrich Schliemann. Each Mycenaean kingdom was governed from the palace, which exercised control over <b>most,</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> industries within its realm. The palatial territory {{was divided into}} several sub-regions, each headed by its provincial center. Each province was further divided in smaller districts, the da-mo. A number of palaces and fortifications appear {{to be part of}} a wider kingdom. For instance, Gla, located in the region of Boeotia, belonged to the state of nearby Orchomenos. Moreover, the palace of Mycenae appeared to have ruled over a territory two to three times the size of the other palatial states in Bronze Age Greece. Its territory would have also included adjacent centers, including Tiryns and Nauplion, which could plausibly be ruled by a member of Mycenae's ruling dynasty.|$|E

5|$|The first mammals (in Kemp's sense) {{appeared}} in the Late Triassic epoch (about 225 million years ago), 40 million {{years after the first}} therapsids. They expanded out of their nocturnal insectivore niche from the mid-Jurassic onwards; The Jurassic Castorocauda, for example, was a near-relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish. <b>Most,</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> are thought to have remained nocturnal (the Nocturnal bottleneck), accounting for much of the typical mammalian traits. The majority of the mammal species that existed in the Mesozoic Era were multituberculates, eutriconodonts and spalacotheriids. The earliest known metatherian is Sinodelphys, found in 125 million-year-old Early Cretaceous shale in China's northeastern Liaoning Province. The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues.|$|E
5|$|When the Song dynasty was founded, the {{political}} elites consisted of officials (and their sons) {{who had served}} in the Five Dynasties era, {{as well as those who}} came from prominent families which boasted an aristocratic ancestry and had provided officials for generations. Since the first Song emperors wished to avoid domination of government by military strongmen such as the jiedushi of the previous era, they limited the power of military officers and focused on building a powerful civilian establishment. During the 11th century, the expansion of schools and local academies nurtured a nationwide gentry class which provided <b>most</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> officials. By the late 11th century, the elite marriage strategies of prominent families eroded due to the intense partisan politics surrounding the New Policies (新法; xin fa) of Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086). These great families were replaced by officials representing diverse local gentry lineages throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Since the Second World War, most {{but not all}} Commonwealth {{countries}} have created their own honours systems and no longer participate in the British honours system.

The VC {{was replaced by the}} Param Vir Chakra (PVC) and Nishan-e-Haider (NH) respectively. <b>Most</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> new honours systems continued to permit recipients of British honours to wear their awards according to the rules of each nation's order of wear. Sri Lanka, whose defence personnel were eligible to receive the Victoria Cross until 1972, introduced its own equivalent, the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya medal. Three Commonwealth realms—Australia, Canada and New Zealand—have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the Victoria Cross with their own. The only Commonwealth countries that still can recommend the VC are the small nations, none of whose forces have ever been awarded the VC, that still participate in the British honours system.|$|E
