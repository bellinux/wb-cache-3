The sample comprised 21 subjects (11 index patients and 10 notified partners). RESULTS The index patients reported complicity, concern about the partner's health and revelation of diagnosis aiming to preserve the relationship. The partners showed antagonistic perceptions: tranquility-betrayal, fear of death, of incurability and the diagnosis, especially of HIV. The reasons for coming to a healthcare center were: fear of being sick, attenuation of guilt of infection transmission, need for diagnosis, early start of treatment. CONCLUSION Fear of losing trust, insecurities when dealing with a sexual infection and being responsible or co-responsible for the transmission were the predominant feelings. Various types <b>of</b> partner <b>notification</b> were reported (verbal, telephone, notification card), according to individual convenience.

40|$|Background: Among men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM), the {{association}} between searching for sexual partners’ on the Internet and increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) /HIV infection, together with current low levels of partner notification (PN), justifies a study to explore the intention to use new communication technologies for PN in Spain. Methods: Two cross-sectional surveys were performed: the first was administered online to visitors to web pages where the survey was advertised; the second was administered on paper to patients attending an STI Unit and centres similar to Community-Based Voluntary Counselling and Testing centres. Results: The study population comprised 1578 Spanish residents (median age, 34 years [range: 18 to 74]); 84 % lived in urban areas, and 69 % reported searching for sexual partners on the Internet. Thirty-seven per cent would be willing to use a website for PN, 26 % did not know if they would use one, and 37 % would not want to use one. The main reasons for not intending to notify STI/HIV were “shame or fear” (stable partner) and “not knowing how to contact them” (casual partner). The preferred <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> was face to face (73 %) for both stable and casual partners, although using new technologies (Short Messaging System, e-mail, web page, phone applications) was widely accepted for notifying casual partners. Conclusions: Fighting stigma and promoting alternative methods of PN among MSM and health professionals through new technologies could increase the frequency of PN. This approach will improve early detection and reduce transmission in Spain...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Screening {{mammography}} {{for women}} 50 to 69 {{years of age}} may lead to 50 % having an abnormal study. We set out to determine the proportion of women who understand their abnormal mammogram results and the factors that predict understanding. METHODS: We surveyed 970 women age 40 to 80 years identified with abnormal mammograms from 4 clinical sites. We collected information on demographic factors, language of interview, consultation with a primary care physician, receipt of follow-up tests, and <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> of index mammogram result. This study examines the following outcomes: the participant’s report of understanding of her physician’s explanation of results of the index mammogram, and {{a comparison of the}} radiology report to the participant’s report of her index mammogram result. Multivariate models controlled for age, education, income, insurance status, and clinical site. RESULTS: The majority (70 %) reported a ‘‘full understanding’’ of their physician’s explanation of their abnormal mammogram, but a significant minority (30 %) reported less than a full understanding (somewhat, not at all, did not explain). Among women of Asian ethnicity, only 63 % reported full understanding. Asian ethnicity was a negative predictor (odds ratio [OR], 0. 4; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 3 to 0. 7), and consultation with a primary care physician was a positive predictor (OR, 2. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 7 to 3. 3) of reported full understanding. Of the 304 women with a suspicious abnormality, only 51 % understood their result to be abnormal. Women notified in person or by telephone were more likely than women notified in writing to understand their result to be abnormal (OR, 2. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 4. 8). CONCLUSION: Almost half of women with the most suspicious mammograms did not understand that their result was abnormal.

40|$|This study {{provides}} current data on key questions about retraction of scientific articles. Findings {{confirm that the}} rate of retractions remains low but is increasing. The most commonly cited reason for retraction was research error or inability to reproduce results; the rate from research misconduct is an underestimate, since some retractions necessitated by research misconduct were reported as being due to inability to reproduce. Retraction by parties other than authors is increasing, especially for research misconduct. Although retractions are on average occur-ring sooner after publication than in the past, citation analysis shows that they are not being recognised by subsequent users of the work. Findings suggest that editors and institutional officials are taking more responsibility for correcting the scientific record but that reasons published in the retraction notice are not always reliable. More aggressive means <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> to the scientific community appear to be necessary. Previous studies of retraction of scientific articles have shown that the dominant reason for retrac-tion is research error or inability to reproduce results (generally referred to as ‘‘inability to reproduce’’). 1 2 Citation continues long after retrac-tion, raising questions about the adequacy <b>of</b> current <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>notification.</b> 3 Here we update these findings.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> validating the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> active {{tuberculosis}} by physicians in the Netherlands. METHOD: The chemotherapeutic agent pyrazinamide {{was used as}} a marker for the occurrence of tuberculosis. On the basis of defined daily doses (DDD) of pyrazinamide dispensed to out-patients, an estimate was made of the number of patients with tuberculosis in the Netherlands in the period 1994 - 1998. DDD is a technical unit of measurement and does not necessarily reflect the recommended or actual dose used. Usually {{it is based on the}} average dosage per day for the main indication in adults with normal organ function. The Dutch Drug Information Project (GIP) of the Health Care Insurance Board (CVZ) provided the DDD data. Based on the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> tuberculosis patients to the Netherlands Tuberculosis Register (NTR) we calculated how much pyrazinamide (measured in DDDs) these patients would have used depending on their body weight. RESULTS: The number of DDDs prescribed according to the GIP pharmacy records differed by only 8 % from the number of DDDs calculated on the basis <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> to the NTR; 6889 patients should have been registered instead of 6349. CONCLUSION: The close correlation between the use of pyrazinamide as measured by the GIP and NTR provides strong evidence that in the Netherlands tuberculosis is reported in conformity with the guidelines for notifiable diseases.

40|$|Abstract — The medical {{industry}} is transitioning to Internetbased communication as {{the field of}} telemedicine broadens to include medical event monitoring systems. A medical event monitor generates different types of messages and alerts for healthcare providers, institutions and patients. We describe how the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), a signaling protocol for Internet conferencing, telephony, presence, event notification and instant messaging, {{can be used to}} create a medical event monitoring system. SIP can work on a variety of devices; its adoption as the protocol of choice for third generation wireless networks allows for a robust and scalable environment that can easily extend across institutions. First, we describe the basics of SIP and how it can be used for event notifications. Secondly, we describe the use of Medical Logic Modules (MLMs) in a clinical event monitoring system and we propose a SIP medical event monitoring system that can combine the use of MLMs, such as the Arden Syntax, with SIP event notification. We also propose an alternate <b>method</b> <b>of</b> event <b>notification</b> with the use of XML filters to deliver only relevant notifications. Finally, we discuss the different types of devices and wireless protocols that can be incorporated within the system, creating an integrated architecture. I...|$|R

40|$|Background: According to the {{surveillance}} system in Turkey, most diseases are notified only by clinicians, without involving laboratory notification. It {{is assumed that}} a considerable inadequacy in notifications exists; however, {{this has not been}} quantified by any researcher. Our aim was to evaluate the completeness of communicable disease surveillance in the province of Izmir, Turkey for the year of 2003 by means of estimating the incidences of diseases. Methods: Data on positive laboratory results for the notifiable and serologically detectable diseases hepatitis A, B, C, brucellosis, syphilis, measles and HIV detected in 2003 in Izmir (population 3. 5 million) were collected from serology laboratories according to WHO surveillance standards and compared to the notifications received by the Provincial Health Directorate. Data were checked for duplicates and matched. Incidences were estimated with the capture-recapture <b>method.</b> Sensitivities <b>of</b> both <b>notifications</b> and laboratory data were calculated according to these estimates. Results: Among laboratories performing serologic tests (n = 158) in Izmir, 84. 2 % accepted to participate, from which 23, 515 positive results were collected. Following the elimination of duplicate results as well as of cases residing outside of Izmir, the total number was 11, 402.
