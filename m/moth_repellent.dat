His continued research on that parasite, the Chalcid wasp, took him to Russia the following year.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the concentrations, emission rates, and source characteristics of a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 30 newly-constructed apartment buildings by measuring indoor and outdoor VOC concentrations over a 2 -year period. For comparison, seven villa-type houses were also surveyed for indoor and outdoor VOC concentrations over a 3 -month period. Indoor and outdoor air samples were collected on Tenax-TA adsorbent and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC) /mass spectrometer system or a GC/flame ionization detector system coupled to a thermal desorption system. The long-term change in indoor VOC concentrations depended on the type of VOCs. Generally, aromatic (except for naphthalene), aliphatic, and terpene compounds exhibited a gradual deceasing trend over the 2 -year follow-up period. However, the indoor concentrations of the six halogenated VOCs did not significantly vary with time changes. Similar to these halogenated VOCs, the indoor naphthalene concentrations did not vary significantly with time changes over the 2 -year period. Unlike the halogenated VOCs, the indoor naphthalene concentrations were much higher than the outdoor concentrations. The indoor concentrations of aliphatic and aromatic compounds were higher for the villa-type houses when compared to those of apartment buildings. In addition, four source groups (floor coverings and interior painting, house-hold products, wood paneling and furniture, <b>moth</b> <b>repellents)</b> and three source groups (floor coverings and interior painting, household products, and <b>moth</b> <b>repellents)</b> were considered as potential VOC sources inside apartment buildings for the first- and second-year post-occupancy stages, respectively...|$|R
5|$|Numerous insects utilize {{defensive}} regurgitation. The eastern {{tent caterpillar}} regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants.

40|$|The {{scent of}} toxic moth poisons {{containing}} the fumigants naphthalene or p-dichlorobenzene {{is a familiar}} spring�me smell in closets, chests, and clothes storage areas. The two major ingredients in mothballs, used individually or in combina�on, are extremely dangerous petroleum-based chemicals that can cause a range of short and long-term health effects, including cancer, blood, kidney, and liver effects. 1 - 4 In 1991, the state of California canceled all pes�cide uses of naphthalene due to known health effects and inadequacies in exis�ng data. However, it is registered with the U. S. Environmental Protec�on Agency (EPA) and is in use in other states. 5, 6 With striking hazards linked to these fumigants, the use of management prac�ces, insect traps, and other repellents takes on an important urgency. Health Concerns <b>Moth</b> <b>repellents</b> are pes�cides used to kill the larvae of clothes moths and/or carpet beetles. These insects lay their eggs on fabric and other tex�les, and when hatched, their larvae feed on organic ma�er trapped within the fibers, chewing away to leave gapping holes in favorite sweaters or clothing. The moth larvae feed on wool, feathers, fur, hair, leather, lint, dust, paper, and occasionally co�on, linen, silk, and synthe�c fibers. 7 Mothballs, usually placed in closed or sealed closets and containers, sublime –meaning they transform from a solid directly into a gas, and the vapors build up and kill moths and their larvae. However, direct and indirect exposures to these vapors are harmful. Mothballs are made with either, or a combina�on of, naphthalene and p-dichlorobenzene as the ac�ve ingredient. Note: p-dichlorobenzene has been replacing naphthalene in the formula�on of <b>moth</b> <b>repellents,</b> and is also used as the primary ingredient in many restroom deodorizers...|$|R

5000|$|As a {{child in}} Oakland, California, Ferguson had a {{backyard}} laboratory in which he developed a <b>moth</b> <b>repellent,</b> a silverware cleanser, and a lemonade powder. He graduated from Oakland Technical High School [...] in 1934 {{at the age of}} 16. After working in construction and as a railway porter in order to earn enough money to pay for college, he did his undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley and received a Ph.D. from the same university in 1943, the first African American to earn a chemistry Ph.D. there. After receiving his Ph.D., he took a faculty position at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, then approximately two years later moved to Howard University, where he became the chair of his department and founded a doctoral program there, the first in chemistry at any black college. While affiliated with Howard University, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1953 and an NSF grant in 1960 that allowed him to travel to the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark, and to ETH Zurich in Switzerland. He moved to the California State University, Los Angeles in 1965. He again became chair, and played an advisory role to the Food and Drug Administration. He retired in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|In his new position, Kincaid began {{scouting}} the Puget Sound {{region for}} a suitable site {{at which the}} university could establish a marine research field station.

After running a laboratory at temporary sites near Friday Harbor for several years, Kincaid personally petitioned for the transfer to the university of the 484-acre Point Caution site (an area of San Juan Island that had been set aside as a military reserve {{to be used in the}} event of war with the United Kingdom). In 1921 the U.S. government finally ceded Point Caution to the university.Kincaid was dispatched to Japan in 1908 by the United States Department of Agriculture to identify and collect a natural parasite for the gypsy moth, which, at the time, was creating havoc in Massachusetts.

40|$|Abstract – Bee {{products}} can be contaminated from different sources. The contamination can arise from beekeeping practices {{or from the}} environment. Environmental contaminants are covered {{in the first part}} of the review. They are: the heavy metals lead, cadmium and mercury, radioactive isotopes, organic pollutants, pesticides (insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and bactericides), pathogenic bacteria and genetically modified organisms. The second part of the review discusses contaminants from beekeeping. The main ones are acaricides: lipophylic synthetic compounds and non-toxic substances such as organic acids and components of essential oils; and antibiotics used for the control of bee brood diseases, mainly tetracyclines, streptomycine, sulfonamides and chloramphenicol. Other substances used in beekeeping play a minor role: para-dichlorobenzene, used for the control of wax <b>moth</b> and chemical <b>repellents.</b> The degree of contamination of honey, pollen, beeswax, propolis and royal jelly by the different contaminants is reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Africa faces serious {{challenges}} in feeding its population, mainly due to poor yields of cereals {{that serve as}} both staple and cash crops occasioned by insect pests, weeds, and poor soil fertility, and more recently effects of climate change. A novel IPM approach dubbed “push–pull” has been developed and implemented in eastern Africa, based on locally available companion plants, that effectively addresses these constraints resulting in substantial grain yield increases. The technology involves intercropping cereal crops with stemborer <b>moth</b> <b>repellent</b> crops (push), the forage legume desmodium or molasses grass, and planting the attractive Napier grass (pull) as a border crop. Desmodium is very effective in suppressing striga weed while improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation and improved organic matter content. The companion plants provide high-value animal fodder, facilitating milk production and diversifying farmers’ income sources. The technology, currently practiced by over 55, 000 farmers in East Africa, has been adapted to dry conditions associated with climate change by identifying and incorporating drought-tolerant companion plants. The development of this technology, its benefits and subsequent efforts to expand its geographical suitability and effectiveness are described...|$|E
