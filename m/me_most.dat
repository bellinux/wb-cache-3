5|$|Two events {{affected}} <b>me</b> <b>most,</b> {{one when}} a colleague dropped himself from second floor to escape under-covered police who stormed school. The second incident was when a dear teacher was arrested. That is when my voice started {{to rise and}} become annoying. I was caught vandalizing a school wall by writing apolitical human rights statements on school walls and was given the choice to either be submitted to police or to switch school. So I took {{the easy way out}} and since I was the top student back then, I choose to switch to Sheikh Abdul Aziz school.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sources have}} {{reported}} 610 officers as {{being involved in}} or ordering the torture of Falun Gong adherents in custody. In a letter to Chinese leaders in 2005, prominent human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng relayed accounts of 610 officers beating and sexually assaulting Falun Gong practitioners: “of all the true accounts of incredible violence that I have heard, of all {{the records of the}} government’s inhuman torture of its own people, what has shaken <b>me</b> <b>most</b> is the routine practice {{on the part of the}} 6–10 Office and the police of assaulting women’s genitals,” wrote Gao. Defector Hao Fengjun described witnessing one of his 610 Office colleagues beating an elderly female Falun Gong practitioner with an iron bar. The event helped catalyze Hao's decision to defect to Australia. The 2009 report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings relayed allegations that the 610 Office was involved in the torture deaths of Falun Gong practitioners ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.|$|E

500|$|Amanda Sebestyen {{wrote in}} The Women's Review of Books {{that at first}} glance the ideas in The Good Terrorist appear deceptively simple, and the plot predictable. But she added that Lessing's {{strength}} is her [...] "stoic narrat of the daily effort of living", which excels in describing day-to-day life in a squat. Sebestyen also praised the book's depiction of Alice, who [...] "speak to <b>me</b> <b>most</b> disquietingly about myself and my generation". In a review in off our backs, an American feminist publication, Vickie Leonard called The Good Terrorist a [...] "fascinating book" [...] that is [...] "extremely well written" [...] with characters that are [...] "exciting" [...] and [...] "realistic". Leonard added that even though Alice is not a feminist, the book illustrates the author's [...] "strong admiration for women and their accomplishments".|$|E
500|$|Writing in Variety, {{the sister}} of Parker's alleged victim {{discussed}} the immense pain that Parker's The Birth of a Nation brought to her and her family, [...] "As her sister, the thing that pains <b>me</b> <b>most</b> of all is that in retelling {{the story of the}} Nat Turner slave revolt, they invented a rape scene. The rape of Turner’s wife is used as a reason to justify Turner’s rebellion. [...] This is fiction. I find it creepy and perverse that Parker and Celestin would put a fictional rape at the center of their film, and that Parker would portray himself as a hero avenging that rape. [...] Given what happened to my sister, and how no one was held accountable for it, I find this invention self-serving and sinister, and I take it as a cruel insult to my sister’s memory." ...|$|E

500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck <b>me</b> <b>most</b> was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care about these people in order to be worried about what might happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E
500|$|On 16 November 1797, {{her husband}} succeeded {{to the throne}} of Prussia as King Frederick William III {{after the death of}} his father. Louise wrote to her grandmother, [...] "I am now queen, and what rejoices <b>me</b> <b>most</b> is the hope that now I need no longer count my benefactions so carefully." [...] The couple had to abandon their {{solitude}} at Paretz and begin living under the restraints of a royal court. They began a tour of the country's eastern provinces for two purposes: the king wanted to acquaint himself with their new subjects, and despite the unusualness of a consort accompanying the king further than the capital, Frederick William wanted to introduce the queen as well to their people. Louise was received everywhere with festivities. For the first time in Prussian history, the queen emerged as a celebrated public personality in her own right, as she occupied a much more prominent role than her predecessors. Louise's presence on her husband's eastern journey was a break from the traditional role of the consort– importantly however the queen's power and enduring legacy did not stem from holding a separate court and policy than her husband's, but rather the opposite: she subordinated her formidable intelligence and skill for her husband's sole advantage. She also became a fashion icon, for instance starting a trend by wearing a neckerchief to keep from getting ill.|$|E
500|$|After the 1994 draft, NBA analyst Doug Collins {{described}} Howard as {{a player}} who could [...] "play {{with his back to}} the basket" [...] and [...] "shoot from about 16 feet outside" [...] and who played [...] "with a lot of energy and emotion". The Bullets' general manager, John Nash, who was disappointed that Jason Kidd was no longer available at the fifth pick of the draft, told Jerry Bembry of The Baltimore Sun that Howard was [...] "as fundamentally sound as any player in the draft" [...] and that he [...] " [...] a discipline about his game and [...] a high level of skill and technique". Bembry said, [...] "Not only can Howard post up, he passes effectively and is able to hit a jumper up to 17 feet", adding that he also was [...] "an excellent position defender". [...] Later Bembry noted that he was a power forward who was able to play center, adding that at Michigan he was [...] "most effective playing {{with his back to the}} basket" [...] but could also pass effectively and hit medium-range jumpers. The Bullets' head coach, Jim Lynam, described Howard as a [...] "complete player" [...] and noted, [...] "e can defend you and he can score over you". Nash said that [...] "the things that impressed <b>me</b> <b>most</b> about him were his character, his intelligence and his insight. He's a leader type." ...|$|E

500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... I decided not to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited <b>me</b> <b>most</b> is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that I feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to the studio in Spain in late January, Björk decided that producer Nellee Hooper, who had produced both Debut and Post, would not return, as Björk stated that they had [...] "both stopped surprising each other". Björk had intended to produce the album alone, but she abandoned the idea and [...] sought out a group of close collaborators including Dravs, Howie B, Guy Sigsworth and LFO's Mark Bell. Howie B had worked with Björk previously on Debut and Post and Sigsworth had played harpsichord on Post. The American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan almost contributed {{to the production of}} Homogenic, but were unable due to their production on the album Wu-Tang Forever, which had taken longer than planned. Most of the melodies on the album were created by Björk, who then composed string sections on a Casio keyboard and brought them to programmers who would add suitable rhythmic patterns. Björk desired to have Mark Bell contribute to her albums Debut and Post, only finding him available for Homogenic. Mark Bell was credited {{for the majority of the}} album's production, including the songs [...] "Pluto", [...] "Alarm Call", and the bass line in [...] "Jóga". Björk stated about her collaboration with Bell that she [...] "trusts and respects what [...] does for me. If I were to say who has influenced <b>me</b> <b>most</b> it would be Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and Mark Bell". Other unorthodox methods of recording were used during the production, including Björk wanting to record outside on the porch and using non-professionals to help with production, such as Rebecca Storey, who was hired as a babysitter but added to the production staff after showing interest in the equipment.|$|E
500|$|By the 1980s, critics {{emphasised}} {{the power}} of the poem's message and technique, and it was seen as an important English poem. After analyzing the language of the poem, W. Hutchings declared in 1984, [...] "The epitaph, then, is still making us think, still disturbing us, even as it uses the language of conventional Christianity and conventional epitaphs. Gray does not want to round his poem off neatly, because death is an experience of which we cannot be certain, but also because the logic of his syntax demands continuity rather than completion." [...] Also in 1984, Anne Williams claimed, [...] "ever since publication it has been both popular and universally admired. Few readers then or now would dispute Dr. Johnson's appraisal... In the twentieth century we have remained eager to praise, yet praise has proved difficult; although tradition and general human experience affirm that the poem is a masterpiece, and although one could hardly wish a single word changed, it seems surprisingly resistant to analysis. It is lucid, and at first appears as seamless and smooth as monumental alabaster." [...] Harold Bloom, in 1987, claimed, [...] "What moves <b>me</b> <b>most</b> about the superb Elegy is the quality that, following Milton, it shares with so many of the major elegies down to Walt Whitman's... Call this quality the pathos of a poetic death-in-life, the fear that one either has lost one's gift before life has ebbed, or that one may lose life before the poetic gift has expressed itself fully. This strong pathos of Gray's Elegy achieves a central position as the antithetical tradition that truly mourns primarily a loss of the self." [...] In 1988, Morris Golden, after describing Gray as a [...] "poet's poet" [...] and places him [...] "within the pantheon of those poets with whom familiarity is inescapable for anyone educated in the English language" [...] declared that in [...] "the 'Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard,' mankind has felt itself to be directly addressed by a very sympathetic, human voice." [...] He later pointed out: [...] "Gray's 'Elegy' was universally admired in his lifetime and has remained continuously the most popular of mid-eighteenth-century English poems; it is, as Gosse has called it, the standard English poem. The reason for this extraordinary unanimity of praise are as varied as the ways in which poetry can appeal. The 'Elegy' is a beautiful technical accomplishment, as can be seen even in such details as the variation of the vowel sounds or the poet's rare discretion in the choice of adjectives and adverbs. Its phrasing is both elegant and memorable, as is evident from the incorporation of much of it into the living language." ...|$|E
