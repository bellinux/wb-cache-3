50|$|SIP and H.323 are {{signaling}} protocols, while <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> control protocols are {{device control}} protocols. The architectural difference between SIP and H.323, and the <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> control protocols {{is that the}} relationships between entities in SIP and H.323 are peer-to-peer, while the relationships between entities in <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> control protocols use the master/slave (technology) model. SIP and H.323 handle call setup, connection, management, and tear-down of calls between like interfaces, whereas <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> control protocols define the mechanisms of setup of media paths and streams between IP and other networks.|$|E

5000|$|In July 1998, Telcordia (Bellcore) and Cisco Systems {{created a}} {{protocol}} called Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP) for controlling Telephony Gateways from external call control elements.Meanwhile, in mid-1998, Level 3 created a Technical Advisory Council (TAC), {{composed of a}} dozen leading communications equipment manufacturers. The TAC proposed a device protocol called Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC) in August 1998. [...] IPDC {{was intended to be}} used between a <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> and a <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> controller. <b>Media</b> <b>gateway</b> were capable of acting as a voice over IP gateway, voice over ATM gateway, dialup modem <b>media</b> <b>gateway,</b> circuit switch, or cross- connect.

5000|$|H.248/Megaco {{exploded}} gatekeeper {{model of}} H.323 and put signaling control in a <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) thereby unbundling call intelligence from media. H.248 {{is meant to}} address {{the relationship between the}} Media Gateways (MGs), which converts circuit-switched voice to packet-based traffic, and the <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC). [...] <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) using H.248 instructs one or more Media Gateways (MG)s to connect streams coming from outside a packet or cell data network onto a packet or cell stream such as the Real-Time Transport Protocol.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the types}} of devices {{targeted}} for control by H.248/Megaco and the low level of its control structure, H.248 is generally viewed as complementary to H.323 and SIP. While a <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) will use H.248/Megaco to manage media establishment and control with a number of Media Gateways (MG), other VoIP protocol such as SIP and H.323 are used for one <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) to communicate with another <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC). From a SIP perspective, the combination of MGC and MGs are treated together as a SIP Gateway.|$|E

50|$|MGCP is a master/slave {{protocol}} {{that allows}} a call control device such as a Call Agent {{to take control of}} a specific port on a <b>media</b> <b>gateway.</b> In MGCP context <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> controller is referred to as call agent. This has the advantage of centralized gateway administration and provides for largely scalable IP Telephony solutions. The distributed system is composed of a call agent, at least one <b>media</b> <b>gateway</b> (MG) that performs the conversion of media signals between circuits and packets switched networks, and at least one signaling gateway (SG) when connected to the PSTN.|$|E
50|$|The {{device that}} handles the call control {{function}} {{is referred to}} as an intelligent <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controller (MGC) and the device that handles the media {{is referred to as}} a relatively unintelligent <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> (MG). H.248 defines the protocol for <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controllers to control Media Gateways for the support of multimedia streams across IP networks and the Public Switched Telephone network (PSTN). It is typically used for providing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services like voice and fax between IP networks and the PSTN), or entirely within IP networks.|$|E
50|$|H.248/Megaco due to {{its master}} - slave nature does not {{describe}} the establishment of calls across domains or across <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controllers. H.248/Megaco is used for communication downward, to the media gateways and does not constitute a complete system. The architecture requires a Peer-to-Peer for communication between <b>Media</b> <b>Gateway</b> Controllers.|$|E
40|$|The {{convergence}} of telecommunications {{systems and the}} Internet causes a variety of concepts for service integration. The focus of the recent research studies {{and the work of}} several standardization bodies lies mostly on the interworking of services and the universal service access from end-user systems including both fixed and wireless terminals. All approaches are driven by the concept of providing several technologies to users by keeping the peculiarity of each service alive. But, developments should not only concentrate on media adaptation between VoIP and PSTN, but also consider the adaptation among completely different types of applications as for example E- mail, facsimile, or voice. Unified messaging, which is an already accepted service on the market, provides solutions for conversions of different application protocols into each other. The functionality of converting one medium into another is implemented here in so-called <b>media</b> <b>gateways.</b> This paper provides an overview of the current developments in the area of <b>media</b> <b>gateways.</b> Next, it introduces the basic architecture of an existing CORBA-based unified messaging system and the implementation of <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> for the adaptation of different services. Finally, both approaches are combined to unified messaging-enabled <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> that improve the user's reachability because of their capability to adapt services to different kinds of end devices...|$|R
40|$|Multicasting {{multimedia}} streams {{over the}} Internet is problematic due to net-work and host heterogeneity. One {{of the proposed}} solutions is to place <b>media</b> <b>gateways</b> inside the network to adopt the media streams for different links and hosts. In this dissertation, we investigate several novel extensions to the existing model of <b>media</b> <b>gateways.</b> First, we make the gateways user extensible by allowing in-jection of Tcl code that specifies transformations on the media streams. Second, we improve efficiency in bandwidth consumption by adaptively running the trans-formations at strategic locations on the Internet. We further reduce bandwidth consumption and improve throughput by decomposing a transformation into mul-tiple sub-transformations for execution on different gateways, forming a data flow pipeline. To realize these extensions, we have designed, implemented, and simu-lated several components of the <b>media</b> <b>gateways.</b> We designed and implemented Dali, a low-level software library for building high-performance, predictable, highly extensible and computationally intensiv...|$|R
