500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>I</b> was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Weissenberger was {{promoted}} to Hauptmann on 1 June 1944. On 3 June he arrived in Herzogenaurach to take over command of I. Gruppe (1st Group) of JG5. The former Gruppenkommandeur Major Horst Carganico {{had been killed in}} a flying accident on 27 May 1944. Three days after Weissenberger took command, the Allied invasion of Normandy began. To counter the invasion, elements of I./JG5 were transported to France by train that afternoon. The ground personnel were flown on Junkers Ju 52s to their airfield at Montdidier, [...] south of Amiens. The following day, Weissenberger took I. Gruppe into combat, achieving [...] "ace-in-a-day" [...] status once again on his first day of combat on the Western Front. His 176th victory was over a Republic P-47 Thunderbolt shot down at 09:05. He claimed two further P-47s shot down 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> <b>I.</b> Gruppe was scrambled again in the afternoon which resulted in aerial combat with roughly 12 P-47s near Beauvais. During the course of this encounter, which ended at 17:39, Weissenberger claimed two P-47s shot down.|$|E
2500|$|The chain {{also has}} fans {{in a number}} of renowned chefs {{including}} Gordon Ramsay, Thomas Keller, Julia Child, Anthony Bourdain, and Mario Batali. Famous London chef/restaurateur Ramsay ate In-N-Out for the first time when taping [...] Hell's Kitchen in Los Angeles, and it soon became one of his favorite spots for take-out. Ramsay was quoted, saying about the experience: [...] "In-N-Out burgers were extraordinary. I was so bad, I sat in the restaurant, had my double cheeseburger then <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>I</b> drove back round and got the same thing again to take away." [...] Thomas Keller, a fan of In-N-out, celebrated with In-N-Out burgers at the anniversary party of his restaurant, The French Laundry. Keller also plans on opening his own burger restaurant inspired by his Los Angeles experience of In-N-Out. Julia Child, one of the first celebrities to champion the chain, admitted to knowing every location of the restaurant between Santa Barbara and San Francisco. Child also had the burgers delivered to her during a hospital stay. Anthony Bourdain reportedly said that In-N-Out was his favorite fast food meal; later naming the restaurant as [...] "the best restaurant in Los Angeles." [...] In-N-Out was {{one of the very few}} restaurant chains given a positive mention in the book Fast Food Nation. The book commended the chain for using natural and fresh ingredients and for looking after the interests of employees regarding pay and benefits. An In-N-Out food truck catered Vanity Fairs 2012 Academy Awards after party.|$|E

2500|$|In 1944, Pregulman was {{inducted}} into the United States Navy where he served as a gunnery officer on the USS Taluga in the Pacific Theater of Operations. [...] The Taluga left Norfolk, Virginia in October 1944. On December 10, 1944, the ship reached Ulithi, an atoll in the Caroline Islands of the western Pacific Ocean, which served as her base of operations until the end of World War II. For the next 11 months, Pregulman and the Taluga crew were in and out of Ulithi picking up oil and other supplies there and carrying them to units of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. During that time, they supported carrier strikes and landings on Luzon in the Philippine Islands, landings on Okinawa, strikes on Formosa, and the final sweep of the Japanese home islands in the summer of 1945. Between April and July 1945, Pregulman and the Taluga crew spent much of their time in and around the anchorage at Kerama Retto, just west of the southern end of Okinawa. At dawn on April 16, 1945, ten kamikazes attacked their formation. One of the kamikazes dove at Taluga, strafed her deck, and then made for her superstructure. The attacker careened off the ship's bridge and hit the wheelhouse. However, only 12 men were injured, and the oiler was soon back in action. Pregulman normally {{would have been in the}} wheelhouse, but he went on deck just before the attack. He recalled: [...] "If he had been five <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>I</b> would have been in the wheelhouse and I certainly wouldn't be here." [...] He recalled that the plane sheared off the top of the wheelhouse, and blew a hole in the deck, but no American soldiers were killed.|$|E

60|$|I {{heard this}} {{arrangement}} made, though {{my eyes were}} following Dus, who had started from her seat, and rushed into the house, endeavoring to hide emotions that {{were not to be}} hushed.

60|$|Uncle Dick {{broke off}} {{and stood in}} a brown study, looking at an old stump aflame with nasturtiums for fully three <b>minutes.</b> <b>Later</b> on <b>I</b> was to learn the {{significance}} of that pause and reverie.|$|R
6000|$|... "One day I {{had been}} out on horseback, {{to look for a}} couple of {{bullocks}} which had strayed away; and was on my way back when, ahead of me, I heard the cooey of the blacks. I didn't think much of it, because they were common enough at that time, and a party had made a sort of encampment at a stream, about a mile from the house; but when, a <b>minute</b> <b>later,</b> <b>I</b> heard a gun fired, I guessed that there was mischief.|$|R
60|$|And {{so it was}} done, and a few <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>I</b> was riding, {{strapped}} to the steel-clad Ercole, away from Paola at every stride. Thus at every stride the anguish that possessed me increased, as the fear that they must find her rose ever higher.|$|E
60|$|Never {{mind what}} I said, but I assure you {{if it had}} not been for Dick's arm I should have gone under the table, when, a few <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> <b>I</b> lifted the blue velvet lid and saw a dainty watch luxuriously lying on its white satin bed.|$|E
60|$|We {{drove off}} ten <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> <b>I</b> {{looked out of}} the motor as we swung round into the main thoroughfare. Behind {{the window of the}} little sitting room I saw the pale, almost ghastly face of Lord Porthoning. He caught my eye and waved his hand weakly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{will talk}} it over presently," [...] Francis said. [...] "Here {{we are at the}} steps of the palazzo, and here comes Matteo himself. It is lucky I was not five <b>minutes</b> <b>later,</b> or <b>I</b> should have missed him." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, I {{got to the}} end at last, and at {{the gate}} of the kraal fence was met by one of those fierce and huge men who served the dwarf as guards. Suddenly he emerged from behind a stone, and having scanned me for a moment in silence, beckoned to me to follow him, as though I were expected. A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>I</b> found myself face to face with Zikali, who was seated in the clear {{moonlight}} just outside the shadow of his hut, and engaged, apparently, in his favourite occupation of carving wood with a rough native knife of curious shape.|$|R
60|$|Other rocks fell also at a distance, {{making a}} great noise, and somehow I found {{myself on the}} ground, my stool had slid away from me. Next {{followed}} a muffled, awful roar, and with it came a blast of wind blowing where wind never blew before {{since the beginning of}} the world, that with a terrible wailing howled itself to silence in the thousand recesses of the cave city. As it passed our lamps went out. Lastly, quite a <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>I</b> should think, there was a thud, as though something of enormous weight had fallen on the surface of the earth far above us.|$|R
60|$|He did not answer, but {{bowed his}} head, and I {{turned and left}} him, Captain Leach {{following}} close behind me. He did not enter with me into the great cabin, but waited without, and when I came out a few <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>I</b> {{saw that he was}} gone.|$|E
60|$|At 3 o'clock P.M. {{we closed}} the last leaf of the story.

60|$|I strode past them, {{and left}} them {{whispering}} among themselves. Some <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>I</b> knocked {{at the door of}} the Cardinal's house.

6000|$|Ten <b>minutes</b> <b>later</b> Theodore and <b>I</b> arrived {{opposite}} the house, with the servants straggling after us, and shouted to the distracted {{group on the}} porch, [...] "Everybody safe!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am--very {{familiar}} with your name, Mr. Chiltern," [...] he said, [...] "and it {{is a pleasure}} to be able to serve you, and the lady who is so shortly to be your wife.

6000|$|... "Didn't see nuthing just then. Soon the moanin' died out, an' I thought I {{must have}} made a mistake, an' I went on fishin' ag'in.

A <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> <b>I</b> saw a figure in bright yellow standin' out before me on the lake.
