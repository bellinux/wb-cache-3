5000|$|Later, in 2005, a {{group of}} French pilots began experimenting with {{modified}} parachute and parafoil kite designs. One of these, Francois Bon, a paraglider test pilot, unsatisfied with foot-launched parachute performance helped perfect the first speed wing design, the Gin Nano. This evolved into other commercial wings (between 9 and 14 square metres) designed for speed, portability, and a lower glide ratio. Today speed gliders are produced by over 30 manufacturers worldwide.

50|$|The system, {{also called}} <b>montant</b> et demontant (from French, meaning upwards and downwards), {{is often called}} a pyramid system. It {{is based on a}} {{mathematical}} equilibrium theory devised by a French mathematician of the same name. Like the martingale, this system is mainly applied to the even-money outside bets, and is favored by players who want to keep the amount of their bets and losses to a minimum. The betting progression is very simple: After each loss, you add one unit to the next bet, and after each win, one unit is deducted from the next bet. Starting with an initial bet of, say, 1 unit, a loss would raise the next bet to 2 units. If this is followed by a win, the next bet would be 1 units.|$|E
