5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> sending space probes to Jupiter is {{that the}} planet has no solid surface on which to land, {{as there is a}} smooth {{transition}} between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Like rhenium and palladium, {{technetium}} {{can serve}} as a catalyst. In processes such as the dehydrogenation of isopropyl alcohol, it is a far more effective catalyst than either rhenium or palladium.

Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane-powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000. As part of its shuttle fleet, Zion has two electric trams each holding up to 36 passengers. Usually from early April through late October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sarawak's {{economy was}} {{stagnant}} during {{the rule of}} previous three white Rajahs. After the formation of Malaysia, Sarawak GDP growth rate has risen due to increase in petroleum output and the rise in global petroleum prices. However, the state economy is less diversified and still heavily dependent upon the export of primary commodities when compared to Malaysia overall. The per capita GDP in Sarawak was lower {{than the national average}} from 1970 to 1990. As of 2016, the urban-rural income gap remained a <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy {{presents}} substantial health risks, even {{in developed}} countries, and despite advances in obstetrical science and practice. Maternal mortality remains a <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> global health {{and is considered}} a sentinel event in judging the quality of health care systems. Adolescent pregnancy represents a particular problem, whether intended or unintended, and whether within marriage or a union or not. Pregnancy results in major changes in a girl's life, physically, emotionally, socially and economically and jeopardises her transition into adulthood. Adolescent pregnancy, more often than not, stems from a girl's lack of choices. or abuse. Child marriage (see below) is a major contributor worldwide, since 90% of births to girls aged 15–19 occur within marriage.|$|E

5|$|Thom {{held his}} {{job with the}} Bureau of Chemistry until 1927, when the {{position}} was abolished. He was then appointed Principal Mycologist of the Division of Soil Microbiology for the newly created Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. In a few years, Thom became known as an authority on soil microbiology, and was often invited to present papers at national and international meetings. In one of Thom's important contributions to the field, he led the research group responsible for advances that enabled the control of cotton root rot, {{which at the time}} was a <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> the southwestern United States. In collaboration with his protégé Kenneth Raper, they published the Manual of Penicillin in 1940. Thom formally retired in 1942, although he remained active as a consultant and guest speaker until shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|Wolves kill dogs on occasion, {{with some}} wolf populations relying on dogs as an {{important}} food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behavior when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a <b>major</b> <b>problem</b> <b>in</b> Scandinavia and Wisconsin. The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are harriers, with older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react {{to the presence of}} wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as Swedish elkhounds are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.|$|E

25|$|Cellars in the UK, however, {{were mainly}} {{included}} only in larger houses, and in houses built {{up to the}} period of World War I, after which detached and semi-detached properties were constructed without cellars, usually to avoid the higher building costs entailed.

25|$|Another {{concern is}} the risk of rising sea levels.

Floods may in the future reach the railroad tracks leading out of the city. Among others, Stiftelsen Bryggen, the foundation responsible for preserving the UNESCO site, has suggested that a sea wall, one that could be raised and lowered as demanded by the tides, be built outside the harbour to protect the city.|$|E
