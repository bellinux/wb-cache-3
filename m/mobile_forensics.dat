50|$|Most recently, <b>mobile</b> device <b>forensic</b> tools {{have been}} {{developed}} for the field. This is in response both to military units' demand for fast and accurate anti-terrorism intelligence, and to law enforcement demand for forensic previewing capabilities at a crime scene, search warrant execution, or exigent circumstances.

50|$|Most {{open source}} <b>mobile</b> <b>forensics</b> tools are platform-specific and geared toward {{smartphone}} analysis. Though not {{originally designed to}} be a forensics tool, BitPim has been widely used on CDMA phones as well as LG VX4400/VX6000 and many Sanyo Sprint cell phones.|$|E
50|$|Generally this {{is harder}} to achieve because the device {{original}} equipment manufacturer needs to secure against arbitrary reading of memory; therefore, a device may be locked to a certain operator. To get around this security, <b>mobile</b> <b>forensics</b> tool vendors often develop their own boot loaders, enabling the forensic tool to access the memory (and often, also to bypass user passcodes or pattern locks).|$|E
50|$|Mobile phone {{technology}} is evolving {{at a rapid}} pace. Digital <b>forensics</b> relating to <b>mobile</b> devices {{seems to be at}} a stand still or evolving slowly. For <b>mobile</b> phone <b>forensics</b> to catch up with release cycles of mobile phones, more comprehensive and in depth framework for evaluating <b>mobile</b> <b>forensic</b> toolkits should be developed and data on appropriate tools and techniques for each type of phone should be made available a timely manner.|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{because it}} is {{impossible}} for any one tool to capture all evidence from all <b>mobile</b> devices, <b>mobile</b> <b>forensic</b> professionals recommend that examiners establish entire toolkits consisting of a mix of commercial, open source, broad support, and narrow support forensic tools, together with accessories such as battery chargers, Faraday bags or other signal disruption equipment, and so forth.|$|R

The smart phones not only keep us connected but also can act as a mobile office, social tool, and an entertainment center.

Up to our knowledge, there is no <b>mobile</b> <b>forensic</b> analysis solution that maps data from different sources including calls, geographical location, multimedia, and web logs.

50|$|XRY is {{designed}} to recover {{the contents of a}} device in a forensic manner so that the contents of the data can be relied upon by the user. Typically it is used in civil/criminal investigations, intelligence operations, data compliance and electronic discovery cases. The software is available to law enforcement, military and intelligence agencies. It has become well known in the digital forensics community as one of their common tools for this type of work. There are many more complex challenges when examining mobile phones in comparison to the forensic examination of normal computers. Many mobile phones have their own proprietary operating systems, which makes reverse engineering of such devices a very complex operation. The speed of the mobile device market also means that there are many more new devices being manufactured on a regular basis, so a <b>mobile</b> <b>forensics</b> tool must deal with all of these issues before being suitable for the task.|$|E
40|$|Mobile phones {{have become}} quite {{important}} {{tools in the}} modern world. The forensics field heavily relies on knowledge as an important resource.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of technology, mobile phones {{have become an}} essential tool in terms of crime fighting and criminal investigation. However, many <b>mobile</b> <b>forensics</b> investigators face difficulties with the investigation process in their domain. These difficulties are due to the heavy reliance of the forensics field on knowledge which, although a valuable resource, is scattered and widely dispersed. The wide dispersion of <b>mobile</b> <b>forensics</b> knowledge not only makes investigation difficult for new investigators, resulting in substantial waste of time, but also leads to ambiguity in the concepts and terminologies of the <b>mobile</b> <b>forensics</b> domain.
