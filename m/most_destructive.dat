5|$|Magmatic eruptions have {{produced}} tephra, pyroclastic flows, and lava flows from summit vents and the Schriebers Meadow cinder cone.

5|$|Some of the <b>most</b> <b>destructive</b> hurricanes in U.S. {{history have}} {{impacted}} Texas. A hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in Indianola, {{followed by another}} hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town. These events allowed Galveston to take over as the chief port city. The 1900 Galveston hurricane subsequently devastated that city, killing about 8,000 people or possibly as many as 12,000. This makes it the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, {{multiple}} tropical cyclones {{affected the}} state, of which six made landfall as hurricanes; three made landfall as major hurricanes. Hurricane Alicia is the <b>most</b> <b>destructive</b> hurricane of the decade, severely impacting the Greater Houston area. The {{names of all}} three major hurricanes that impacted Texas during the 1980s were later retired by the World Meteorological Organization. In contrast to the 1980s, during the 1990s only one tropical cyclone, Hurricane Bret, made landfall on the Texas coast. In the next decade five hurricanes would make landfall on Texas. Hurricane Ike, the second costliest hurricane to impact Texas, made landfall during the decade. Other notable systems include Tropical Storm Allison and Hurricane Rita.|$|E
5|$|Following hatching, larvae {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their <b>most</b> <b>destructive</b> stage. Through maturation, older larvae become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two larvae per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature larvae migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E

The <b>most</b> <b>destructive</b> flood on Nescopeck Creek {{occurred}} in 1850, when a dam on the creek was breached, killing 22 people. From 1858 to 1870 there was a tannery on Nescopeck Creek. In 1828, plans for a canal in Nescopeck Creek were made. In 1885, a number of French Indian artifacts, which were Plaster of Paris casts for making sculptures, were discovered along Nescopeck Creek in Dennison Township.|$|E

Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.|$|E
5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its host range and it rapidly became a <b>most</b> <b>destructive</b> pest of potato crops. They are today {{considered to be}} the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of potato leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E

30|$|Tomato (Lycopersicum esculantum Mill) is an {{important}} solanaceous vegetable crop {{all over the world}} including Pakistan.

Phythium ultimum and Phytopthora capsici are the <b>most</b> common <b>destructive</b> soil-borne pathogens having broad host range and causes severe crop loss to the farmers (Hausbeck and Lamour 2004).|$|R
