25|$|The {{number of}} bird species {{observed}} within the area exceeds 912, {{or more than}} 60% of the country’s total. Two {{of the most interesting}} are arguably the southern helmeted curassow and the <b>military</b> <b>macaw.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{documented}} fauna of {{the region}} includes 39 species of mammals, 377 species of birds and 126 species of reptiles and amphibians. The region is rich with birds, including the king vulture, harpy eagle, great curassow, crested guan, scarlet macaw, green macaw and <b>military</b> <b>macaw.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Ara macaws have a Neotropical {{distribution}} from Mexico to Argentina. The {{centre of}} Ara distribution is the Amazon Basin and the Panama–Colombia border region; each {{with as many}} as four species found together (marginally five where the <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> approach the western Amazon). Seven species are found in Bolivia, but no single locality in that (or any other) country surpasses four species. The most widespread species, the scarlet macaw, is (or was) distributed throughout large parts of Central America and the Amazon. On the other hand, the blue-throated macaw and the red-fronted macaw have tiny distributions in Bolivia. The overall range of many species and the genus as a whole has declined in historical times due to human activities. The <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> is distributed from northern Mexico to northern Argentina, but the distribution is discontinuous, with populations in Mexico, a large gap, then a population in the Venezuelan Coastal Range and a population along the Andes from western Venezuela to northern Argentina. The blue-and-yellow macaw was expiated from Trinidad in the 1960s, as well as retreating from northern Argentina, and several species apparently became extinct in the islands of the Caribbean.|$|E

50|$|Some common {{illnesses}} in pet <b>military</b> <b>macaws</b> include chlamydiosis, diarrhea, feather-plucking, and proventricular dilatation disease. Swelling in the beak or eyes, eye or nasal discharge, loss of appetite, coughing, and lethargic {{activity are}} all {{warning signs of}} an ill pet.|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the resplendent quetzal which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released. Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún {{made a list of}} the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, roseate spoonbill, squirrel cuckoo, red-legged honeycreeper, emerald toucanet, agami heron, russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, great egret, <b>military</b> <b>macaw,</b> scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{almost all}} parrots, the Ara macaws are cavity nesters. The {{majority}} of species nest in cavities in trees, either live or dead. Natural holes in trees may be used, {{particularly those in}} dead trees, otherwise holes created by other species; in Mexico military macaws still use the cavities excavated by the now critically endangered [...] imperial woodpecker. In addition to nesting in trees the <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> and green-winged macaw will also nest in natural fissures in cliffs. This nesting habitat {{is the only one}} used by the red-fronted macaws, as sufficiently large enough trees are absent in its arid range.|$|E

50|$|The three {{subspecies}} will breed {{at different}} times. However this probably {{has more to}} do with the geographical region they are residing in than anything else. Breeding in the militaris occurs from January to March. The mexicana breeds from April to July and the boliviana breeds in November and December. <b>Military</b> <b>macaws</b> are monogamous and remain with their mates for life. As they fly in large flocks the mates fly together. They will also be found flying in pairs in their feeding and roosting/nesting areas. Females will lay one to two eggs which only she will incubate for a period of approximately 26 days. <b>Military</b> <b>macaws</b> will reach sexual maturity in two to four years.|$|R
50|$|<b>Military</b> <b>macaws</b> live {{in large}} flocks and can live about 50-60 {{years in the}} wild. They can often be heard long before they are seen. They are a very noisy bird making a variety of loud {{cracking}} and shrieking sounds, including a loud kraa-aak.|$|R
50|$|The <b>military</b> <b>macaw's</b> diet {{consists}} of seeds, fruits, nuts, berries, and other vegetation found on treetops in their forests. Their beaks are well adapted for eating various seeds and nuts {{as they have}} the ability to break open the hardest of shells with relative ease.|$|R
50|$|Some {{bird species}} present include the keel-billed toucan, elegant trogon, white-throated magpie-jay, blue-winged teal, {{laughing}} falcon, mangrove hummingbird, great curassow, jabiru, roseate spoonbill, great green macaw, and the <b>military</b> <b>macaw.</b> Both the <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> {{and the great}} curassow have a conservation status of vulnerable. The mangrove hummingbird and the great green macaw are considered endangered.|$|E

50|$|<b>Military</b> <b>macaws</b> {{will leave}} their roosts in flocks around dawn {{and head to}} their feeding areas. They will also visit heaps of clay known as “macaw licks”. These clay licks are found along riverbanks or {{sometimes}} {{in the interior of}} the Amazon rainforest. Macaws will flock to there to feed on these clay deposits, which appear to detoxify the poisons found in the seeds and vegetation of the rest of their diet. It is also thought that this clay provides the macaws with dietary salt not available in their normal diet.|$|R
5000|$|Like most <b>macaws,</b> <b>military</b> <b>macaws</b> will be even-tempered {{although}} {{sometimes they}} may be difficult and cranky. With proper training they can become a very tame and friendly pet. They are a very social bird who are playful and inquisitive and enjoy human interaction. Though {{they can be a}} noisy bird, they are very intelligent and have the ability to mimic human speech. They are considered to be a good choice for a show bird. When they get excited their face turns a pinkish reddish color similar in appearance to [...] "blushing".|$|R

50|$|The {{population}} {{and distribution of}} the <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> has been decreasing over the past fifty years. The abundance of the <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> has now decreased to less than 10,000 globally. This decrease is mostly due to deforestation and the capturing of wild birds for the pet trade industry. Military macaws are now listed as vulnerable on the 2013 IUCN Red List Category. They are also listed as CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix I, which protects the birds from being captured for trade.|$|E
50|$|When {{considering}} a <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> as a pet, {{it is very}} important to verify the bird was bred in captivity. The U.S. Wild Bird Act forbids the commercial import of any bird listed by CITES. Though it is not among the most popular parrot species sought as a pet, the <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> is often bred in captivity for trade and can be purchased for $800.00 to $1,000. The most common of the subspecies kept as pets is A. m. mexicana and they can live for more than 60 years in captivity.|$|E

50|$|Most of the Valley {{was closed}} in 2002, {{and it was}} entirely closed by 2005. A {{flamingo}} pond borders the outside edge of the valley, and it remains in use. The old aviary row is now Beaks and Feet Boulevard, with exhibits for Indian peafowl, green iguana, <b>military</b> and green-winged <b>macaws,</b> spectacled owl, Swainson's toucan, black-billed magpie, golden lion tamarin, red-handed tamarin, and bobcat.|$|R
50|$|The <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> inhabits arid {{woodlands}} and subtropical forests. They typically live at elevations of 600 to 2600 m, {{higher in}} the mountains than most macaws ever range. However, these macaws may seasonally fly down to lowlands, where they are likely in humid forests and thorny woodlands. They will nest in the tops of trees and more often in cliff-faces over 600 ft. (200 m) above the ground. The three subspecies of the <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> are distinguished geographically. A. m. militaris are found in areas of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. A. m. mexicana occupy areas in Mexico and A. m. boliviana live in Bolivia and Argentina.|$|E
5000|$|The Great green macaw {{belong to}} the genus Ara, which {{includes}} other large parrots, such as the scarlet macaw, the <b>military</b> <b>macaw,</b> and the blue-and-yellow macaw. The binomial name has recently been changed from Ara ambigua to Ara ambiguus.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} {{representative}} genera of birds are: the peregrine falcon, the swift, harpy eagle, the lonely eagle, the Wetmore cock, the helmeted curassow, the guiro, the sorocuá acorallado, the <b>military</b> <b>macaw</b> and the siskin, {{just to name}} a few.|$|E
5000|$|Vulnerability {{is mainly}} caused by habitat loss or {{destruction}} of the species home. Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened. Some species listed as [...] "vulnerable" [...] may be common in captivity, an example being the <b>military</b> <b>macaw.</b>|$|E
