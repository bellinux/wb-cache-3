40|$|Background: Smartphone use is well {{established}} in society, with increasing acceptance in many professional workplaces. Despite the growth in <b>mobile</b> <b>resources,</b> how students and teachers benefit from these devices remains under-researched. Aims: An exploration of student and educators views {{on the impact of}} mobile learning resources on placement learning experiences as part of the Leeds ‘MBChB Mobile’ pro-gramme. Methods: Focus groups incorporating visual methodologies were undertaken with students from each year group; semi-structured interviews were undertaken with clinical teaching staff, including those who experienced the mobile programme as students themselves. Results: Four key themes emerged. ‘Maturity of learning’, related {{to the way in which}} senior students use resources in a more nuanced way than junior colleagues. ‘Learning differently’, identified ‘personalisation’ and ‘just in time’ opportunities that <b>mobile</b> <b>resources</b> afforded. ‘Learning legitimately’ was identified by students as key to ensuring they adopted appropriate behaviours in relation to mobile learning. Using <b>mobile</b> <b>resources</b> at undergraduate level was found to ‘change learning patterns for life’. Conclusions: There is a need to further develop the educational theory behind using <b>mobile</b> <b>resources</b> for learning.

40|$|Resource {{discovery}} {{is an essential}} function for distributed mobile applications integrated in vehicular communication systems. Key requirements of the mobile resource discovery are wide-area geographic-based discovery and scalable resource discovery not only inside a vehicular ad-hoc network but also through the Internet. While a number of resource discovery solutions have been proposed, {{most of them have}} focused on specific scale of network. Furthermore, managing a large number of <b>mobile</b> <b>resources</b> in the Internet raises a scalability issue due to the mobility of vehicles. In this paper, we design a solution to wide area geographical mobile resource discovery in heterogeneous networks composed of numerous mobile networks possibly connected to the Internet. The proposed system relies on a hierarchical publish-subscribe architecture and geographic routing so that users can locate resources according to geographical coordinates without scalability issue. Furthermore we propose a location management mechanism for <b>mobile</b> <b>resources,</b> which enables to reduce periodic updates of geographical location.

40|$|The {{operations}} of the <b>mobile</b> <b>resources</b> of Durham County Constabulary have been studied with particular reference to their function of responding to calls for service, both emergency and otherwise. Data collected during two three-month survey periods a year apart has been analysed to determine the main quantitative aspects of mobile police performance and to evaluate the demand for and the service provided by these resources. The effects of organisational changes made between the two survey periods have been assessed in terms of these measures of performance. Significant changes in {{some aspects of the}} service provided were recorded. Mathematical models of these measures of police performance have been tested and found to be generally applicable to the Durham Constabulary situation.
