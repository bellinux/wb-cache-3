40|$|In {{the last}} decade, European Court of Human Right {{case-law}} evolution revealed a new {{component of the}} right to private life, protected by the Human Rights Convention, Article 8. Existence and limits {{of the right to}} know one’s biological identity were set out {{in a long line of}} cases, starting with Mikulic c. Croatie (2002) until the very recent Godelli c. Italie (2012). The Court jurisprudence established that birth, and in particular the circumstances in which a child is born, forms part of a child’s, and subsequently the adult’s, private life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respect for private life requires that everyone should be able to establish details of their identity as individual human beings and that an individual’s entitlement to such information is of importance because of its formative implications for his or her personality. This includes obtaining information necessary to discover the truth concerning important aspects of one’s personal identity, such as the identity of one’s parents. Having regard to the margin of appreciation left to the member states, the Court sticks between taking priority over the third parties’ right to privacy – for example, mothers in the cases of X births, donors sperm, unknown fathers – to recognition of the child’ right to know his/her biological roots and identity. Following the bioethics and bio-law progress, case-law evolution had influence member states legislation and disseminated progressive ideas, as the recent official United Kingdom legislative modifications which remove anonymity for sperm, egg and embryo donors. In view of the above, future analysis of private life respect throughout Europe should include this new element, the right of any person to know his/her biological identity, not only for <b>medical</b> <b>aims...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Tibetan {{practice}} of bcud len, or âextracting the essenceâ, {{has been for}} long a neglected aspect of Tibetan medical and spiritual knowledge with scattered evidence and little certainty regarding its origins or the extent of its effective presence, either in the past or at currently. In this study, seventy-three texts have been identified and tabulated. Of these, sixty-seven have been summarised and commented on, and five of these, each representative of one type of the practice, have been translated in full. All {{but a handful of}} these texts have not been translated previously. The research findings suggest that, whatever its influences from Indian, Chinese or other medical cultures, bcud len soon evolved into a distinctively Tibetan method of life enhancement, with teachings that emphasise both spiritual and <b>medical</b> <b>aims</b> and the use of indigenous Tibetan remedies, accompanied in some cases by particular rituals. The content of the texts indicates that the term bcud len can be applied legitimately to practices involving ritually empowered pills and elixirs which are ingested, respiratory and yogic exercises, dietary restrictions and rituals involving mantra recitation, visualisation and yab yum union with a consort, in that all these are considered to be means of obtaining 'the essence'. The teachings offer extensive material for those interested in the evolution and contemporary {{practice of}} Tibetan medicine, especially its botanical aspects, and for historians of ritual. In particular, the texts provide ample evidence of the lineage tradition in Tibetan religious culture, citing examples of transmissions through gter ma, whereby teachings are preserved in secret to be recovered at a future date by a gter ton or treasure revealer. The final section contains conversations with Tibetan doctors, lamas and contemporary practitioners of bcud len in Asia and the West that complement recent ethnographic studies in the field testifying to the continuing vitality of the tradition. </p...|$|E

40|$|The concepts, {{principles}} and methods of complex systems dynamics have {{a profound impact on}} our appreciation of and engagement with Chinese medicine. Firstly, they offer a fra 1 ne,vork for understanding the funda 1 nental approach of Chinese medicine {{that for the first time}} renders it systematically intelligible in the terms of Western science whilst respecting its own salient commitments. In the process they underline the ways in which the orthodox Western medical worldview contrasts with that of Chinese medicine, and thereby the ways that complex systems approaches within Western medicine itself likewise differ from the orthodoxy. Secondly, they provide an articulation of Chinese <b>medical</b> <b>aims</b> and practices which emanate from its conceptions of health and disease permitting engagement with those of Western medicine. Thirdly, they highlight the differences between two distinct approaches in medical treatment and treatment validation: One, stemming from complex dynamics, employs methods focussed on tuning the patient to harmony. The other, deriving from classical science, aims at restoring homeostatic balance. The former emphasises the context dependence - especially patient-dependence - of diagnosis and treatment, whilst the latter seeks to abstract away from details of context, which from its point of view are "confounding variables' by employing traditional logical-causal methods. Fourthly and finally their application to Chinese medicine raises important epistemological questions about the roles of evidence, judgment, specificity and individuality in objective scientific medical research. These final issues are best analysed by illuminating the situated cognition and embodied knowledge of Chinese medicine in light of a complex systems dynamics perspective. This analysis shows that evidence, judgment and practice are more subtly interconnected in both medical traditions than one gets the impression from examining the literature generated by advocates of "evidence-based medicine", In the next section the groundwork for the enquiry are laid by contrasting the ancient cosmologies that underwrite Chinese and Western medical practice and theory...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The <b>medical</b> <b>aim</b> of {{translational}} {{research is to}} smooth the transition of discoveries made through basic research from the laboratory bench to their diagnostic or therapeutic applications for patients. These applications may be extended to current clinical practice and to health policies. AIM: The converse is also important: health policies should provide {{a point of departure}} when identifying research priorities. Translational research poses the same ethical problems as trials with human subjects - albeit in different ways. One of the more significant problems is the risk for participants in trials: it is thus necessary to ensure that the risks to which these subjects are exposed are not out of proportion to the expected benefits. DISCUSSION: Translational research does not require new ethical principles, but existing biomedical principles need to be adjusted to the specific context. The well-being of participants should always be the primary objective; these persons should never be considered as means for the advancement of knowledge or for the improvement of applications...|$|R

40|$|Preterm {{birth is}} a {{significant}} global health problem with serious {{short and long term}} consequences. This paper reviews the research literature to answer the question how effective are the <b>medical</b> interventions that <b>aim</b> to reduce the rates of preterm birth? A systematic search was carried out in CINAHL, Cochrane, Medline and Embase in relation to following <b>medical</b> treatments <b>aimed</b> at preventing preterm births: anti-infective medications, tocolytics, progesterone and cervical cerclage. The research underpinning each type of intervention is critically analysed in order to establish the validity of knowledge claims that are made for each type of intervention. In relation to reducing the rates of preterm births, anti-infectives are only effective in the presence of known infection. Screening for infections during pregnancy is ineffective. Tocolytic agents are not effective in decreasing the preterm birth rates. Progesterone seems to be effective in a select group of pregnant women at higher risk of preterm birth. Cervical cerclage plays a small and an occasional role in preventing some preterm births. This literature review demonstrates that <b>medical</b> interventions <b>aimed</b> at preventing, not just delaying, preterm birth, are not effective at a population level. Providing holistic, antenatal midwifery care for women living in socio-economic disadvantage and/or with an increased risk of preterm birth seems to be a promising strategy to address the negative effects of the social determinants of disease and thus to reduce the rate of preterm births at an individual and a population level...|$|R
