West of {{the city}} of Trinidad {{centered}} on the town of San Ignacio de Moxos is an area in which soils are relatively fertile and hosting a large number <b>of</b> <b>earthworks,</b> including mounds, man-made forested islands, raised fields and causeways.

500|$|Although the rampart and ditch were in {{use for a}} long time, {{during this}} period the east gateway was remodelled twice, making it longer, and {{creating}} earthworks {{on each side of}} the approach. The southwest gateway was given extra defences in the form <b>of</b> <b>earthworks</b> before being abandoned and filled in. Also in this period, the southern part of the fort became populated with four- and six-post structures, probably granaries, replacing the earlier roundhouses. The fort's centre was probably used for shrines while houses were mainly built close to the ramparts. A new series <b>of</b> <b>earthworks</b> was created beyond the already existing ring, turning Danebury into a complex multivallate (more than one series <b>of</b> <b>earthworks)</b> fort. They added [...] to the fort and probably were used to protect livestock.|$|R

50|$|Sumner's {{earliest}} {{contributions to}} archaeology involved surveying the prehistoric <b>earthworks</b> <b>of</b> Cranborne Chase, only a bike-ride {{away from his}} home at Cuckoo Hill in the Avon valley. The results of his fieldwork between 1911 and 1913 were published in a collection entitled The Ancient <b>Earthworks</b> <b>of</b> Cranborne Chase. In 1917 he published a companion volume The Ancient <b>Earthworks</b> <b>of</b> the New Forest. In 1921, in partnership with W G Wallace, Sumner published Ancient <b>Earthworks</b> <b>of</b> the Bournemouth District in {{the proceedings of the}} Bournemouth Natural Science Society. These three studies <b>of</b> ancient <b>earthworks</b> in the Wessex region included hillforts, enclosures and notable barrows.
