25|$|On June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company {{announced}} that it would acquire Belo for $1.5 billion (the purchase price would increase to $2.2 billion by the merger's completion). The deal was granted FCC approval on December 20, and was finalized on December 23. Through the merger with Gannett, WFAA became the company's largest television station by market size (supplanting CBS-affiliated sister station WUSA-TV in Washington, D.C., which has been owned by the company since 1986); it also <b>marked</b> <b>channel</b> 8's first ownership change in 63 years. Additionally in July 2014, WFAA gained new sister stations in nearby markets—including NBC affiliate KCEN-TV in Waco and its Bryan semi-satellite KAGS-LD, CBS affiliate KYTX in Tyler and Fox affiliates KXVA in Abilene and KIDY in San Angelo—through Gannett's purchase of six television stations owned by the Dallas-based London Broadcasting Company, which based its portfolio of broadcasting properties exclusively within Texas (independent station KTXD-TV (channel 47) in nearby Greenville was one of two stations that London exempted from the deal, along with MeTV affiliate KCEB in Tyler, although FCC ownership regulations did not play a factor in the case of KTXD and WFAA as the Dallas–Fort Worth market had enough full-power television stations to allow a fourth duopoly).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{determinants of}} fruit marketing choices by farmers. Based {{on data from}} a stratified random sampling survey of the 338 apple production households in 35 villages in Shandong province, characteristics of farmers' marketing choices are discussed. The determinants of the marketing and choices are estimated econometrically. The results show that although the modern marketing channels such as processing firms, export firms, supermarkets and specialized suppliers have been emerging and grown rapidly, farmers' <b>marking</b> <b>channels</b> are still dominated by small wholesaler and brokers. Major factors affecting farmers' <b>marking</b> <b>channel</b> choices are transport and market infrastructure, regional scale of production, farmers' non-farm employment and the wealth of farmers. Moreover, the small farmers are not excluded from emerging of wholesale markets and modern channels and they {{have benefited from the}} market expansion too.

50|$|The Intracoastal Waterway, in {{the lower}} part of Perdido Bay, is reached from Perdido Pass via a <b>marked</b> <b>channel</b> through Bayou St. John. In May 1982, {{shoaling}} to 6 ft was reported in Bayou St. John, between day-beacons no. 6 and 8. An overhead power cable, with a clearance of 59 ft, crosses the channel leading to Terry Cove and Johnson Cove, about 0.4 mi from the State Route 182 fixed bridge. Several small-craft facilities are in the coves and Cotton Bayou, on the W side of Perdido Pass 0.7 mi above the entrance.|$|E
5000|$|Miantonomah sailed {{early in}} the {{afternoon}} of the 25th. Because of the danger of enemy mines, her skipper — Cdr. Austin E. Rowe — ordered [...] "the highest state of watertight integrity to be set and all personnel not actually on watch below to be on topside and wear lifejackets" [...] — measures which undoubtedly saved many lives. With a French harbor pilot at the conn, she skillfully navigated the inner and outer harbors and cleared the blockships, thence made course for the entrance to the <b>marked</b> <b>channel.</b> As she steamed about 2000 yd out from the blockships, she was rocked at 14:15 by a tremendous underwater explosion under the engine room. This blast — possibly followed by a second one — dazed or injured practically the entire crew. Immediately, the stricken ship began to sink rapidly by the stern and to starboard. Damage control efforts proved useless, and as Coast Guard vessels, British motor launches, and a French fishing craft stood by to rescue survivors, her injured skipper ordered Miantonomah to be abandoned. She sank about 20 minutes after the explosion with a loss of some 58 officers and men at position [...]|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} energy-efficient {{design for}} uplink multiuser SIMO frameworks with <b>marked</b> <b>channel</b> state data (CSD) {{at the base}} station (BS). Since the CSD at the BS is constantly unreliable because of the channel estimation error and delay, the imperfectness of the CSD needs {{to be considered in}} practical framework plan. It causes interuser impedance at the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver and makes it hard to acquire the universally ideal power distribution that expands the energy efficiency (EE). Consequently, we propose a non-helpful energy efficiency uplink power control game, where every client egotistically overhauls its own uplink power. The proposed framework is utilized to examine the execution of expansive scale MU-MIMO framework by changing the quantity of BS receivers, clients and recognize the effect on limit, spectral efficiency, aggregate rate, energy efficiency and so on. The proposed work is planned & analyzed proficiently procedure/system for improvement of energy efficiency, throughput and so on...|$|E
40|$|Fluoxetine {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a variety of clinical disorders including depression and obesity, and of cocaine detoxification or alcoholism. It is generally believed that fluoxetine exerts its clinical effects because it selectively blocks 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT) reuptake into nerve terminals. In here we describe that fluoxetine antagonized the neuronal homomeric alpha(7) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) expressed in Xenopus oocytes, with an IC 50 of 43 mu M, when fluoxetine was coapplied with ACh, and of 1. 6 mu M when the oocytes were pretreated briefly with fluoxetine. A similar block occurred in oocytes expressing L 247 T alpha(7) mutant nAChR. Furthermore, blockage of mutant alpha(7) receptors appeared non-competitive and was stronger with cell membrane hyperpolarization. Cell-attached single channel recordings in oocytes expressing L 247 T alpha(7) mutant nAChR showed that the voltage-dependence of the blockage by fluoxetine could be due to a drastic decrease in channel opening frequency accompanied by <b>marked</b> <b>channel</b> flickering and reduced channel conductance. We conclude that fluoxetine behaves as a reversible blocker of both wild and mutant alpha(7) receptors; and that the Leu- 247 T mutation in the channel domain renders the blockage of alpha(7) nAChR by fluoxetine voltage-dependent. These effects of fluoxetine on alpha(7) receptors may be clinically importan...|$|E
