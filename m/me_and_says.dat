500|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} at the American box office, Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD. David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "every Christmas a new flock of children comes up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Oh! you're the one who's in Labyrinth!" [...] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said [...] "I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places. I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie. It's on TV {{all the time and}} I guess I pretty much look the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shaw {{represented}} {{the new school}} of thought, modernism, which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In Orthodoxy he writes: [...] "The worship of will is the negation of will … If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will {{is that it is}} particular." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, McCain said {{he would}} {{consider}} changing the U.S. military's don't ask, don't tell policy: [...] "The day that {{the leadership of the}} military comes to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Senator, we ought to change the policy,' then I think we ought to consider seriously changing it." [...] In December 2007, McCain said he supported the policy, citing reports from military leaders that [...] "this policy ought to be continued because it's working." [...] In January 2010, when Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen – the top civilian and uniform leadership of the military – came out in favor of repealing the policy, McCain said he was [...] "disappointed" [...] by their stance: [...] "At this moment of immense hardship for our armed services, we should not be seeking to overturn the Don't ask, don't tell policy," [...] which he described as [...] "imperfect but effective." [...] McCain also criticized Gates for what he saw as an attempt to usurp Congressional authority over the policy. In December 2010, McCain voted against repealing the policy.|$|E

2500|$|Meier founded MicroProse with Stealey in 1982, and by 1986 {{the company}} was using his name and face in {{advertisements}} for its games. MicroProse at first developed mostly simulation video games, such as Silent Service and F-19 Stealth Fighter. In 1987, the company released Sid Meier's Pirates!, which also began a trend of placing Meier's name in the titles of his games. He later explained that the inclusion of his name {{was because of the}} dramatic departure in the design of Pirates! compared to the company's earlier titles. Stealey decided that it would improve the company's branding, believing that it would make those who purchased the flight simulators more likely to play the game. Stealey recalled: [...] "We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. And he turns to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says</b> 'Bill, you should put Sid's name on a couple of these boxes, and promote him as the star.' And that's how Sid's name got on Pirates, and Civilization." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Kiefer Sutherland {{took the}} project, {{he did not}} {{understand}} that the series was set in real-time, having skipped the line that said, [...] "All events take place in real time." [...] Kiefer said it was, in fact, the interaction between the characters that prompted him to take the pilot. Sutherland was sent the script by director Stephen Hopkins, with whom he had a previous relationship. Sutherland was attracted to the shades of grey in the Jack Bauer character, as well as his status as a [...] "normal guy", citing Jack's inability to handle his own teenage daughter. The Tony Almeida character was originally called [...] "Geller" [...] in the original Pilot script, who Bernard called a [...] "backbiting Jewish techie guy". Bernard didn't understand why they had sent him the script, given his Hispanic ethnicity. Carlos and the crew came up with the Tony Almeida name fifteen minutes before shooting, but the legal department wouldn't let them use it. Legal told the crew that they could use the name 'Tonio', which Carlos found underwhelming. Bernard said, [...] "So we were filming the very first scene, Kiefer walking down CTU, and he turns to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>says,</b> 'Sorry man, I can't call you Tonio, I'm just gonna call you Tony.' I owe Kiefer everything: Tonio's the name of a guy who gets killed in the first episode." ...|$|E
