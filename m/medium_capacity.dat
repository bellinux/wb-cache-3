5000|$|Media {{richness}} theory (Daft & Lengel, 1986) shares some characteristics {{with social}} presence theory. It posits {{that the amount}} of information communicated differs with respect to a medium's richness. The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication. Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time (with [...] "rich" [...] media carrying more information), they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well. The more restricted the <b>medium's</b> <b>capacity,</b> the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage. It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication.|$|R

40|$|We {{raise the}} {{question}} {{whether there is a}} way to characterize the quantum information transport properties of a medium or material. For this analysis the special features of quantum information have to be taken into account. We find that quantum communication over an isotropic medium, as opposed to classical information transfer, requires the transmitter to direct the signal towards the receiver. Furthermore, for large classes of media there is a threshold, in the sense that `sufficiently much' of the signal has to be collected. Therefore, the <b>medium's</b> <b>capacity</b> for quantum communication can be characterized in terms of how the size of the transmitter and receiver has to scale with the transmission distance to maintain quantum information transmission. To demonstrate the applicability of this concept, an n-dimensional spin lattice is considered, yielding a sufficient scaling of d^(n/ 3) with the distance d...|$|R

In this paper a new process for lead recovery is modeled, Flubor (R) (Olper and Fracchia, 1991, Olper 1995), based on leaching and electrolysis that is environmental friendly and solve the problems of high capital investment and operating costs.

The model involves several unit operations necessary for the separation of a broad range of impurities. Multiphase streams are treated, involving liquid, gases and solids. A "sequential modular approach" is used with iterative calculations for solving the problem of recycle loops. The model well reproduces the performances of a flexible, large-scale demonstrative plant. It can be also of support for control and as operator training simulator (OTS) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- "Active {{listening}} " is {{a well-known}} ingredient in contexts that involve gathering information and solving problems. Demanding both verbal and nonverbal skills, {{this way of communication}} improves mutual understanding by using techniques like paraphrasing. The benefits are manifold and crucial for computer scientists. For instance, it avoids misunderstandings, as people verify they do really understand. Our study investigates active listening in an online educational setting using written communication, which is a novel asset. We explore whether active listening is effective in written online communication and examine this <b>medium's</b> <b>capacity</b> to fully exploit this concept's benefits. The study was conducted in a technology-enhanced course on "Soft Skills for Computer Scientists". Interestingly, analysis reveals that active listening techniques do have positive effects on communication in the analyzed setting of online communication. Furthermore, it appears that instant messaging tools facilitate to let the other completely verbalize his or her thought before responding...|$|R

40|$|IEEE 802. 11 is a Media Access Control (MAC) {{protocol}} {{which has}} been standardized by IEEE for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). The IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol offers two types of services to its users: synchronous and asynchronous. This paper thoroughly analyzes, by simulation, the asynchronous part alone, when each station feeds the MAC protocol with data traffic patterns (in the following referred to as advanced data traffic) that are very close in shape to those generated by a terminal accessing, for example, the WWW service. Although the analysis shows that {{the performance of the}} IEEE 802. 11 with advanced traffic is considerably worse than with Poissonian traffic, we can conclude that IEEE 802. 11 still performs satisfactorily. Furthermore, our analysis is broadened to include higher <b>medium</b> <b>capacities</b> up to 10 Mbit/sec.
