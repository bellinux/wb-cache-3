40|$|Understanding how {{mechanics}} complement bio-signaling {{in defining}} patterns during morphogenesis {{is an outstanding}} challenge. Here, we utilize the multicellular polyp Hydra to investigate {{the role of the}} actomyosin cytoskeleton in morphogenesis. We find that the supra-cellular actin fiber organization is inherited from the parent Hydra and determines the body axis in regenerating tissue segments. This form of structural inheritance is non-trivial because of the tissue folding and dynamic actin reorganization involved. We further show that the emergence of multiple body axes can be traced to discrepancies in actin fiber alignment at early stages of the regeneration process. Mechanical constraints induced by anchoring regenerating Hydra on stiff wires suppressed the emergence of multiple body axes, highlighting the importance of <b>mechanical</b> <b>feedbacks</b> in defining and stabilizing the body axis. Together, these results constitute an important step toward the development of an integrated view of morphogenesis that incorporates mechanics...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the empirical properties of hot X-ray-emitting gas {{in a sample}} of 7 starburst and 3 normal edge-on spiral galaxies correlate with the size, mass, star formation rate and star formation intensity in the host galaxies. From this analysis we investigate various aspects of <b>mechanical</b> energy <b>feedback</b> on galactic scales. We demonstrate, using a variety of multi-wavelength star formation rate and intensity indicators, that the diffuse X-ray emission is ultimately driven by <b>mechanical</b> energy <b>feedback</b> from massive stars. We find that the luminosity of the extra-planar diffuse X-ray emission is proportional to proxies of the star formation rate of the host galaxy, for example the FIR or 1. 4 GHz radio luminosity. Larger galaxies tend to have more extended X-ray-emitting halos, but galaxy mass appears to play no role in determining the properties of the disk or extra-planar X-ray emitting plasma. Accretion of gas from the IGM {{does not appear to be}} a significant contributor to the diffuse X-ray emission in this sample. The combination of these luminosity and size correlations leads to a correlation between the X-ray surface brightness and L_FIR/D_ 25 ^ 2. Intriguingly, the diffuse X-ray properties of the normal spirals fall where extrapolation of the trends from the starburst galaxies with superwinds would predict. We reconsider the conditions necessary for superbubble blow-out from the disk into the halo of a galaxy, and present methods for observationally determining the efficiency of <b>mechanical</b> energy <b>feedback</b> and testing theoretical models of disk blow out. Given the properties of the gaseous halos we observe, outflows from disk galaxies of mass M = 1 e 10 to 1 e 11 Solar masses should still eject some fraction of their material in the IGM...|$|R

40|$|Morphogenesis {{in living}} tissues is the {{paramount}} {{example of a}} time- and space-dependent orchestration of living matter where shape and order emerge from undifferentiated initial conditions. The genes encode the protein expression that eventually drives {{the emergence of the}} phenotype, while energy supply and cell-to-cell communication mechanisms are necessary to such a process. The overall control of the system likely exploits the laws of chemistry and physics through robust and universal processes. Even if the identification of the communication mechanisms is a question of fundamental nature, a long-standing investigation settled in the realm of chemical factors only (also known as morphogens) faces a number of apparently unsolvable questions. In this paper, we investigate at what extent mechanical forces, alone or through their biological feedbacks, can direct some basic aspects of morphogenesis in development biology. In this branch of mechano-biology, we discuss the typical rheological regimes of soft living matter and the related forces, providing a survey on how local <b>mechanical</b> <b>feedbacks</b> can control global size or even gene expression. We finally highlight the pivotal role of nonlinear mechanics to explain the emergence of complex shapes in living matter...|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} {{the perception of}} optically simulated haptic feedback. The perception of optically and mechanically simulated bumps and holes was tested experimentally. In an earlier article, we have described the active cursor technique, a method to simulate haptic feedback optically without resorting to special <b>mechanical</b> force <b>feedback</b> devices, commonly applied to produce haptic percepts in computer interfaces. The operation of the force feedback device is substituted by tiny displacements on the cursor position relative to the intended force. This method exploits the domination of the visual over the haptic modality. Results show that people can recognize optically simulated bump and hole structures and that active cursor displacements influence the haptic perception of bumps and holes. Depending on the simulated strength of the force, optically simulated haptic feedback can take precedence over mechanically simulated haptic feedback and also the other way around. When optically simulated and mechanically simulated haptic feedback counteract each other, however, the weight attributed to each source of haptic information differs from user to user. It is concluded that active cursor displacements {{can be used to}} simulate the operation of <b>mechanical</b> force <b>feedback</b> devices...|$|R

40|$|Theory and {{numerical}} implementation describing {{groundwater flow}} and {{the transport of}} heat and solute mass in fully saturated fractured rocks with elasto-plastic <b>mechanical</b> <b>feedbacks</b> are developed. In our formulation, fractures are considered as being of lower dimension than the hosting deformable porous rock and we consider their hydraulic and mechanical apertures as scaling parameters to ensure continuous exchange of fluid mass and energy within the fracture–solid matrix system. The coupled system of equations is implemented in a new simulator code that makes use of a Galerkin finite-element technique. The code builds on a flexible, object-oriented numerical framework (MOOSE, Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) which provides an extensive scalable parallel and implicit coupling to solve for the multiphysics problem. The governing equations of groundwater flow, heat and mass transport, and rock deformation are solved in a weak sense (either by classical Newton–Raphson or by free Jacobian inexact Newton–Krylow schemes) on an underlying unstructured mesh. Nonlinear feedbacks among the active processes are enforced by considering evolving fluid and rock properties depending on the thermo-hydro-mechanical state {{of the system and}} the local structure, i. e. degree of connectivity, of the fracture system. A suite of applications is presented to illustrate the flexibility and capability of the new simulator to address problems of increasing complexity and occurring at different spatial (from centimetres to tens of kilometres) and temporal scales (from minutes to hundreds of years) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} gap in {{the current}} understanding of galaxies concerns the thermodynamical evolution of ordinary, baryonic matter. On the one hand, radiative emission drastically decreases the thermal energy content of the interstellar plasma (ISM), inducing a slow cooling flow towards the centre. On the other hand, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) struggles to prevent the runaway cooling catastrophe, injecting huge amount of energy into the ISM. The present study intends to investigate thoroughly the role of <b>mechanical</b> AGN <b>feedback</b> in (isolated or massive) elliptical galaxies, extending and completing the mass range of tested cosmic environments. Our previously successful feedback models in galaxy clusters and groups demonstrated that AGN outflows, self-regulated by cold gas accretion, are able to quench the cooling flow properly without destroying the cool core. Via three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations (FLASH 3. 3), also including stellar evolution, we show that massive mechanical AGN outflows can indeed solve the cooling-flow problem for the entire life of the galaxy, {{at the same time}} reproducing typical observational features and constraints such as buoyant under dense bubbles, elliptical shock cocoons, sonic ripples, dredge-up of metals, subsonic turbulence and extended filamentary or nuclear cold gas. In order to avoid overheating and totally emptying the isolated galaxy, the frequent <b>mechanical</b> AGN <b>feedback</b> should be less powerful and efficient (ϵ ∼ 10 − 4) compared with the heating required for more massive and bound ellipticals surrounded by the intragroup medium (ϵ ∼ 10 − 3) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{source of}} cytoskeletal {{traction}} is actomyosin contractility. Increased external stiffness {{leads to a}} signal transduction cascade that activates the small GTPase Rho and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). ROCK, in turn, controls myosin light chain phosphorylation, an event that triggers myosin ATPase activity and the shortening of actin fibers, causing contraction and pulling on the ECM. Though the precise pathway that connects ECM stiffness to ROCK activity is unknown, the observation of increased traction in response to increased ECM stiffness is sufficient to explain the phenomenon of durotaxis. The stronger <b>mechanical</b> <b>feedback</b> would pull the cell towards the stiffer region and cause a bias in directional movement and have other consequences on cytoskeletal and focal adhesion organization.|$|E

Some of the Austrailian staff at Woomera began development of a simulator system in 1965 {{in order to understand}} and tune the manual guidance system. This consisted of a joystick from the Rapier optical tracker which caused the projected image of the missile to move about. Models of the missile and various target aircraft were constructed and shot using stop motion filming techniques to make a selection of films of various target attack sequences across the Woomera sky. The system was completed in 1968 and in initial testing, it seemed tracking was a serious problem, and it appeared the British Army was concerned that the system would simply be beyond the capabilities of the average gunner. However, some of the problems was ultimately solved by adjusting the <b>mechanical</b> <b>feedback</b> in the joystick so it more closely matched the difficulty the missile would have responding to various inputs, and with that solved, many of the remaining issues were worked out through a massive simulation run and data processing on an IBM 7090.|$|E
