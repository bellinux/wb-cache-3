50|$|Common {{aspects of}} synthesis: With the aerographite's CVD process metal oxides had {{been shown in}} 2012 to be a {{suitable}} template for deposition of graphitic structures. The templates can be in situ removed. Basic mechanism is the reduction of metal oxide to a <b>metallic</b> <b>constituent,</b> the nucleation of carbon in {{and on top of}} metal and the simultaneous evaporation of metal component.Requirements for the metal oxides are: a low activation energy for chemical reduction, a metal phase, which can nucleate graphite, a low evaporation point of metal phase (ZnO, SnO).From engineering perspective, the developed CVD process enables the use of ceramic powder processing (use of custom particles and sintering bridges) for creation of templates for 3D carbon via CVD. Key advantages compared to commonly used metal templates are: shape variety of particle shapes, the creation of sintering bridges and the removal without acids.Originally demonstrated on just µm-sized meshed graphite networks, the CVD mechanism had been adopted after 2014 by other scientists to create nm-sized carbon structures. Details specific to reference: Aerographite is produced by chemical vapor deposition, using a ZnO template. The template consists of micron-thick rods, often in the shape of multipods, that can be synthesized by mixing comparable amounts of Zn and polyvinyl butyral powders and heating the mixture at 900 °C. The aerographite synthesis is carried out at ~760 °C, under an argon gas flow, to which toluene vapors are injected as a carbon source. A thin (~15 nm), discontinuous layer of carbon is deposited on ZnO which is then etched away by adding hydrogen gas to the reaction chamber. Thus the remaining carbon network closely follows the morphology of the original ZnO template. In particular, the nodes of the aerographite network originate from the joints of the ZnO multipods.|$|E

30|$|There is {{a number}} of common {{procedures}} to fabricate carbon nanotubes (CNT) by, e.g. thermal sputtering of graphite in an electric arc, laser evaporation, etc. [1 – 8]. For any of them, the synthesized substance is a nanocarbon material (NCM) containing not only single-wall and multi-wall CNT, but also amorphous carbon, graphite nanoparticles, and catalyst refuses. Transition metals are commonly used as catalysts for the CNT synthesis. Their contents depend on the synthesis procedure [9 – 11]. To obtain CNT of the highest possible purity it is therefore vital to understand and control the routes of their rectification. At the same time, {{it is necessary to}} control the composition of the synthesized material. For instance, a fast method for quantitative analysis of the amorphous component is based on Raman scattering as described in Refs. [12 – 15]. The presence of the metallic component is commonly detected by the X-ray and electron diffraction, although they have low efficiency at low contents and high dispersity of the <b>metallic</b> <b>constituent.</b>|$|E

40|$|Infiltration {{is used in}} the {{production}} of several different material groups as electric contact materials, copper infiltrated sintered steels and metal matrix composites. The mechanism of infiltration causes also unwanted difficulties in processing as brazing of porous sintered compacts. The common question, in this work has been, how is it possible to control infiltration in different materials processing techniques? In joining of powder metallurgically (P/M) produced porous compacts, by brazing, the inherent porosity of the compacts causes the melt filler metal to infiltrate the interconnected pore channels of the P/M parts, by capillary forces. This will result in high penetration depths and filler metal consumption and a limited amount of filler metal will be available for the joint. In {{the production}} of metal matrix composites (MMC:s), the difference in surface energies between the metallic and ceramic components prohibits a spontaneous infiltration of the metallic phase into the ceramic porous body. This work includes a general analyse of the different physical and mechanical methods to control infiltration in brazing of porous compacts and processing of MMC:s respectively. The experimental part of the work concentrates on the study of physical methods for the infiltration control. Brazing of porous sintered compacts has been studied experimentally through different thermal treatments. A special (Cu-Ni-Mn-Si) filler-metal, developed by others in order to facilitate alloying between iron in P/M- compacts and the elements in the filler-metal, has been used and the results has been studied by optical and scanning electron microscopy and the mechanical strength and hardness has been measured. In the work on MMC:s a method for processing of aluminium matrix-alumina reinforced composites by spontaneous infiltration has been studied by wetting and in- situ high temperature X-ray experiments. The investigation of brazing shows that the filler metal starts to melt already at 930 oC and a two phase alloy is developed in the joint. The diffusion of elements from the filler metal and the sintered compact causes a development of an alloy with high melting temperature in the surface area of the sintered compact that blocks the surface pores from continued infiltration. The wetting experiments show that the spontaneous infiltration in production of MMC:s is enabled by chemical reactions in the system concerned. The in-situ X-ray experiments show that the formation of magnesium-nitride appears below 600 oC. The formation of AlN as a second reaction product in the spontaneous infiltration has been detected for compact tested after a processing cycle with increased pressure of nitrogen- gas in the processing furnace. The in-situ X-ray study of the spontaneous infiltration has shown that the formation of magnesium nitride could be detected. The results show also {{that it is possible to}} study chemical reactions at and above the melting temperature of the <b>metallic</b> <b>constituent</b> of the system.

Disks with increasing ceramic content from inner to outer radius showed a more uniform von Mises stress distribution for a fixed value of total ceramic content. In contrast, disks with decreasing ceramic content from inner to outer radius had the lowest outer edge displacement for a fixed value of total ceramic content. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4006023...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{carbonation}} can stabilize industrial residues and, in {{the steel}} industry, may contribute to simultaneously valorize CO 2 emissions and slag. We hypothesized that, by restricting the leaching of metals of toxicological concern such as Cr and V, carbonation can suppress the toxicity of these materials. The cytotoxic activity (WST 1 assay) of slag dusts collected from a stainless and a Linz-Donawitz (LD) steel plant, before and after carbonation, was examined in J 774 macrophages. The release of Cr, V, Fe, Mn and Ni was measured after incubation in artificial lung fluids mimicking the extracellular and phagolysosomal milieu to which particles are confronted after inhalation. LD slag had the higher Fe, Mn and V content, and was more cytotoxic than stainless steel slag. The cytotoxic activity of LD but not of stainless dusts was reduced after carbonation. The cytotoxic activity of the dusts toward J 774 macrophages necessitated a {{direct contact with the}} cells and was reduced in the presence of inhibitors of phagocytosis (cytochalasin D) or phagolysosome acidification (bafilomycin), pointing to a key role of <b>metallic</b> <b>constituents</b> released in phagolysosomes. This in vitro study supports a limited reduction of the cytotoxic activity of LD, but not of stainless, steel dusts upon carbonation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Depending on {{the energy}} level used during {{mechanical}} alloying, {{the constitution of the}} resulting products can vary extensively. With high energy input, full transformation to the equilibrium phase, FeTi, is achieved. In contrast, for low levels of energy input, the process is akin to mixing without any phase transformation even for extended milling periods. In the present work, nanostructured FeTi powders were produced by mechanical alloying, avoiding the unfavourable agglomeration problem, by using a relatively low level of energy (e. g. 300 rpm) to mill the pure <b>metallic</b> <b>constituents,</b> Fe and Ti, followed by subsequent heat treatment at 800 ºC. A major achievement of this research was to show that, by modulating the milling intensity and total milling time, the high temperature synthesis reaction of FeTi (1100 ºC) can be partially or totally suppressed, reverting instead to a metastable reaction path at low temperature (650 ºC). The mechanical “activation ” modifies the reactivity of the system, producing a very thin Ti /Fe layers. That in conjunction {{with a high level of}} defects induced mechanically may be responsible for the metastability. Partial substitution of Fe with Ni (10 %) resulted essentially in the same phase constitution, indicating solid solution of Ni in FeTi replacing partially Fe lattice positions...|$|R
40|$|Striking {{similarities}} {{have been}} observed {{in a number of}} extrapulmonary responses of rodents to seemingly disparate ambient pollutants. These responses are often characterized by primary decreases in important indices of cardiac and thermoregulatory function, along with secondary decreases in associated parameters. For example, when rats are exposed to typical experimental concentrations of ozone (O 3), they demonstrate robust and consistent decreases in heart rate (HR) ranging from 50 to 100 beats per minute, whereas core temperature (T co) often falls 1. 5 – 2. 5 °C. Other related indices, such as metabolism, minute ventilation, blood pressure, and cardiac output, appear to exhibit similar deficits. The magnitudes of the observed decreases may be modulated by changes in experimental conditions and appear to vary inversely with both ambient temperature and body mass. More recent studies in which both healthy and compromised rats were exposed to either particulate matter or its specific components yielded similar results. The agents studied included representative examples of ambient, combustion, and natural source particles, along with individual or combined exposures to their primary <b>metallic</b> <b>constituents.</b> In addition to the substantial decreases in HR and T co, similar to those seen with the O 3 -exposed rats, these animals also displayed numerous adverse changes in electrocardiographic waveforms and cardiac rhythm, frequently resulting in fata...|$|R
