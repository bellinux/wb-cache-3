40|$|HYPERPLASIAof {{the thyroid}} gland will follow any {{procedure}} leading to thyroid hormone deficiency provided the anterior pituitary is intact. This {{has been demonstrated}} in rats and mice treated with thiouracil (Astwood, Sullivan, Bissell Gorbman, 1947) and also after {{the use of a}} low iodine diet and Tyslowitz, 1943; (Remington, 1937; Axelrad and Leblond, 1952). Attempts to produce thyroid neoplasia by these means have been relatively successful in rats (Hall and Bielschowsky, 1949; Axelrad and Leblond, 1955), but the mouse responds much less readily; indeed serial transplantations of such thyroid tissue through several generations of mice have usually been required to establish clear evidence of malignancy. In the present experiment the neoplastic potentialities of mouse thyroid gland under the stimulation of extreme induced thyroxin deficiency has been assessed by subjecting a group of mice to a combination of a thiouracil derivative and a low iodine diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred 4 -month-old C 57 mice, 50 males and 50 females, were segregated by sex in metal ea-ges, 6 to 7 per cage. They were then divided into 3 groups: Group A-the control series, consisting of 12 males and 13 females, was given a stock 41 B diet and tap water. Group B-consisting of 25 males and 25 females, was given the stock diet and distilled drinking water with <b>methylthiouracil</b> added.

40|$|IT is well {{recognised}} {{that any}} condition interfering with thyroxin synthesis {{leads to an}} increased secretion of thyrotrophic hormone from the anterior pituitary. The "thyrotrophs " undergo proliferation and may form large adenomata (Furth and Clifton, 1958). The thyrotrophic hormone in turn causes thyroid hyperplasia, provided of course the original agent interfering with thyroxin formation does not actually destroy the parenchyma of the gland. In the following experiment mice have been treated with <b>methylthiouracil</b> and a low iodine diet. An attempt {{has been made to}} correlate the changes in pituitary with varying degrees of hyperplasia encountered in the thyroid. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred 4 month old C 57 mice, 50 of each sex, were divided into 3 groups: a control group of 25, a group of 50 fed on <b>methylthiouracil</b> and a stock 41 B diet, and a group of 25 given <b>methylthiouracil</b> and a low iodine diet. The <b>methylthiouracil</b> was administered as a 0. 05 per cent solution in distilled drinking water. Details of the diet have already been described (Israel and Ellis, 1960). In addition 10 mice were given the low iodine diet alone. After 480 days the animals were killed and their thyroid glands examined, as reported previously (Israel and Ellis, 1960).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonist rosiglitazone {{has been}} suggested to exert cardiovascular protection through the improvement of lipid metabolism, anti-inflammation, anti-proliferation etc. However, whether renin-angiotensin system (RAS) {{is involved in the}} vascular protective effects of PPARγ agonists is not fully understood. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the renin-angiotensin system in vascular protection mediated by PPARγ agonists. Objective To investigate the actions of the renin-angiotensin system in vascular protection mediated by activation of PPARγ in vivo and in vitro. Methods Rats were fed a regular diet (n = 8), a cholesterol-rich diet plus <b>methylthiouracil</b> (80 mg/Kg/day, n = 10), a cholesterol-rich diet plus <b>methylthiouracil</b> and rosiglitazone (4 mg/kg/day, n = 10). The rosiglitazone treatment was started from one month after the start of cholesterol-rich diet plus <b>methylthiouracil,</b> and lasted five months. Cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were pretreated with 1 μmol/L angiotensin II (ANG II) for 6 h and randomly divided into the control group; the ANG II group (1 μmol/L ANG II); the groups respectively treated with different concentration rosiglitazone (20, 30, 50) μmol/L for 12 h; the groups treated with 30 μmol/L rosiglitazone for (6, 12, 24) h. Morphology changes of the aortic tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin stain. The VSMC growth was detected by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay. Angiotensin II and expression of angiotensin receptors were determined by radioimmunoassay, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Results After 6 months, lipid deposition, VSMC proliferation and migration toward intima were observed in aortic tissues in the rats on a cholesterol-rich diet plus <b>methylthiouracil,</b> while these pathological changes induced by the cholesterol-rich diet were significantly suppressed by rosiglitazone. In addition, VSMC proliferation induced by ANG II was markedly inhibited by rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone markedly down-regulated expression of angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) and up-regulated expression of angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT 2 R) in the aortic tissues and ANG II-treated VSMCs. Conclusions The present study demonstrated that PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone suppressed ANG II-induced VSMC proliferation in vitro and early atherosclerotic formation evoked by cholesterol-rich diet in vivo. These vasculoprotective effects of rosiglitazone were mediated at least partially by reduction in local tissue ANG II concentration, down-regulation of AT 1 R expression and up-regulation of AT 2 R expression both at the mRNA and protein levels. </p...|$|E

40|$|A REVIEW of the {{radiobiology}} of {{the thyroid}} gland {{has already been}} published by Philp (1966).

Comparison was made between the carcinogenic effect of 30,C 1131 with a single exposure of the thyroid to 1100 rads X rays.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rapid method for confirming residues of thyreostats in meat-based baby foods by using liquid chromatography–dual polarity electrospray–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ES(±) -MS/MS). Six thioureylenes, {{belonging to the}} group of thiouracil and imidazole, were selected for this work: thiouracil (TU), <b>methylthiouracil</b> (MTU), propylthiouracil (PTU), phenylthiouracil (PhTU), mercaptobenzimidazole (MBI) and tapazole (TAP). The amphoteric nature of these compounds allows their electrospray detection in both positive and negative ionisation.

A pentafluorophenyl (PFP) core-shell phase column was selected to avoid peak asymmetry or peak splitting, and a dual-polarity ionisation method was optimised to obtain a sensitivity as high as possible. The method was validated according to the Commission Decision 657 / 2002 /EC.

While carcinomas showed a linear relation for cumulative percentage and time, sarcomas at first tended to develop at a fast rate and later more slowly thus giving a biphasic graph. The present report is concerned with the sex difference in the induction of tumours of the salivary glands in rats and examines the process in intact and castrate males and females.

Because of the influence of the thyroid on the submaxillary gland (Arvy, Debray and Gabe, 1950; Arvy and Gabe, 1950 a, b; Grad and Leblond, 1949; Hammett, 1923; Shafer and Muhler, 1956), we have also investigated the influence of L-thyroxine and of <b>methylthiouracil</b> on tumour induction in intact and castrate male and female rats. The sexual dimorphism of the salivary glands in rats an...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} catechol {{in the presence}} of propylthiouracil (PTU) and <b>methylthiouracil</b> (MTU) at a glassy carbon electrode is thoroughly investigated. The cyclic voltammetric studies of the systems are performed in different pHs and sweep rates. The results of the voltammetric foundations show an electrocatalytic oxidation of catechol {{in the presence of}} PTU and MTU, leading to a remarkable increase in the anodic peak current of catechol together with the contemporaneous disappearance of the corresponding cathodic wave. The presented mechanism shows the nucleophilic addition/reduction of the electro-generated o-quinone by the PTU or MTU, which produced chemically reduced adducts whose subsequent re-oxidation at the electrode surface leads to a considerable amplification of the anodic peak current. The increasing of the anodic peak current shows a linear correlation with the concentration of PTU and MTU. The spectrophotometric investigations are used to confirm the interaction of considering thiols with the electrochemically produced o-quinone during the controlled-potential coulometry. The effect of various biological thiols, such as cysteine, penicillamine, N-acetyl cysteine, glutathione and captopril on the electrochemical behavior of catechol is investigated in the same conditions. The results represent the unique electrocatalytic effect of PTU and MTU for improving the anodic peak current of catechol and exhibit a very sensitive and relatively selective method for the voltammetric detection of the pointed thiols. A linear range from 0. 1 to 10. 0 µM with a detection limit of 0. 05 µM is obtained for the determination of PTU. The linear range for MTU, using differential pulse voltammetry, was from 0. 1 to 5. 0 µM with a detection limit of 0. 07 µM. The proposed method showed to be useful for the sensitive detection of PTU and MTU among pharmaceutical and biological thiols...|$|E
40|$|A rapid, {{sensitive}} and specific method for quantifying propylthiouracil in human plasma using <b>methylthiouracil</b> as the internal standard (IS) is described. The analyte and the IS were extracted from plasma by liquid–liquid extraction using an organic solvent (ethyl acetate). The extracts {{were analyzed by}} high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) in negative mode (ES−). Chromatography was performed using a Phenomenex Gemini C 18 5 μm analytical column (4. 6 mm × 150 mm i. d.) and a mobile phase consisting of methanol/water/acetonitrile (40 / 40 / 20, v/v/v) + 0. 1 % of formic acid. For propylthiouracil and I. S., the optimized parameters of the declustering potential, collision energy and collision exit potential were − 60 (V), − 26 (eV) and − 5 (V), respectively. The method had a chromatographic run time of 2. 5 min and a linear calibration curve over the range 20 – 5000 ng/mL. The limit of quantification was 20 ng/mL. The stability tests indicated no significant degradation. This HPLC–MS/MS procedure {{was used to assess}} the bioequivalence of two propylthiouracil 100 mg tablet formulations in healthy volunteers of both sexes in fasted and fed state. The geometric mean and 90 % confidence interval CI of Test/Reference percent ratios were, without and with food, respectively: 109. 28 % (103. 63 – 115. 25 %) and 115. 60 % (109. 03 – 122. 58 %) for Cmax, 103. 31 % (100. 74 – 105. 96 %) and 103. 40 % (101. 03 – 105. 84) for AUClast. Conclusion: This method offers advantages over those previously reported, in terms of both a simple liquid–liquid extraction without clean-up procedures, as well as a faster run time (2. 5 min). The LOQ of 20 ng/mL is well suited for pharmacokinetic studies. The assay performance results indicate that the method is precise and accurate enough for the routine determination of the propylthiouracil in human plasma. The test formulation with and without food was bioequivalent to reference formulation. Food administration increased the Tmax and decreased the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) ...|$|E
40|$|What is termed Hohlweg {{effect is}} the {{mechanism}} {{in which a}} stimulus applied to the diencephalon (hypothalamus) by the hormone folliculin causes secretion of F. S. H. and L. H. from the anterior lobe of the pituitary body, resulting {{in the formation of}} the corpus luteum in the ovary. As the factors which have influence on this phenomenon also exert influence on the relation between the hormone folliculin and the hormones that stimulate the genital glands, they are of significance from the standpoint of gynecology. For the purpose of investigating into the influence of various agents on Hohlweg effect from this standpoint, the author performed experiments in young female rats, 674 in total, on, how this phenomenon is influenced by the following agents: <b>Methylthiouracil</b> which is said to cause hypothyroidism, Thyradin which reinforces thyroid activity, various copper salts which are believed effective in inducing the discharge of ova, some sympathetic and parasympathetic agents and vitamin C. The results are summarized as follows: (1) The experiments in which the hormone folliculin administered to rats was reduced to 100 - 50 I. U. so that the corpus luteum positive rate would be lowered, has revealed that this phenomenon is accelerated in hypothyroidism, which it is restrained in hyperthyroidism. (2) Though intravenous injections of copper salts did not cause formation of the corpus luteum in young rats, they, like vitamin C, demonstated an action similar to that of F. S. H. It may be said that they accelerates this phenomenon in so far as they have brought about an increase in the number of the corpus luteum formed in the ovary. (3) The fact that this phenomenon was markedly restrained and accelerated by parasympathetic blocking agents and stimulating agents, respectively, would indicate that the parasympathetic plays an important role in genital function. (4) On the ovary of young rats, vitamin C had the same action as F. S. H. It reinforced the action of the hormone folliculi in so far as it has caused hemorrhagic reaction of moderate degree...|$|E
