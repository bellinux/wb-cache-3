40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BHLMXBs) with short orbital periods may have evolved from BH binaries with an intermediate-mass secondary, but the donor star seems to always have higher effective temperatures than measured in BHLMXBs (Justham, Rappaport & Podsiadlowski 2006). Here we suggest that the secondary star is originally an intermediate-mass (∼ 2 - 5 M_) star, which loses a large fraction of its mass due to the ejecta impact during the aspherical SN explosion that produced the BH. The resulted secondary star could be of low-mass (1 M_). <b>Magnetic</b> braking would <b>shrink</b> the binary orbit, drive mass transfer between the donor and the BH, producing a compact BHLMXB.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} problem of self-similar {{properties}} of the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum, focusing on spectral as well as topological characteristics. In our studies involving any value of magnetic flux and arbitrary flux interval, we single out the most dominant hierarchy in the spectrum, which {{is found to be}} associated with an irrational number ζ= 2 +√(3) where nested set of butterflies describe a kaleidoscope. Characterizing an intrinsic frustration at smallest energy scale, this hidden quasicrystal encodes hierarchical set of topological quantum numbers associated with Hall conductivity and their scaling properties. This topological hierarchy maps to an integral Apollonian gasket near-D_ 3 symmetry, revealing a hidden symmetry of the butterfly as the energy and the <b>magnetic</b> flux intervals <b>shrink</b> to zero. With a periodic drive that induces phase transitions in the system, the fine structure of the butterfly is shown to be amplified making states with large topological invariants accessible experimentally.

40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the effect of}} in-plane magnetic fields on the photoluminescence of 2 D carriers confined in a modulation-doped GaAsAlGaAs MQW heterostructure. The most dramatic effect is a large increase, and eventual saturation at high fields, of the intensity of radiative recombination at interface acceptors (binding energy ∼ 10 meV). We explain this {{as a result of}} field-induced spreading of the confined wave functions toward the barriers. We show this behavior to be qualitatively consistent with an analytically soluble model which combines the in-plane magnetic field with harmonic quantum well confinement to give a 1 D composite oscillator. The low field spreading is due to linear displacement of the oscillator centers with B; at higher fields the <b>magnetic</b> field confinement <b>shrinks</b> the wave functions, and they recede from the interfaces. We observe also a diamagnetic shift and a spectral narrowing of the band-to-band recombination. These effects are confirmed quantitatively with the composite oscillator model. © 1986...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} discovered gamma-ray flares from the Crab nebula are generally {{attributed to the}} magnetic energy release in a highly magnetized region within the nebula. I argue that such a region naturally arises in the polar region of the inner nebula. In pulsar winds, efficient dissipation of the Poynting flux into the plasma energy occur only in the equatorial belt where the energy is predominantly transferred by alternating fields. At high latitudes, the pulsar wind remains highly magnetized therefore the termination shock in the polar region is weak and the postshock flow remains relativistic. I study the structure of this flow and show that the flow at first expands and decelerates and then it converges and accelerates. In the converging part of the flow, the kink instability triggers the magnetic dissipation. The energy release zone occurs {{at the base of}} the observed jet. A specific turbulence of relativistically <b>shrinking</b> <b>magnetic</b> loops efficiently accelerates particles so that the synchrotron emission in the hundreds MeV band, both persistent and flaring, comes from this site.

40|$|In relativistic, Poynting {{dominated}} outflows, {{acceleration and}} collimation are intimately connected. An {{important point is}} that the Lorentz force is nearly compensated by the electric force therefore the acceleration zone spans a large range of scales. We derived the asymptotic equations describing relativistic, axisymmetric MHD flows far beyond the light cylinder. These equations do not contain either intrinsic small scales (like the light cylinder radius) or terms that nearly cancel each other (like the electric and magnetic forces) therefore they could be easily solved numerically. They also suit well for qualitative analysis of the flow and in many cases, they could even be solved analytically or semianalytically. We show that there are generally two collimation modes. In the first mode, the residual of the hoop stress and the electric force is counterbalanced by the pressure of the poloidal magnetic field so that at any distance from the source, the structure of the flow {{is the same as the}} structure of an appropriate cylindrical equilibrium configuration. In the second mode, the pressure of the poloidal magnetic field is negligible small so that the flow could be conceived as composed from coaxial <b>shrinking</b> <b>magnetic</b> loops. In the two collimation modes, the flow is accelerated in different ways. We study in detail the structure of jets confined by the external pressure with a power law profile. In particular, we obtained simple scalings for the extent of the acceleration zone, for the terminal Lorentz factor and for the collimation angle.

40|$|Interest {{in highly}} {{sensitive}} magnetic sensors {{has been great}} due to their wide applications ranging from data storage to geomagnetic exploration. To achieve better performance, magnetic sensors are usually fabricated with micrometer-sized or sub-micrometer-sized multilayer structures. The thickness of each layer can be as thin as a few angstroms. The magnetic properties of these small and thin layers are quite {{different from those of}} the bulk. As the size of the <b>magnetic</b> devices <b>shrinks</b> and the thickness of the ferromagnetic films decreases, the chance of having defects becomes higher. Those defects may be formed during thin film deposition, annealing and the lithography process etc. To have a better understanding the origin of those nanometer sized defects is important for improving sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio of those magnetic sensors. ^ In this thesis, a magnetic sensitivity mapping (MSM) system is developed to locate the inhomogeneous regions in the ferromagnetic layer of magnetic sensors. An ultra-sensitive microcantilever torque magnetometer (MTM) system is developed to characterize the submicrometer-sized magnetic films and arrays. The detailed magnetic microstructures of both the free layer and the pinned layer in magnetic tunneling junctions are studied by the analysis of the temperature and voltage dependence of the tunneling magnetoresistance data. ^ We have correlated the microstructures to the sources of magnetic noise using the developed MSM system. In this study, a scanning nanometer-sized magnetic tip was used to generate a localized magnetic field and excite the free-layer magnetic moment at the air-bearing surface (ABS). By mapping out the magnetic noise as a function of position, the inhomogeneous regions in the ferromagnetic layer of the magnetic sensors that relate to magnetic instabilities inside the recording heads are identified. ^ We studied the voltage and temperature dependence of resistance and magnetoresistance of two types of magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJs). These two types of MTJ samples have different free layer structures but the same pinned structures and the same material for free and reference layers. The tunneling magnetoresistance ratio (TMR), defined as (RAP-RP) /RP, is 26 % and 70 % for type 1 and type 2, respectively. From the analysis of our results, we conclude that: (1) There are more magnetic inhomogeneous regions in the free magnetic layer of type 1 MTJ samples than in those of type 2 MTJ samples; (2) There are possible additional spin-glass-like states that occur at the interface between the magnetic layer and the insulating layer in the type 1 MTJ sample at low temperature. These results clearly indicate that the micro-magnetization orientation in the free layer and its interfaces plays an important role in determining the TMR ratio in these two types of MTJ samples. ^ An ultra-sensitive MTM system is developed to characterize the magnetic nanostructures. The MTM system can be operated in temperature from 10 K to 300 K and under vacuum of 5 x 10 - 8 torr. We have also developed a new method to deposit magnetic patterns on cantilevers that allows us to have more flexibility in magnetic studies using MTM in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problem of energization of particles (both electrons and ions) to tens and hundreds of keV and the associated transport process in the magnetotail during substorms. Particles energized in the magnetotail are further accelerated to even higher energies (hundreds of keV to MeV) in the radiation belts, causing space weather hazards to human activities in space and on ground. We develop an analytical model to quantitatively estimate flux changes caused by betatron and Fermi acceleration when particles are transported along narrow high-speed flow channels from the magnetotail to the inner magnetosphere. The model shows that energetic particle flux can be significantly enhanced by a modest compression of the <b>magnetic</b> field and/or <b>shrinking</b> of {{the distance between the}} magnetic mirror points. We use coordinated spacecraft measurements, global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations driven by measured upstream solar wind conditions, and large-scale kinetic (LSK) simulations to quantify electron local acceleration in the near-Earth reconnection region and nonlocal acceleration during plasma earthward transport. Compared to the analytical model, application of the LSK simulations is much less restrictive because trajectories of millions of test particles are calculated in the realistically determined global MHD fields and the results are statistical. The simulation results validated by the observations show that electrons following a power law distribution at high energies are generated earthward of the reconnection site, and {{that the majority of the}} energetic electrons observed in the inner magnetosphere are caused by adiabatic acceleration in association with magnetic dipolarizations and fast flows during earthward transport. We extend the global MHD+LSK simulations to examine ion energization and compare it with electron energization. The simulations demonstrate that ions in the magnetotail are first nonadiabatically accelerated in the weak field region close to the reconnection site, and then adiabatically accelerated in the high-speed flow channels as they catch up with and ride on the earthward propagating dipolarization structures. The nonlocal adiabatic acceleration mechanism for ions is very similar to that for electrons. However, the motion of energetic electrons is adiabatic except in very limited regions near the reconnection site while the motion of energetic ions is marginally adiabatic in the dipolarization regions. The simulations also show that the earthward transport of both species is controlled by the high-speed flows via the dominant ExB drift in the magnetotail. To understand how the power law electrons are initially produced in the magnetotail, we use an implicit particle-in-cell (PIC) code to model the processes in the near-Earth reconnection region. We find that the power law electrons are produced not in the reconnection diffusion region, but in the immediate downstream of the reconnection outflow in the course of dipolarization formation and intensification. Our study illustrates that during substorms, particles are accelerated via a multi-step process, including local acceleration in the reconnection region and nonlocal acceleration during the earthward transport, and the multi-step acceleration occurs on multiple spatial scales ranging from a few kilometers (the scale of electron diffusion region) to more than ten Earth radii (the transport scale) ...|$|R
