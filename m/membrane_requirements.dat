40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{ability of}} {{cholestanol}} to support growth of yeast sterol auxotrophs has been examined. Growth on this stanol was precluded unless minute quantities of ergosterol were available, a phenomenon designated sparking. The {{low levels of}} ergosterol were insufficient to support growth alone. The data indicate that cholestanol is fulfilling a bulk <b>membrane</b> <b>requirement(s)</b> while ergosterol satisfies a high specificity sparking function(s). A variety of sterols and stanols were analyzed {{for their ability to}} satisfy these two sterol functions in yeast sterol auxotrophs. While many sterols and stanols satisfied bulk <b>membrane</b> <b>requirements,</b> only those possessing a C- 5, 6 unsaturation or capable of being desaturated at C- 5 in vivo fulfilled the sparking function. Addition of a bromo or iodo moiety to the sterol side chain had no effect on the ability of cholesterol to satisfy either sterol function. However, the presence of a keto or hydroxy group on the sterol side chain completely abolished the ability of cholesterol to satisfy either sterol requirement. Unsaturation of the A-ring or a-saturation of a C- 5, 6 unsaturation rendered both sterol and stanol unsuitable for either function. The C- 28 methyl group of ergosterol, while found not to be required for growth, allowed for greater ease of in vivo desaturation at C- 5. As a result some sterols and stanols lacking the C- 28 methyl were incapable of satisfying the sparking requirement while identical compounds possessing the C- 28 methyl were able to fulfill the sparking function(s). These data are extended to hypothesize a role for the C- 28 methyl group as well as other functional moieties of ergosterol in yeast. Physiological studies are also undertaken in an attempt to define the sparking phenomenon better...|$|E

It appeared from complementation tests that a defect in delta 5 -desaturase enzyme activity was required for the viability of the C- 14 demethylation mutant. Growth studies with a sterol auxotrophic strain indicated that the major sterol of strain JR 4, 14 alpha-methyl-ergosta- 8, 24 (28) -dien- 3 beta-ol, could satisfy "bulk" <b>membrane</b> <b>requirements</b> but not the second, structurally specific, sterol function that we defined previously (Rodriguez et al., Biochem.

The import of a chloroplast protein into isolated mitochondria which occurs with a low rate is not inhibited by a protease-pretreatment of mitochondria, indicating that this precursor only follows the bypass pathway.

Under the concomitant etching/cross-linking/oxidation effects inherent to the plasma modification, transport properties (ionic exchange capacity, water uptake, ionic conductivity and fuel retention) of membranes have been improved.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{features of}} sterols required to support mammalian cell growth {{have not been}} fully defined. Here, we use mutant CHO cells that synthesize only small amounts of cholesterol to test the capacity of various sterols to support growth. Sterols with minor modifications of the side chain (e. g., campesterol, β-sitosterol, and desmosterol) supported long-term growth of mutant cells, but sterols with more complex modifications of the side chain, the sterol nucleus, or the 3 -hydroxy group did not. After 60 days in culture, the exogenous sterol comprised > 90 % of cellular sterols. Inactivation of residual endogenous synthesis with the squalene epoxidase inhibitor NB- 598 prevented growth in β-sitosterol and greatly reduced growth in campesterol. Growth of cells cultured in β-sitosterol and NB- 598 was restored by adding small amounts of cholesterol to the medium. Surprisingly, enantiomeric cholesterol also supported cell growth, even {{in the presence of}} NB- 598. Thus, sterols fulfill two roles in mammalian cells: (i) a bulk <b>membrane</b> <b>requirement</b> in which phytosterols can substitute for cholesterol and (ii) other processes that specifically require small amounts of cholesterol but are not enantioselective...|$|R

Despite {{the widespread use}} of autografts and allografts, no data are yet available on productive infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1) of human keratinocytes. To address this point, we challenged keratinocytes at the second passage of culture with HTLV-IIIB virus by cell-free and cell-mediated inoculum. Viral entry was not achieved by cell-free inoculum, thus demonstrating that cultured keratinocytes do not provide the <b>membrane</b> <b>requirements</b> for viral binding and/or internalization. By contrast, the cell-mediated inoculum overcame specific receptor constraints, leading to viral integration and productive infection. The p 24 gag viral protein was transiently released in the culture supernatant, although at low level. The viral progeny produced by infected keratinocytes was rescued and amplified by co-culture experiments performed with the HIV- 1 high sensitive CEM-SS human T-cell line. Viral integration, p 24 gag production, and secondary transmission to lymphoid cells was further confirmed with keratinocytes infected at the fourth passage of culture. Taken together, our results demonstrate that cultured keratinocytes can be infected by HTLV-IIIB virus, which can be maintained in semi-latent form for several passages after inoculum and rescued to full replication by a proper target.

40|$|Supplying fresh, {{potable water}} to an ever {{increasing}} world population {{is becoming a}} major challenge. One possibility is to produce fresh water from seawater by Reverse Osmosis (RO), {{a process that is}} very energy intensive. To reduce the energy demand of this process, osmotic dilution (OD) /osmotic energy recovery (OER) systems can be used as pre-treatment. Both Reverse Electrodialysis (RED) and Pressure Retarded Osmosis (PRO) and their non energy-producing counterparts short-circuited RED/ Forward Osmosis (scRED/FO) and assisted RED/FO (ARED/AFO) were modelled as OD/OER devices for RO, in a thermodynamic way. Different mixing ratios of impaired versus salt water (0. 5, 1 and 2) were compared at a realistic RO recovery of 50 %. A realistic approach for the RED/PRO-RO hybrid process was also modelled incorporating some major losses, to gain a more realistic insight into its possibilities. The thermodynamic modelling revealed that a significant reduction of the SEC is possible with all hybrid processes. The reduction in SEC is less for the non energy-producing systems, but these have the added advantage of requiring a lower membrane area to achieve a similar extent of seawater dilution. From preliminary results of the more realistic modelling, it seems that RED-RO scores better when losses are incorporated. Further thermodynamic and realistic modelling will focus on different RO recoveries, capital cost calculations based on <b>membrane</b> <b>requirements</b> and sensitivity analysis of the different parameters implemented...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{interact}} with mechanical environments by mechanotransduction, a cellular process that converts mechanical signals into biochemical signals. Umbrella cells respond to mechanical stimuli by increasing exocytosis, endocytosis, and ion transport, but how these processes are coordinated and the mechanotransduction pathways involved {{are not well}} understood. By manipulating different forces and force parameters applied on umbrella cells, the responses of electrophysiological parameters (TEV, TER, and Isc) and apical membrane capacitance (1 µF  1 cm 2 membrane surface area) are monitored through the modified Ussing chamber system. Stretch of the umbrella cells result in an acute change of electrical parameters, but not hydrostatic pressure. Further, the stretched response is sensitive to force direction, indicating that stretch of apical membrane causes umbrella cell TEV hyperpolarization, TER decrease, Isc increase, and apical membrane exocytosis, while stretch of basolateral membrane causes opposite effects, and this observation can be modeled mathematically. Stretch speed, which {{is defined by the}} filling rate, is further defined to play the key role in modulating the degree and time course of stretched umbrella cell responses, suggesting a mechnosensory function of umbrella cells. Use of channel blockers and openers established that the stretch of apical membrane is likely dependent on cation transport pathway, while stretch of basolateral membrane is dependent on K+ transport at the basolateral surface of the cells, indicating distinctive apical and basolateral <b>membrane</b> <b>requirements</b> for umbrella cell mechanotransduction. These results indicate that mechanotransduction in umbrella cells depends on the sequential activity of its distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains, which act in a collaborative manner to regulate apical membrane dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Boron (B) is {{essential}} for plant cell-wall structure and membrane functions. Compared with its role in cross-linking the pectic domain rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II), little information {{is known about the}} biological role of B in membranes. Here, we investigated the involvement of glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs), major components of lipid rafts, in the <b>membrane</b> <b>requirement</b> for B. Using thin-layer chromatography and mass spectrometry, we first characterized GIPCs from Rosa cell culture. The major GIPC has one hexose residue, one hexuronic acid residue, inositol phosphate, and a ceramide moiety with a C 18 trihydroxylated mono-unsaturated long-chain base and a C 24 monohydroxylated saturated fatty acid. Disrupting B bridging (by B starvation in vivo or by treatment with cold dilute HCl or with excess borate in vitro) enhanced the GIPCs' extractability. As RG-II is the main B-binding site in plants, we investigated whether it could form a B-centred complex with GIPCs. Using high-voltage paper electrophoresis, we showed that addition of GIPCs decreased the electrophoretic mobility of radiolabelled RG-II, suggesting formation of a GIPC-B-RG-II complex. Last, using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we showed that added GIPCs facilitate RG-II dimerization in vitro. We conclude that B plays a structural role in the plasma membrane. The disruption of membrane components by high borate may account for the phytotoxicity of excess B. Moreover, the in-vitro formation of a GIPC-B-RG-II complex gives the first molecular explanation of the wall-membrane attachment sites observed in vivo. Finally, our results suggest a role for GIPCs in the RG-II dimerization process...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{membrane}} technology has attracted vast attention from many scientists and engineers, {{particularly from the}} industrial area. The membrane for gas separation is favoured due to its economically feasibility and high separation performance with respect to gas permeability and selectivity. In this study, the effect of different polymer concentrations (5, 10, 13, 15 and 18 wt%) on the gas permeation properties of CO 2 /CH 4 separation was investigated. Matrimid 5218 {{was chosen as the}} based polymer for tubular carbon membrane preparation owing to its excellent membrane properties (i. e. high mechanical and thermal stability) in order to fulfil the <b>membrane</b> <b>requirement</b> for high gas separation performance. The commercialised tubular membrane was dip-coated into Matrimid/NMP solution and then proceed with carbonisation process at the optimum condition with a heating rate of 2 K/min and under Argon gas flow rate at 200 mL/min at temperature of 1, 123. 15 K by using argon gas. The pure gas permeation tested for both CO 2 and CH 4 was carried out under room temperature at pressure controlled at 800 kPa. From the experimental results, the tubular membrane made of 15 wt % Matrimid performed the highest CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity (87. 34 %) as compared to the other membranes. The excellent performance obtained from the membrane could be attributed by the micropores formation, where the chain of the polymer had increased its packing density. Thus, membrane porosity can be increased by increasing the polymer concentration in the solution...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{hydrophobic}} {{porous polymer}} membranes to vent unwanted gas bubbles from liquid streams {{is becoming increasingly}} more common in portable applications such as direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) and micro-fluidic cooling of electronic circuits. In order for these portable systems {{to keep up with}} the ever increasing demand of the mobile user, it is essential that auxiliary components, like gas-liquid separators (GLS), continue to decrease in weight and size. While there has been significant progress made in the field of membrane-based gas-liquid separation, the ability to miniaturize such devices has not been thoroughly addressed in the available literature. Thus, it was the purpose of this work to shed light on the scope of GLS miniaturization by examining how the amount porous membrane required to completely separate gas bubbles from a liquid stream varies with operating pressure. Two membrane characterization experiments were also employed to determine the permeability, k, and liquid entry pressure (LEP) of the membrane, which provided satisfying results. These parameters were then implemented into a mathematical model for predicting the theoretical membrane area required for a specified two-phase flow, and the results were compared to experimental values. It was shown that the drastically different surface properties of the wetted materials within the GLS device, namely polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and acrylic, caused the actual <b>membrane</b> area <b>requirement</b> to be higher than the theoretical predictions by a constant amount. By analyzing the individual effects of gas and liquid flow, it was also shown that the <b>membrane</b> area <b>requirement</b> increased significantly when the liquid velocity exceeded an amount necessary to cause the flow regime to transition from wedging/slug flow to wavy/semi-annular flow...|$|R
40|$|Increasing carbon {{emissions}} and insecurities in oil supply {{have led to}} heightened interest in hydrogen powered fuel cells. Preferably, the cell runs on hydrogen gas, though due to {{the sensitivity of the}} catalytic components in the fuel cell to carbon monoxide, the hydrogen must be extremely pure (typically < 50 ppm CO). Due to a lack of hydrogen infrastructure, it is envisaged that a medium term solution will be the reforming of more conventional fuels such as gasoline. The gas mixture produced however, contains impurities such as CO, CO 2 and CH 4. Purification may be achieved using palladium membranes, which allow selective permeation of hydrogen. This thesis describes the research carried out in conjunction with Johnson Matthey on thin (typically 7. 5 μm) palladium/silver alloy membranes supported on both ceramic and stainless steel porous tubular substrates. Extensive experimental flow testing has been performed to assess the effect of temperature, feed composition, including wet feeds, and membrane thickness on the hydrogen purification properties. An existing Fortran based model was validated and revised to accurately account for the effects of operating conditions such as temperature and carbon monoxide concentration. This work provided excellent correlation between experimental and simulated results. The validated and improved model was incorporated in the design of a hydrogen refuelling station in Aspen Plus and the palladium <b>membrane</b> <b>requirements</b> assessed to supply 650 fuel cell vehicles per day. The system incorporated a steam reformer, membrane clean-up module, water trap and high pressure compressor for hydrogen storage at 1000 bara. Operating conditions such as system pressure, fuel feed and steam to carbon ratio were investigated and adjusted to optimise the overall system efficiency. An efficiency of 52 % was achieved with a steam to carbon ratio of SCR = 2. 5. A membrane requirement of 6000 standard tubes was found to provide a 90 % hydrogen recovery efficiency. </p...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{has focused}} on the {{membrane}} for the osmotic membrane pressure actuator (OMPA). The OMPA is an autonomous inflow control device for intended use in oil and gas wells. Its function is to prevent water from entering the well from the reservoir. This enables improved production and better reservoir management and also minimizes problems caused by produced water upstream. Extreme conditions of high temperature and pressure exist in the offshore reservoir. A commercial membrane material for the OMPA does not exist and a membrane must therefore be developed with excellent thermal, chemical and mechanical stability. Several other important factors have been identified in this thesis. A literature review was conducted to find suitable membrane materials for the OMPA. This focused on materials with glass transition temperatures of > 200 oC and some ceramic membranes. This list was shortened by cross-referencing with hydrophilic materials and literature regarding osmosis or nanofiltration and the materials. This completed list is presented in this thesis. Three commercially available membranes were received for the experimental. These were partially characterized with thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Successful permeation tests were performed on two of these membranes; RO 98 pHt® polyamide membrane (Alfa Laval) and DuraMem® 150 polyimide membrane (Evonik MET Ltd). Water flux and solute flux and rejection were performed in a reverse osmosis dead end cell at temperatures 23 oC, 50 oC and 70 oC and sodium chloride and sucrose were used as solutes. The RO 98 pHt® showed increased flux and rejection with increasing temperatures. This was attributed to increased solubility and diffusion of the solvent in the membrane at elevated temperatures. The DuraMem® 150 had increased rejection with temperature whilst the flux remained fairly constant. This was attributed to the effects of compaction counteracting the increased solubility and diffusion. Of the solutes, sucrose had the highest rejection because of its larger size. It may therefore be interesting as a draw solution for use in the OMPA. Neither membrane is suitable for direct use with the OMPA. However, the polyimide material in the DuraMem® 150 membrane may be of interest if fabricated with a more desirable morphology. From the theory and discussion presented in the thesis, an updated list of OMPA <b>membrane</b> <b>requirements</b> was constructed with methods in which to attain these requirements. The dependence of several of the requirements upon one another suggests the need for more experimental data at conditions closer to the field conditions. As commercially available membranes are currently non-existent, fabrication of membrane materials is the next step and some necessary starting literature has been provided. Finally, a new forward osmosis/pressure retarded osmosis rig design has been suggested which allows tests to be conducted at reservoir conditions which more closely mimics the intended operation of the OMPA. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{requirement}} of cholesterol for myoblast fusion {{has been linked}} to the primary step in the fusion process, calcium-dependent aggregation (recognition). Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with 25 - hydroxycholesterol or compactin in the absence of exogenous lipid dramatically inhibits calcium-mediated aggregation and concomitant fusion within several hours. Restimulating cholesterol synthesis or supplying exogenous cholesterol rapidly restores aggregation activity. Over this time period, however, the sterol:phospholipid ratio is unaltered, suggesting a local rather than a general <b>membrane</b> cholesterol <b>requirement</b> for the expression of aggregation activity. The aggregation response to a change in sterol availability occurs on a shorter time scale than that required to inhibit the synthesis of the protein(s) with aggregation activity; thus, the cholesterol-requiring step is posttranslational.

In contrast to the wild-type, the mutant was unable to grow with myo-inositol as the sole energy source and did not show any myo-inositol dehydrogenase activity in vitro, indicating that GOX 1857 encodes an inositol dehydrogenase. The association of inositol dehydrogenase with the <b>membrane</b> and the <b>requirement</b> for the cofactor PQQ were confirmed. Inositol dehydrogenase exhibited optimal activity at pH 8. 75. As indicated by cultivation on different substrates, inositol dehydrogenase was repressed by D-glucose...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-stage}} membrane {{process is}} designed for CO 2 capture from coal-fired power plants. Vacuum operation on the permeate side of the membrane is the preferred option to reduce the power demand for compressing the huge feed volume. The energy recovered from the CO 2 -depleted emission stream and the energy consumed for post-capture CO 2 liquefaction are considered in this simulation study. A numerical modeling of the membrane process and a brief description on assessing both the capital and operating costs of the process are provided. It is found that the <b>membrane</b> area <b>requirement</b> is dominated by recovery of the lower concentrations of CO 2 in the tail portion of the flue gas stream. Process optimizations allowing the minimal CO 2 capture cost or minimal power demand indicate that current membrane technology is promising for flue gas CO 2 capture, assuming a permeance of 1000 GPU and CO 2 /N 2 selectivity of 30. The potential of membrane technology for CO 2 capture was also explored by using membranes with a CO 2 /N 2 selectivity of 50 and 200. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Natural Killer (NK) {{cells and}} Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTL) {{are critical for}} the immune response against virus infections or transformed cells. They kill target cells via polarized exocytosis of lytic proteins from secretory lysosomes (SL). Rab 27 a and munc 13 - 4 interact directly and are required for target cell killing. How they cooperate in the intricate degranulation process is not known. We identified critical residues in munc 13 - 4 for rab 27 interaction and tested binding mutants in several complementation assays. In a rat mast cell line we replaced endogenous munc 13 - 4 with ectopically expressed munc 13 - 4 constructs. Unlike wild type munc 13 - 4, binding mutants fail to rescue β-hexosaminidase secretion. In accord, expression of binding mutants in CTL of Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis type 3 patients, does not rescue CD 107 appearance on the plasma membrane. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) imaging shows that munc 13 - 4 *rab 27 a restricts motility of SL in the subapical cytoplasm. We propose that rab 27 *munc 13 - 4 tethers SL to the plasma <b>membrane,</b> a <b>requirement</b> for formation of a cognate SNARE complex for fusion...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{data in the}} {{literature}} have indicated that phytochrome could alter the rate of reduction of exogenously added NADP by a pea mitochondrial preparation in vitro. These results could not be duplicated using a mitochondrial preparation isolated from etiolated oat seedlings. Further experimentation demonstrated that the addition of Pr to the preparation, in combination with a far red light illumination, could significantly reduce the rate of oxidation of NADH by the external dehydrogenases of oat mitochondria. This response was characterized by a 15 % decrease in reaction velocity at saturating substrate concentrations and a 2 -fold increase in apparent Km as compared to values obtained after Pfr plus red light treatment. The response was photoreversible, the rate of oxidation of exogenous NADH being determined by the last light illumination given to the mitochondrial preparation. The interaction between phytochrome and the mitochondria was apparently occurring {{at the level of}} the inner mitochondrial <b>membrane.</b> A <b>requirement</b> for these results was that the mitochondria be isolated from plants that were illuminated with white or red light before extraction; mitochondria from unirradiated plants showed no dehydrogenase response to treatments with phytochrome plus actinic light...|$|R
