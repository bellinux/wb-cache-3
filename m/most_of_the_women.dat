However, Kinsey's methodology was criticized.|$|E

5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed from <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> on the Revising Committee in {{that she did not}} feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|The {{early stages}} of the {{organization}} were characterized by a focus on Marxist–Leninist ideology. The CPC viewed the women’s movement {{as a part of the}} larger Chinese revolution against the feudal past, but some leaders in the CPC argued that because <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> continued to do domestic work, and did not actively participate in the revolution, this contradicted the Marxist–Leninist ideology. The ACWF contested this assertion, stating that the economic conditions were not at the point where jobs could be provided to all women. Therefore, housekeepers, wives and mothers who were dedicated to their work could indeed be seen as contributing to socialism.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and {{children}} had {{gathered in the}} sacristy of the church. As Mexican soldiers entered the room, a boy, {{thought to be the}} son of defender Anthony Wolf, stood up to rearrange a blanket around his shoulders. Mistaking him for a Texian soldier, the Mexican soldiers bayoneted him. In the confusion, {{at least one of the}} women was lightly wounded. Bowie's family, including Gertrudis Navarro, Juana Navarro Alsbury and her son, were hiding in one of the rooms along the west wall. Navarro opened the door to their room to signal that they meant no harm. A Mexican officer soon arrived and led the women to a spot along one of the walls where they would be relatively safe. All of the women {{and children}} were eventually placed under the protection of an officer and escorted out of the Alamo and imprisoned in the home of the Musquiz family.|$|E

5|$|The Natchez revolt, or the Natchez Massacre, was {{an attack}} by the Natchez people on French colonists near present-day Natchez, Mississippi, on November29, 1729. The Natchez and French had lived {{alongside}} {{each other in the}} Louisiana colony {{for more than a decade}} prior to the incident, mostly conducting peaceful trade and occasionally intermarrying. After a period of deteriorating relations, however, Natchez leaders were provoked to revolt when the French colonial commandant, Sieur de Chépart, demanded land from a Natchez village for his own plantation near Fort Rosalie. They plotted their attack over several days and managed to conceal their plans from most of the French; those who overheard and warned Chépart of an attack were considered untruthful and were punished. In a coordinated attack on the fort and the homesteads, the Natchez killed almost all of the Frenchmen, while sparing <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and African slaves. Approximately 230 colonists were killed overall, and the fort and homes were burned to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{of birth control}} was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize contraception began. Longstanding techniques included the rhythm method, withdrawal, diaphragms, contraceptive sponges, condoms, prolonged breastfeeding, and spermicides. Use of contraceptives increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the fertility rate in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions. The only known survey conducted {{during the nineteenth century}} of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by Clelia Mosher from 1892 to 1912. The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> used contraception (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, condoms and pessaries) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.Engelman, pp. 11–12.|$|E

25|$|The usual breast {{augmentation}} {{patient is}} a young woman whose personality profile indicates psychological distress about her personal appearance and her body (self image), {{and a history of}} having endured criticism (teasing) about the aesthetics of her person. The studies Body Image Concerns of Breast Augmentation Patients (2003) and Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Cosmetic Surgery (2006) reported that the woman who underwent breast augmentation surgery also had undergone psychotherapy, suffered low self-esteem, presented frequent occurrences of psychological depression, had attempted suicide, and suffered body dysmorphiaa type of mental illness wherein she perceives non-existent physical defects. Post-operative patient surveys about the mental health and {{the quality of life of}} the women, reported improved physical health, physical appearance, social life, self-confidence, self-esteem, and satisfactory sexual functioning. Furthermore, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> reported long-term satisfaction with their breast implants; some despite having suffered medical complications that required surgical revision, either corrective or aesthetic. Likewise, in Denmark, 8.0 per cent of breast augmentation patients had a pre-operative history of psychiatric hospitalization.|$|E
25|$|In late 1933, Gold {{served a}} brief prison {{sentence}} {{after having been}} arrested for participating in a hunger march in Wilmington, Delaware. Hunger marches had been occurring throughout the United States since 1931. Catholic social activist Dorothy Day herself encouraged Gold {{to participate in a}} march from New York City to Washington, D.C. Gold was one of 315 marchers who left New York City on November 29, 1932, bound for Washington. The marchers reached Wilmington on December 2, their number having increased by several hundred. Their permit to march in the city was withdrawn. That night, the police herded most of the marchers into a warehouse downtown, but Gold, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and most of the marchers from New England stayed in a rented church two blocks away. That night, the marchers at the church were refused permission to hold a meeting in the street, so they held it on the church steps. When the police tried to stop the meeting, the marchers resisted. The police began beating the people listening to the speaker, and the marchers fled into the church and barricaded the doors. The police fired tear gas through the windows of the building, then broke down the doors and entered the building with weapons drawn. The marchers resisted by hurling chairs at the police, but were beaten and gassed repeatedly until subdued. Twenty-three marchers, including Gold, were arrested. Four police and three marchers were hospitalized. Gold was convicted of incitement to riot, and served a brief prison term in Wilmington in late 1933 and early 1934. Gold participated in additional hunger marches in 1933 and 1934, and was arrested again in Albany, New York, in late October 1934.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempted}} to draw <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Filipino <b>woman</b> as depicted by female protagonists in selected short stories in English (1925 - 1986) written by Filipino <b>woman</b> authors.

What are their virtues, vices, passions, and struggles?; and (2) What roles do these female protagonists play in the Philippine society? A virtue displayed by the most female characters is having a sense <b>of</b> responsibility. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> characters are passionate in preserving their relationship with their loved ones or keeping the peace among the family members. <b>The</b> Filipino <b>woman,</b> in <b>the</b> short stories, has projected varied images which could be categorized as martyr, social victim, homemaker, mother, and fighter. <b>The</b> Filipino <b>woman</b> is a product of her time and milieu – heterogeneous in looks, psyche, and roles in the society...|$|R

[...] Kurtzman blends the verbal and visual aspects of the work—for example, when an enraged Goodman Beaver confronts his diminutive boss Mr. Schlock, Goodman is graphically overwhelmed by Schlock's word balloons, which demonstrates Goodman's helpless subservience and Schlock's effortless psychological dominance over his employees.|$|E
