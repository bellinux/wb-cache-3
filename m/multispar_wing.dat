40|$|Radiant heating {{experiments}} were {{performed in the}} laboratory on an instrumented <b>multispar</b> <b>wing</b> structure to investigate (1) how accurately the structural temperatures of a Mach 3 cruise-flight profile could be simulated, (2) what {{the effects of the}} heating and heating inaccuracies would be on the responses of strain-gage bridges installed on the structure, and (3) how these responses would affect flight loads measurements. Test temperatures throughout the structure agreed well with temperatures calculated for a Mach 3 profile. In addition, temperatures produced by two identical tests were repeatable to less than ± 6 K⁰ (± 10 F⁰). Thermally induced strain-gage-bridge responses were large enough to be detrimental to a high-speed flight loads program with a goal of establishing aerodynamic loads (exclusive of thermal loads). It was shown that heating simulation can be used effectively for thermal calibration (that is, to provide corrections for a high-temperature environment), and that thermal calibration may not be needed if the simulation data are used to carefully select bridges and load equations.

40|$|Abstract: The {{potential}} advantages of an airliner composite wing are investigated by consid-ering a multispar configuration. An efficient initial sizing methodology, suitable for large-scale composite components, {{such as the}} studied aircraft main wing, is applied for the preliminary design of a <b>multispar</b> <b>wing.</b> The methodology comprises three basic modules, i. e. the compu-tational stress analysis of the structure, the comparison of the stress–strain results to design allowable, and a suitable resizing procedure {{in order to satisfy}} all design requirements. A detailed comparison between optimized designs of conventional (2 -spar) and three alterna-tive wing configurations, which comprise 4 -, 5 -, and 6 -spars for the wing construction is per-formed. In order to understand the effect of different material properties, as well as the variation of maximum strain level allowed the total wing mass, parametric analyses are per-formed for all configurations considered. Comparing the conventional and the multispar arrangements, it arises that under certain conditions, the multispar configuration demonstrates significant advantages over the conventional design. In addition, for all the configurations investigated, i. e. the 2 -, 4 -, 5 - and 6 -spar designs, the mass breakdown in the wing subcompo-nents is presented, such that the maximum mass saving potentials are identified for each multispar configuration...|$|E
40|$|A stress {{analysis}} software based on MATLAB, Graphic user interface (GUI) has been developed. The developed software {{can be used}} to estimate load on a wing and to compute the stresses at any point along the span of the wing of a given aircraft. The generalized formulation allows performing {{stress analysis}} even for a <b>multispar</b> (multicell) <b>wing.</b> The software {{is expected to be a}} useful tool for effective teaching learning process of courses on aircraft structures and aircraft structural design...|$|R
40|$|A free-flight {{investigation}} {{has been made}} to determine some effects of aerodynamic heating on the structural behavior of a wing at supersonic speeds. The test wing was a thin, unswept, untapered, <b>multispar,</b> aluminum-alloy <b>wing</b> having a 20 -inch chord, a 20 -inch exposed semispan, and a circular-arc airfoil section with a thickness ratio of 5 percent. The wing was tested on a model propelled by a two-stage rocket-propulsion system to a Mach number of 2. 22 and a corresponding Reynolds number per foot of 13. 2 x 10 (6) Reasonably good agreement was obtained between Stanton numbers obtained from measured temperature-time data and values obtained by the theory of Van Driest for flat plates having turbulent boundary layers. Temperature measurements made in the skin of the wing and in the internal structures agreed well with calculated values. The wing was instrumented to detect any apparent fluttering motion in the wing, but no evidence of flutter was observed throughout the flight...|$|R
40|$|An unstiffened panel {{buckling}} constraint for balanced, symmetric laminated composites {{is included}} on the global design level in a mathematical programming structural optimization procedure for designing wing structures. Constraints are introduced by penalty functions, and Newton's method based on approximate second derivatives of the penalty terms is used as the search algorithm to obtain minimum-mass designs. Constraint approximations used during the optimization process contribute to the computational efficiency of the procedure. A criterion is developed that identifies the appropriate conservative form of the constraint approximations that are used with the optimization procedure. Minimum-mass design results are obtained for a <b>multispar</b> high-aspect-ratio <b>wing</b> subjected to material strength, minimum-gage, displacement, panel buckling and twist constraints. The material systems considered for the examples are all graphite-epoxy, graphite-epoxy with boron-epoxy spar caps, and all aluminum. The composite material designs are shown to have an advantage over the aluminum designs since they can often satisfy additional constraints with only small mass increases...|$|R
