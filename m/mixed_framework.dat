40|$|Recently, a tetraquark <b>mixing</b> <b>framework</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} for light mesons and applied more or less successfully to the isovector resonances, $a_ 0 (980), a_ 0 (1450) $, {{as well as to}} the isodoublet resonances, $K^*_ 0 (800), K^*_ 0 (1430) $. In this work, we present a more extensive view on the <b>mixing</b> <b>framework</b> and extend this to the isoscalar resonances, $f_ 0 (500) $, $f_ 0 (980) $, $f_ 0 (1370) $, $f_ 0 (1500) $. Tetraquarks in this framework can have two spin configurations containing either spin- 0 diquark or spin- 1 diquark and each configuration forms a nonet in flavor space. The two spin configurations are found to mix strongly through the color-spin interactions. Their mixtures, which diagonalize the hyperfine masses, can generate the physical resonances constituting the two nonets, which, in fact, coincide roughly with the experimental observation. We identify that $f_ 0 (500) $, $f_ 0 (980) $ are the isoscalar members in the light nonet, and $f_ 0 (1370) $, $f_ 0 (1500) $ are the similar members in the heavy nonet. This means that the spin configuration mixing, as it relates the corresponding members in the two nonets, can generate $f_ 0 (500), f_ 0 (1370) $ among the members in light mass, and $f_ 0 (980), f_ 0 (1500) $ in heavy mass. The complication arises because the isoscalar members of each nonet are subject to an additional flavor mixing known as OZI rule so that $f_ 0 (500), f_ 0 (980) $, and similarly $f_ 0 (1370), f_ 0 (1500) $, are the mixture of two isoscalar members belonging to an octet and a singlet in SU$_f$(3).

The framework (G,p) is globally rigid if every framework (G,q) in which the direction or length between the end vertices of corresponding edges {{is the same as}} in (G,p), can be obtained from (G,p) by a translation and, possibly, a dilation by − 1. We characterize the globally rigid generic mixed frameworks (G,p) for which the edge set of G is a circuit in the associated direction–length rigidity matroid. We show that such a framework is globally rigid if and only if each 2 -separation S of G is ‘direction balanced’, i. e. each ‘side’ of S contains a direction edge. Our result is based on a new inductive construction for the family of edge-labeled graphs which satisfy these hypotheses.

40|$|Many {{problems}} in geometric modeling {{can be described}} using variational formulations that define the smoothness of the shape and its behavior w. r. t. the posed modeling constraints. For example, high-quality C 2 surfaces that obey boundary conditions on positions, tangents and curvatures can be conveniently defined as solutions of high-order geometric PDEs; the advantage of such a formulation is its conceptual representation-independence. In practice, solving high-order problems efficiently and accurately for surfaces approximated by meshes is notoriously difficult. For modeling applications, the preferred approach is to use discrete geometric schemes which are efficient and robust, but their convergence properties are less well understood compared to higher-order FEM. In this paper, we explore discretizations of common geometric PDEs on meshes using mixed finite elements, where additional variables for the derivatives in the problem are introduced. Such formulations use first-order derivatives only, allowing a discretization with simple linear elements. Various boundary conditions can be naturally discretized in this setting. We formalize continuous region constraints commonly used in modeling applications, and show that these seamlessly fit into the <b>mixed</b> <b>framework.</b> We demonstrate {{that some of the}} commonly used discrete geometric discretizations can be regarded as a particular case of mixed finite elements.

40|$|An {{alternative}} formulation for the eigenvalue optimization {{of structures}} made of rubber- like material is presented. The proposed methodology adopts the truly-mixed variational formulation that descends from {{the principle of}} Hellinger-Reissner. This formulation has regular stresses as main variables and discontinues displacements that {{play the role of}} lagrangian multipliers. The use of this discretization passes the inf-sup condition [1] even for incompressible materials and therefore allows to overcome the arising of the locking phenomenon, difficulty often found handling rubber material in displacement-based finite element contexts. The approach presented in the work consists in the adoption of a mixed-FEM bidimensional discretization that uses the composite element of Johnson and Mercier [2] as to the discretization of the stress field. Also this discrete formulation, as the continuous one, meets automatically the Babuska-Brezzi conditions of the problem even in presence of incompressible materials. Within this <b>mixed</b> <b>framework,</b> the work addresses classical eigenvalue optimization problems, with the aim of maximizing the first eigenfrequency or a weighted sum of the first eigenvalues, given the domain and a volume constraint [7], [3].

40|$|International audienceThe {{paper is}} {{focussed}} on the robustness of parallel computation {{in the case}} of buckling and post-buckling analyses. In the nonlinear context, domain decomposition methods are mainly used as a solver for the tangent problem solved at each iteration of a NewtonâRaphson algorithm. In case of strongly nonlinear and heterogeneous problems as those encountered in buckling and post-buckling, this procedure may lead to severe difficulties regarding convergence and efficiency. The problem of convergence is regarded as the most critical issue at the industrial level. Indeed if a method, which can show efficiency for some problems, is not robust with respect to convergence the method will not be implemented by industrial end-users. Therefore, two paths are explored to gain robustness when making use of domain decomposition methods: (1) a nonlinear localization strategy which may also improve the robustness by treating the nonlinearity at the subdomain level; and (2) a <b>mixed</b> <b>framework</b> allowing to circumvent the problem of local divergence (i. e. at the subdomain level).

40|$|AbstractA widely {{accepted}} rational behavior for non-cooperative players {{is based on}} the notion of Nash equilibrium. Although the existence of a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed in the <b>mixed</b> <b>framework</b> (i. e., when players select their actions in a randomized manner) in many real-world applications the existence of “any” equilibrium is not enough. Rather, it is often desirable to single out equilibria satisfying some additional requirements (in order, for instance, to guarantee a minimum payoff to certain players), which we call constrained Nash equilibria. In this paper, a formal framework for specifying these kinds of requirement is introduced and investigated in the context of graphical games, where a player p may directly be interested in some of the other players only, called the neighbors of p. This setting is very useful for modeling large population games, where typically each player does not directly depend on all the players, and representing her utility function extensively is either inconvenient or infeasible. Based on this framework, the complexity of deciding the existence and of computing constrained equilibria is then investigated, in the light of evidencing how the intrinsic difficulty of these tasks is affected by the requirements prescribed at the equilibrium and by the structure of players’ interactions. The analysis is carried out for the setting of mixed strategies {{as well as for the}} setting of pure strategies, i. e., when players are forced to deterministically choose the action to perform. In particular, for this latter case, restrictions on players’ interactions and on constraints are identified, that make the computation of Nash equilibria an easy problem, for which polynomial and highly-parallelizable algorithms are presented...|$|E
