She said that fans could expect an [...] "edgy sound with lots of strong powerful anthems. Big up tempos, R and Pop at [...] best and two big ballads".|$|E

40|$|Against a {{backdrop}} of concern about the natural environment and renewed worrying over world energy supply, governments {{around the world are}} diverting resources into investment into biofuels as a source of energy. This has potential implications for the Australian economy and the agricultural economy, and beyond. Investment commits capital now to reap rewards in the future. The future awaiting the invested capital cannot be known. Some of the possible futures awaiting invested capital can be imagined. When imagining the future it is helpful to draw on what is known. Theory and principles explaining the behaviour of what is known are a help also. The causes and effects that derive from established theory about how parts of the world work represent the best explanation we have at this time – with good research and tough testing, new knowledge is established and theory evolves. This approach is better than <b>making</b> up <b>your</b> <b>own</b> theories about science or economics, based on some particular set of personal experience, or simply seeing phenomena through the prism of private interest. Such approaches are no less fraught for being increasingly common approaches. In the following discussion, principles of economics are applied to questions about the implications of investing public and private resources in biofuel production in Australia...|$|R

5000|$|From {{a secular}} viewpoint, demonization {{can be used}} to denigrate an opposed {{individual}} or group, <b>making</b> adherents to <b>your</b> <b>own</b> religion or viewpoint less inclined to do business with them (and possibly convert) and more inclined to fight against them. If foreigners are evil and corrupted by demonic influence, then any means of self-defense is easily portrayed as legitimate. The portrayal of almost all pagans in the Middle East as Baal-worshippers in the Hebrew Bible is an example of this. If pagans are corrupted by the demon-"god" [...] Baal, then clearly they must be fought or at least oppressed. Especially in the earlier books of the Hebrew Bible, foreign deities are portrayed as existing and corrupting entities rather than being mere powerless idols. Some would argue this later transferred to Christianity after Constantine I's ascension in its suppression of Roman paganism. Much later, the language of demonization would be invoked during the Spanish Inquisition, leading to the expulsion of Jews and Moriscos from Spain.|$|R
