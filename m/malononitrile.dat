2500|$|Kitagawa and {{co-workers}} have reported {{the synthesis of}} a catalytic MOF having the formula [...] The MOF is three-dimensional, consisting of an identical catenated pair of networks, yet still featuring pores of molecular dimensions. The nodes consist of single cadmium ions, octahedrally ligated by pyridyl nitrogens. From a catalysis standpoint, however, the most interesting feature of this material {{is the presence of}} guest-accessible amide functionalities. The researchers showed that the amides are capable of base-catalyzing the Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with <b>malononitrile.</b> Reactions with larger nitriles, however, are only marginally accelerated, implying that catalysis takes place chiefly within the material’s channels rather than on its exterior. A noteworthy finding is the lack of catalysis by the free strut in homogeneous solution, evidently due to intermolecular H-bonding between bptda molecules. Thus, the MOF architecture elicits catalytic activity not otherwise encountered.|$|E

The alkylidene <b>malononitriles</b> 1 were obtained by the Knoevenagel reaction of ketones with <b>malononitriles.</b> Vilsmeier-Haack reaction allowed direct access to 2 -chloro- 3 -cyanopyridines 2. Those products, by refluxing with hydrazine hydrate, allowed cyclization to amino-pyrazolopyridines 3 a-g, which were not previously described in the literature. Bioactivity results indicated that amino-pyrazolopyridines 3 a, 3 b and 3 g induced apoptotic cell death in K 562 cancer cells with an IC 50 of 36. 5 +/- 3. 9 mu M, 27. 6 +/- 4. 5 mu M and 35. 0 +/- 2. 3 mu M, respectively, after 72 h.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to develop a {{quantitative}} ligand-binding model for the receptor tyrosine kinases, a pharmacophore search was first used to identify structural features that are common in two novel sets of 12 molecules of the 3 -substituted indolin- 2 -ones and 19 compounds of the benzylidene <b>malononitriles</b> with low-to-high affinity for HER 2, a kind of receptor tyrosine kinase. The common pharmacophore model based on these 31 compounds {{was used as a}} template to obtain the aligned molecular aggregate, which provided a good starting point for 3 D-QSAR analysis of only the 19 benzylidene <b>malononitriles.</b> Two molecular field analysis (MFA) techniques, including CoMFA and CoMSIA, were used to derive the quantitative structure-activity relationships of the studied molecules. From the studied results, it was obvious that the 3 D-QSAR models based on the pharmacophore alignment were superior to those based on the simple atom-by-atom fits. Considering the flexibility of the studied molecules and the difference between the active conformers and the energy-lowest conformers, the pharmacophore model can usually provide the common features for the flexible regions. Moreover, the best CoMSIA model based on the pharmacophore hypothesis gave good statistical measure from partial least-squares analysis (PLS) (q 2) 0. 71), which was slightly better than the CoMFA one. Our study demonstrated that pharmacophore modeling and CoMSIA research could be effectively combined.

Alternatively, modifying the standard amine catalysis by adding a suitable chemical stimulus (p -nitrophenol cocatalyst) switched the reactivity decidedly toward a domino [4 + 2] cycloaddition to afford γ ′,δ-bonded bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane carbaldehydes 8. Products invariably formed in good yields, with rigorous chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantiocontrol.

40|$|The nitrilase {{superfamily}} is a {{large and}} diverse superfamily of enzymes that catalyse the cleavage of various types of carbon-nitrogen bonds using a Cys-Glu-Lys catalytic triad. Thermoactive nitrilase from Pyrococcus abyssi (PaNit) hydrolyses small aliphatic nitriles like fumaro- and malononitryl. Yet, the biological role of this enzyme is unknown.

The spread of strains of drug-resistant these pathogens has encouraged researchers {{to identify and}} use novel antibacterial compounds. In this research project, we studied antibacterial effects of some newly synthesized thiazole, imidazolidine and tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives against B. cereus and S. typhimurium. Methods: 2 -(E) -Cyano(thiazolidin- 2 -ylidene) thiazoles 1 - 4 and (imidazolidin or tetrahydropyrimidin- 2 -ylidene) <b>malononitriles</b> 5 - 11 were synthesized. Then, the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods were applied to evaluate antibacterial effects. Results were recorded as the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the growth inhibition zone diameters. Results: The in vitro assessment of antibacterial effects showed that only thiazole derivative 4 had considerable inhibitory effects against B. cereus and S. Typhimurium, whereas the others didn't have so. The inhibitory effects of thiazole derivative 4 against B. cereus and S. typhimurium were proven according to the MICs 125 and 500 µg/mL and the growth inhibition zone diameters 19. 2 ± 0. 1 and 8. 4 ± 0. 2 mm, respectively. Conclusion: The antibacterial effects of thiazole, imidazolidine and tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives were different, these effects were observed only in thiazole derivative 4.
