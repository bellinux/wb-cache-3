2500|$|The {{regulations}} for composting toilets {{and other forms}} of dry toilets in Germany {{vary from state to state}} and from one application to another (e.g. use in allotment gardens or use in family homes and settlements). In the different states of Germany, it is the [...] "Landesbauordnung" [...] (translates to [...] "state civil engineering regulations") [...] of the respective state that regulates the use of such alternative toilets. Most of them stipulate the use of flush toilets, however there are many exceptions, for example in the states of Hamburg, Lower Saxony, Bavaria, <b>Mecklenburg-Western</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. These generally make exceptions for the use of composting toilets in homes provided that there are no concerns for public health.|$|E
