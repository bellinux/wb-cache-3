40|$|Bottom ash is {{produced}} by the incineration of household waste. Waste regulations mandate that re-use of this residue be given priority. The goal of the investigations was to devine and test the process conditions of an integrated wet chemical treatment of bottom ashes in a bottom <b>ash</b> <b>discharger.</b> This should lead to an improved quality of bottom ashes. Easily soluble pollutants and fine particles should be removed by a washing process, and heavy metals of environmental significance should be stabilized {{by the addition of}} gaseous carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid in one and the same process. To achieve the above objectives, dry raw bottom ashes were removed continuously from three incineration plants, sieved into grain fractions and conditioned. Laboratory experiments were carried out in a glass reactor and a heating water reactor. Pilot-scale experiments were performed in a bottom <b>ash</b> <b>discharger.</b> Each type of treated and untreated bottom ash was characterized according to environmental and technical construction material criteria. Results indicated that easily soluble salts and fine particles were removed by the washing of bottom ash. In laboratory experiments, the concentrations of heavy metals in leachates after treatment could be lowered significantly by the addition of gaseous carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid. However, in pilot-scale experiments the concentrations of carbon dioxide or phosphoric acid in the process fluids were too low, and hence the expected stabilization of heavy metals was not achieved. The chemical reactions of the additives mostly happen in the washing solution. Stabilization can be reached only with a large amount of additives. In the case of phosphoric acid this would constitute a great expenditure of chemicals associated with a decrease in acid neutralization capacity of the bottom ash. After wet chemical treatment all bottom ashes exhibited a significant improvement of technical construction material characteristics. This procedure may be applied without incurring substantial investment costs by retrofitting existing incineration plants to allow on-site washing of bottom ash. In addition the carbon dioxide from the cleaned flue gas can be used to accelerate the aging processes. A stabilization of heavy metals is possible mostly by changing the pH value in the leachates of the treated bottom ashes. The washing solutions could then be used in the washer system of the flue gas cleaning facility. (orig.)

The lungs were then lavaged, and mRNA was extracted from alveolar macrophages and assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the lavage fluid, no change in cellularity or increase in the content of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α was detected. However, at 1 h following exposure, 80 % of macrophages were seen to have phagocytosed the volcanic ash. This percentage was unchanged at 24 h after exposure. Profilin mRNA content of the macrophages was elevated, and c-jun mRNA was expressed.

The potential environmental contamination from the storage of coal ash has been highlighted in recent years by large spills from power plant retention ponds in Tennessee and North Carolina. These incidents, as well as permitted coal <b>ash</b> leachate <b>discharge,</b> make it important to understand the influences of coal ash on the ecology and biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems. Wetland ecosystems are particularly of interest, as they serve as reservoirs and transformers of pollutants in the landscape, and constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTS) have been used in the past to treat coal combustion waste. Emergent macrophytes play a pivotal role in CWTS and are often a defining feature of natural wetland habitats that can contribute to the removal of pollutants from the water column through a range of biological and chemical processes. This study explored the explored the effects of two emergent macrophyte species, Juncus effusus and Eliocharis quadrangulata, on the physicochemical properties and trace element concentrations of water contaminated with coal ash. 	A greenhouse study was performed with wetland microcosms dosed with leachates of fly ash derived from high sulfur and low sulfur coal sources. Microcosms were planted with J. effusus, E. quadrangulata or were unplanted to control for the presence of plants. Both types of leachate increased the electric conductivity (Ec) of microcosm water relative to controls received reverse osmosis water. High sulfur leachates increased water pH while low sulfur leachates decreased water pH. Both leachates significantly elevated boron and lithium concentrations in microcosm water and high sulfur leachates also elevated molybdenum significantly. The highest boron concentrations measured in the study exceeded several aquatic toxicity thresholds. 	The macrophytes did not display any signs of toxicity, but did appear to exert an influence on the water chemistry. The presence of either species reduced the Ec of microcosm water significantly more than when plants were not presence. Both species also appeared to increase the removal efficiency of trace elements from the water column compared to microcosms with no macrophytes. 	The findings {{of this study indicate that}} emergent macrophytes are tolerant to aquatic coal ash pollution and could potentially reduce associated perturbations in water quality. Their presence in aquatic ecosystems downstream from coal <b>ash</b> <b>discharges</b> could help maintain ecosystem integrity or they may be effectively utilized in CWTS for coal power plant wastewater.

To this end we characterize Yasur's surface activity in terms of material movement, temperature and excess pressure. The joint temporal trend in these data reveals smooth variations of surface activity and regime-like persistence of individual explosion forms over days. Analysis of all data types shows ash-free and ash-rich explosive styles similar to those found at Stromboli volcano. During ash-free activity low echo powers, high explosion velocities and high temperatures result from the movement of isolated hot ballistic clasts. In contrast, ash-rich episodes exhibit high echo powers, low explosion velocities and low temperatures linked to the presence of colder ash-rich plumes. Furthermore ash-free explosions cause high excess pressure signals exhibiting high frequencies opposed to low-amplitude, low-frequency signals accompanying ash-rich activity. To corroborate these findings we compare fifteen representative explosions of each explosive episode. Explosion onset velocities derived from Doppler radar and infrared camera data are in excellent agreement and consistent with overall observations in each regime. Examination of infrasound recordings likewise confirms our observations, although a weak coupling between explosion velocity and excess pressure indicates changes in wave propagation. The overall trend in explosion velocity and excess pressure however demonstrates a general correlation between explosive style and explosion intensity, and points to stability of the uppermost conduit on timescales shorter than at Stromboli volcano...|$|R

According {{to the principles of}} sustainability, several restrictions have been imposed on the conventional methods currently adopted for its disposal. The consequent need to develop alternative processes for the use of sewage sludge for energy purposes such as gasification requires experimental tests in order to quantify the potential energy recover from this waste, as well as to evaluate the optimum conditions for its gasification. In the present study, the gasification with air of dehydrated sewage sludge (20 wt. % moisture) mixed with conventional woody biomass was performed in a pilot scale updraft fixed-bed gasifier operating at atmospheric pressure. Attention was focused on the effect of the sewage sludge content and the equivalent ratio (ratio between the amount of air used and the stoichiometric air needed for combustion) on the product yields, gas composition and cold gas efficiency. The results obtained showed {{that it is possible to}} cogasify sewage sludge with wood pellets in pre-existing updraft fixed-bed gasification installations. However, at high sewage sludge content (P 70 w/w%) slagging and an excessive clinker formation may occur in the oxidation zone because of the high ash content and low ash fusion temperatures of the sludge making the gasification process unstable. In addition, the formation of an ash layer on the grate requires persistent <b>ash</b> <b>discharge</b> that introduces instabilities in the gasifier operating conditions. The rise in the equivalent ratio led to higher gas and carbon yields and cold gas efficiencies. At the optimal equivalent ratio of 0. 25, compared with wood pellets gasification, the addition of sewage sludge with 20 wt. % moisture up to 70 w/w% gave rise to decreasing the dry gas yield from 1. 56 to 1. 07 Nm 3 /kg of feedstock due to the higher moisture and ash content of sewage sludge and to moderate reductions of the gas lower heating value and cold gas efficiency from 5. 8 to 4. 9 MJ/Nm 3 dry and from 60 % to 55 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Depending on the {{magnitude}} of their eruptions, volcanoes impact the atmosphere at various temporal and spatial scales. The volcanic source remains a major unknown to rigorously assess these impacts. At the scale of an eruption, the limited knowledge of source parameters, including time variations of erupted mass flux and emission profile, currently represents the greatest issue that limits the reliability of volcanic cloud forecasts. Today, {{a growing number of}} satellite and remote sensing observations of distant plumes are becoming available, bringing indirect information on these source terms. Here, we develop an inverse modelling approach combining satellite observations of the volcanic plume with an Eulerian regional chemistry-transport model (CHIMERE) to characterise the volcanic SO 2 emissions during an eruptive crisis. The May 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull is a perfect case study to apply this method as the volcano emitted substantial amounts of SO 2 during more than a month. We take advantage of the SO 2 column amounts provided by a vast set of IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) satellite images to reconstruct retrospectively the time series of the mid-tropospheric SO 2 flux emitted by the volcano with a temporal resolution of ~ 2 h, spanning the period from 1 to 12 May 2010. We show that no a priori knowledge on the SO 2 flux is required for this reconstruction. The initialisation of chemistry-transport modelling with this reconstructed source allows for reliable simulation of the evolution of the long-lived tropospheric SO 2 cloud over thousands of kilometres. Heterogeneities within the plume, which mainly result from the temporal variability of the emissions, are correctly tracked over a timescale of a week. The robustness of our approach is also demonstrated by the broad similarities between the SO 2 flux history determined by this study and the <b>ash</b> <b>discharge</b> behaviour estimated by other means during the phases of high explosive activity at Eyjafjallajökull in May 2010. Finally, we show how a sequential IASI data assimilation allows for a substantial improvement in the forecasts of the location and concentration of the plume compared to an approach assuming constant flux at the source. As the SO 2 flux is an important indicator of the volcanic activity, this approach is also of interest to monitor poorly instrumented volcanoes from space...|$|R

Wooden construction typically involved several different types of timber, with careful use of different woods according to their <b>mechanical</b> properties; <b>ash</b> and spruce were the most commonly used, although hickory, mahogany and poplar were among the other timbers employed. Struts were frequently hollow members formed by spindling out two pieces of wood and then glueing them together, usually using a tongue in groove joint to strengthen the joint. Wing spars were also often composite members, and the wing ribs were complex structures. When flying replicas of the 1910 Bristol Boxkite were made for the 1966 film Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, a modern stress analysis was performed, {{and concluded that the}} airframe was close to conforming to modern requirements.|$|R

Energetic and metallurgic wastes {{are widely}} used as Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCM) and {{aggregates}} {{in order to reduce}} the concrete price and/or enhance its durability and <b>mechanical</b> properties. <b>Ashes</b> generated in process of Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) feature certain similarity with conventional SCMs and thus there is a potential to utilize MSWI ashes as concrete admixtures. Unfortunately high variety of MSWI ashes is observed as consequence of differences in incinerated waste composition and also variability of applied combustion and air pollution control technology. Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the applicability of MSWI ashes individually. The present paper deals with influence of MSWI bottom ash from a Czech incineration facility on strength and Young’s modulus of cementitious mortars where the MSWI bottom ash was used as aggregates. Even though the content of ash was as high as 40 % of aggregates dosage the influence on mechanical properties was found to be not very significant. The strength was not lost by MSWI admixing, the Young’s modulus decreased somewhat...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of fly <b>ash</b> that is <b>discharged</b> {{in the form}} of slurry from a power plant situated on the southern coast of the Black Sea was simulated with a transport model that used the velocity fields produced by isopycnic modelling. It is shown that a significant amount of ash is deposited {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>discharge</b> location. The <b>ash</b> remaining in the water column settles in a manner dependent on the direction and intensity of the local current regime. Generally, summer and spring are found to be seasons when the circulation is weak and the ash dispersion is confined to the shore. The model results are conditional upon obtaining observational data for validation...|$|R
