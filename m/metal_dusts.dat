The {{deposition of}} carbon from a carbon-rich environment onto structural materials is prevalent in petrochemical and chemical {{industries such as}} in the production of syngas, iron reduction plants, petroleum refineries, carbon dioxide cooled nuclear plants, fuel cells using molten salts and hydrocarbons, and the recycle-gas loop equipment of coal-gasification units. The consequence of carbon deposition is a metal related degradation phenomenon known as "Metal dusting". <b>Metal</b> <b>dusting</b> results in rapid material wastage and/or thinning of material, producing hemispherical pits and grooves as the affected material disintegrates into a mixture of carbon and metal particles. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate material factors that cause or contribute to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> This was achieved by refurbishing the in-built <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> rig to carry out experimental tests on a laboratory scale. The objectives of this research were to simulate a <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> environment, characterize the resistance of various alloys to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting,</b> and to evaluate the effects of surface treatment and temperature on <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> <b>Metal</b> <b>dusting</b> was induced on a wide variety of nickelbased and iron-based alloys which were capable of forming chromium oxide scales in a flowing CO-HrH 20 atmosphere at 650 °C and 500 °C.

40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>dusting</b> is {{a catastrophic}} {{carburisation}} phenomenon that occurs at temperatures of 450 - 850 °C in atmospheres of high carbon activity. The resistance of alloys to corrosion, including <b>metal</b> <b>dusting,</b> {{relies on the}} formation of a dense, adherent oxide layer that separates the alloy from the corrosive environment. For such an oxide layer to be protective, it must achieve full surface coverage, be crack-free and be established before significant material degradation has occurred. Formation of a protective oxide scale can be enhanced by increasing the population of rapid diffusion paths for the protective elements (e. g. Cr and Al) to reach the alloy surface. In this work, laser surface melting has been used to improve the <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> resistance of Alloy 800 H by creating a rapid solidification microstructure and, thereby, increasing the density of rapid diffusion paths.

The major objective of this biomonitoring study was to assess genotoxic effects as a measure for carcinogenic risk in workers From cobalt refineries and hard metal plants currently exposed to the threshold limit value/time-weighted average (TLV-TWA) for cobalt-containing dust. The study comprised three groups of workers: 35 workers exposed to cobalt dust From three refineries, 29 workers exposed to hard metal dust from two producing plants, and 35 matched control subjects recruited from the respective plants. The study design integrated complementary methodologies to assess biomarkers of effects that represent both initial DNA damage (8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine [8 -OHdG] in urine and comet assay on lymphocytes) and definitive chromosome breakage/loss (micronuclei in lymphocytes). Cobalt and cotinine were determined in urine as a measure for cobalt exposure and recent smoking, respectively. No significant increase of genotoxic effects was detected in workers exposed to cobalt-containing dust as compared to controls. No difference in any genotoxicity biomarker was Found between workers exposed to cobalt and hard <b>metal</b> <b>dusts.</b> Multiple regression analysis indicated that workers who smoked and were exposed to hard <b>metal</b> <b>dusts</b> had elevated 8 -OHdG and micronuclei valves.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To assess airflow {{limitation}} in workers exposed long term to metal dust, {{the prevalence of}} pleural plaques in those workers exposed {{in the past to}} asbestos, the influence of pleural plaques on lung function, and the possible association with airway disease caused by asbestos. METHODS [...] A cross sectional and longitudinal (seven year) survey of 494 long term (mean (SEM) 21 (1) years) workers in a copper refinery was carried out from medical questionnaires, chest radiographs, and forced spirometry. RESULTS [...] The prevalence of lifetime non-smokers was 19 %, current smokers 39 %, and ex-smokers 42 %. The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 0. 05). In the smokers and ex-smokers with COPD, the loss of FEV 1 was 53 (10) (P < 0. 02). The prevalence of pleural plaques was 11 % (P < 0. 0001); pleural plaques were found in older workers with known exposure to asbestos. The pleural plaques were circumscribed and associated with a non-significant 196 ml reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) and non-significant reduction of FVC over time. The pleural plaques were not associated with COPD or SAD. The cumulative smoking index obtained by a technician did not differ from that by a chest physician. CONCLUSIONS [...] Despite exposures to asbestos that produced pleural plaques and exposures to <b>metal</b> <b>dusts</b> and foundry fumes the long term workers of this plant did not have excessive prevalence of COPD or SAD. The data suggest that low level long term exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>dusts,</b> gases, and foundry fumes do not necessarily cause respiratory dysfunction, circumscribed pleural plaques with low grades of width and extent do not reduce FVC significantly, and exposure to asbestos dust that produced pleural plaques does not necessarily produce airway dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Background: We sub-divided {{a cohort}} of 6820 workers at the Paducah (KY) Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) which was traced from 1953 to 2003. The subdivisions were made to assess the {{mortality}} risks in a sub-group of workers employed solely during the plant’s refit period, a time of suspected higher exposure to <b>metal</b> <b>dusts</b> (nickel, arsenic, chromium and ura nium) and trichloroethylene. Methods: This article describes a comparison of exposures and causes of death for 754 workers employed exclusively {{during the period of}} 1975 – 1979, with 1554 workers who worked in this period as well as other years. This interval was when the gaseous diffusion cascade facilities were refit. The workers employed ‘only ’ during this period have a variety of deterministic factors (age-at-hire, duration of employment) that distinguish this sub-group of employees from the ‘longterm ’ workforce. Results: The ‘only 1975 – 1979 ’ workers had a larger fraction of minorities and female work-ers. This ‘only ’ subgroup was disproportionately employed in unskilled labor positions. The ‘only ’ workers were younger than the referent group, and a 14 -year earlier mean age at death. The all-cause mortality standardized rate ratio [SRR] was 1. 58 [95 % Cl: 0. 97 – 2. 42]. The ‘only ’ group was significantly different from the ‘ever ’ workers with respect to suicides, SRR = 3. 74 [95 % Cl: 1. 86 – 6. 69], and for homicides, SRR = 11. 71 [95 % Cl: 3. 20 – 30. 03].

40|$|The primary {{intention}} {{with this}} Doctoral thesis is to fillin the knowledge gaps {{and raise the}} level of understandingregarding the different <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> mechanisms in general andexplain the process in detail for high alloyed materials. Considerable effort is put into identifying the driving forcesand elucidating the diffusional processes in <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> The results are based on a series of long-term laboratory exposures of stainless steels and high-performance commercial alumina-forming Fe- and Ni-base alloys in synthesis gasmixtures, plus a separate shorter study on ultra pure iron. ANi-base alloy was also investigated after a two years field exposure in a methanol plant. Post exposure metallographic examinations and analysis aswell as thermodynamic calculations were made in order toidentify and describe the operating <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> mechanisms. Two main mechanisms were previously used to explain metaldusting, one on the basis of decomposition of metastable carbides (Type I) the other on graphite formation (TypeII). A new <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> mechanism has been identified in this Thesis which appears on high alloyed steels and Ni-base alloys,an active corrosion induced by carbon and oxygen, denoted TypeIII. Both the mechanisms and the type of corrosion products were consistent with the thermodynamic conditions of the material under the influence of a carbon and oxygen gradient. It was shown that this mechanism not only accelerates the metaldusting process, in fact, it determines the overall metaldusting kinetics on stainless steels and Ni-base alloys. Another feature, which may occur at temperatures where metalbulk and even static grain boundary diffusion is too slow forexplaining the <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> corrosion process, was identifiedon a Ni-base alloy. It involves a fast growing cellular structure with discontinuous precipitated carbides whichprovides fast <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> kinetics by the Type IIImechanism.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} carburising furnace {{in which}} <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> conditions are simulated {{has been designed}} and constructed. This furnace {{has been used to}} simulate and study the <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> corrosion of four iron-based alloys viz. 9 Cr Mo 45 steel, Incoloy 800 H, AISI 310 stainless steel and Chromanite - an experimental high-nitrogen Cr-Mn stainless steel (HNSS). Tests conducted on the carburising furnace show that the rig is capable of heating a flowing gas environment to temperatures of 800 °C in the horizontal ceramic tube. The design allows the testing of up to thirty-six test specimens in a constanttemperature test zone. Systems for the safe heating and disposal of gases such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide have been incorporated into the design. Four twenty-four hour exposures were performed on specimens of the CrMo steel and as received samples of AISI 310. This was followed by a series of seven week-long exposures of Incoloy 800 H, AISI 310 and the high nitrogen stainless steel (HNSS). These specimens were tested in an annealed and polished condition in order to increase their susceptibility to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> In a third test series, specimens of these three alloys were tested in an annealed and abraded condition {{in order to determine the}} effect of grain size and surface roughness on <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> resistance. Exposures of the CrMo specimens resulted in general metal loss and massive carbon deposition after the first exposure of 24 hours. Filamentous carbon deposits containing metal particles showed that <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> corrosion of the specimens had taken place. The as received AISI 310 specimens showed no signs of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> attack over the same exposure time. This was attributed to a protective surface chromia layer that prevented carburisation of the specimens. During the second test series, specimens of Incoloy 800 H in the sensitised condition showed a high susceptibility to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> Carburisation of the matrix carburisation was accompanied by large carbon protrusions growing from the specimens' surfaces. Large pits were observed on the specimens after five weeks. Sensitised AISI 310 specimens also showed signs of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> but at a slower rate. The difference in performance between these two alloys was attributed to the difference in alloying contents, notably chromium, nickel and silicon. The HNSS specimens showed a high resistance to carburisation, carbon deposition and metal loss during the first six weeks. Small amounts of carbon deposition and pitting were observed after the seventh exposure. The good resistance to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> of this alloy was attributed to its alloying contents, which included chromium, manganese, sulphur and nitrogen. The results of the third test senes showed that resistance to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> was significantly improved by increasing the surface roughness and decreasing the grain size of the specimens.

There are two major issues of importance in <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> First is formation of coke and subsequent {{deposition of}} coke on metallic structural components. Second is the initiation and subsequent propagation of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> degradation of the structural alloy.

In this report, we present <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> data on both Fe- and Ni-base alloys after exposure in high and atmospheric pressure environments that simulate the gas chemistry in operating hydrogen reformers. We have also measured the progression of pits by measuring the depth {{as a function of}} exposure time for a variety of Fe- and Ni-base structural alloys. We have clearly established the role of transport of iron in forming a non-protective spinel phase in the initiation process and presence of carbon transfer channels in the oxide scale for the continued propagation of pits, by nano-beam X-ray analysis using the advance photon source (APS), Raman scattering, and SEM/EDX analysis. In this report, we have developed correlations between weight loss and pit progression rates and evaluated the effects of carbon activity, system pressure, and alloy chemistry, on weight loss and pit propagation. To develop pit propagation data for the alloys without incurring substantial time for the initiation of pits, especially for the Ni-base alloys that exhibit incubation times of thousands of hours, a pre-pitting method has been developed. The pre-pitted alloys exhibited pit propagation rates similar to those of materials tested without pre-pitting.

The emphasis of this update is on parenchymal diseases caused by metal inhalation, including granulomatous disease, giant cell interstitial pneumonitis, chemical pneumonitis, and interstitial fibrosis, among others. The clinical characteristics, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of disorders arising from exposure to aluminum, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, and nickel are presented in detail. Metal fume fever, an inhalation fever syndrome attributed to exposure to a number of metals, is also discussed. Advances in our knowledge of antigen-specific immunologic reactions in the lung are particularly evident in disorders secondary to beryllium and nickel exposure, where immunologic mechanisms have been well characterized. For example, current evidence suggests that beryllium acts as an antigen, or hapten, and is presented by antigen-presenting cells to CD 4 + T cells, which possess specific surface antigen receptors. Other metals such as cadmium and mercury induce nonspecific damage, probably by initiating production of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, geneti...|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis is {{a disease}} with a {{profound}} impact on the psychological and social aspects of the patient, particularly because of its visibility. Quality of life is impaired and different mental health disorders like depression, anxiety, alcoholism, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are found among persons suffering from psoriasis. Studies have shown the influence of stressful life events on onset, exacerbation and relapse of psoriasis. Rare studies explored prevalence of psoriasis during war times and relations between psoriasis and war provoked PTSD. Psoriasis {{is a disease}} with multiple possible causes and additional caution is necessary among medical professional to recognize all contributing factors. This report describes a case of a person whose first episode of psoriasis appeared six months after engaging in combat activities. He is diagnosed with psoriasis vulgaris, psoriatic arthritis and permanent personality changes after the traumatic experiences caused by war participation. His occupational history is burdened with additional causational factors; work with heavy metals and <b>metal</b> <b>dusts.</b> Cumulative effects of different aetiological factors can contribute to psoriasis with intensive trauma induced stressors serving as a trigger. His medical history indicates cognitive difficulties typical for early dementia which makes this case even more interesting.

40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>dusting</b> {{leads to}} {{disintegration}} of such alloys as iron and nickel-based into a “dust” of particulate metal, metal carbide, carbon, and/or oxide. It occurs in strongly carburising environments at 400 - 900 °C. Literature survey {{has shown that}} alloys behave differently in <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> conditions based on their composition and the environment. <b>Metal</b> <b>dusting</b> mechanisms for iron and nickel-based alloys have been proposed but, nevertheless, have not been agreed upon and numerous modifications to them have been suggested. Further adding to the complexity, the mechanisms {{were found to have}} differed due to operating condition alterations. In view of that, this research was carried out {{to gain a better understanding}} of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> process(s) by evaluating the performance of heat-resistant alloys, namely KHR 35 C HiSi© (HP), KHR 45 A LC© (35 Cr- 45 Ni), and UCX©, in <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> conditions. HP, which is an iron-based alloy, was modified by adding more silicon in order to improve its resistance through the development of SiO 2 at the surface. The carbon content in the nickel-based alloy, 35 Cr- 45 Ni, was lowered to delay the attack onset by accommodating more diffused carbon. UCX©, however, has the highest nickel and chromium levels. The alloys were exposed to a gas containing 80 vol% CO+ 20 vol% H 2 at 650, 750, and 850 ºC for 100, 500, and 1000 h. Analyses including visual inspection, XRD, and SEM/EDX revealed that the alloys suffered localised attacks at the three temperatures but to varying degrees and in different shapes. In general, the attack initiated at the matrix rather than the primary carbides and also progressed through the matrix. Increasing the exposure temperature caused less carbon deposition and more oxides formation on the alloy surfaces leading to a reduction in the attack aggressiveness. UCX© exhibited the highest resistance to <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> whilst HP suffered the severest attack. The presence of high concentrations of chromium at the surface catalysed a quick formation of Cr 2 O 3 scale that reduced the extent of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> Also, the increase in nickel content might have slowed down the carbon diffusion into the alloy. In addition, the presence of other oxide and carbide-forming elements such as silicon and tungsten might well have enhanced the alloy performance. Diffused carbon binds with free tungsten, niobium, and chromium to form carbides prolonging the incubation period prior to the attack initiation.

40|$|Phenomena of <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> on {{iron and}} nickel (and their alloys) were studied by characterizing both {{microstructure}} and nanochem-istry {{of the reaction}} zones using TEM and AEM techniques. While in case of iron a metastable carbide (cementite) is formed nickel directly disintegrates. In the chromium-rich steel HK 40 and the chromium-rich Ni-base alloy Inconel 600 some microstructural chromium dependent features were observed with protective ef-fects against <b>metal</b> <b>dusting.</b> Independent of these differences, in all groups of materials a fundamental common starting mechanism on the atomic scale could be deduced, which first of all comprises the arrangement of basal graphite lattice planes perpendicularly oriented to the carbide (or metal) surface acting as active sites in the disintegration process.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a safety research task to identify the safety issues and phenomenology of metallic dust fires and explosions that are postulated for fusion experiments. There are a variety of <b>metal</b> <b>dusts</b> that are created by plasma erosion and disruptions within the plasma chamber, as well as normal industrial dusts generated in the more conventional equipment in the balance of plant. For fusion, in-vessel dusts are generally mixtures of several elements; that is, the constituent elements in alloys and the variety of elements used for in-vessel materials. For example, in-vessel dust could be composed of beryllium from a first wall coating, tungsten from a divertor plate, copper from a plasma heating antenna or diagnostic, and perhaps some iron and chromium from the steel vessel wall or titanium and vanadium from the vessel wall. Each of these elements has its own unique combustion characteristics, and mixtures of elements must be evaluated for the mixture’s combustion properties. Issues of particle size, dust temperature, and presence of other combustible materials (i. e., deuterium and tritium) also affect combustion in air. Combustion in other gases has also been investigated to determine if there are safety concerns with “inert” atmospheres, such as nitrogen. Several coolants have also been reviewed to determine if coolant breach into the plasma chamber would enhance the combustion threat; for example, in-vessel steam from a water coolant breach will react with metal dust. The results of this review are presented here...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of and introduction {{to the subject of}} dust explosions. The purpose is to provide information on the explosibility and ignitability properties of dust clouds {{that can be used to}} improve safety in industries that generate, process, use, or transport combustible dusts. The requirements for a dust explosion are: a combustible dust, dispersed in air, a concentration above the flammable limit, the presence of a sufficiently energetic ignition source, and some confinement. An explosion of a fuel in air involves the rapid oxidation of combustible material, leading to a rapid increase in temperature and pressure. The violence of an explosion is related to the rate of energy release due to chemical reactions relative to the degree of confinement and heat losses. The combustion properties of a dust depend on its chemical and physical characteristics, especially its particle size distribution. In this paper, the explosion characteristics of combustible dusts will be compared and contrasted with those of flammable gases using methane as an example. These characteristics include minimum explosible concentration, maximum explosion pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, limiting oxygen concentration, ignition temperature, and amount of inert dust necessary to prevent flame propagation. The parameters considered include the effects of dust volatility, dust particle size, turbulence, initial pressure, initial temperature, and oxygen concentration. Both carbonaceous and <b>metal</b> <b>dusts</b> will be used as examples. The goal of this research is to better understand the fundamental aspects of dust explosions...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the long-term effects}} of <b>metal</b> <b>dusts</b> on the bronchopulmonary system and the synergistic effect of cigarette smoke, a comparative study of spirometric measurements in 104 polishers and 90 unexposed controls was carried out in 25 brass and steelware polish-ing industries at Moradabad in northern India. The two groups were comparable in terms of age, height, smoking habit and socio-economic status. A total of 58. 6 % of the polish-ers had one or more respiratory symptoms, compared to only 25. 5 % of the controls (P< 0. 05). Chronic cough was present in 21 polishers (20. 2 %) as compared to 11. 1 % of the controls. However, this difference was insignificant. Chronic phlegm was nearly three times as frequent among the polishers as among the controls (17. 5 % vs 4. 4 %) (P< 0. 005). The prevalence of dyspnoea of varying grades was also significantly higher (16. 3 % as opposed to 4. 4 %) among the exposed groups. Chronic bronchitis (6. 7 %) and occupational asthma (4. 8 %) were found to be confined to polishers. The polishers also experienced acute respi-ratory symptoms during the work shift. The prevalence of acute respiratory symptoms was recorded for cough in 19 workers (44. 1 %) followed by dyspnoea in 14 workers (32. 5 %) and throat irritation in 11 workers (25. 5 %).

40|$|We have {{performed}} {{a long term}} comparative study between five wrought and three centricast materials, both as-is, and in coated condition. Two commercially available coatings were applied to each different alloy. One coating was aluminum based with a chromium rich intermediate layer. The other coating was nickel rich with substantial amounts of silicon and aluminum. Both types of coating were of good quality, and did not show (micro) defects. The coated and bare alloy samples were exposed in a high pressure <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> atmosphere, and characterised based on mass loss, pit depth, pit size and pit density at regular intervals. The results indicate that a properly applied coating can boost the <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> resistance of low chromium alloys to a level comparable with alloy 693, for which generally no <b>metal</b> <b>dusting</b> attack is observed. Finally, the effect of micro cracks on the coating performance was assessed. © 2009 by NACE International...|$|R
