40|$|The {{invention}} {{proposes a}} process for the modular contacting of multi-layer semiconductor components, said process permitting the low-impedance contacting both of semiconductor areas and metallic layers of lateral structural sizes in the submicron range with high reliability. The contact holes or vias of the layers to be contacted are first filled selectively with pure aluminium or copper at temperatures below 450 degrees C. The metallic layer serving as a conductor is then applied, and a concentration compensation is adjusted between the conductor layer and the selective aluminium or copper layer by tempering. Since the entire process can be performed at temperatures below 450 degrees C, it is preferably suitable for the <b>multi-layer</b> <b>metallization</b> of semiconductor elements...|$|E
40|$|Dispersion {{characteristics}} of different classes of width-modulated microstrip line based unit cells forming High Impedance Surfaces (HISs) are investigated. The HISs {{consist of a}} periodic arrangement of macro unit cells, formed by sequential repetitions of similar elementary unit cells. Within the single unit cells, mono- and <b>multi-layer</b> <b>metallization</b> configurations are proposed and numerically characterized, which lead to interesting phenomenon of controlling the position and width of the band-gap and provide a key element for efficient dispersion engineering. The effects of the modulation on periodic and quasi-periodic structures are discussed. The modulation parameter of the different metallization within the macro unit cells are changed, which allows competently controlling the reflective phase over a wide frequency band. The proposed modulation mechanism is well suited for the synthesis of reflectarrays and/or holographic surface...|$|E
40|$|Fraunhofer ISE's {{concept for}} an {{advanced}} metallization of silicon solar cells {{is based on}} a two-step process: the deposition of a seed layer to form a mechanical and electrical contact and the subsequent thickening of this seed layer by a plating step, preferably by light-induced plating (LIP). The concept of a <b>multi-layer</b> <b>metallization</b> is used for most of the relevant high-efficiency cell types in industry. The main advantage of this concept is that each layer can be optimized individually, i. e. the seed layer to achieve an optimal electrical and mechanical contact and the plated layer in terms of high lateral conductivity and good solderability. Solar cells results with seed layers fabricated by aerosol printing, chemical Ni plating on cells with a laser-structured dielectric layer and laser-enhanced Ni plating are presented...|$|E
40|$|With about 125, 000 terawatts {{of solar}} power {{striking}} the earth {{at any given}} moment, solar energy {{may be the only}} renewable energy resource with enough capacity to meet a major portion of our future energy needs. Thin-fi lm technologies and solution deposition processes seek to reduce manufacturing costs in order to compete with conventional coal-based electricity. Inkjet printing, as a derivative of the direct-write process, offers the potential for low-cost, material-effi cient deposition of the metals for photovoltaic contacts. Advances in contact metallizations are important because they can be employed on existing silicon technology and in future-generation devices. We report on the atmospheric, non-contact deposition of nickel (Ni) and silver (Ag) metal patterns on glass, Si, and ZnO substrates at 180 – 220 °C from metal-organic precursor inks using a Dimatix inkjet printer. Near-bulk conductivity Ag contacts were successfully printed up to 4. 5 μm thick and 130 μm wide on the silicon nitride antirefl ective coating of silicon solar cells. Thin, high-resolution Ni adhesion-layer lines were printed on glass and zinc oxide at 80 μm wide and 55 nm thick with a conductivity two orders of magnitude less than the bulk metal. Additionally, the ability to print <b>multi-layered</b> <b>metallizations</b> (Ag on Ni) on transparent conducting oxides was demonstrated and is promising for contacts in copper-indium-diselenide (CIS) solar cells. Future work will focus on further improving resolution, printing full contact devices, and investigating copper inks as a low-cost replacement for Ag contacts...|$|R

The systems under investigation included duplex systems with Zn/Al <b>metallization,</b> <b>multi-layered</b> organic systems, a single-layer thick organic system, Zn/Mg metallization and cathodic protection of uncoated sections. Special field specimens and laboratory specimens were utilized in order to investigate the systems. Laboratory tests included immersion tests, ageing tests, test on cathodic compatibility and electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy Part 1 of the paper (Stahlbau, No. 4 / 2009) covererd the general experimental design and details of the experimental procedures, whereas Part 2 deals {{with the results of}} the test programme...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a <b>multi-layer</b> <b>metallization</b> {{concept for}} {{high-efficient}} large-area silicon back-contact back-junction solar cells is investigated. The metallization approach represents an industrial {{alternative to the}} well-known edge-to-edge cell interconnection technology, allowing for a decoupling of the cell metallization from the external contact structure by inserting an intermediate insulation layer. A first proof of principle is shown for an n type back-contact back-junction solar cell with an edge length of 156 mm and evaporated aluminum grid fingers. Furthermore, we present a tool that allows for the design optimization of the contact layout by combining detailed cost of ownership calculations with analytical solar cell simulations. Two back-end process sequences are compared and for both approaches the most cost-effective metallization layout is determined on cell level. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out, revealing the high potential of the investigated back-contact back junction solar cell structures...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{mechanical}} polishing (CMP) planarization process {{is an important}} step in fabrication for <b>multi-layer</b> <b>metallization</b> to create and design IC metallization and via interconnections. Fill synthesis methodologies are innovated by inserting dummy fill structures into the surrounding functional interconnects to help reduced metal and oxide topography variations which caused by post-CMP planarization effects. In transition to ultra-deep sub-micron (UDSM) design technology nodes, fill synthesis increasingly causing performances impact to the interconnect design due to the parasitic capacitances induced by the dummy fill structures. Meeting CMP density design rules alone are no longer sufficient. Large spacing setbacks between functional interconnects and dummy fill structures are commonly used to minimize parasitic capacitance, however as design scaled further into the nanometer regime, a huge percentage of metal densities are sacrificed and achieving minimum density requirements in certain areas are not possible. A fill synthesis solution is proposed in this thesis to optimize and balance both of the requirements in-between chip performances and yield requirements...|$|E
40|$|Recently, SnSe {{material}} with an outstanding high ZT (Figure of merit) of 2. 6 has {{attracted much attention}} due to its strong applicability for highly efficient thermoelectric devices. Many studies following the first journal publication have been focused on SnSe materials, not on thermoelectric devices. Particularly, to realize highly efficient intermediate-temperature (600 ~ 1000 K) thermoelectric modules with this promising thermoelectric material, a more thermally and electrically reliable interface bonding technology needs to be developed so that the modules can stably perform their power generation in this temperature range. In this work, we demonstrate several approaches to develop metallization layers on SnSe thermoelectric legs. The single-layer metallization shows limitations in their electrical contact resistances and elemental diffusions. The Ag/Co/Ti <b>multi-layer</b> <b>metallization</b> results in lowering their electrical contact resistances, {{in addition to providing}} more robust interfaces. Moreover, it is found to maintain the interfacial characteristics without any significant degradation, even after heat treatment at 723 K for 20 h. These results can be effectively applied in the fabrication of thermoelectric devices or modules that are made of the SnSe thermoelectric materials...|$|E
40|$|The major {{requirements}} for a solar cell used in space applications are high efficiency at AMO irradiance {{and resistance to}} high energy radiation. Gallium arsenide, with a band gap of 1. 43 eV, {{is one of the}} most efficient sunlight to electricity converters (25 %) when the the simple diode model is used to calculate efficiencies at AMO irradiance, GaAs solar cells are more radiation resistant than silicon solar cells and the N/P GaAs device has been reported to be more radiation resistant than similar P/N solar cells. This higher resistance is probably due to the fact that only 37 % of the current is generated in the top N layer of the N/P cell compared to 69 % in the top layer of a P/N solar cell. This top layer of the cell is most affected by radiation. It has also been theoretically calculated that the optimized N/P device will prove to have a higher efficiency than a similar P/N device. The use of a GaP window layer on a GaAs solar cell will avoid many of the inherent problems normally associated with a GaAlAs window while still proving good passivation of the GaAs surface. An optimized circular grid design for solar cell concentrators has been shown which incorporates a <b>multi-layer</b> <b>metallization</b> scheme. This multi-layer design allows for a greater current carrying capacity for a unit area of shading, which results in a better output efficiency...|$|E
