25|$|Genie quickly began {{growing and}} putting on weight and {{steadily}} became more confident in her movements, and by December she had good eye–hand coordination and was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> focusing her eyes. She rapidly developed a sense of possession, hoarding objects to which she took a liking for reasons doctors did not know, and became extremely upset if someone touched or moved anything she collected. She took all kinds of items but particularly sought colorful plastic objects, which doctors speculated was due to these having been the items she had access to as a child, {{and she did not}} seem to care whether they were toys or ordinary containers but especially sought out beach pails. During {{the first few months of}} her stay, giving her one of these objects could bring her out of a tantrum.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} results the {{concluded}} that Genie's brain had completed lateralization and that, because Genie had received no stimulation in her language center {{when she was}} a child, it had atrophied and her language functions had instead lateralized to her right hemisphere. Her results on their non-language tests suggested to them that her hemispheric dominance was not simply reversed. They believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and attributed the extreme imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory stimulation as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile. Previous observations of right-hemisphere language acquisition in adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients consistently showed that both populations were <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> learning vocabulary, although they were able to learn some basic grammar. Linguists noted these subjects had an advantage over Genie because, unlike her, their right hemispheres had already acquired at least a small amount of basic language.|$|E

500|$|Although Uribe did {{not have}} a {{starting}} role {{at the beginning of his}} tenure with the White Sox, he wound up appearing in 134 games for them in 2004, playing second base, shortstop, and third base. On June 19, he had seven RBIs (one short of the White Sox single-game record) in a 17–14 loss to the Montreal Expos. He set many career highs in batting categories, including batting average with the bases loaded (.556), RISP (.340), batting average (.283), home runs (23), RBIs (74), hits (142), and runs (82). He played <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> home, batting [...]315 with six home runs compared to [...]248 with seven home runs on the road.

From July 22 through July 26, he had four straight multi-hit games. Davis played well enough that, upon Hank Blalock's return from the disabled list (DL) on August 22, he was moved to third base so he could remain in the lineup. He had four hits on September 26 in a 121 victory over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In 80 games (295 at bats), Davis batted [...]285 with 84 hits, 23 doubles, 17 home runs, and 55 RBI.

500|$|Come What(ever) May was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive critical reviews. Several reviewers noted how it helped to further establish Stone Sour. Chad Bower of About.com stated that the band had [...] "progressed a lot since their debut", noting that the album was [...] "very diverse and [...] the band to show many different sides of their musical personality". Megan Frye of Allmusic opened her review of the album by distinguishing what sets Stone Sour apart musically, writing [...] " [...] ability to create smooth, radio-friendly alternative metal songs while simultaneously not boring {{the people who have}} heard way too much from post-grunge groups." [...] On a similar note, Michael Melchor of 411mania said, [...] "The band is <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> the craft of songwriting than many of their peers." [...] In contrast, reviewer William Fry of IGN criticized the album, writing, [...] "Stone Sour doesn't do anything inspired, original, or fresh here," [...] even calling the album [...] "completely misdirected, and stonewalled". A particular point of interest for reviewers was how Come What(ever) May is more melodic than the band's previous album Stone Sour. Melchor of 411mania said the album is [...] "much more liberal with the balladry and acoustic sounds than its predecessor"; of the track [...] "Sillyworld" [...] he said, [...] "It sounds like what Nickelback could be if Chad Kroeger could write a good melody." [...] In his review, Chad Bower labeled Come What(ever) May as a [...] "very melodic and accessible album" [...] writing that [...] "it has a little something for everyone". Similarly, Megan Frye praised the album as an [...] "unyielding effort from a promising talent".|$|E
500|$|Proto-globalization {{differed}} from modern globalization in {{the practices of}} expansionism, methods of managing global trade, finances, as well as commercial innovation. With the shift of expansionism by large nations to Western Europe, nations began competing {{in an effort to}} achieve world domination. The rise of larger-scale conflicts between these powerful nations over expanding their wealth led to nations taking control over one another’s territory and then moving products and the accumulated wealth of these conquered regions back to the sovereign country. [...] Although conflicts occurred throughout the world between 1600 and 1800, European powers found themselves far more equipped to handle the pressures of war. A quote by Christopher Alan Bayly gives a better interpretation of these advantages by stating, [...] "Europeans became <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> killing people. The European ideological wars of the 17th century had created links between war, finance, and commercial innovation which extended all these gains. It gave the Continent a brute advantage in world conflicts which broke out in the 18th century. Western European warfare was peculiarly complicated and expensive, partly because it was amphibious." [...] These battle-tested nations fought for their own needs, but in reality their success increased European advancement in the global market. Each of the following sections will shed light on the history of several key engagements. Whether a war was religious or commercial, its impact was greatly felt throughout the world. British victories during the Anglo-Dutch Wars led to their dominance in commercial shipping and naval power. The stage was set for future conflicts between Britain and foreign nations, as well as domestic frustration with “the motherland” on the North American continent. The French and Indian War, fought between the European powers of France and England, led to a British victory and resulted in continued dominance in maritime enterprise. The American Revolutionary War {{marked the beginning of the}} power shift for control over foreign markets.|$|E

2500|$|At first Genie {{did not use}} {{negative}} word forms {{but soon}} showed comprehension of them, an ability previously observed in split-brain and adult left-hemispherectomy patients, albeit much more consistently with the word not and contraction n't than the prefix un. Instead of learning negatives through the three-step process which linguists believed young children did, she appeared to have learned every kind of negation at once. In September and October 1971 she began incorporating verbs into her two-word utterances, such as, [...] "Dave hurt", although at first she never included the first person subject and inconsistently included any subject. Although Genie's two-word sentences contained grammatical properties typical of young children she was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> labeling and describing emotions and concrete objects, especially colors, sizes, and qualities, and most of her earliest two-word sentences modified nouns.

2500|$|In 1992 Gwynn {{ended the}} {{season on the}} DL for the third {{straight}} year. On September 8 in a 16-inning game in San Francisco, he had the third five-hit game of his career and his first since 1987. He sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee in the same game, and played just four more innings the rest of the season. He required arthroscopic surgery on the knee. Gwynn met Hall of Famer Ted Williams for the first time during the 1992 All-Star Game, which was hosted at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium (known later as Qualcomm Stadium). At the time, Gwynn considered himself to be an accomplished hitter, content to hit singles and doubles. Williams called Gwynn [...] "a big guy", capable of hitting for more power. He chided Gwynn for using a [...] "toothpick" [...] for a bat. His encounter with Williams spurred him to think more about hitting, and he began to hit for more power. [...] "I've never been a home run guy, never been a big RBI guy, but from that point to the end of my career, I was <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> it", said Gwynn.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} types of {{pancreatic}} cancer, involving both the endocrine and exocrine tissue. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which affects the exocrine part of the pancreas, {{is by far the}} most common form. [...] The many types of pancreatic endocrine tumors are all uncommon or rare, and have varied outlooks. [...] However the incidence of these cancers has been rising sharply; it is not clear to what extent this reflects increased detection, especially through medical imaging, of tumors that would be very slow to develop. Insulinomas (largely benign) and gastrinomas are the most common types. In the United States pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of deaths due to cancer. The disease occurs more often in the developed world, which had 68% of new cases in 2012. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has poor outcomes with the average percentage alive for at least one and five years after diagnosis being 25% and 5% respectively. In localized disease where the cancer is small (< 2nbsp&cm) the number alive at five years is approximately 20%. For those with neuroendocrine cancers the number alive after five years is <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> 65%, varying considerably with type.|$|E
2500|$|The {{continued}} growth of Ashland into the unincorporated areas {{just outside the}} city limits has reduced the city's population. [...] Ashland has two zip codes, 41101 which is mainly within the city limits, and 41102 which serves {{part of the city}} and the surrounding unincorporated areas of the county. [...] These two zip codes combined contain approximately 40,000 residents, which is more reflective of the Ashland community's size. [...] In 1972, a proposal was floated to combine the governments of Boyd County, Ashland, and Catlettsburg. Commonly called ‘Unigov’ it failed 12,514 to 2,518 due to the polarity between the two cities. A commission to draft a charter to merge the three governments into a metro government was seated following a petition drive in 1988. [...] The measure fared <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> the ballot box than the earlier Unigov effort. [...] It was defeated by a 3 to 2 margin, although it carried the majority of the Ashland precincts. [...] The aftermath of the intitiative saw the elimination of the unpopular Ashland and Catlettsburg city stickers and cooperation in the extension of sewer lines into the unincorporated areas of Boyd County. [...] Largely due to the sewer line expansions, growth was spurred along the US 60 shopping corridor between downtown and Interstate 64.|$|E

2500|$|Pilots {{soon learned}} that the Me 262 was quite maneuverable despite its high wing loading and lack of {{low-speed}} thrust, especially if attention was drawn to its effective maneuvering speeds. The controls were light and effective {{right up to the}} maximum permissible speed and perfectly harmonised. The inclusion of full span automatic leading-edge slats, something of a [...] "tradition" [...] on Messerschmitt fighters dating back to the original Bf 109's outer wing slots of a similar type, helped increase the overall lift produced by the wing by as much as 35% in tight turns or at low speeds, greatly improving the aircraft's turn performance as well as its landing and take off characteristics. As many pilots soon found out, the Me 262's clean design also meant that it, like all jets, held its speed in tight turns much better than conventional propeller-driven fighters, which was a great potential advantage in a dogfight as it meant better energy retention in maneuvers. Luftwaffe test pilot and flight instructor Hans Fey stated, [...] "The 262 will turn <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> high than at slow speeds and, due to its clean design, will keep its speed in tight turns much longer than conventional type aircraft." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{performance}} {{increase was}} described by Jeffrey Quill as a [...] "quantum leap" [...] over that of the Mk VB and another Spitfire airframe, R6700 was modified to take the new engine. Although design work on the Mk VII and VIII series was under way, these would take over {{a year to get}} into production and a counter to the Fw 190 was urgently needed. The Air Ministry made the decision that Mk VC airframes should be converted to take the more powerful engine and, as a result, many of the early IXs were converted Mk VCs which did not have any of the refinements which later appeared. These could be identified by the Type C wing with the large double blisters over the inner cannon bays and the identification light on the fuselage spine, behind the aerial mast. The elevator horns were also smaller in size than that of most Mk IXs which had larger horn balances. The first IX was a modified VC AB505, which was tested by the Air Fighting Development Unit (AFDU) in April 1942. The report said;The performance of the Spitfire IX is outstandingly better than the Spitfire V especially at heights above 20,000 feet. On the level the Spitfire is considerably faster and climb is exceptionally good. It will climb easily to 38,000 feet and when levelled off there can be made to climb in stages to above 40,000 feet by building up speed on the level and a slight zoom. Its manoeuvrability is as good as a Spitfire V up to 30,000 feet and above is very <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> <b>At</b> 38,000 feet it is capable of a true speed of 368mph and is still able to manoeuvre well for fighting. Although the Mk IX's airframe did not have the aerodynamic and strength improvements, or the modified control surfaces of the Mk VII and VIII, the Mk IX still proved to be an effective counter to the Focke Wulf Fw 190.|$|E
