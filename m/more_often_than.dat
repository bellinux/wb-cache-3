5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> the rest of the population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury {{on the part of the}} uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of nalidixic acid combined {{with each of}} 10 other antimicrobial agents on 95 strains of Enterobacteriaceae was studied.

Combinations of nalidixic acid with kanamycin, gentamicin, or colistin were <b>more</b> <b>often</b> synergistic <b>than</b> antagonistic, whereas with the other antibiotics the combination was <b>more</b> <b>often</b> antagonistic <b>than</b> synergistic. Synergistic effects were more common with Shigella than with other genera.

5|$|A recent {{geological}} formation, Carabane {{consists of}} a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils {{in the region are}} generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tellurium}} {{is found}} with gold <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> in uncombined form, {{it is found}} even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels in Canada and the {{northern}} United States typically migrate south in the winter, sometimes going as far as Central America and the Caribbean. Birds that breed south of about 35° north latitude are usually year-round residents. Migration also depends on local weather conditions. Wintering kestrels' choice of habitat varies by sex. Females are found in open areas <b>more</b> <b>often</b> <b>than</b> males during the non-breeding season. A common explanation for this behavior is that the larger females arrive at the preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory.|$|E
