5000|$|Currently {{only three}} freight railroads, Union Pacific, Florida East Coast and CSX Transportation, have adopted {{any form of}} ATC on their own networks. The systems on both FEC and CSX work in {{conjunction}} with pulse code cab signals, which {{in the case of}} CSX was inherited from the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac railroad on its single main line. Union Pacific's was inherited on portions of the Chicago and Northwestern east-west main line and works in conjunction with an early two aspect cab signaling system designed for use with ATC. On CSX and FEC <b>more</b> <b>restrictive</b> cab <b>signal</b> changes require the engineer to initiate a minimum brake application or face a more severe penalty application that will bring the train to a stop. Neither system requires explicit speed control or adherence to a braking curve. [...] The Union Pacific system requires an immediate brake application that cannot be released until the train's speed has been reduced to 40 mph (for any train traveling above that speed). Then, the train's speed must be further reduced to no more than 20 mph within 70 seconds of the initial cab signal drop. Failure to apply the brakes for these speed reductions will result in a penalty application.|$|R
5000|$|Signal aspects are {{designed}} to incorporate some degree of fault tolerance. Aspects are often designed so that a faulty or obscured lamp will cause the resulting aspect to be <b>more</b> <b>restrictive</b> than the intended one. Operating rules (GCOR, NORAC or CROR) require that dark or obscured signal heads be treated as displaying their most restrictive aspect (i.e. stop), but fault-tolerant aspect design can help the engineer take a safer course of action before {{the failure of a}} signal becomes apparent. While not all aspects are fault-tolerant, the green lamp on the topmost head is only used by the least <b>restrictive</b> <b>signal</b> aspect, [...] "Clear," [...] so there is no case where a failure could accidentally display a clear aspect.|$|R
40|$|Arbitrary {{communication}} systems can emerge from iconic beginnings through processes of conventionalisation via interaction. Here, we explore whether {{this process of}} conventionalisation occurs with continuous, auditory signals. We conducted an artificial signalling experiment. Participants either created signals for themselves, or for {{a partner in a}} communication game. We found no evidence that the speech-like signals in our experiment became less iconic or simpler through interaction. We hypothesise that the reason for our results is that when it is difficult to be iconic initially because of the constraints of the modality, then iconicity needs to emerge to enable grounding before conventionalisation can occur. Further, pressures for discrimination, caused by the expanding meaning space in our study, may cause more complexity to emerge, again {{as a result of the}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>signalling</b> modality. Our findings have possible implications for the processes of conventionalisation possible in signed and spoken languages, as the spoken modality is <b>more</b> <b>restrictive</b> than the manual modality...|$|R

We consider two families of perturbations.
