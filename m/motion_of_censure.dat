5|$|In late 2003, it was {{discovered}} that Texan businessman Allen Stanford had given both Joseph and fellow minister Gaston Browne cheques worth 100,000 East Caribbean dollars. While Browne denied suggestions that this had constituted bribery, claiming that the money had gone towards community projects, Leader of the Opposition Baldwin Spencer demanded that both ministers resign. Both ministers were part of a team negotiating with Stanford over a land exchange in St. John's, and the news led to protesters picketing their offices. Prime Minister Lester Bird affirmed his support in both ministers, and despite a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> brought by the opposition and more protests, Stanford publicly made a second set of donations to Joseph and Browne.|$|E

He was re-elected in the March 1957 elections, in which the UDSG also placed first, winning 18 of the 40 contested seats, against 16 for BDG. M'ba's party won 21 seats against 19 for Aubame's party after a recount. However, {{in the absence of}} an absolute majority, on 21 May 1957, both parties were obligated to submit a list of individuals that both agreed were suitable for inclusion in the government. That same day, M'ba was appointed vice president of the government. Soon, divisions within the government grew, and Aubame resigned from his position and filed a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> against the government. The motion was rejected by a 21–19 vote. With M'ba's victory, many elected UDSG members joined the parliamentary majority, giving the ruling government 29 of the 40 legislative seats. Well installed in the government, he slowly began to reinforce his power.|$|E

25|$|The {{amendment}} {{was adopted by}} the Assembly around 2 AM on 9 February 2006, after much heated debate. On the same day, in the afternoon, Prime Minister de Villepin announced to the National Assembly that he invoked article 49-3 of the Constitution of France on that text; this meant that the law would be considered adopted in its current state, without being approved by the National Assembly, unless a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> were adopted by the Assembly. Since Villepin's UMP party had an absolute majority in the Assembly, there was no chance that such a motion could be adopted.

50|$|The Parliament {{performs}} {{other functions}} besides legislation. It can discuss urgency <b>motions</b> or matters <b>of</b> public importance: these provide {{a forum for}} debates on public policy matters. Senators and Members can move <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> against the government or against individual ministers. On most sitting days in both Houses there is a session called Question Time at which Senators and Members address questions to the Prime Minister and other ministers. Senators and Members can also present petitions from their constituents. Both Houses have an extensive system of committees in which draft bills are debated, evidence is taken and public servants are questioned. There are also joint committees, composed of members from both Houses.|$|R

The Government may also ask for the expressed confidence of the Parliament at any point in time, by a written or oral request of the Prime Minister to parliament. The government always enjoys the confidence of Parliament when the absolute majority of members are present, yet no less than 2/5 of their overall number, declare their confidence. Moreover, Parliament may withdraw its trust in Government or a member thereof by means <b>of</b> a <b>censure</b> <b>motion.</b> The motion must be supported and signed by at least 50 MPs and include explicitly the issues to be debated. The motion is submitted to the Speaker at a public parliamentary sitting.|$|R

He created a constitution for Dahomey, styling it after that of the French Fifth Republic. The assembly, now led by Djibode Aplogan, adopted the constitution on November 25. The new constitution gave the president the right to ask the National Assembly to reconsider a bill {{if it did not}} pass with two-thirds of the votes, and submit referendums. Maga assumed the powers of Commander in Chief of the Dahomeyan Army, although he did not wear its uniform until its capture of the Portuguese enclave of Ajuda on August 1, 1961.|$|R

Letellier justified the dismissal on charges that the government was acting incompotently and corruptly on the matter of railway legislation. He also argued that if the de Boucherville government hadn't made concessions to [...] "rings" [...] of interest within the legislature on the issue, it would lose the legislature's support. De Boucherville called the move a [...] "coup d'etat", and complained to the Governor General of Canada.

In 1985, The Times reported that eight committee members of CUCA had [...] "resigned after allegations of electoral irregularities", with one committee member having a tape recording which he claimed proved the allegations.

However, Varsity noted that the subsequent <b>motions</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> themselves had no reasons formally attached to them by their proposers and that some of those who had signed them were unaware of why they were supporting them other than on the word of one of the factions involved. Indeed, Varsity articles on CUCA elections subsequently themselves came under fire. Following an Easter 2000 article, [...] "Conservatives in Corruption Crisis", which claimed to be based on a taped telephone conversation and accused the then-Chairman of 'vote-buying', the paper was forced to print a front-page [...] "Rectification" [...] and apology, after threats of legal action.|$|R
25|$|By {{the morning}} of Saturday 21 Wilson was talking of resigning and urging his staff to do the same, {{although}} he never actually did so and forfeited respect by talking too much of bringing down the government. With Parliament debating a Conservative <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> on the government for using the Army in Ulster, Repington telephoned Wilson (21 April 1914) to ask what line The Times should take. Fresh from a visit to Bonar Law (21 March), Wilson suggested prodding Asquith to take “instant action” to prevent general staff resignations. At the request of Seely (Secretary of State for War) Wilson wrote a summary of “what the army would agree to”, namely a promise that the army would {{not be used to}} coerce Ulster, but this was not acceptable to the government. Despite Robertson’s warm support, Wilson was unable to persuade French to warn the government that the Army would not move against Ulster.|$|E
25|$|Censure is {{an action}} by the House of Commons or the Senate rebuking the actions or conduct of an individual. The power to censure is not {{directly}} mentioned in the constitutional texts of Canada but {{is derived from the}} powers bestowed upon both Chambers through section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867. A <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> can be introduced by any Member of Parliament or Senator and passed by a simple majority for censure to be deemed to have been delivered. In addition, if the censure is related to the privileges of the Chamber, the individual in question could be summoned to the bar of the House or Senate (or, {{in the case of a}} sitting member, to that member's place in the chamber) to be censured, and could also face other sanctions from the house, including imprisonment. Normally, censure is exclusively an on-the-record rebuke — it is not equivalent to a motion of no confidence, and a prime minister can continue in office even if censured.|$|E
25|$|In November 1960, {{a crisis}} broke out within the {{majority}} party. After deciding to reshuffle the cabinet without consulting Parliament, {{the president of}} the National Assembly, Paul Gondjout, a previous ally of M'ba's, filed a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure.</b> Gondjout supposedly hoped to benefit from a balance of power modified to his own advantage, and specifically sought the establishment of a strong parliament and a prime minister with executive power. M'ba, who did not share these ideas, reacted repressively. On 16 November, under the pretext of a conspiracy, he declared a state of emergency, ordering the internment of eight BDG opponents and the dissolution of the National Assembly the day after. Electors were asked to vote again on 12 February 1961. Gondjout was sentenced to two years in prison. Sousatte, who also opposed the constitution, was also sentenced to the same amount of jail time. Upon their releases, M'ba appointed Gondjout president of the economic council and Sousatte Minister of Agriculture, both mostly symbolic posts.|$|E

25|$|In response, on {{the basis}} it was {{tantamount}} to a vote of no confidence, the President of PES, Pauline Green, announced she would put forward a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure.</b> However PES would vote against its own motion, {{as there is no}} method for a motion of confidence. During this period, the Parliament took on an increased government-opposition dynamic, with PES as a party supporting the Commission and the EPP renouncing its support and acting as a de facto opposition party to the executive. This is in part because the allegations centred on Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both from the Socialist party (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the People's party (EPP) to discredit PES ahead of the 1999 elections. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations. Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (just those whom the main allegations are against) and PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a committee of independent experts to investigate the allegations.|$|E

Gaitskell moved a <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> <b>censure</b> over Macleod's treatment of the strike. Macleod had recently demanded more debates on industrial relations but in his Commons speech of 8 May now criticised the opposition for demanding one. He moved the house to laugh at Gaitskell by quoting the line of “Mr Marx, of whom I am a devoted follower – Groucho, not Karl” “Sir, I never forget a face, but I will make an exception for yours”. He {{then moved on to}} a blistering attack on Gaitskell, including the declaration that “I cannot conceal the scorn and contempt for the part that the Leader of the Opposition has played in this.” He was discreetly congratulated afterwards by the Labour frontbencher Alf Robens. Roy Jenkins describes his attack on Gaitskell as “high order jugular debating”, accusing Gaitskell of weak leadership in appeasing the militants of his own party and attacking him for refusing to endorse the findings of the arbitration tribunal.|$|E
