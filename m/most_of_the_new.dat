5|$|Gielgud {{continued}} to try, without much success, {{to find new}} plays that suited him as an actor, but his direction of Peter Shaffer's first play, Five Finger Exercise (1958), received acclaim. While in the US for the Shaffer play, Gielgud revived Much Ado About Nothing, this time with Margaret Leighton as his Beatrice. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York critics praised the production, and they all praised the co-stars. He gave his first performances on television during 1959, in Rattigan's The Browning Version for CBS and N C Hunter's A Day by the Sea for ITV. He appeared in more than fifty more plays on television {{over the next four}} decades.|$|E

5|$|In 2014 the State Historic Preservation Board {{considered}} a boundary adjustment that removes {{a small area}} at the northeast corner but adds far more, primarily at the southeast. It would include a total of 200 new contributing properties and extend the district's period of significance to 1978, {{to take into account}} the city's urban renewal era. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated.

5|$|Isabella and Mortimer rapidly took {{revenge on}} the former regime. Hugh Despenser the Younger was put on trial, {{declared}} a traitor and sentenced to be disembowelled, castrated and quartered; he was duly executed on 24 November 1326. Edward's former chancellor, Robert Baldock, died in Fleet Prison; the Earl of Arundel was beheaded. Edward's position, however, was problematic; he was still married to Isabella and, in principle, he remained the king, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> administration {{had a lot to}} lose were he to be released and potentially regain power.|$|E
50|$|During 1978, {{the series}} was revived partly by Gerard and Young, with John Newland hosting and {{directing}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episodes; <b>the</b> <b>new</b> series was named The Next Step Beyond.

5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not <b>most,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance {{had a profound effect}} on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|After {{his arrival}} in New England, Wheelwright preached {{primarily}} to the Boston settlers who owned land at Mount Wollaston, still considered a part of Boston, but located about ten {{miles south of the}} Boston meetinghouse. Within months, someone had alerted magistrate John Winthrop, a lay person in the Boston church, that Wheelwright was harboring familist and antinomian doctrines. Familism, the theology of the Family of Love, involved one's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom from both sin, and the responsibility for it. Antinomianism, or being freed from moral law under the covenant of grace, was a form of familism. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> England Puritan ministers were adamantly opposed to these theological doctrines, seeing them as the cause of the violent and bloody ravages of the anabaptists in Germany during the Münster Rebellion of the 1530s. When confronted with accusations of familism, Wheelwright denied preaching such a doctrine. While Winthrop and many of the colony's ministers may have viewed Wheelwright as a familist, Cotton saw him as an orthodox minister.|$|E
50|$|BBC America was {{launched}} on March 29, 1998, presenting {{a mixture of}} comedy, drama and lifestyle programs from BBC Television and other British television broadcasters including ITV and Channel 4. In the channel's early days, it focused on repeats of popular lifestyle shows such as Changing Rooms and Ground Force. BBC America's head of television programming later stated {{that it was important}} for the channel to establish a niche since non-UK viewers found the lifestyle shows appealing. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> programs appeared as part of BBC America's evening schedule.|$|R

5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York State Democratic establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton, the United States Senator from New York. This marked a break from his earlier political organization, Grassroots, which supported Barack Obama from the outset. He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano {{announced that he would}} attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns. During the New York state September primary elections for state office, The New York Times alleged that Brown was aiding Golisano's attempt to unseat Sam Hoyt in the New York State Assembly.|$|E
5|$|In May 1707, Governor Dudley {{organized}} {{an expedition}} to take Port Royal led by John March. However, 1,600 men failed to take the fort by siege, and a follow-up expedition in August was also repulsed. In response, the French developed an ambitious plan to raid <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire settlements on the Piscataqua River. However, much of the Indian support needed never materialized, and the Massachusetts town of Haverhill was raided instead. In 1709, New France governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil reported {{that two-thirds of the}} fields north of Boston were untended because of French and Indian raids. French-Indian war parties were returning without prisoners because the New England colonists stayed in their forts and would not come out.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century the romantic medieval gothic style {{appeared}} as a backlash to the symmetry of Palladianism which brought certain changes to the city's appearance. Many of the new churches, for example, {{were built in the}} gothic style as were a number of new villas. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> civic and retail buildings however continued to be designed in the classical mode but along much more ornamented and elborate lines than their 18th century predecessors. However virtually all the new buildings were constructed using the local bath stone so the city continued to have a cohesive look. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, construction was able to develop incorporating steel as a building component.|$|E

At the 4th, 5th and 6th National Congresses {{approximately}} 45 percent of full Central Committee members were retained, 18 percent of alternate members were promoted to full membership and 37 percent were newly {{elected to the}} Central Committee as either full or alternate members. The 6th Congress continued the trend of increasing {{the size of the}} Central Committee; membership was 124 full and 49 alternate members. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> officials in the Central Committee were from the second generation of Vietnamese revolutionaries who gained prominence during Vietnam's struggle against French colonial rule in the 1940s and 1950s. The composition of the Central Committee changed at the 6th National Congress, with a notable increase of economic specialists, technocrats and provincial secretaries as members, but military representation in the Central Committee decreased. Only 8 percent of members of the 6th Central Committee were from the Vietnam People's Army. The number of central-level officials also decreased; 74 percent {{of the members of the}} 2nd Central Committee were central-level officials, while only 46 percent in the 6th Central Committee were from the centre. These changes reflected the party's overriding concern about basic problems.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{population}} of Belgium was comparatively small. Out of a {{population of}} around 8 million, there were only 10,000 Jews in the country before World War I. The interwar period saw substantial Jewish immigration to Belgium. By 1930, the population rose to 50,000, and by 1940 it was between 70,000–75,000. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Jewish immigrants came from Eastern Europe and Nazi Germany, escaping anti-Semitism and poverty in their native countries. The Roma population of Belgium {{at the same time}} was approximately 530. Few of the Jewish migrants claimed Belgian citizenship, and many did not speak French or Dutch. Jewish communities developed in Charleroi, Liège, Brussels and, above all, Antwerp, where {{more than half of the}} Jews in Belgium lived.|$|E
5|$|The {{defending}} army, the Nanking Garrison Force, was {{on paper}} a formidable army of thirteen divisions, including three elite German-trained divisions plus the super-elite Training Brigade, {{but in reality}} most of these units had trickled back to Nanking severely mauled from the fighting in Shanghai. By {{the time they reached}} Nanking they were physically exhausted, low on equipment, and badly depleted in total troop strength. In order to replenish some of these units, 16,000 young men and teenagers from Nanking and the rural villages surrounding it were speedily pressed into service as new recruits. An additional 14,000 fresh soldiers were brought in from Hankou to fill the ranks of the 2nd Army. However, due the unexpected rapidity of the Japanese advance, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> conscripts received only rudimentary training on how to fire their guns on their way to or upon their arrival at the frontlines. No definitive statistics exist on how many soldiers the Nanking Garrison Force had managed to cobble together {{by the time of the}} battle, but among leading estimates are those of David Askew who says 73,790 to 81,500, those of Ikuhiko Hata who estimates 100,000, and those of Tokushi Kasahara who argues in favor of about 150,000.|$|E

50|$|During its nearly 60-year existence, US 66 {{was under}} {{constant}} change. As highway engineering became more sophisticated, engineers constantly sought more direct routes between cities and towns. Increased traffic {{led to a}} number of major and minor realignments of US 66 through the years, particularly in the years immediately following World War II when Illinois began widening US 66 to four lanes through virtually the entire state from Chicago to the Mississippi River just east of St. Louis, and included bypasses around virtually all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towns. By the early to mid-1950s, Missouri also upgraded its sections of US 66 to four lanes complete with bypasses. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> four-lane 66 paving in both states was upgraded to freeway status in later years.|$|R
5|$|The {{developments}} {{spread to}} Anglo-Norman possessions in Ireland where this English style of castles dominated throughout the 13th century, although the deteriorating Irish {{economy of the}} 14th century brought this wave of building to an end. In Scotland Alexander II and Alexander III undertook a number of castle building projects in the modern style, although Alexander III's early death sparked conflict in Scotland and English intervention under Edward I in 1296. In the ensuing wars of Scottish Independence castle building in Scotland altered path, turning away from building larger, more conventional castles with curtain walls. The Scots instead adopted the policy of slighting, or deliberately destroying, castles captured in Scotland from the English to prevent their re-use in subsequent invasions – <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Scottish castles built by nobles were of the tower house design; the few larger castles built in Scotland were typically royal castles, built by the Scottish kings.|$|E
