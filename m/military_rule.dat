5|$|During {{the power}} vacuum that {{followed}} the assassination of Somalia's second president, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, the military staged a coup d'état on 21 October 1969 (the day after Shermarke's funeral) and took over office. Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who had succeeded Hersi as Chief of Army in 1965, was installed as President of the Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC), the new government of Somalia. The country was renamed the Somali Democratic Republic. In 1971, he announced the regime's intention to phase out <b>military</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E

However, unemployment also rose near 19%. In February 1990, the overweight Endara began a hunger strike in the Metropolitan Cathedral {{to call attention to}} the nation's poverty and to pressure US President George H. W. Bush to dispense previously pledged American aid. In the course of the strike, he lost more than thirty of his two hundred and sixty pounds.|$|E
5|$|Historians see {{the growing}} Roman {{influence}} over the east, as with the west, as {{not a matter of}} intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright <b>military</b> <b>rule,</b> the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It was not until the time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} month leading up the coup, Khánh's leadership had become increasingly troubled. He {{had tried to}} augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency, but this only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling {{for an end to}} <b>military</b> <b>rule,</b> with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future. He also removed several military officials closely linked to the discriminatory Catholic rule of the slain former President Ngô Đình Diệm; this response to Buddhist pressure dismayed several Catholic officers, who made a few abortive moves to remove him from power.|$|E

5|$|Magoffin and the {{legislature}} continued to clash throughout {{the remainder of}} 1861 and into 1862. They found agreement only on the most menial of legislation, such as a bill to allow the common schools to continue the sessions that had been interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. He found particularly onerous a bill forfeiting the citizenship of anyone who fought for or aided the Confederacy, but in March 1862, his veto of the bill was overridden. Magoffin also opposed the <b>military</b> <b>rule</b> of Brigadier General Jeremiah T. Boyle, who he believed was violating {{the civil rights of}} states' rights advocates, even if they did not advocate secession.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria regained {{democracy}} in 1999 when it elected Olusegun Obasanjo, the former military head of state, {{as the new}} President of Nigeria. This ended almost 33 years of <b>military</b> <b>rule</b> (from 1966 until 1999), excluding the short-lived second republic (between 1979 and 1983) by military dictators who seized power in coups d'état and counter-coups during the Nigerian military juntas of 1966–1979 and 1983–1998. Although the elections that brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development.|$|E
5|$|The Nigerian Military {{consist of}} an army, a navy, and an air force. The {{military}} in Nigeria {{have played a}} major role in the country's history since independence. Various juntas have seized control of the country and ruled it through most of its history. Its last period of <b>military</b> <b>rule</b> ended in 1999 following the sudden death of former dictator Sani Abacha in 1998. His successor, Abdulsalam Abubakar, handed over power to the democratically elected government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999.|$|E

It was further understood that we were {{to act as a}} military organization under <b>military</b> <b>rules</b> and discipline--I as commander, with Bradley as my first lieutenant and Olson as my second, in command of the Englishmen; while von Schoenvorts was to act as an additional second lieutenant and have charge of his own men. The four of us were to constitute a military court under which men might be tried and sentenced to punishment for infraction of <b>military</b> <b>rules</b> and discipline, even to the passing of the death-sentence.|$|R
5|$|This growing {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers. The result was more alliance-seeking, {{on the part}} of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership (and protection) within that confederacy. While there were exceptions to this (such as <b>military</b> <b>rule</b> of Sicily after the First Punic War), it was not until after the Second Punic War that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire, at least in certain locations. This shift mainly took place in parts of the west, such as the southern Italian towns that sided with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Chinese and North Koreans were {{exhausted}} by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship – which continues to date – according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of personality. In the South, the American-backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime. After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of <b>military</b> <b>rule</b> that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Santiago's {{military}} prosecutor {{prohibited the}} unmarked bodies from being incinerated or removed, though Walkowitz and Knauer wrote in Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space {{that the military}} government dug up and hid hundreds of these bodies in 1982. Following the end of <b>military</b> <b>rule</b> and return of democracy to Chile in 1990, investigation of human rights violations became a top priority. Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented prosecution for pre-1978 offenses, the new Aylwin government sought disclosure of the truth and recompense for the victim's families and appointed a National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. The commission's February 1991 Rettig Report named victims disappeared shortly after the coup, executed by gunshot, and presumed {{to be buried in}} Patio 29. Patio 29 was the largest of about twelve Pinochet era mass graves identified and searched.|$|E

Although {{he was in the}} <b>military,</b> the <b>rules</b> in his book were not based on <b>military</b> <b>rules.</b> The author's interest in parliamentary procedure began in 1863 when he was chosen to preside over a church meeting and, although he accepted the task, he felt {{that he did not have}} the necessary knowledge of proper procedure.|$|R
5|$|Mauricio Macri, {{mayor of}} Buenos Aires, was elected {{president}} in the 2015 presidential elections, defeating the Kirchnerite candidate Daniel Scioli in a ballotage. During the transition period, Macri reported that Kirchner was creating obstacles and problems {{in an attempt to}} undermine his government. She changed the 2016 budget, increasing spending in several areas (even the broadcasting of soccer matches), despite the huge fiscal deficit. A number of Kirchnerite officials refused to resign their offices to allow Macri to appoint his own people. Even the handover ceremony became controversial, as Kirchner refused to attend it. It was {{the first time since the}} end of <b>military</b> <b>rule</b> in 1983 that the outgoing president did not hand over power to the incoming one.|$|E
5|$|<b>Military</b> <b>rule</b> {{ended in}} 1983, and the radical Raúl Alfonsín was elected president. Menem ran for {{governor}} again, and was elected by a clear margin. The province benefited from tax regulations established by the military, which allowed increased industrial growth. His party got control of the provincial legislature, and he was re-elected in 1987 with 63% of the vote. The PJ was divided in two factions, the conservatives that still supported the political doctrines of Juan and Isabel Perón, and those who proposed a renovation of the party. The internal disputes ceased in 1987. Menem, with his prominent victory in his district, {{was one of the}} leading figures of the party, and disputed its leadership.|$|E

They intensified their calls for Kỳ to fulfil his promise to hold democratic elections. Some I Corps units supportive of Thi then decided to join the Struggle Movement and ceased military operations against the Vietcong, instead starting a stand-off against Kỳ. Throughout April and May there were tense incidents as units loyal to the junta were flown in from Saigon, and the factions came close to warfare.|$|E

5|$|Later {{that same}} year, Khánh became {{involved}} in a power struggle with his deputy Khiêm as well as Minh, who had been retained as the titular head of state. Thảo {{was a close friend}} of Khiêm, so when Khánh prevailed in the power struggle, Khánh despatched Khiêm to Washington as the ambassador with Thảo was his press attaché. In August 1964, Khánh's leadership became increasingly troubled after he tried to augment his powers by declaring a state of emergency. This only provoked large-scale protests and riots calling for an end to <b>military</b> <b>rule,</b> with Buddhist activists at the forefront. Fearful of losing power, Khánh began making concessions to the protesters and promised democracy in the near future, which encouraged more groups to demand changes, and Khánh demoted certain Catholic pro-Diệm supporters. On 13 September, a Catholic-dominated group led by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức, both of whom had been demoted, moved troops into Saigon but then withdrew after it became obvious they did not have the numbers to remove Khánh. Khiêm and Thảo were implicated in helping to plot Phát and Đức's attempted putsch; both were sent abroad by Khánh.|$|E
5|$|On July 25, 1898, at the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was invaded by the United States when, following a brief armed conflict, the United States Army landed at Guánica. Following the conclusion of the war, Spain was forced to cede Puerto Rico, along with Cuba, the Philippines and Guam, to the United States under the 1898 Treaty of Paris. Puerto Rico began the twentieth century under the <b>military</b> <b>rule</b> of the United States with officials, including the governor, who were appointed by the President of the United States. In 1900, William McKinley signed the Foraker Act as a United States federal law, this established civilian (limited popular) government on Puerto Rico. The new government had a governor and an executive council appointed by the President, a House of Representatives with 35 elected members, a judicial system with a Supreme Court, and a non-voting Resident Commissioner in Congress. The first civilian governor of the island under the Foraker Act was Charles Herbert Allen. This system was still used after the approval of the Jones–Shafroth Act, which altered the structure of government in Puerto Rico, and was in use until 1948.|$|E
5|$|The {{signature}} of the military-appointed civilian Chief of State Phan Khắc Sửu was required to pass the ruling, but Sửu referred the matter to the High National Council (HNC), a junta-appointed civilian advisory body, to get their opinion. The HNC turned down the request. This was speculated to be because many HNC members were old, and did not appreciate the generals' negativity towards seniors. On 19 December, the generals dissolved the HNC. The operation was commanded by Thi — who had traveled into Saigon from I Corps — and Kỳ. The national police, which was under the control and command of the military, moved through the streets before dawn, arresting five HNC members and other politicians and student leaders they deemed to be an obstacle to <b>military</b> <b>rule.</b> Minh and the other aging generals were arrested and flown to Pleiku, a Central Highlands town in a Montagnard area and forcibly retired, while other officers were simply imprisoned in the capital. The junta's forces also arrested around 100 members of the National Salvation Council (NSC) of the anti-war Lê Khắc Quyến party. The NSC was a new political party active in the I Corps region that opposed {{the expansion of the}} war and was aligned with Thi and the Buddhist activist monk Thích Trí Quang. As Thi was active in the purge, it was believed that the Quyen had fallen out with Thi.|$|E
