Shortly after 975, Ansfrid, the standard-bearer of King Otto I of Germany, was rewarded by Otto II with the county of Huy. His reputation as a count is provided by the chronicler Alpert of Metz, who states that he [...] "investigated righteous legal decisions and spent so much time reading that he was mocked by some foolish people for living the life of a monk." [...] He later entered the church, becoming bishop of Utrecht in 995 and dying in 1010.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{collective}} action by women in Nigeria. In the 1910s, women in Agbaja stayed away from their homes for a month because they thought that men were killing pregnant women. Their collective absence pushed village elders to take action to address the concerns of the women. In 1924, 3000 women in Calabar protested a <b>market</b> <b>toll</b> that was required by the government. In Southwestern Nigeria, where the Women’s War took place, there were other women organizations such as the Lagos Market Women’s Association, Nigerian Women’s Party, and Abeokuta Women’s Union. There was also an “elaborate system of women’s market networks,” which the Igbo and Ibibio women used to communicate information to organize the Women’s War.|$|E
50|$|Around 1178-8, William the Lion granted Erroll (Herol), {{located on}} the north side of the Tay estuary, to William II de Haya for the service of two knights. The barony, which was granted as a {{hereditary}} right (in feu and heritage), awarded the privileges associated with that rank, including the right to hold a judicial court and to retain the fines imposed (sake and soke), the right to exact tolls and to hold a <b>market</b> (<b>toll</b> and team), and the right to hang thieves caught red-handed (infangthief). This is the beginning of the still extant House of Erroll. The charter remains preserved in their family papers, while the artificial mound (motte) on which William II de Haya built his wooden tower in the twelfth century still existed at Erroll in 1967.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 862, Huy {{was only}} ever {{described}} as a vicus, larger than a village but smaller than a city. It had a market by 743, when King Childeric III exempted some monks from the <b>market</b> <b>toll</b> (toloneum). In 862, Huy was {{described as a}} port on the Meuse when King Lothair II gave the double monastery of Stavelot-Malmedy the right to some of its revenues. During the reign of Ethelred II (978-1016), its traders were present in London. The port was upgraded to a castrum with the construction of a fortress by 890. It is unclear when exactly it was constituted the seat of a county, but it most likely occurred after 870, when there is evidence that the Hesbaye was divided into four counties. Numerous documents of the tenth and eleventh centuries describe locations as being in the district of Hesbaye in the county of Huy. The first identified count is the mysterious saint Mengold, killed in 892 and possibly a wholly legendary figure. According to the hagiographical Vita Meingoldi comitis (Life of Count Mengold), he was granted the county by the Emperor Arnulf.|$|E

50|$|Between the 13th and 16th centuries, much of land {{surrounding}} Milltown {{was owned}} by the nearby Killagha Abbey, the ruins of which now stand {{one and a half}} miles outside the town. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the estates were granted to the Spring family and then, following the Irish Confederate Wars, to the Godfrey family. The settlement at Milltown was developed by Captain John Godfrey in the 1750s as the central town of their estate. The development of Milltown was a deliberate attempt at urban planning by the Godfreys who hoped such development would increase the income and prosperity of their estate through rents, <b>market</b> <b>tolls</b> and the promotion of industries.|$|R
50|$|The market toll-keeper in 1888, {{though he}} had no fixed scale of charges and kept no record of receipts, {{was said to be}} taking about £50 a year. The success and {{prosperity}} of the market fluctuated over the years and an attempt by the Local Board to purchase the market rights to mark Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee of 1887 was a failure. However, in 1897 Sir Algernon Peyton agreed to sell the market rights, the Market Place and Market House to March Urban District Council for £800. At that time the market was leased to F. B. Phillips, who agreed to surrender his lease in 1898 subject to receiving the <b>market</b> <b>tolls</b> for one year without charge.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the organization of}} livelihoods in a forest reserve fringe community in south western Ghana. Livelihoods in these communities have been organized within three main contexts. These are community vulnerabilities of increasing population, decreasing soil fertility and poor infrastructural development; commoditisation of agriculture to incorporate cocoa and oil palm production for export and industry; and forest reservation and logging policies. The above processes have dwindled the community's livelihood base most particularly farmland and non-timber forest products, changed the mode of production towards greater diversification of livelihood activities into non-farm income sources, transformed customary livelihood activities and their organization, community structures and institutions and promoted social differentiation and class formation. Community livelihood activities and organization have transformed to incorporate elements of cooperation, mutual support and interdependence as well as exploitation, marginalization and conflict. Customary production relations that involved communal rights of tenure have changed to land sales, renting and share cropping. This change had reduced the security of tenure and therefore the social protection offered by customary production relations. Although community laws and taboos, District Assembly rent and <b>market</b> <b>toll</b> policies, interpretation and enforcement of forestry regulations by forestry officials, state agricultural policies and bank regulations mediated livelihood activities and resource access, it was the micro-political production relations of exploitation {{that appeared to be}} more important in ensuring access to resources. The social relations of production presented winners and losers in both categories of women and men. Women have had increased work burdens compared with their male counterparts as well as less access to resources, although amongst the group of women' some have had more access than others. Cleavages have appeared within the community as a result of resentments and tensions and these have a capacity to disintegrate social structures.

5000|$|Like Leominster, Ledbury, and Ross-on-Wye, {{the town}} and fair at the manor of Bromyard was {{probably}} founded in c1125 during the episcopate of Richard de Capella (1121-1127). As with those other three towns, the bishops of Hereford had had a manor and minster there since Anglo-Saxon times. As at Ledbury the church was collegiate, with an establishment of clergy known as [...] "portioners", but without a master and common seal. Surveys for the bishop made c. 1285 and 1575-80 give valuable information about the town's first few centuries. Bromyard contained 255 burgage and landowner tenancies in the 1280s which paid a total rent of £23 10s 7 1/2d to the bishop. A Toll Shop at Schallenge House ("Pie Powder" [...] from pieds a poudre) was where <b>market</b> <b>tolls</b> were paid and summary jurisdiction dealt out.|$|R

50|$|Prior to Guadimir, {{the cathedral}} chapter and the bishop {{received}} incomes from different revenue streams, and the chapter's revenue was divided to give separate incomes {{to each of}} the canons (priests), although both revenue streams were controlled by the bishop. The canons complained to Guadamir that he had dissipated their revenues, a charge he admitted. On his deathbed on 10 June 957, he reformed the system by combining episcopal and capitular revenues while retaining separate incomes for the canons and the bishop (who receive the lion's share). Ostensibly, his motive was to increase communal feeling among the brothers by increasing their financial security. Although Guadamir's division—one third of revenues from the <b>market,</b> <b>tolls,</b> pasturage rights and the mint were to go to the chapter—remained in force long after his death, it was rarely followed, and required re-confirmation by Bishop Oliba in 1038 (to little effect).|$|R
5000|$|St Ives Borough Police {{only had}} a single officer at any one time, and was {{severely}} criticised by the Inspector of Constabulary in his 1876 report for being [...] "too small and inefficient to be worthy of keeping." [...] A further report, following an inspection on 20 May 1878, found that more police were needed for such a large area and population. The head constable was based at the Market Hall, and made use of the town hall, which had two police cells, for bringing offenders into custody. By 1889 the pressure to merge with the Cornwall County Constabulary was such that amalgamation became a certainty. The lone officer of the borough {{was known as the}} head constable and wore a frock coat and top hat. In 1873 the position was held by James Bennett, who also held the title of Collector of <b>Market</b> <b>Tolls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Woolwich Market {{received}} its charter in 1618 but may have existed before. In 1808 it moved from Market Hill (near Woolwich High Street) to Market Street (in the Bathway Quarter). This peripheral location {{proved to be}} unpopular with traders, who drifted back to Market Hill and, after 1813, to the new square {{in front of the}} Arsenal (where no <b>market</b> <b>tolls</b> had to be paid). The police regularly cleared the square and it was not until 1879 that the existing situation was accepted and regulated. In 1887 the Local Board of Health bought out the Maryon Wilson family's interest in the market charter. A new market was laid out by the Board with room for 136 stalls, against much opposition from costermongers. It officially opened in September 1888. In the middle of the square stood an iron toll house, a drinking fountain and a brightly ornamental urinal. Most of the pubs and shops around the square were rebuilt {{in the last two decades}} of the 19th century.|$|R

Rural areas and small communities often have rich endogenous natural resources, which may appeal to a stressed urban public, however, simply possessing these attributes is not sufficient, the must be communicated and promoted to the right people. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the use of Internet and online marketing tools to improve the competitiveness of small-scale rural tourism companies. The paper presents an overview of the perception, knowledge and use of Internet as a <b>marketing</b> <b>toll</b> by small-scaled rural tourism companies located in Portugal centre region and discusses the challenges and motivations involved in promoting rural tourism in a globalized market. A sample of small-scaled rural tourism companies was inquired about their attitudes toward the use of Internet marketing tools. The results show that Rural Tourism companies have limited knowledge of web marketing tools potential to support the rural tourism and highlight the need to increase the use of Internet as a marketing tool to globally communicate, promote and positioning rural tourism in order to leverage resources and create sustainability.

2500|$|Midhurst was a 'free borough' and in 1278 {{was said}} to have been so from time beyond memory. It was governed by a bailiff who was elected by the burgesses from among themselves. [...] The bailiff {{regulated}} the market by ensuring the assize of bread and ale, appointing two ale-tasters yearly, and acted as clerk of the market. Disputes over the respective rights and duties of town and manor were settled in 1409 by an agreement whereby Michael Bageley and six other named burgesses agreed, on behalf of themselves and their successors, to pay 40 shillings a year to Sir John de Bohun, Lord of the Manor, and his heirs, for the right to take the <b>market</b> <b>tolls.</b> [...] In return they were required to hold both the three-weekly courts and to conduct two 'law days' in the name of Sir John. If they failed for a whole year to hold the courts the agreement should lapse, and if they neglected to keep the streets and ditches in order the lord's manorial officers should be responsible for apprehending offenders, but were required to hand over any fines to the burgesses. This arrangement was confirmed in 1537 by Sir William Fitzwilliam, after his purchase of the manor.|$|R
