40|$|Abstract—A {{design of}} {{communication}} area for infrared electronic-toll-collection systems {{to provide an}} extended communication interval in the vehicle traveling direction and regular boundary between contiguous traffic lanes is proposed. By utilizing two typical low-cost commercial infrared LEDs with different half-intensity angles Φ 1 / 2 = 22 ◦ and 10 ◦, the radiation pattern of the emitter is designed to properly adjust the spatial distribution of the signal power. The aforementioned purpose can be achieved with an LED array in a three-piece structure with appropriate <b>mounting</b> <b>angles.</b> With this emitter, {{the influence of the}} mounting parameters, including the mounting height and <b>mounting</b> <b>angles</b> of the on-board unit and road-side unit, on the system performance in terms of the received signal strength and communication area are investigated.

Street lights need more energy in winter than in summer due to longer winter nights. However, for a solar powered system, less energy is available in winter with less intense sunlight and shorter days. The <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of panels has {{a great impact on}} the cumulative energy output of the panels. Our investigation shows that while a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 23. 1 ° yields maximum energy collection in summer and minimum energy collection in winter, a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 46. 5 ° increases the energy collection in winter and yields more or less uniform energy collection throughout the year. Assuming a panel efficiency of 16 %, an average cumulative energy output of 950 Wh/m 2 /day with about 5 - 8 % variation throughout the year has been found with a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 46. 5 °. This results in about 9 % reduction in the panel size than that required with a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 231 °. Moreover, installing a traffic sensor in the lighting system will allow detection of traffic density, thereby operating the lamps at different intensity levels as per requirements. This will save energy wastage in time of low or no traffic and will further relax the requirement on system size. Publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} the annual collected energy and the annual average optical efficiency factor is suggested. The radiation distribution on the absorber of an asymmetric CPC collector with a flat bi-facial absorber is measured for three different absorber mounting angles using a photo diode. The annual optical efficiency factors and a relative measure of the annual collected energy are determined for collectors with the absorber fin thickness 0. 5 and 1 mm, and for a collector with a teflon convection suppression film mounted around the absorber. With the local optical efficiency factors and the annual incident solar energy distribution considered, the analysis indicates that the energy gain for a <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> of 20 is higher than for a collector with 65 absorber <b>mounting</b> <b>angle.</b> The annual collected energy is increased with 6 - 8 % if the absorber fin thickness is increased from 0. 5 to 1 mm. The annual average optical efficiency factor is relatively independent of the absorber <b>mounting</b> <b>angle.</b> It {{was found to be}} 0. 87 - 0. 88 for a collector with a 0. 5 mm thick absorber fin and 0. 92 for a collector with a 1 mm thick absorber fin or for a collector with 0. 5 mm thick absorber fin with a teflon convection suppression film added. The low annual average optical efficiency factor is not caused by the uneven irradiance distribution but by the relatively high U-L-values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to deploy a {{time-of-flight}} (ToF) based photonic mixer device (PMD) camera on an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) whose overall target is to traverse from one point to another in hazardous and hostile environments employing obstacle avoidance without human intervention. The hypothesized approach of applying a ToF Camera for an AGV is a suitable approach to autonomous robotics because, as the ToF camera can provide three-dimensional (3 D) information at a low computational cost, it is utilized to extract information about obstacles after their calibration and ground testing and is mounted and integrated with the Pioneer mobile robot. The workspace is a two-dimensional (2 D) world map which has been divided into a grid/cells, where the collision-free path defined by the graph search algorithm is a sequence of cells the AGV can traverse to reach the target. PMD depth data is used to populate traversable areas and obstacles by representing a grid/cells of suitable size. These camera data are converted into Cartesian coordinates for entry into a workspace grid map. A more optimal camera <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> is needed and adopted by analysing the camera's performance discrepancy, such as pixel detection, the detection rate and the maximum perceived distances, and infrared (IR) scattering with respect to the ground surface. This <b>mounting</b> <b>angle</b> is recommended to be half the vertical field-of-view (FoV) of the PMD camera. A series of still and moving tests are conducted on the AGV to verify correct sensor operations, which show that the postulated application of the ToF camera in the AGV is not straightforward. Later, to stabilize the moving PMD camera and to detect obstacles, a tracking feature detection algorithm and the scene flow technique are implemented to perform a real-time experiment...|$|E

40|$|The pitch bearing, which {{connects the}} hub and the blades, allows the {{required}} oscillating {{movements of the}} blade, to change the angle of attack thus reducing the lift and drag coefficients there by controlling power and loads of the wind turbine. During the service life of the turbine of approximately 20 years the pitch bearing is loaded dynamically. In a double row four-point contact ball bearing, which is often used for this application, the described loads lead to radial and axial displacements between {{the inner and outer}} ring and deformations. These displacements and deformations lead to contact angles which vary from the <b>mounted</b> contact <b>angle</b> which is given by the supplier of the bearing. These divergent angles are called free contact angles. For a four-point contact ball bearing the <b>mounted</b> contact <b>angle</b> in the presented example is 45 °. Deviations from the <b>mounted</b> contact <b>angle</b> can lead to reduced fatigue life of the bearing and increased wear, arising from the modified contact behavior.
