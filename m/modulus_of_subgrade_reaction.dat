[...] Allowable bearing stress is the {{bearing capacity}} divided {{by a factor of}} safety. [...] Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing stress is determined with regard to the maximum allowable settlement. It is important during construction and design stage of a project to evaluate the subgrade strength. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) test is commonly used to determine the suitability of a soil as a subgrade for design and construction.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} soil–bentonite slurry trench cut-off walls is {{highly dependent on}} the hydraulic conductivity of the soil–bentonite backfill, which according to laboratory tests can decrease significantly as consolidation pressure increases due to corresponding reductions in void ratio. Consequently a reliable estimate of the hydraulic conductivity of backfill in the field requires proper calculation of effective stresses. A model is proposed to predict the steady-state horizontal and vertical effective stresses in the backfill after consolidation. The arching effect is considered by way of force equilibrium, and the lateral squeezing effect of inward displacement of the trench side walls is considered by assuming the cut-off wall is surrounded by soil, which is represented by a Winkler idealisation. The proposed model is applied to consider a soil–bentonite slurry trench cut-off wall in New South Wales, Australia, and the predicted stress profile is in good agreement with that calculated from cone penetration test data. Compared to those predicted by geostatics and other alternative models, the proposed method offers a significant improvement in the prediction of stress in soil–bentonite slurry trench walls. The obtained stresses are then used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in the backfill. It is found that the hydraulic conductivity is relatively high in the shallow region owing to the low state of effective stresses, which requires consideration in cut-off wall design, and decreases slightly with the depth in the deeper region.

A recent method has used reduction of pile resistance approach in determining ∆k. The relative displacement between pile and soils, and reduction of pile resistance has been identified. In fact, determining of reduction of pile resistance is difficult. This paper proposes an approach by considering tolerable settlement of rigid pavement. Validation is carried out with respect to a loading test of nailed-slab models. The models are presented as strip section of rigid pavement. The theory of beams on elastic foundation is used to calculate the slab deflection by using k’. Proposed approach can results in deflection prediction close to observed one. In practice, the Nailed-slab System would be constructed by multiple-row piles. Designing this system based on one-pile row analysis will give more safety design and will consume less time.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> in statically indeterminate framed structures. In building's design the interaction between ground and foundation can be modelled variously: using springs instead of supports, modelling the wholesale soil as finite elements, etc. The most common situation in practice is that the interaction is modelled using the springs. Nevertheless,there is not just one approved method to calculate it, and engineers use different methods, proposed by various authors. In practice the settlements of foundations are usually calculated and compared with the limit value. However, in some cases the impact of settlements is not taken into account on the analysis of the structure. During the design process, the number of boreholes is always limited. Therefore, the real situation cannot be considered exactly. As a result, unforeseen settlements may cause the considerable redistribution of internal forces, leading to the cracking or even to the failure of the structure. In this research, different calculation methods of <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> are presented. Most of these methods are adopted for the base of foundations consisted of one soil layer.

The soil-structure interaction modeled in this analysis was based on hyperbolic load displacement behavior using effective (drained) stresses. The development of the â€œt-zâ€� model parameters has been accomplished using finite difference methods to analyze the non-linear soil-structure interaction along the sides of the piles. During the analysis, the mean shear <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> soil-structure interface <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction,</b> K[sub]init, and the mean ultimate shear strength of the soil-structure interface, [symbol for tau][sub]u, were back-calculated from each set of load test data and were based on the assumption of a single-layer, homogenous soil profile. These â€œt-zâ€� model parameters were then compared to standard field investigation data, including standard penetration tests (SPT) and cone penetrometer test (CPT) soundings, and effective overburden stress to develop correlations suitable for service limit state design of augered cast-in-place piles. While there was some indication of a linear relationship between K[sub]init and the field investigation data, there was not a sufficient quantity of data in the analysis to properly identify any statistical trends. The relationship between [symbol for tau][sub]u and the field investigation data was much more variable and did not provide any distinct correlation. The plot of the data relating the model parameters to the effective overburden stress exhibited some grouping but the sample size and distribution was not sufficient to identify any statistical trends.

40|$|Dynamic Soil-Structure Interaction (DSSI) {{is an area}} of much ongoing {{research}} and has wide and varied applications from seismic response analysis to offshore wind foundation response. DSSI covers a wide range of load regimes from small-strain vibrations to large-strain cyclic loading. One of the most common ways to model DSSI uses the Winkler model, which considers the soil as a series of mutually independent springs. The difficulty with modelling DSSI arises with the inelastic and nonlinear load–displacement response of soil with increasing strain, therefore modelling of large-strain DSSI relies on the specification of many interrelated parameters. The relative magnitude of these parameters can {{have a significant effect on}} the modelled response. In this paper, the specification of an initial stiffness coefficient to model the elastic (small-strain) response of a soil–pile system is investigated. The coefficient <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> method can be used to generate spring stiffness moduli for Winkler type models. A number <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> theories have been proposed and their application to the problem of static loading has been widely studied.

40|$|In {{the paper}} the author {{presents}} the results of calculations of the system «structurefoundation-base» in case of using the two-layer and the single-layer beam models on an elastic basis with variable and constant coefficients <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction.</b> The analytical solution is obtained using the method of initial parameters. The calculations are carried out in case of building up the structure. The method of calculating two-layer beam with variable flexural rigidity along the length on an elastic foundation was described in the author’s previous articles, while in the present paper variable coefficients <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> are taken into account. A two-layer beam is a beam of variable rigidity, the lower layer simulates the foundation, and the upper — the structure, {{at the same time the}} weight of each layer is considered. For comparison, the problem is also considered in its traditional statement. That means the problem of single-layer beam bending is solved with cross-section of constant length, which is freely lying on an elastic basis of Winkler’s type. The results of calculations of two-layer and single-layer beams show, that the values of the internal forces and stresses are higher with variable coefficient <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> than with the constant one. When comparing the two-layer and the single-layer beam models with the same foundation characteristics, the values of internal forces in two-layer beams are much higher. On the basis of the calculations we can make the following conclusion: in order to obtain more reliable prognosis of the stress-strain state of the system «structure-foundation» on an elastic basis, it is appropriate to carry out calculations with the use of a contact model in the form of a two-layer beam on an elastic basis of Winkler’s type with variable coefficients <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction.</b> The model allows us to take account of such factors as rigidity changes in the base and the rigidity of the upper structure. Приведены результаты расчетов системы здание — фундамент — основание с использованием моделей двухслойной и однослойной балок на упругом основании с постоянным и переменным коэффициентами постели. Двухслойная балка является балкой переменной по длине жесткости, нижний слой которой моделирует фундамент, а верхний — надфундаментную конструкцию, при этом учитывается собственный вес каждого слоя. Расчеты приведены с учетом наращивания надфундаментной конструкции...|$|R

As a quick, {{accurate}} and efficient inspecting equipment, the Portable Falling Weight Deflectometer (PFWD) {{is widely used}} in subgrade modulus evaluation in the foreign countries.

It is considered by assuming the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> to be a homogeneous random function of space variable. The problem is governed by the fourth-order differential equation with random parameters. The main results of this article are the approximate analytical solutions for the displacement field, variance and dynamic-stiffness coefficient. It has been made a comparison of numerical results obtained by using two different methods: Adomian’s decomposition and Bourret’s approximation. The special method of finding inverse Laplace transform based on the wavelet theory is adopted and used in numerical examples. For making numerical calculations and plots the programs in MATHEMATICA have been prepared...|$|E
40|$|Typically, {{the problem}} of a plate on an elastic {{foundation}} has been approached by assuming that the foundation modulus (or <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> for a soil) remains constant as the plate deforms the foundation. If one were dealing with soil as the foundation material, {{it can be seen}} from a load-deformation plot for a particular soil, that this modulus would not be constant but would decrease as the deformations increase. The purpose of this thesis is to obtain an accurate solution that uses a more realistic model for the effect of the foundation behavior in the problem. When larger deflections of the plate are encountered, the results of the analysis using a non-linear model for the foundation differ substantially when compared to results using a linear model...|$|E

In the present study combined rectangular footing loaded with both Axial force and Moment on both columns is analyzed using Rigid (conventional) Method and the same footing is also analyzed by Finite Element and Winkler Model Approach and the results of both analysis is compared. The results of an analysis typically include support reactions, Bending and shear stresses and displacements. The Winkler Model Method is sometimes also called as Simplified Elastic Approach.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of laterally loaded piles {{is considerably}} {{influenced by the}} uncertainties in soil properties. Hence probabilistic models for assessment of allowable lateral load are necessary. Cone penetration test (CPT) data are often used to determine soil strength parameters, whereby the allowable lateral load of the pile is computed. In the present study, the maximum lateral displacement and moment of the pile are obtained based on the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> approach, considering the nonlinear soil behaviour in undrained clay. The coefficient <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> <b>reaction</b> {{is related to the}} undrained shear strength of soil, which can be obtained from CPT data. The soil medium is modelled as a one-dimensional random field along the depth, and it is described by the standard deviation and scale of fluctuation of the undrained shear strength of soil. Inherent soil variability, measurement uncertainty and transformation uncertainty are taken into consideration. The statistics of maximum lateral deflection and moment are obtained using the first-order, second-moment technique. Hasofer-Lind reliability indices for component and system failure criteria, based on the allowable lateral displacement and moment capacity of the pile section, are evaluated. The geotechnical database from the Konaseema site in India is used as a case example. It is shown that the reliability-based design approach for pile foundations, considering the spatial variability of soil, permits a rational choice of allowable lateral loads...|$|R
40|$|Resilient modulus {{has been}} used for characterizing the {{stress-strain}} behavior <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> soils subjected to traffic loadings in the design of pavements. With the recent release of the M-E Pavement Design Guide, highway agencies are further encouraged to implement the resilient modulus test to improve subgrade design. A laboratory resilient modus test and a FWD test are usually used to obtain the resilient <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>subgrade.</b> However, the difference in the resilient modulus obtained from these two methods is considerably large {{due to the fact that}} these tests are conducted under different conditions. This difference gives engineers a significant confusion about how they input appropriately the resilient modulus in the MEPDG software. In the present study, FWD tests, resilient modulus (Mr) tests and physical property tests were conducted to develop the relationship between the modulus from the FWD test and the resilient modulus from the lab resilient modulus test by comparing the results obtained from the FWD test on subgrade and the laboratory repeated triaxial load test on subgrade soil samples molded at OMC in Indiana varying over different climatic conditions. Based on the results of FWD tests and laboratory tests on some Indiana subgrades, the following conclusions can be drawn: On average, the FWD modulus is about 75 % lower than the lab resilient <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> the soil compacted at OMC. Winter FWD modulus is about 40 % higher than early summer FWD modulus. When inputting the resilient <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>subgrade</b> in the MEPDG software, this relationship can be implemen...|$|R
