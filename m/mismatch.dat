5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a <b>mismatch,</b> a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the <b>mismatch,</b> and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E

Heteroduplex DNAs containing such <b>mismatched</b> base pairs were first incubated with osmium tetroxide (for T and C <b>mismatches)</b> or hydroxylamine (for C <b>mismatches)</b> and then incubated with piperidine to cleave the DNA at the modified <b>mismatched</b> base. This cleavage was studied with an internally labeled strand containing the <b>mismatched</b> T or C, such that DNA cleavage and thus reactivity could be detected by gel electrophoresis. Cleavage {{at a total}} of 13 T and 21 C <b>mismatches</b> isolated (by at least three properly paired bases on both sides) single-base-pair <b>mismatches</b> was identified. All T or C <b>mismatches</b> studied were cleaved.

Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40–60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} <b>mismatch</b> repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also <b>mismatch</b> repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E

Since experimental data is preferred over a predictive model, the thermodynamic parameters for 25 frequently occurring tandem <b>mismatches</b> were determined.

To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a <b>mismatch</b> is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E

Objectives: We aimed to examine the independent {{association between}} overall and class-specific donor-recipient allelic and structural HLA <b>mismatching</b> and long-term graft loss in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Methods: In this retrospective national cohort study of 4, 851 heart transplant recipients 18 {{years of age or}} younger from 1987 - 2012, we used the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression to compare probabilities of death or re-transplantation (graft loss) by total and class-specific donor-recipient HLA-A, -B, and -DR allele <b>mismatches.</b> We used the HLA Matchmaker algorithm to compare probabilities of graft loss by level of class-specific HLA structural differences at the molecular level. Results: Recipients with 4 - 6 <b>mismatches</b> had an increased independent long-term risk of graft loss compared to those with 0 - 3 <b>mismatches</b> (adjusted HR: 1. 21 [95 % CI: 1. 05 - 1. 40]). Median times to graft loss were 10. 3 (95 % CI: 9. 9 - 11. 1) and 14. 3 (95 % CI: 11. 3 - 17. 1) years in the groups with 4 - 6 vs. 0 - 3 <b>mismatches,</b> respectively. <b>Mismatches</b> at class I loci (HLA-A and -B) were associated with progressively higher probabilities of graft loss while <b>mismatches</b> at the class II locus (HLA-DR) were not. Having 10 or more class I structural eplet <b>mismatches</b> was associated with higher probability of graft loss (HR: 1. 24 [95 % CI: 1. 07 - 1. 44]) while the corresponding number of class II eplet <b>mismatches</b> was not. On stratification by both allele and structural eplet <b>mismatching,</b> only those with both 4 - 6 allele <b>mismatches</b> and 10 + class I eplet <b>mismatches</b> had an increased probability of graft loss. Conclusions: Genotypic and structural-level HLA <b>mismatching</b> might identify recipients at increased risk of long-term graft loss who could benefit from intensified post-transplant surveillance and management. Further studies should elucidate the mechanisms by which HLA <b>mismatches</b> may impact graft survival...|$|R

Another method to reduce <b>mismatch</b> repair is to bury the mutations of interest within other silent mutations. Since silent mutations do not often cause catastrophic effects, they are poorly detected by the MMR machinery. The presence of modified bases will also help to evade the MMR machinery because they are not recognized. Finally, long segments of mutations will be less affected by short segments of mutations.|$|E
