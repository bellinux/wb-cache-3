50|$|A urine sensor is a {{necessary}} part of any bedwetting alarm. A basic urine sensor consists of two electricity conductors separated by moisture absorbing insulating material. A low DC electric voltage, provided by batteries, is applied across these conductors. This low voltage is usually about 3 volts, {{so as not to be}} dangerous to the user. When this insulating material (frequently cotton cloth as in common briefs) absorbs urine, it allows electricity to pass through it and between the conductors, resulting in a small electric current in the conductors. The conductors are attached to an alarm device, which triggers an alarm when it senses this current. Most sensors and alarms are engineered based on this concept. Note that unless the urine reaches the sensor mechanism and adequately wets the briefs (or insulator between the conductors), the urine may not be sensed and the alarm will not activate. Sensors are usually classified in terms of their attachment mechanisms to the briefs or other urine absorbing medium. The major sensor attachment categories are mechanical clips, sticky tape or pads for flat surface sensors, <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachment,</b> and wiring sewed into special briefs.|$|E
40|$|Background/purpose: One of the {{problems}} that has limited magnets’ wide acceptance by clinicians is their low corrosion resistance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of corrosive environments and thermocycling on the attractive force of different types of new generation magnetic attachments. Materials and methods: We measured the attractive forces of 60 <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachment</b> systems (Hyper slim, Hicorex slim, Dyna, and Steco) with a universal test machine. We then immersed 40 of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachment</b> systems in two media, namely, 1 % lactic acid solution (pH 2. 3), and 0. 9 % NaCl solution (pH 7. 3). The remaining magnetic attachments were put through 10, 000 thermal cycles (5  °C/ 55  °C). We measured the attractive forces of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachment</b> systems again after immersion and thermocycling to compare data. The data were statistically evaluated with one-way analysis of variance, paired samples t-test, and post hoc Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison tests (α =  0. 05). Results: We found significant differences between the mean values before and after immersion in corrosive environments (P    0. 05). Conclusion: Magnetic attachments showed lower attractive force after immersion in corrosive environments compared to their initial retentive force. In addition, closed-field systems were not affected by the thermocycling procedures and were more resistant than open-field systems to thermal variations characteristic of the oral cavity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{aim of this}} {{preliminary}} study is to compare patient-reported outcomes between immediately and conventionally loaded mandibular two-implant overdentures retained by <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachments.</b> MethodsNineteen participants with edentulous mandibles were randomly assigned into either an immediate loading group (immediate group) or a conventional loading group (conventional group). Each participant received 2 implants in the inter-foraminal region by means of flapless surgery. Prostheses in the immediate and conventional groups were loaded using <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachments</b> {{on the same day}} as implant placement or 3 months after surgery, respectively. All participants completed questionnaires (the Japanese version of the Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous [OHIP-EDENT-J], the patient's denture assessment [PDA], and general satisfaction) before implant placement (baseline) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The median differences between baseline and each monthly score were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. The differences in median and 95 % confidence interval between two groups were analyzed. ResultsThe immediate group showed slightly lower OHIP-EDENT-J summary score at 1 and 3 months than the conventional group (P= 0. 09). In the lower denture domain of PDA, the immediate group showed a statistically higher score at 3 months (P= 0. 04). There was no statistically significant difference in general satisfaction between the two groups.

40|$|Background Conventional {{dentures}} in edentulous patients {{show some}} limitations {{due to the}} lack of retention, support and stability thus resulting in difficulty to chew. The modern implantology allows to use different implant overdentures and different attachment systems. The selection of the attachment by practitioners is mainly influenced by the clinical experience or technical preferences. Aims The aim of the present review is to provide an adequate background to the clinicians, in order to select the prosthetic attachments according to the current literature. The mechanical attachments have been compared to the magnetic devices, with the aim to guide the decision of the practitioners. Methods Articles topics selection was based on the use of <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachments</b> in dentistry and the comparison between them and mechanical connectors. The databases used were PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar and ISI Web of Science. A critical evaluation of the selected paper has been made to choose the ones that matched the inclusion criteria. Results Nowadays, few studies have compared different attachments in a manner useful for clinical decision-making. The main problem limiting long-term durability of <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachments</b> in the oral fluid is the poor corrosion resistance of permanent magnets and the consequent leaching of cytotoxic ions. Conclusion <b>Magnetic</b> <b>attachments</b> in comparison with other attaching systems can be useful in patients with special needs, in patients with limited interocclusal space, or in patients with neuromuscular limitations, thanks to the automatic reseating properties. However, it’s important to highlight that the mechanical attachments still represent the best choice in common conditions requiring dental prostheses...|$|R

40|$|Successful visual {{prostheses}} require stable, longterm attachment. Epiretinal prostheses, in particular, require attachment {{methods to}} fix the prosthesis onto the retina.

In a first rotary position corresponding to the ON condition, each of the poles of the rotor magnet (32) is closely adjacent a stator magnet pole plate of like polarity whereby the respective magnet fields are additive for producing a strong magnetic field emanating from the adhering surfaces (35 a, 36 a) for attracting a ferrous magnetic plate 20, or the like, affixed to the payload (20 or 50).

The magnetic behaviour has been analysed {{as a function of the}} hysteresis loop obtained by using an inductive method. The biocompatibility has been tested using human osteoblast-like cells seeded onto discs of PM 2000. The ability of cells, on its surface, to attach, grow, and produce alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was determined. It is shown that PM 2000 is a soft magnetic material irrespective of its material condition, its remanent magnetisation being very low (up to about 3 % for the recrystallised swaged material). Fields close to 200 Oe are required to saturate the material. The saturation magnetisation is about 135 emu g- 1. In vitro tests indicate that cells are able to attach and grow onto its surface, and produce ALP, a specific marker of cells with bone-forming activity. In this respect, PM 2000 holds promise as a suitable substrate for bone integration.

An improved system utilising small neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachments</b> has been proposed to enhance appliance capabilities. Aim: The aim of the investigation was to analyse the force system diagrams produced by small attracting NdFeB magnets to determine, 1) whether the force levels were sufficient to induce tooth movement, 2) the effect of magnet morphology on force characteristics and, 3) the most appropriate magnet dimensions that could be utilised for this application. Methods: Twenty-nine NdFeB rectangular magnets of varying dimensions were tested. A Mach- 1 universal testing machine (Biosyntech Inc, Quebec, Canada) {{was used to measure}} the attractive force of pairs of magnets. Measurements commenced with a magnetic pair in contact and subsequently vertically separated a distance of 10 mm at a speed of 12 mm/minute. For all magnetic configurations four repeat measurements were performed on five magnetic pairs of the same size. Results: The force-distance diagrams for all magnet configurations demonstrated a dramatic decrease in force with increasing magnet separation. Rather than a suggested inverse square law, the experimental data followed an inverse fourth law when an offset determined by a regression analysis was applied to the distance. For the majority of magnets, insignificant forces were attained beyond 2 mm of separation. Magnets with large pole face areas and longer magnetic axes provided the greatest force. Conclusions: A select range of magnet configurations exhibited suitable and reliable attractive forces and therefore could be advocated for prescribed clinical application. 11 page(s...|$|R

30|$|Bar and clip {{attachments}} {{were most}} commonly used for IODs, followed by magnet, ball, and socket, and Locator attachments (Q 8) (Figure  4). It is noteworthy among the questionnaire results that <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachment</b> use is highest in Asian countries, including Japan [43].

Conversely, ball and socket attachments have been standardized by major implant manufacturers, and the freedom with which prefabricated parts can be used has led to their comparatively broad use. IOD use in Japan is by no means widespread; a survey of IOD use in ten countries by Carlsson et al. [44] revealed that the adoption rate of these devices in Japan was just 7 % for individuals with mandibular edentulism. This number was lower than in any of the other nine countries, and future changes in IOD use in Japan are a topic that remains interesting.|$|E

The <b>attachment</b> of the <b>magnetic</b> flux of the charge carrier suggest, that this may be viewed as a skyrmion. The interaction of a massless fermion representing a neutral spin with a gauge field along with the interaction of a spinless hole with the gauge field enhances the antiferromagnetic correlation along with the pseudogap at the underdoped region. As the doping increases the antiferromagnetic long range order disappears for the critical doping parameter δ_sc.

40|$|Background/purpose: Given {{that many}} {{patients}} find {{the cost of}} mandibular rehabilitation through complete overdenture implants to be beyond their financial scope, many seek a more affordable treatment. The aims {{of this study were}} to compare the clinical outcomes of single mandibular implant-retained overdentures versus that of complete dentures. Materials and methods: Thirteen edentulous patients {{with a mean age of}} 71 years were enrolled in this investigation. They were treated with a single implant inserted into the mandibular midline, followed by rehabilitation with complete dentures. The mandibular dentures were adhered with a locator or <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachment</b> after 10 weeks of adaptation.  Patient satisfaction was assessed by means of a visual analogue scale(VAS)  questionnaire both on the day of attachment connection and 3 months later. Chewing efficiency was assessed by a sieve test before and after connecting the attachment. Within-subject comparisons were performed either by using paired-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to test patient satisfaction and chewing efficiency (P =  0. 05). Results: No implants were lost nor were denture fracture found during the observation period. Significant improvements were observed in all parameters of patient satisfaction (with P values ranging from < 0. 001 to ∼ 0. 043) after attachment of the mandibular dentures with a single midline implant. Furthermore, the objective chewing efficiency of patients significantly improved after implant connection (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Clinical {{endoscopic}} {{intervention of}} the pancreaticobiliary tree [endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) ] often concludes with the insertion of a temporary plastic stent {{to reduce the risk}} of post-ERCP complications by promoting continued flow of bile and pancreatic fluids. This stent is later removed once the patient has fully recovered, but today this necessitates a second endoscopic intervention. The final goal of this work is to obviate the second intervention. This is to be achieved by adding a magnetic ring to the stent such that the stent is removed using a hand-held magnet, held in a suitable position ex vivo. This paper details the design, optimization, and both ex vivo and in vivo testing of the magnetized stent and hand-held magnet, which has been accomplished to date. The optimized design for the hand-held magnet and the modified stent with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachment</b> performs in line with simulated expectations, and successful retrieval is achieved in the porcine ex vivo setting at 9 - 10 cm separation. This is comparable to the mean target capture distance of 10 cm between the entry point to the biliary system and the closest cutaneous surface, determined from random review of clinical fluoroscopies in ten human patients. Subsequently, the system was successfully tested in vivo in the acute porcine model, where retrieval at an estimated separation of 5 - 6 cm was captured on endoscopic video.

40|$|I {{present a}} process for {{manufacturing}} poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films of thicknesses down to 50 microns. PDMS films are currently fabricated by spin-coating the polymer on a wafer and then manually peeling the film after curing. This is labor-intensive and suffers from low yield, dimensional inaccuracies, tearing and wrinkling. I apply manufacturing principles to the preparation of PDMS to enable more accurate, efficient, and reliable manufacturing. Difficulties {{in the preparation of}} PDMS films occur for two reasons: a) the material properties of PDMS are hard to characterize and b) process steps are hard to characterize. In analyzing the functional steps in PDMS manufacture, I first examine the spin-coating process. There has been surprisingly little work on thickness control, and I show how unlike with photoresist, the thickness of the coat can be controlled quite robustly by a judicious choice of process parameters. I also show how second-order variations can be controlled by using an inexpensive interferometric technique developed by our collaborators. I then analyze the physics of peeling and show why initiation, beading and tearing are difficult issues. Furthermore the line of separation of between the film and the wafer is difficult to advance without dynamic effects and micro-slippage. In order to prevent these problems, I introduce two new process concepts. First, I introduce a thin 'scaffold', incorporated in situ between the PDMS film and the substrate during spin-coating, which can start the peel front, eliminate the bead, as well as support the film as it is peeled. I then introduce the use of an adhesive roller actuator with a compressive pre-load which helps peel the film while controlling the peel-front. I show how, by using a ferro-magnetic material, the scaffold can be separated and handled by <b>magnetic</b> <b>attachment.</b> I show how the scaffolding can also incorporate a kinematic coupling for subsequent registration in layering. Finally, I will present experimental results showing thickness metrology, model verification and peeling success. by Sriram Krishnan. Thesis (Ph. D.)
