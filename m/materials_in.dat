5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> a way that mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|Bede's scriptural commentaries {{employed}} the allegorical {{method of interpretation}} and his history includes accounts of miracles, which to modern historians has seemed at odds with his critical approach to the <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> his history. Modern studies have shown the important role such concepts played in the world-view of Early Medieval scholars.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth has few {{commercial}} applications, {{and those}} applications that use it generally require small quantities {{relative to other}} raw <b>materials.</b> <b>In</b> the United States, for example, 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics); 26% into metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing; 7% into bismuth alloys, solders and ammunition; and 4% into research and other uses.|$|E
40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensing system}} monitors the level, temperature, magnetic permeability and electrical dielectric constant of a non-gaseous <b>material</b> <b>in</b> a container. An open-circuit electrical conductor is shaped {{to form a}} two-dimensional geometric pattern that can store and transfer electrical and magnetic energy. The conductor resonates {{in the presence of}} a time-varying magnetic field to generate a harmonic response. The conductor is mounted in an environmentally-sealed housing. A magnetic field response recorder wirelessly transmits the time-varying magnetic field to power the conductor, and wirelessly detects the harmonic response that is an indication of at least one of level of the <b>material</b> <b>in</b> the container, temperature of the <b>material</b> <b>in</b> the container, magnetic permeability of the <b>material</b> <b>in</b> the container, and dielectric constant of the <b>material</b> <b>in</b> the container...|$|R

5|$|Copies of the {{developed}} film or summaries prepared by Moyzisch were promptly passed on to senior German leaders. Ribbentrop showed the initial set of photographs to Hitler immediately upon receipt.

He concluded, though, that there would also be attacks in other locations, such as Norway or the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Electron beam {{processing}} is used {{to irradiate}} <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> order to change their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products. Electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its activation energy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: By {{finite element}} {{simulation}} and experiment, this paper compares {{the performance of}} generators with magnetic material to generators without magnetic <b>material</b> (Fe) <b>in</b> its coil and analyzes the reason why there is difference between simulation results and experimental results. Experimental results present that under the same rotational speed, output voltage improves 60 % {{with the addition of}} magnetic <b>material</b> <b>in</b> coil compared to generator without magnetic <b>material</b> <b>in</b> coil. We further discuss the feasibility to add magnetic <b>material</b> <b>in</b> coil, present the existed problems and improvement methods...|$|R

Filler metals are available with different diameters and are made {{of a variety of}} <b>materials.</b> <b>In</b> most cases, the filler metal {{in the form of a}} rod is added to the weld pool manually, but some applications call for an automatically fed filler metal, which often is stored on spools or coils.|$|E
5|$|Further {{refinements}} in the process, such {{as basic}} oxygen steelmaking (BOS), largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing {{the quality of the}} final product.

Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organizations.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{strategic}} bombing during World War II, {{the aim of}} the USAAF {{offensive against}} Japan was to destroy the enemy's war industries, kill or disable civilian employees of these industries, and undermine civilian morale.

50|$|Herbart's {{pedagogical}} {{method was}} divided into discrete steps: preparation, presentation, association, generalization, and application. In preparation, teachers introduce new <b>material</b> <b>in</b> relation to the students' existing knowledge or interests, so as to instill an interest <b>in</b> the new <b>material.</b> <b>In</b> presentation, the new <b>material</b> is shown <b>in</b> a concrete or <b>material</b> fashion. <b>In</b> association, the new material is compared with the students' previous knowledge for similarities and differences, so as to note the new <b>material's</b> distinction. <b>In</b> generalization, the new material is extrapolated beyond concrete and <b>material</b> traits. <b>In</b> application, if the students have internalized the new material, they apply it towards every facet of their lives {{rather than in a}} utilitarian manner.|$|R
