40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the {{organizers}} of this program for the opportunity to speak to you today on a subject that I feel is of the utmost importance to the dairy industry in the U. S. The problem to which I am referring is not the current devastating drought that has affected many of the dairy-producing areas in our country, but rather the repercussions of the dairy industry's inability to market a wholesome uncontaminated product that is viewed as such by a majority of the consumers in the U. S. I am sure that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> here <b>can</b> remember the problems that occurred several years ago with contaminated Tylenol products that reached various market areas in the U. S. With the recent revelations that approximately 70 % of the milk samples in several metropolitan areas, including Boston and Seattle, were contaminated with sulfamethazine, I fear that we in the dairy industry also could be faced with much more adverse publicity than what we have seen in the recent past. There has been at least one segment on 60 Minutes dealing with the potential contamination of milk products, along with articles in the Wall Street Journal. This publicity is definitely not what the dairy industry needs today. Currently, what publicity has been generated has not shaken the confidence that American consumers have in dairy products as a source of wholesome, uncontaminated, nutritional components of their diet. However, those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that are involved in the dairy industry need to realize the potential devastation that could occur to our complete marketing system, if adulterated, contaminated milk is not removed from the market place...|$|R

6000|$|I {{may as well}} pause here {{to explain}} their error. The right to know is like the right to live. It is {{fundamental}} and unconditional in its assumption that knowledge, like life, is a desirable thing, though any fool can prove that ignorance is bliss, and that [...] "a little knowledge is a dangerous thing" [...] (a little being the <b>most</b> that any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> attain), as easily as that the pains of life are more numerous and constant than its pleasures, and that therefore {{we should all be}} better dead. The logic is unimpeachable; but its only effect is to make us say that if these are the conclusions logic leads to, so much the worse for logic, after which curt dismissal of Folly, we continue living and learning by instinct: that is, as of right. We legislate on the assumption that no man may be killed on the strength of a demonstration that he would be happier in his grave, not even if he is dying slowly of cancer and begs the doctor to despatch him quickly and mercifully. To get killed lawfully he must violate somebody else's right to live by committing murder. But he is by no means free to live unconditionally. In society he can exercise his right to live only under very stiff conditions. In countries where there is compulsory military service he may even have to throw away his individual life {{to save the life of}} the community.|$|R

Says he, [...] "After {{a great many of}} these {{practices}} with which I am charged, Parliament appointed me to my trust, and consequently has acquitted me."--Has it, my Lords? I am bold to say that the Commons are wholly guiltless of this charge. I will admit, if Parliament, on a full state of his offences before them, and full examination of those offences, had appointed him to the government, that then the people of India and England would have just reason to exclaim against so flagitious a proceeding. A sense of propriety and decorum might have restrained us from prosecuting. They might have been restrained by some sort of decorum from pursuing him criminally. But the Commons stand before your Lordships without shame. First, in their name we solemnly assure your Lordships that we had not in our Parliamentary capacity (and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> myself I <b>can</b> say surely, heard very little, and that in confused rumors) the slightest knowledge of any one of the acts charged upon this criminal at either of the times of his being appointed to office, and that we were not guilty of the nefarious act of collusion and flagitious breach of trust with which he presumes obliquely to charge us; but from the moment we knew them, we never ceased to condemn them by reports, by votes, by resolutions, and that we admonished and declared it to be the duty of the Court of Directors to take measures for his recall, and when frustrated in the way known to that court we then proceeded to an inquiry. Your Lordships know whether you were better informed. We are, therefore, neither guilty of the precedent crime of colluding with the criminal, nor the subsequent indecorum of prosecuting what we had virtually and practically approved.|$|R
6000|$|The {{population}} of these dismal abodes appeared {{to consider the}} sidewalks and {{middle of the street}} as their common hall. In a drama of low life, the unity of place might be arranged rigidly according to the classic rule, and the street be the one locality in which every scene and incident should occur. Courtship, quarrels, plot and counterplot, conspiracies for robbery and murder, family difficulties or agreements,-- all such matters, I doubt not, are constantly discussed or transacted in this sky-roofed saloon, so regally hung with its sombre canopy of coal-smoke. Whatever the disadvantages of the English climate, the only comfortable or wholesome part of life, for the city poor, must be spent in the open air. The stifled and squalid rooms where they lie down at night, whole families and neighborhoods together, or sulkily elbow one another in the daytime, when a settled rain drives them within doors, are worse horrors than it is worth while (without a practical object in view) to admit into one's imagination. No wonder that they creep forth from the foul mystery of their interiors, stumble down from their garrets, or scramble up out of their cellars, on the upper step of which you may see the grimy housewife, before the shower is ended, letting the raindrops gutter down her visage; while her children (an impish progeny of cavernous recesses below the common sphere of humanity) swarm into the daylight and attain all that they know of personal purification in the nearest mud-puddle. It might almost make a man doubt the existence of his own soul, to observe how Nature has flung these little wretches into the street and left them there, so evidently regarding them as nothing worth, and how all mankind acquiesce in the great mother's estimate of her offspring. For, if they are to have no immortality, what superior claim can I assert for mine? And how difficult to believe that anything so precious as a germ of immortal growth can have been buried under this dirt-heap, plunged into this cesspool of misery and vice! As often as I beheld the scene, it affected me with surprise and loathsome interest, much resembling, though in a far intenser degree, the feeling with which, when a boy, I used to turn over a plank or an old log that had long lain on the damp ground, and found a vivacious multitude of unclean and devilish-looking insects scampering to and fro beneath it. Without an infinite faith, there seemed as much prospect of a blessed futurity for those hideous hugs and many-footed worms as for these brethren of our humanity and co-heirs of all our heavenly inheritance. Ah, what a mystery! Slowly, slowly, as after groping {{at the bottom of a}} deep, noisome, stagnant pool, my hope struggles upward to the surface, bearing the half-drowned body of a child along with it, and heaving it aloft for its life, and my own life, and all our lives. Unless these slime-clogged nostrils can be made capable of inhaling celestial air, I know not how the purest and <b>most</b> intellectual <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> reasonably expect ever to taste a breath of it.

The T.B.C. Company went into liquidation, as I began by telling you. The Tesmans washed their hands of it.

He had become invisible, as in those early days when he used to make a bolt clear out of sight in his attempts to break away from the enchantment of [...] "these isles," [...] either in the direction of New Guinea or in the direction of Saigon--to cannibals or to cafes. The enchanted Heyst! Had he at last broken the spell? Had he died? We were too indifferent to wonder overmuch. You see we had on the whole liked him well enough. And liking is not sufficient to keep going the interest one takes in a human being. With hatred, apparently, it is otherwise. Schomberg couldn't forget Heyst. The keen, manly Teutonic creature was a good hater. A fool often is.|$|E
60|$|Hers {{was that}} type of {{character}} which every age has reproduced, varying externally with climates and conditions, but materially the same from fabled Circe down to Lola Montes, or some less famous syren whose subjects are not kings. The same passions that in ancient days broke out in heaven-defying crimes; the same power of beauty, intellect, or subtlety; the same untamable spirit and lack of moral sentiment are the attributes of all; latent or alert as the noble or ignoble nature may predominate. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> recall some glimpse of such specimens of Nature's work in a daring mood. Many of our own drawing-rooms have held illustrations of the nobler type, and modern {{men and women have}} quailed before royal eyes whose possessors ruled all spirits but their own. Born in Athens, and endowed with a finer intellect, Ottila might have been an Aspasia; or cast in that great tragedy the French Revolution, have played a brave part and died heroically like Roland and Corday. But set down in uneventful times, the courage, wit, and passion that might have served high ends dwindled to their baser counterparts, and made her what she was,--a fair allurement to the eyes of men, a born rival to the peace of women, a rudderless nature absolute as fate.|$|E

His father, now in a green old age, continued to take a prominent part {{in the affairs of}} the day, but likewise made his declining years rich and picturesque with recollections of the heroic times through which he had lived. On the 26th of December, 1825, it being his sixty-seventh birthday, General Benjamin Pierce prepared a festival for his comrades in arms, the survivors of the Revolution, eighteen of whom, all inhabitants of Hillsborough, assembled at his house. The ages of these veterans ranged from fifty-nine up to the patriarchal venerableness of nearly ninety. They spent the day in festivity, in calling up reminiscences of the great men whom they had known and the great deeds which they had helped to do, and in reviving the old sentiments of the era of 'seventy-six. At nightfall, after a manly and pathetic farewell from their host, they separated--"prepared," [...] as the old general expressed it, [...] "at the first tap of the shrouded drum, to move and join their beloved Washington, and the rest of their beloved comrades, who fought and bled at their sides." [...] A scene like this must have been profitable for a young man to witness, as being likely to give him a stronger sense than <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>can</b> attain of the value of that Union which these old heroes had risked so much to consolidate--of that common country which they had sacrificed everything to create; and patriotism must have been communicated from their hearts to his, with somewhat of the warmth and freshness of a new-born sentiment.

Perhaps his talks with the doctor had got his ideas into order and made them more readily expressible than they would have been otherwise. He argued against the belief that any class could be good as a class or bad as a class, and he instanced the conflict of motives he found in all the members of his Committee and most so in himself. He repeated the persuasion he had already confessed to Dr. Martineau that {{there was not a single}} member of the Fuel Commission but had a considerable drive towards doing the right thing about fuel, and not one who had a single-minded, unencumbered drive towards the right thing.

Opposite to where I sat, far away across the arena, was a great bank of men of the Sokol organizations, an unbroken brown mass wrapped in their brown uniform cloaks. Suddenly the sun came out and at a word the whole body flung back their cloaks, showed their Garibaldi shirts and became one solid blaze of red. It was an amazing transformation until one understood what had happened. Yet nothing material had changed but the sunshine. And given a change in laws and prevailing ideas, and the very same people who are greedy traders, grasping owners and revolting workers to-day will all throw their cloaks aside and you will find them working together cheerfully, even generously, for a common end.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author © 2010 Ronald Philip StottHow do we explain to students the often subtle and seemingly intuitive skills and sensitivities that make a creative piece of work that extra bit special? We might describe it as taste, or a sense of style, or even as tapping into some essential genius – whatever we call it, {{it is something that}} resonates with people at a very deep level. As teachers, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> believe we <b>can</b> recognise it when we come across it. However, we often find it difficult to explain or articulate exactly what it is and why it is important, even to ourselves. It is something that is often thought of as being mystical and innately subjective; something that cannot be explained logically. This thesis sets out to explore what it is that we expect from students in creative arts subjects and how we can best equip students to understand and focus on these challenges, particularly in the final two years of secondary school and the first years of post secondary education, which I identify as an important transition period for many students. Five teachers were interviewed about what they think this mysterious “X-factor” is and how they position the student so they can understand and develop it in their work. These findings are correlated against many of the prevailing theories and philosophies that underpin our understanding of what we value in creative work, including postmodernist theory, traditional aesthetics and the various educational theories and ideologies outlined by Eisner (2002). The interviewees all stressed the importance of creative work having a degree of meaning or significance, as opposed to simply demonstrating virtuosity or being technically impressive, but they didn’t have clear or firm ideas about what this meaning might be. Furthermore, there appears to be disjunction between underlying (and often unarticulated) assumptions/ideologies and the pragmatic understandings that are reflected in the more intuitive teaching practices that many of the interviewees have adopted. Many of these conflicts appear to stem from residual beliefs and ideologies based on modernistic and structuralist principles such as the existence of universal aesthetic properties. I conclude that these paradigms are ill-equipped to account for the dynamic complexity of communication in this postmodern age, nor do they acknowledge (or account for) any social purpose in mediated communication. It is apparent that there are many alternative theoretical disciplines and conceptual models of communication and meaning construction that could be more fully explored in relation to arts education. Many of these theories appear to complement or parallel one another. This thesis concentrates on social semiotics (Hodge & Kress 1988) because it provides a model that articulates how different semiotic components (including seemingly arbitrary and non-denotative images and sounds) combine together to create structures of meaning that are maintained and replicated socially, but are also constantly being renegotiated and re-energised. Importantly, this provides a way of understanding how an individual student’s work can be seen as contributing to a wider ongoing discourse within the media and genre. Open Acces...|$|R
