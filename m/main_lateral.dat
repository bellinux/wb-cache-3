60|$|On the Nature of the Tissues {{through which}} the Motor Impulse is Transmitted.--It will be {{necessary}} first to describe briefly {{the course of the}} main fibro-vascular bundles. These are shown in the accompanying sketch (fig. 11) of a small leaf. Little vessels from the neighbouring bundles enter all the many tentacles with which the surface is studded; but these are not here represented. The central trunk, which runs up the footstalk, bifurcates near the centre of the leaf, each branch bifurcating again and again according {{to the size of the}} leaf. This central trunk sends off, low down on each side, a delicate branch, which may be called the sublateral branch. There is also, on each side, a <b>main</b> <b>lateral</b> branch or bundle, which bifurcates in the same manner as the others. Bifurcation does not imply that any single vessel divides, but that a bundle [page 248] divides into two. By looking to either side of the leaf, it will be seen that a branch from the great central bifurcation inosculates with a branch from the lateral bundle, and that there is a smaller inosculation between the two chief branches of the lateral bundle. The course of the vessels is very complex at the larger inosculation; and here vessels, retaining the same diameter, are often formed by the union of the bluntly pointed ends of two vessels, but whether these points open into each other by their attached surfaces, I do not know. By means of the two inosculations all the vessels on the same side of the leaf are brought into some sort of connection. Near the circumference of the larger leaves the bifurcating branches also come into close union, and then separate again, forming a continuous zigzag line of vessels round the whole circumference. But the union of the vessels in this zigzag line seems to be much less intimate than at the main inosculation. It should be added that the course of the vessels differs somewhat in different leaves, and even on opposite sides of the same leaf, but the main inosculation is always present.|$|E

40|$|In Portugal {{all of the}} {{upstream}} controlled canal systems {{work with}} flexible water delivery schedules and therefore canal operational losses can be significant. Real-time technologies can allow the canal managers to continuously compare the real operation with its optimal or target value and to take appropriate corrective steps as required and minimize the water operational losses. The paper presents the design, field solutions and tuning of an implemented SCADA system on a Portuguese upstream controlled canal. Remote monitoring allows the data acquisition of water levels, gate positions and inflow and outflow computations. Remote control allows the operator to send control orders to gates. Two networks, including their remote terminal units and the needed communication and control software are parts of the presented SCADA system. This system controls the inflows to the main canal and <b>main</b> <b>laterals,</b> {{as well as the}} main outlets to the drainage system with gate controlled orifices. All the discharge equations are tuned in the field. The outflows through weirs or Neyrpic automatic siphons from the <b>main</b> <b>laterals</b> are also monitorized and their discharge equations are also tuned in the field...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} aimed {{to assess the}} effect of Trichoderma harzianum Bi on {{qualitative}} and quantitative traits of polianthes, including stem length and diameter, inflorescence floret number and leaf length of the <b>main</b> and <b>lateral</b> bulbs; an experiment with completely randomized design having four treatments and seven replications was completed in greenhouse conditions. Enriched coco peat with Trichoderma in different concentrations (0, 20, 50 and 100 %) of pot total coco peat, were applied as treatments. Main media mixture was 40 % of coco peat+ 40 % of field soil+ 20 % of perlite. Enriched coco peat with 100 % concentration significantly increased stem length and diameter, floret number and leaf length in both <b>main</b> and <b>lateral</b> bulbs compared with control sample. There {{were no significant differences}} between treatments for stem length and diameter, neither for floret number. Also, treatments of 50 % and 20 % enriched coco peat for stem length and diameter, and floret number, did not significantly differ from control variant. By applying 50 % enriched coco peat the floret number and leaf length of the <b>main</b> and <b>lateral</b> bulbs significantly increased compared with control variant. The data obtained from the experiment showed that Trichoderma enhanced qualitative and quantitative traits of polianthes cut flower...|$|R

30|$|The nine trialled {{species were}} {{a mix of}} {{evergreen}} and deciduous trees and exhibited a range of tree form. Canopy shape and density were variable with some species having a bushy shrub-like appearance and others more streamlined canopies and forms. In a similar manner, the below-ground appearance of the root systems was also variable. Several species had low root density (i.e. low numbers of roots per m 2 of soil) and elongated “spidery” lateral roots with few small side branches (low root branching order) (blackwood, eucalypt, oak) (Fig.  3). Alder and cherry had dense branching lateral root systems with high root numbers (high root density and high root order) while redwood and cypress had similar dense root systems, but many fine long branching roots. Radiata had long laterals with limited branching order, similar to blackwood but with {{a greater number of}} short branch roots on the <b>main</b> <b>laterals.</b> Alder, redwood and cypress roots were reddish in colour, radiata orange, blackwood and oak pale brown, cherry pale brown to white, and eucalypt dark brown.|$|R
