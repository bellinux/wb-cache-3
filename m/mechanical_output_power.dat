The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine correlations between measures of external <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> and internal <b>mechanical</b> joint <b>power</b> <b>output</b> across different loads during a weightlifting exercise. Ten subjects performed 3 sets of the clean exercise at 65, 75, and 85 % of 1 repetition maximum (1 RM). Peak external <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> was calculated with 4 commonly used methods, whereas an inverse dynamics approach was used to calculate peak internal <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> for the hip, knee, and ankle joints along with the peak of the sum of all internal joint powers. All peak <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> were expressed as relative peak power by either ratio (watts per kilogram) or allometrically scaling to body mass (W·kg- 0. 67). Correlation coefficients were used to compare <b>power</b> <b>output</b> measures. The greatest numbers of significant correlations between internal and external <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> were observed at 85 % of 1 RM, at this load hip and knee joint <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> were correlated to external <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> when calculated with the traditional work-energy method.

40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the role of central and peripheral fatigue on 4000 -m cycling time trial performance by comparing changes in <b>power</b> <b>output</b> and integrated electromyography (iEMG) in differently paced maximal efforts. Methods: Eight well-trained men performed three randomly ordered time trials with different pacing strategies, in which the first 2000 m were manipulated to evoke an increasing, even, and decreasing <b>power</b> <b>output</b> profile (SUB, EVEN, and SUPRA, respectively). Subjects were instructed to finish the last 2000 m of all trials in the shortest time possible. iEMG of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps femoris (BF) muscle, <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>output,</b> and gas exchange variables were measured. Anaerobic and aerobic contributions to <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> were calculated from gas exchange data. Results: The increase in <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> during the SUB time trials was always associated with an increase in iEMG in all muscles. A decrease in <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> {{near the end of the}} time trials was also marked by an increase in iEMG for all muscles, except for the RF. Comparing the last 2000 -m interval with the first, aerobic <b>power</b> <b>output</b> increased for all strategies. Anaerobic <b>power</b> <b>output</b> increased in SUB and decreased in EVEN and SUPRA. Conclusion: The relationship between iEMG and <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> pattern was consistent with peripheral fatigue rather than central downregulation of <b>mechanical</b> <b>power</b> <b>output.</b> Specifically, anaerobic energy resources seem to be important in regulating pacing strategy.

Furthermore, the electrical characteristics of this machine make it possible to apply the well-known flux weakening technique, which enhances the performance of the entire energy-conversion system.

The bending vibration modals of transducer and ring are degenerated, and the motion trajectories of nodes on the teeth are analyzed.

We formulated a realistic biophysical model of stereocilia incorporating stereocilia dimensions, the known flexoelectric coefficient of lipid membranes, mechanical compliance, and fluid drag.

40|$|LecturePg. 131 - 144 For {{more than}} 40 years, {{integrally}} geared centrifugal compressors {{have been in}} use worldwide, in the plant air sector first, and increasingly in the process industry. Apart from reliability, efficiency and operating range, the most striking features of this compressor concept, particular when used in the process industry, are the versatility and configurability of the machine. Today, all sorts of process gases, including toxic and flammable ones, can be compressed or expanded using integrally geared centrifugal compressor and expander units. The high level of modular construction employed in integrally geared turbomachines (IGTMs) allows for {{a high degree of}} standardization; the resulting building block system makes it possible to adapt the machine concept to each field of application and, in particular, to the customer's own requirements. Of prime importance here are the definition and geometry of the interfaces between the individual modules and equipment units, such as compressor and expansion stages, gear case, pinion shafts, seal systems, etc. The integrally geared centrifugal compressor has conquered many ranges of application in the process industry starting with compressors operated purely on air, followed by nitrogen and then carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, chlorine, hydrocarbons, acetylenexide, and isobutyric aldehyde, and so forth. A recent success involving the compressing of high purity oxygen to high discharge pressures using integrally geared centrifugal compressors deserves special mention. It had been thought that this could only be achieved using single shaft compressors. This means that for oxygen, too, the advantages of integrally geared centrifugal compressors such as efficiency and very broad operating ranges can be used, {{as in the case of}} variable oxygen supply systems (varox) in air separation plants. Energy recovery in the process industry has presented integrally geared centrifugal compressors with a new task. Tail gases often have high energy contents which can be returned directly to a compression process in the same machine through addition of expander stages. In its original concept, the integrally geared centrifugal compressor is primarily suitable for the use of low-speed drive units. By using "free" pinion shaft extensions or additional pinion shafts, high speed drive units without an external intermediate gear can also be used. This aspect, together with the integration of expander stages already mentioned, leads to a very interesting and economical application of integrally geared centrifugal compressors: alongside compression and expansion functions, IGTMs can be used for <b>mechanical</b> <b>output</b> <b>power</b> distribution in sophisticated process equipment such as dimethylterephthalate (DMT) and pure terephthalic acid (PTA systems) ...|$|E
