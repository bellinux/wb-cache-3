Arunachalam invests the money in horse race which is a way to loose money easily in minutes. He deliberately bets on a weakest horse but due to quartet's plan, the weak horse wins earning him lot of money. Next he buys bumper prize lotteries which also gets him to win ample amount of money, He then produces a movie with his friend Arivazhagan hoping it will fail commercially. However his plan backfires due to the quartet who make him to earn more money from the selling rights. Finally he jumps into politics starting a party, nominating his friend Kattavarayan for upcoming election. He vigorously campaigns for him and lavishly spends all the money so fast. During a meeting, Katavaraayan's speech <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> <b>angry</b> on him and Arunachalam declares that he is apologizing them for nominating a wrong person and asks them not to vote for him. However the quartet group make the other nominees of election to withdraw and Katavarayan is elected as MP. Arunachalam is shocked now, as MP post and the party are both assets as per the challenge. But he makes Kathavarayan to resign the post and he dissolves his party destroying both assets.|$|E

6000|$|Of real sensational journalism, as {{it exists}} in France, in Ireland, and in America, we have no trace in this country. When a {{journalist}} in Ireland wishes to create a thrill, he creates a thrill worth talking about. He denounces a leading Irish member for corruption, or he charges the whole police system with a wicked and definite conspiracy. When a French journalist desires a frisson there is a frisson; he discovers, let us say, that the President of the Republic has murdered three wives. Our yellow journalists invent quite as unscrupulously as this; their moral condition is, as regards careful veracity, about the same. But it is their mental calibre {{which happens to be}} such that they can only invent calm and even reassuring things. The fictitious version of the massacre of the envoys of Pekin was mendacious, but it was not interesting, except to those who had private reasons for terror or sorrow. It was not connected with any bold and suggestive view of the Chinese situation. It revealed only a vague idea that nothing could be impressive except a great deal of blood. Real sensationalism, of which I happen to be very fond, may be either moral or immoral. But even when it is most immoral, it requires moral courage. For {{it is one of the}} most dangerous things on earth genuinely to surprise anybody. If you make any sentient creature jump, you render it by no means improbable that it will jump on you. But the leaders of this movement have no moral courage or immoral courage; their whole method consists in saying, with large and elaborate emphasis, the things which everybody else says casually, and without remembering what they have said. When they brace themselves up to attack anything, they never reach the point of attacking anything which is large and real, and would resound with the shock. They do not attack the army as men do in France, or the judges as men do in Ireland, or the democracy itself as men did in England a hundred years ago. They attack something like the War Office--something, that is, which everybody attacks and nobody bothers to defend, something which is an old joke in fourth-rate comic papers. just as a man shows he has a weak voice by straining it to shout, so they show the hopelessly unsensational nature of their minds when they really try to be sensational. With the whole world full of big and dubious institutions, with the whole wickedness of civilization staring them in the face, their idea of being bold and bright is to attack the War Office. They might as well start a campaign against the weather, or form a secret society in order to make jokes about mothers-in-law. Nor is it only from the point of view of particular amateurs of the sensational such as myself, that it is permissible to say, in the words of Cowper's Alexander Selkirk, that [...] "their tameness is shocking to me." [...] The whole modern world is pining for a genuinely sensational journalism. This has been discovered by that very able and honest journalist, Mr. Blatchford, who started his campaign against Christianity, warned on all sides, I believe, that it would ruin his paper, but who continued from an honourable sense of intellectual responsibility. He discovered, however, that while he had undoubtedly shocked his readers, he had also greatly advanced his newspaper. It was bought--first, by all the people who agreed with him and wanted to read it; and secondly, by all the people who disagreed with him, and wanted to write him letters. Those letters were voluminous (I helped, I am glad to say, to swell their volume), and they were generally inserted with a generous fulness. Thus was accidentally discovered (like the steam-engine) the great journalistic maxim--that if an editor can only <b>make</b> <b>people</b> <b>angry</b> enough, they will write half his newspaper for him for nothing.|$|R
5000|$|Calls for minimum {{taxation}} of the 'ultra-rich' {{have been}} given greater impetus after the high-profile revelation that Republican Party Presidential candidate Mitt Romney will pay a projected tax rate for 2011 of 15.4%. Such measures are legal, and often arise from the far lower rate of taxation on investment, as opposed to income. [...] Nick Clegg has {{been quoted as saying}} [...] "Mitt Romney, it turns out, pays 13 per cent tax. You hope that kind of thing doesn’t go on in this country." [...] HM Revenue and Customs, the tax collection agency for the United Kingdom has also stated that there are approximately 16,000 tax payers in the UK who have incomes above £1,000,000, who pay tax at an average of around 35%. The UK tax system requires individuals to pay 50% tax on all income above £150,000. Other taxes, such as Capital Gains Tax, have lower rates. Regarding this issue, Nick Clegg has said that [...] "There are hundreds of people earning millions per year who are barely paying 20 per cent tax, forget 40 per cent, forget 50 per cent, forget 30 per cent. They are not even paying 20 per cent." [...] Whilst this is legal, Nick Clegg believes the Tycoon Tax is justified as “It <b>makes</b> <b>people</b> so incredibly <b>angry</b> when you are getting up early in the morning, working really hard to try {{to do the right thing}} for your family and for your community, you are paying your taxes and then you see people ... who are paying extraordinarily low rates of tax.” ...|$|R
