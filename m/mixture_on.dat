He then proceeded to toss books around and smear the <b>mixture</b> <b>on</b> objects in the building. The man, identified by police as Mahoud Samed Almahadin, was charged with burglary, criminal mischief, and aggravated harassment as hate crimes. Two weeks later, 21-year-old film student and Anonymous member Jacob Speregen was charged with aggravated harassment and criminal mischief as hate crimes after he filmed Almahadin carrying out his prank. According {{to his mother and}} the video, Speregen was filming the event from behind the barricade. Scientology critics Mark Bunker and Jason Beghe disagreed with the individual's actions.|$|E

30|$|The EC 50 {{values of}} the binary <b>{{mixtures}}</b> <b>on</b> wheat (Table  4) clearly show that mixtures containing Alachlor were the most toxic ones and have the lowest TU. In contrast, mixtures that did not contain Alachlor had the highest EC 50, which in some cases were several hundred times higher. This indicates that Alachlor {{is responsible for the}} toxicity of the mixture against wheat. These results agree with (El-Nahhal et al. 1998, 2013 a) who found that wheat was sensitive to Alachlor and Acetochlor, respectively. Statistical analysis of the phytotoxic effects of the <b>mixtures</b> <b>on</b> the test plant showed significant differences on melon growth p-values, which were less than 0.01. No significant differences were detected on the effect of <b>mixtures</b> <b>on</b> molokhia and wheat, indicating similar effects of p-values above 0.05 (data not shown). The explanation of these variations is given above.|$|R
25|$|In screen-printing a {{fine screen}} of bolting silk or similar {{material}} is stretched taut onto a frame {{similar to the}} way canvas is prepared before painting. A colloid sensitized with a dichromate is applied evenly to the taut screen. Once the dichromate mixture is dry, a full-size photographic negative is attached securely onto the surface of the screen, and the whole assembly exposed to strong light – typically about half an hour in bright sunlight – hardening the exposed colloid. When the negative is removed, the unexposed <b>mixture</b> <b>on</b> the screen can be washed off with warm water, leaving the hardened mixture intact, acting as a precise mask of the desired pattern, which can then be printed with the usual screen-printing process.|$|E
500|$|Helium as a {{breathing}} gas has no narcotic properties, so helium mixtures such as trimix, heliox and heliair {{are used for}} deep diving to reduce the effects of narcosis, which worsen with increasing depth. As pressure increases with depth, {{the density of the}} breathing gas also increases, and the low molecular weight of helium is found to considerably reduce the effort of breathing by lowering the density of the mixture. This reduces the Reynolds number of flow, leading to a reduction of turbulent flow and an increase in laminar flow, which requires less work of breathing. At depths below [...] divers breathing helium–oxygen mixtures begin to experience tremors and a decrease in psychomotor function, symptoms of high-pressure nervous syndrome. This effect may be countered to some extent by adding an amount of narcotic gas such as hydrogen or nitrogen to a helium–oxygen mixture.-He-O2 <b>mixture</b> <b>on</b> the HPNS up to 450 msw |journal=Undersea Biomed.

500|$|Brian Lowry, {{reviewing}} the two-part premiere for Variety, felt that giving Atwell her own television series was [...] "a pretty smart bet" [...] by Marvel, {{and he called}} the episodes [...] "considerable fun". He noted the period setting as contributing to this, and positively mentioned the score by composer Christopher Lennertz. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "the show isn't as retro-stylish as it thinks it is ... the first hour of Agent Carter feels like an above-average episode of Young Indiana Jones Chronicles", noting that it tonally aims for His Girl Friday, Dick Tracy, and Alias ("A tough tonal <b>mixture</b> <b>on</b> a weekly broadcast budget, but also an ambition worth pursuing"), but praised Atwell's performance, calling her [...] "a delight" [...] and [...] "firing on all cylinders". Franich was negative about what he saw to be common MCU tropes, notably [...] "Somebody named Stark invented something dangerous; everyone wants an All-Important Glowing Thing; there's an implicit promise that nothing will be solved for weeks/years to come." [...] Though he was wary about the series being forced {{to contribute to the}} rest of the MCU, he did note that [...] "Agent Carter feels pleasantly segmented off from the greater Marvel Machinery".|$|E
40|$|Crop variety {{mixtures}} (different {{varieties of}} a crop grown {{together in a}} single plot) have been successfully deployed in pathogen and pest management for several crops including wheat, common bean and rice. Despite the available evidence, promotion of this approach has remained limited in many countries, including Uganda. The factors that influence farmers' adoption of varietal mixtures for common bean and banana were assessed, {{as well as the}} perceptions of farmers on the effects of <b>mixtures</b> <b>on</b> yields, through household surveys and statistical modelling. A three-year yield increase in both common bean and banana varietal mixtures in farmer fields, of 5. 2 % and 28. 6 %, respectively, is realized using robust OLS estimates. The study reveals that accessing knowledge on the importance of crop varietal mixtures and the skills relating to the approach are crucial for their adoption. Location of the farm significantly determined the perceived yield change, which calls for more research into mixtures' suitability under particular contexts in respect to compatibility of genotypes, management practices and appropriate acreage for maximum impact. The positive effects of <b>mixtures</b> <b>on</b> yields make it an effective biologically friendly economy strategy.

2500|$|In 1855, Dr. J. Foster Flagg, a {{professor}} of dental pathology in Philadelphia, experimented with new mixtures of amalgam. In 1861, he presented his findings to the Pennsylvania Association of Dental Surgeons and, in 1881, he published his book, Plastic and Plastic Fillings (Figure 4). (Amalgam fillings were often called [...] "plastic fillings" [...] at the time.) The inevitable result of this affair was that silver amalgam was proven to be, [...] "an excellent filling material," [...] and expanded dentistry's, [...] "ability to save teeth." [...] Around the same time, John and Charles Tomes in England conducted research on the expansion and contraction of the various amalgam products. During the American Civil War, {{the debate on the}} merits of amalgam continued. In dental meetings, with now decades of use and dental research came the recognition of the importance of good technique and proper <b>mixture</b> <b>on</b> long-term success. It was argued that, [...] "the fault was not in the material but in the manipulation....Some men's amalgam is good universally, and some men's gold is bad universally; the difference lies in the preparation of the tooth and in the plug (filling)." ...|$|E
2500|$|CDI {{triggered}} by {{two sets of}} points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design {{is a lack of}} engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the <b>mixture</b> <b>on</b> overrun also contributes to erratic and [...] "lumpy" [...] running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were {{triggered by}} an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, [...] "afterfiring"). Engine braking is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the [...] "A". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any [...] "M" [...] (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki {{toyed with the idea of}} two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with so much of their engineering on this bike, overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in the rotor housing (NGK A9EFV).|$|E

40|$|In this {{manuscript}} we review {{the use of}} mechanistic models to interpret effects of mixtures of compounds {{within the framework of}} the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. Within this approach the effect of a mixture is built up from the effects of the individual components making up the mixture. Understanding effects of mixtures is essential as it is impossible to assess effects of all possible mixtures experimentally. In contrast to the more classical way of interpreting effects of mixtures with concentration addition or effect addition models, DEB theory offers a single consistent framework to understand effects of <b>mixtures</b> <b>on</b> growth, reproduction and survival in an integrated, way. It systematically incorporates exposure time and biology of the organisms, including the natural links between the processes of feeding, maintenance, growth, development and reproduction. We also give directions for an experimental setup to interpret the results within the DEB framework. The DEB framework was successfully applied to assess effects of complex <b>mixtures</b> <b>on</b> survival and binary <b>mixtures</b> <b>on</b> sub-lethal endpoints. It gives the possibility to explain observed interactions by the underlying biological mechanisms or pinpoint interactions. We expect this approach to help in identifying key mechanisms and enable to focus further research in cooperation with modelers and experimentalists to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mixture toxicity. © 2009 Elsevier B.
