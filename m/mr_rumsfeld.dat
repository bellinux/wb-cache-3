[...] Scott said [...] "most {{of the movie}} deals with {{a period of a}} few months {{in the spring and summer}} of 2003, when a series of decisions were made that did much to determine the terrible course of subsequent events" [...] and wrote [...] "the knowledge and expertise of military, diplomatic and technical professionals was overridden by the ideological certainty of political loyalists." [...] Scott also remarked, [...] "It might be argued that since Mr. Bremer, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> and Mr. Wolfowitz declined to appear in the film, Mr. Ferguson was able to present only one side of the story. But the accumulated professional standing of the people he did interview, and their calm, detailed insistence on the facts, makes such an objection implausible."

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn {{the process of}} the European implementation of a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) at Maastricht in December 1991 until the Franco-British declaration on European defense at Saint-MlÌ o in December 1998, the EU's European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) etched out the initial concept of a European Pillar within the framework of NATO expressed in NATO's European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI). The Franco-British declaration at Saint- MlÌ o demonstrated the willingness of some EU member states to promote autonomous military capabilities within the EU that enables the EU to act outside of NATO's framework. The further development of ESDP led to concern among NATO officials and US diplomats regarding ESDP's potential challenging appearance to NATO. US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld expressed this concern about a growing EU opposition to the transatlantic policy of alliance. In January 2003, during the Iraq Crisis, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> labeled France and Germany as the "Old Europe". The relation of ESDP to NATO is strongly affected by the national interests of leading European actors like France and Germany. The development of ESDP as either a competitor or support arm of NATO depends on whether the French or the German approach to European security becomes dominant. Major, German Air Forc...|$|E

40|$|This article {{appeared}} in Strategic Insights (April 2003), v. 2 no. 4 An intellectual {{equivalent of a}} raid is how a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) staffer described US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's proposal for a rapidly deployable response force during the September 2002 meeting of NATO Defense Ministers. With relatively little warning to Alliance colleagues, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> proposed {{the establishment of a}} robust, NATO force capable of more than just flag-waving. This force, {{often referred to as the}} NATO Response Force or NRF, is intended not only to have fairly sharp teeth but also to be the vehicle that brings other Alliance forces and concepts into the 21 st century. Many observers believe that this US proposal, timed as it was just a few months before the Prague Summit, was offered to downplay the Summit's enlargement policies (thereby not offending the Russians) and to give NATO Allies one last clear chance of developing a credible war-fighting capability. A kinder view holds that the NRF is a bit of an olive branch designed to allay fears of increasing US isolationism, particularly based on American exclusion of NATO during major portions of Operation Enduring Freedom, and presents a tangible link between the United States, NATO and even the European Union (EU). Everyone recognizes that NATO's European members need to increase their military capabilities relative to their American counterpart. The NRF may offer a way to refocus national economic resources devoted to the Defense Capabilities Initiative (DCI) and to serve as the catalyst for NATO's military transformation efforts. This document explains why NATO must properly organize, train, and equip their joint combined force for significant crisis response capability, especially in the area where European Union efforts fall short: warfighting capability...|$|E
5000|$|After the Interment Service, Mrs. Ford and {{her family}} and President Ford's brother, Dick Ford, spent a few moments at the casket and then {{proceeded}} inside the Museum. Vice President and Mrs. Cheney, President and Mrs. Carter, and former Secretary and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Rumsfeld</b> approached the casket together for their final farewells.

40|$|The war is {{over and}} history is forgotten, says Simon Adams There are things we are not {{supposed}} to mention about the war in Iraq. Like the fact that our troops are participants in the most unpopular war in modern history. Even before a single shot was fired there were massive protests. And since March 20 literally {{millions of people around the}} world have marched against the US-led invasion. The Vietnam War was never this immediately and globally unpopular. Not even after years of napalm, not after My Lai, not ever. While the initial stage of the invasion, with tanks racing across the desert, facilitated a partial boost in approval of the ‘support our troops’ variety, even this has been undermined by the growing death toll of Iraqi civilians and coalition soldiers. The shocking and awful missile barrage of Iraq’s cities, the ongoing ‘pockets of resistance’ which seem much deeper than anyone imagined, and the fact that the most powerful nation in history has so far been mightily unsuccessful in conquering a Third World country, has not helped either. Vietnam must have haunted the dreams of Bush and Rumsfeld in Washington this past week. When Bush the Elder fought the first Gulf War in 1991 he said it shattered forever America’s ‘Vietnam Syndrome’. What then, do we make of the quagmire that his son has now immersed America in? Call it the revenge of history. I’m old enough to remember when Saddam Hussein was our comrade in arms. I lived in America between 1979 and 1983. I recall the yellow ribbons we tied around trees at my school - a ribbon a day, for each of the 444 days the American hostages remained prisoners of fanatical Muslim students in Teheran. Old enough to recall when Ayatollah Khomeini was public enemy number one. Old enough to remember learning that we (meaning the Americans and I, a foreigner) had allies in the Middle East and that one of the greatest of these was the nation of Iraq whose armies were marching against the evil Iranians. When Iraq invaded Iran in 1980 Saddam was considered a potential ally in a treacherous region. His brutal regime was secular and his Ba’ath Party had wiped out the Iraqi Communist Party. Like the Americans, Saddam hated and feared Iran’s Islamic revolution. He seemed like the kind of guy Washington could do business with. The fact that Saddam’s regime brutalised and tortured its own people was a peripheral matter. Bigger issues of geopolitics and American hostages were at stake. In 1982 President Reagan removed Iraq from the US State Department’s list of states that supported terrorism. Throughout the Iran-Iraq War America was openly with Saddam against Iran. The links between Washington and Baghdad extended to the Americans sharing sensitive satellite intelligence with the Iraqi Army so they could wage war more effectively. The US Navy provided armed escorts for Iraqi oil tankers. And in December 1983 US President Ronald Reagan even sent a special envoy - a certain <b>Mr</b> Donald <b>Rumsfeld</b> - to meet Saddam Hussein and establish a closer relationship with the Iraqi dictator. No wonder Rummy claims such insight into the minds of Iraq’s brutal rulers - he’s supped with them as their guest! Not that you’ll hear him mention this on CNN. These days Rummy works for President Bush the Younger as Secretary of Defense. He speaks continually of ‘weapons of mass destruction’ and Saddam’s appalling human rights record. Maybe he really does know something that we don’t. Maybe Saddam took Rummy into his confidence all those years ago in Badghad? After all, the lines between trusted ally and evil tyrant were apparently a lot less clear then than they are today. Bush the Younger, in arguing in favour of an invasion of Iraq, sometimes recalls Iraq’s use of chemical weapons against the Kurds. Like the appalling incident in March 1988 when Iraqi forces gassed over four thousand Kurds in Halabja. Bush has called this an act of attempted genocide. The problem is that none of it is news. The American State Department and CIA were aware of the Iraqi military’s use of chemical weapons throughout the 1980 s while Iraq was a US ally. On 20 March 1984, for instance, US intelligence sources reported that they had ‘incontrovertible evidence that Iraq has used nerve gas in its war with Iran and has almost finished extensive site for mass-producing the lethal chemical agent’. And yet this did not stop the United States from re-establishing full diplomatic ties with Iraq in November that year. Nor did it stop the US from continuing to support Saddam’s war against Iran. Indeed when the US Senate, or the United Nations, attempted to constrain Iraq the Reagan administration intervened. In March 1986, for example, the UN Security Council proposed a declaration against Iraq’s use of chemical weapons. The United States voted against the declaration. Britain and Australia abstained. The war continued. As did the trade, according to a 1994 US Senate Committee Report, of materials used in manufacturing chemical weapons. From 1985 - 1989 about a dozen US companies were involved in exporting biological agents to the Iraqis, assisting them in making, among other things, deadly anthrax. The US Department of Commerce licensed this trade. That is, until the end of the Iran-Iraq War and the Cold War altered the structure of allegiance in the Middle East. The Iran-Iraq War continued until 1988, by which time a million people had been killed. It is now a matter of public record that the Reagan administration secretly traded weapons for hostages with the Iranians in the early 1980 s. What was largely overlooked in the resulting ‘Iran-Contra Scandal’, however, was the fact that Washington had therefore militarily supported both sides of the Iran-Iraq war, possibly prolonging the killing. One million dead. This is only a small part of the history not mentioned on CNN. And certainly not on FoxNews where the disgraced cold warrior Oliver North, the Pentagon’s ‘fallguy’ during the Iran-Contra Scandal, now works as a frontline reporter. This current war in Iraq is an elaborate exercise in political amnesia. No matter how long, or what new twists it takes, it remains morally wrong. As Czech author Milan Kundera once wrote, the struggle for human freedom is the struggle of memory against forgetting. Now more than ever.
