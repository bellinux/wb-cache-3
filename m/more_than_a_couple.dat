Bifocal hybrid laser welding (BHLW) demonstrates how this material can be welded reliably without defects. The used hybrid laser system consists of a Nd:YAG laser and a high power diode laser (HPDL). This leads to a high welding penetration in combination with a high seam quality. This publication demonstrates that the BHLW process is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupled</b> deep penetration welding (DPW) process with a heat conduction welding (HCW) process.

Again the Laurel Hill line repulsed the Union troops with heavy losses. Grant was forced to postpone his 5 p.m. coordinated assault until Warren could get his troops reformed. Not informed of the delay, Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott of the II Corps moved his division forward at 5 p.m. toward the tip of the Mule Shoe. When his men reached the open field, Confederate artillery ripped them to shreds, and they retreated. At around 6 p.m., Col. Emory Upton led a group of 12 hand-picked regiments, about 5,000 men in four battle lines, against an identified weak point {{on the west side of}} the Mule Shoe. The plan was for Upton's men to rush across the open field without pausing to fire and reload, reaching the earthworks before the Confederates could fire <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of shots. The plan worked well initially, but Generals Lee and Ewell were quick to organize a vigorous counterattack with brigades from all sectors of the Mule Shoe. No Union supporting units arrived.
