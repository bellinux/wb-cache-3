50|$|Since the {{earliest}} {{surveys of the}} area, theories about {{the movement of the}} JF <b>Microplate</b> have evolved to include compression of the plate through rotational movement and also shear zones between two major plates and the JF <b>Microplate</b> driving this clockwise rotational movement. The Pacific Plate is estimated to have a spreading rate anywhere between 13 and 16 cm/yr in relation to the Juan Fernandez <b>MicroPlate.</b> This spreading ridge supplies magma {{to the west of the}} plate, acting as a lubricant. In the development stages of the <b>microplate,</b> the Pacific Plate also shared a coupled shear section to the south of the <b>microplate</b> and, together with the Nazca Plate, drove fast rotation of the <b>microplate.</b> Approximately 2.5 Ma ago the JF <b>Microplate</b> began decoupling from the Pacific Plate and coupling with the Antarctic Plate. The latter severely braked the rotational movement of the <b>microplate.</b> Now, the Nazca and Antarctica Plates, are the plates that share the current shear zones with transform faulting between them and the JF Plate. The Nazca Plate shears to the east while the Antarctica Plate shears relatively to the west, and this continues to drive the rotation of the <b>microplate</b> clockwise as well as consequential compression however at a much slower rate. Compression has been observed on the Juan Fernandez <b>Microplate</b> at the Pacific-Nazca-JF triple junction and the Nazca-Antarctic-JF triple junction, due to the slightly irregular shape of the plate which does not rotate perfectly about its center.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>microplate</b> {{is divided}} into two regions between north (Northern Galapagos <b>Microplate)</b> and south (Galapagos <b>Microplate).</b> The Galapagos <b>Microplate</b> is bounded by the Dietz {{volcanic}} ridge at 1°10'N, south of the Cocos-Nazca Ridge, and the Northern Galapagos <b>Microplate</b> (NGMP) is bounded by the Incipient Ridge at 2°40'N, north of Cocos-Nazca Ridge. The westward propagating and slowly diverging Cocos-Nazca Ridge cuts between the two sub-plates toward the East Pacific Rise. However, the tip of Cocos-Nazca Ridge does not fully meet the East Pacific Rise and, in fact, the westerly propagating Cocos-Nazca Ridge generates secondary transient rifts by shear stresses. The tip of the Cocos-Nazca ridge has maintained a distance of 50 km from the East Pacifc Rise and slightly moved its position into {{the eastern part of the}} <b>microplate</b> due to clockwise rotation of the GMP.|$|R

40|$|The GLORIA {{and other}} {{geophysical}} data obtained during {{this study have}} enabled the entire present-day tectonic pattern of the Easter <b>Microplate</b> to be determined. The complex nature {{of all of the}} plate boundaries has been revealed, and there is evidence of rapid plate boundary evolution. Earthquake focal mechanisms together with GLORIA data have provided the first unequivocal evidence that thrust faulting is taking place along the northern boundary of the <b>microplate.</b> On the Nazca plate {{to the north of the}} Easter <b>Microplate,</b> the GLORIA images have disclosed a series of prominent east-west trending ridges which earthquake focal mechanisms and plate tectonics of the region imply are the first known case of intraplate thrusting in young oceanic lithosphere. Slightly younger Nazca plate lithosphere to the north is overthrust over marginally older lithosphere to the south, in order to accommodate the tectonic shortening predicted in the region. Interpretation of magnetic anomaly data and the complex structural information offered by the GLORIA images have permitted a detailed history of the <b>microplate</b> to be determined. Three-plate Nazca-Pacific, Nazca-Easter and Pacific-Easter Euler poles have been calculated and used to rotate the Easter <b>Microplate</b> and surrounding major plates back in time since the East Rift of the <b>microplate</b> first started to propagate northwards at around 5. 25 Ma. The <b>microplate</b> has evolved in two stages. The first is from 5. 25 Ma to around 2. 5 Ma, and involved continuous northward propagation of the East Rift, while the West Rift became segmented along new transform faults as it adjusted to keep the overall Nazca-Pacific velocities constant. The transpressive northern boundary migrated with the East Rift tip, while the transtensional southern boundary remained more or less still. At sometime after 2. 5 Ma, the East Rift ceased northward propagation and the Southwest Rift began to open up along the transtensional Pacific-Easter transform. A convergent northern boundary formed involving southward overthrusting of the Nazca plate to the north over the <b>microplate.</b> No more Nazca plate lithosphere from the north of the <b>microplate</b> was transferred to the <b>microplate</b> interior, and the Pito Deep region was caused to open up by pervasively rifting apart pre-existing Nazca plate lithosphere. This study predicts that the Easter <b>Microplate</b> will be transferred onto the Pacific plate within the next 2 - 5 myr, when the Southwest Rift has propagated through to the southern EPR, and the shear couple on the <b>microplate</b> has ceased...|$|R

40|$|We use {{two-dimensional}} elastic {{finite element}} analysis, supplemented by strength estimates, {{to investigate the}} driving mechanism of the Easter <b>microplate.</b> Modeled stresses are compared with the stress indicators compiled from earthquake focal mechanisms and structural observations. The objective is to constrain the tectonic forces that govern the Easter <b>microplate</b> rotation and to test the <b>microplate</b> driving hypothesis proposed by Schouten et al. [1993]. We infer that the mantle basal drag cannot drive the <b>microplate</b> rotation but opposes it, and that the asthenospheric viscosity {{is no more than}} about 1 × 1018 Pa s. At most, the basal drag comprises 20 % of the force resisting <b>microplate</b> rotation. The outward pull of the main plates can drive the rotation by shear drag applied along the northern and southern boundaries of the <b>microplate.</b> However, we propose an additional driving force which arises from the strong variation of the ridge resistance force along the east and west rifts, so that the main driving torques come from the pull of the major plates acting across the narrowing and slowing rifts. This requires the strength to increase substantially toward the rift tips due to thickening of the brittle lithosphere as the spreading rate slows...|$|R

50|$|This <b>microplate</b> is {{estimated}} to have formed approximately 3-4 Ma ago. Once one single spreading center, the East Pacific Rise at this location split in two, and resulted in two separate spreading ridges between the Nazca Plate and the Pacific Plate. The two spreading ridges, along with the Chile Rise, bounded the JF <b>microplate.</b> These two spreading centers then accreted material onto the JF <b>microplate</b> until it grew into the recognizable shape it is today. As it grew, the northern boundary of the <b>microplate</b> most likely experienced compression due to extreme clockwise rotational force provided by the eastern shear of the Nazca Plate and the western shear of the Pacific Plate. As the Nazca plate has a close coupling to the northern boundary of the plate, rotation of the JF <b>Microplate</b> was at its peak during its beginning stages of formation nearing rotational speeds of 32° per Ma. However, approximately 2.5 Ma ago, the south-eastern tip of the <b>microplate</b> collided against a fracture zone within the Antarctic Plate thus causing compression of the <b>microplate</b> against the Antarctic Plate and therefore stagnating its rotational motion down to approximately 9° per Ma at approximately 1 Ma ago. The original couplings causing shear then changed from the Pacific-JF and Nazca-JF boundaries to the Atlantic-JF boundary and Nazca-JF boundaries. The past 1 Ma has not seen any significant change in plate rotation and growth rate since.|$|R
