40|$|AbstractModelling surface {{microstructural}} {{changes is}} a key issue when considering the manufacture of critical metallic parts. During machining, extreme conditions of temperature and deformation appear in the cutting zone. Consequently, surface microstructure is strongly affected with {{a direct impact on}} its integrity and the fatigue resistance of the part. Thus the machining effect on the 15 - 5 PH steel surface has been underlined. To explain and predict the formation of this modified surface layer, the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) has been considered. Firstly, a DRX model has been identified using dynamic compressive tests. The calibrated DRX model is composed of two parts: a criterion of initiation and an evolution law. EBSD maps obtained from compressed samples show recrystallized microstructures comparable with <b>micrographys</b> of machined surface. Then, the DRX model has been implemented in an ALE orthogonal cutting model. Numerical simulation results predict the recrystallized layer at the machined surface.

The vesicles isolated with percoll, have precursors of 11 S globulins, &# 945;-TIP, &# 948;-TIP, BiP, and two proteins that have homology to the pumpkin vacuolar sorting receptor PV 72.

Thus, membrane stability, water absorption–release, phase transitions and phase transition temperatures were studied through different methods during heating cycles. Hydrogel films were realized using an oligomer mixture (HEMA–PEGDA 575 /photo-initiator) with adequate viscosity. Then, the fibers were deposited over silicon wafers (hydrophilic substrate) through electrospinning technique using four different voltages: 15, 20, 25 and 30 kV. The films were then exposed to UV light, favoring polymer chain crosslinking and interactions between hydrogel and substrate. For samples deposited at 20 and 25 kV, hierarchical wrinkle folds were observed at surface level, their arrangement distribution depends directly on thickness and associated point defects. DPPC bilayers were then placed over hydrogel scaffold using Langmuir–Blodgett technique. Field emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FE-SEM) analysis were used to investigate sample surface, <b>micrographies</b> show homogeneous layer formation with chain polymer order/disorder related to applied voltage during hydrogel deposition process, among other parameters.

Therefore, 64 bacterial genomes belonging to seven different phyla (whose four PVC phyla) were studied. We reconstructed the evolution of the cell plan as precisely as possible, thanks to information obtained by bibliographic study and electronic microscopy.

The proportion of HGT does not seems to be related to the cell plan of bacteria, suggesting that compartmentalization does not induce a protection of bacterial DNA against HGT.
