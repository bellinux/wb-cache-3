50|$|Geometrical {{models of}} nucleic acids {{are used to}} predict {{tertiary}} structure. This is important because designed nucleic acid complexes usually contain <b>multiple</b> <b>junction</b> points, which introduces geometric constraints to the system. These constraints stem from {{the basic structure of}} nucleic acids, mainly that the double helix formed by nucleic acid duplexes has a fixed helicity of about 10.4 base pairs per turn, and is relatively stiff. Because of these constraints, the nucleic acid complexes are sensitive to the relative orientation of the major and minor grooves at junction points. Geometrical modeling can detect strain stemming from misalignments in the structure, which can then be corrected by the designer.|$|E
50|$|At {{the apex}} of the V was a {{junction}} allowing northbound trains to take either of the branches north, and likewise allow the trains south from the branches to join the single southbound track. This resulted in four connecting tunnels. When the CCE&HR and City & South London Railway (C&SLR) lines were joined together after the C&SLR became part of the Underground Group on 1 January 1913, a short extension was planned from the Euston terminus of the City & South London Railway to connect with the CCE&HR south of Camden Town station allowing services to run from both City and West End branches to and from the Hampstead and Highgate branches. City Branch services were extended to this station on 20 April 1924. This complex tunnelling work added another four tunnels that allows trains to proceed to or from either the Edgware or High Barnet Branch on to or off both the City or Charing cross branch without following conflicting paths The <b>multiple</b> <b>junction</b> tunnels are effectively located beneath Camden High Street.|$|E
50|$|In a {{conventional}} solar cell, light is absorbed by a semiconductor, producing an electron-hole (e-h) pair; the pair may be bound and {{is referred to}} as an exciton. This pair is separated by an internal electric field (present in p-n junctions or Schottky diodes) and the resulting flow of electrons and holes creates electric current. The internal electric field is created by doping one part of semiconductor interface with atoms that act as electron donors (n-type doping) and another with electron acceptors (p-type doping) that results in a p-n junction. Generation of an e-h pair requires that the photons have energy exceeding the bandgap of the material. Effectively, photons with energies lower than the bandgap do not get absorbed, while those that are higher can quickly (within about 10−13 s) thermalize to the band edges, reducing output. The former limitation reduces current, while the thermalization reduces the voltage. As a result, semiconductor cells suffer a trade-off between voltage and current (which can be in part alleviated by using <b>multiple</b> <b>junction</b> implementations). The detailed balance calculation shows that this efficiency can not exceed 31% if one uses a single material for a solar cell.|$|E

As opposed to the continuous transitions of the translationally invariant ($M= 2 $) and semi-infinite ($M= 1 $) system, the local order parameter {{is found to be}} discontinuous for $M> 2 $.

In the active phase, the estimate is compatible with the bulk value, while in the inactive phase it exceeds the bulk value and increases with $M$. The unusual local critical behavior is explained by a scaling theory with an irrelevant variable, which becomes dangerous in the inactive phase.
