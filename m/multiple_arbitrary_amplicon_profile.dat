40|$|A ligase {{mediated}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (LMPCR) was developed to amplify between the repetitive element, IS 1533, of Leptospira and adjacent chromosomally located BglII restriction endonuclease enzyme sites. To do this, complimentary oligonucleotide linkers designed to anneal together with an overhanging BglII end were ligated to BglII digested DNA from 35 leptospiral reference strains and field isolates, This ligated DNA was used as template for PCR with oligonucleotide primers specific for the linker and for the repetitive element IS 1533. The resultant <b>amplicon</b> <b>profile</b> hybridised a 102 hp region derived from the terminus of IS 1533 thus confirming that amplicons generated by LMPCR contained part of IS 1533. The number of fragments generated containing IS 1533 was significantly fewer than that generated by RFLP but the LMPCR method {{has the potential to}} use far less template DNA and be quicker than standard RFLP. Obvious and reproducible interserovar differences were demonstrated by LMPCR whereas for 20 of 21 L. hardjo-bovis isolates tested no intraserovar differences were observed. Of those serovars known to possess IS 1533 homologues and tested here by LMPCR, each produced a unique <b>amplicon</b> <b>profile</b> which hybridised the IS 1533 terminus probe. The limited heterogeneity amongst hardjo-bovis isolates is discussed as is the potential contribution of this method to diagnosis, differentiation and the phylogenetics of the Leptospires...|$|R

40|$|Fifty {{isolates}} of {{the most}} common UK strain of Clostridium difficile [polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotype 001] were analysed by three PCR-based typing methods in order to determine genomic diversity within this strain that may form the basis of a subtyping method. The three methods used were repetitive extragenic palindromic elements (REP), conserved repetitive DNA elements (BOX), and enterobacterial repetitive PCR intergenic consensus sequences (ERIC). The performance of each typing method was assessed by comparing powers of discrimination, typeability and reproducibility. All methods had satisfactory levels of typeability and reproducibility as determined by blind-coded repeats, but REP-PCR typing proved to be the most discriminatory method, yielding seven distinct <b>amplicon</b> <b>profiles</b> consisting of up to eight major bands. BOX-PCR generated between two and five major amplicons with four distinct BOX profiles. ERIC-PCR primers, however, could not discriminate between isolates. These results suggest that PCR ribotype 001 is not clonal in nature at present, and that REP-PCR subtyping methods offer promise to further our understanding of the epidemiology of C. difficile PCR ribotype 001 disease in UK hospitals...|$|R

Plants have {{a large number of}} defence related genes which trigger a cascade of defense responses that halt the spread of pathogens. Knowledge of the diversity present in genes related to the defense against Sigatoka disease will be useful in developing disease resistant banana cultivars. The defence genes of all sterile commercial banana cultivars (AAA genomes) are considered to have arisen from a similar gene pool belonging to the Musa acuminata complex. The objectives of this study were, (i) to assess the disease response of twelve banana cultivars to M. eumusae, (ii) to assess the level of polymorphisms in selected genes associated with defence against Sigatoka in banana, and (iii) ascertain if this polymorphism was related to levels of resistance to M. eumusae. Defence genes reported to act in response to M. fijiensis were selected and related to the response of M. eumusae. The genetic diversity of selected defence gene analogs (DGA) was assessed using degenerate primers designed from conserved motifs in the aligned amino acid sequences from known resistance genes. Highly polymorphic <b>amplicon</b> <b>profiles</b> for DGAs were selected for comparison. Cluster analysis was used to differentiate to some extent, cultivars considered as resistant/susceptible to M. eumusae.

Interestingly, E. coli strains isolated from certain finisher hog groups exhibited resistance against 2 - 7 antimicrobials, but strains isolated from multiparous sow groups in each herd were resistant to only 2 - 4 antimicrobial agents. When randomly selected 108 tetracycline-resistant isolates were tested for the presence of resistance genes, the following genes tet(A) (n = 6), tet(B) (n = 95), tet(D) (n = 1) or both tet(A) and tet(B) (n = 6) were found to be distributed among them.

Recently, cultivated products of Chinese Poria strains have accounted for most of the market, while the cultivation of Japanese Poria strains has not been successful. Aiming to determine the relationship between the differences in cultivation characteristics and genetic polymorphism, we conducted a field cultivation experiment, a rot test, and rapid amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis of Poria strains collected from China and Japan: 3 Chinese and 7 Japanese strains. In field cultivation, although there was no marked inferiority of Japanese strains to Chinese ones in either mycelium propagation or the rate of sclerotium formation, Chinese strains formed whiter sclerotia with a mean size more than twice that of Japanese ones. Representatives of Chinese and Japanese strains, Yunnan and Kaimondake, respectively, were tested for wood-rotting ability.

Salmonella spp. can survive {{for long periods}} in natural waters, and the persistence of specific and epidemic strains is of great concern in public health. However, the diversity of species found in the natural environment remains unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the diversity of Salmonella strains isolated from different natural aquatic systems within a Mediterranean coastal watershed (river, wastewater, and marine coastal areas). A total of 574 strains isolated from these natural environments were identified by both conventional serotyping and the ribosomal spacer-heteroduplex polymorphism (RS-HP) method (M. A. Jensen and N. Straus, PCR Methods Appl. 3 : 186 – 194, 1993). More than 40 different serotypes were found, and some serotypes probably mobilized from widespread animal-rearing activities were detected only during storm events. These serotypes may be good indicators of specific contamination sources. Furthermore, the RS-HP method based on the PCR amplification of the intergenic spacer region between the 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes can produce <b>amplicon</b> <b>profiles</b> allowing the discrimination of species at both serotype and intraserotype levels.

The latter was shown subsequently to lack the required specificity, so we undertook genetic studies of the HDP 2 sequence from T. saginata and T. asiatica to determine why, and to develop a novel HDP 2 -PCR protocol for the simultaneous unambiguous identification of human taeniids. Sequencing and further analysis of the HDP 2 DNA fragments of 19 Asiatic isolates of T. saginata and T. asiatica indicated that the HDP 2 sequences of both species exhibited clear genomic variability, due to polymorphic variable fragments, that could correspond to the non-transcribed region of ribosomal DNA. This newly observed polymorphism allowed us to develop a novel, reproducible and reliable HDP 2 -PCR protocol which permitted the simultaneous discrimination of all T. saginata and T. asiatica isolates examined. This species-specific identification was based on, and facilitated by, the clear size difference in <b>amplicon</b> <b>profiles</b> generated: fragments of 1300 bp, 600 bp and 300 bp were produced for T. asiatica, amplicons of 1300 bp and 300 bp being obtained for T. saginata.

To investigate the impact of diuron on whole prokaryotic communities that underpin the marine food web and are integral to coral reef health, GBR lagoon water was incubated with diuron at environmentally-relevant concentration (8 µg/L), and sequenced at specific time points over the following year. 16 S rRNA gene <b>amplicon</b> <b>profiling</b> revealed no significant short- or long-term effect of diuron on microbiome structure. The relative abundance of prokaryotic phototrophs was not significantly altered by diuron, which suggests that they were largely tolerant at this concentration. Assembly of a metagenome derived from waters sampled at a similar location in the GBR lagoon did not reveal the presence of mutations in the cyanobacterial photosystem that could explain diuron tolerance. However, resident phages displayed several variants of this gene and could potentially {{play a role in}} tolerance acquisition. Slow biodegradation of diuron was reported in the incubation flasks, but no correlation with the relative abundance of heterotrophs was evident. Analysis of metagenomic reads supports the hypothesis that previously uncharacterized hydrolases carried by low-abundance species may mediate herbicide degradation in the GBR lagoon. Overall, this study offers evidence that pelagic phototrophs of the GBR lagoon may be more tolerant of diuron than other tropical organisms, and that heterotrophs in the microbial seed bank may have the potential to degrade diuron and alleviate local anthropogenic stresses to inshore GBR ecosystems...|$|R

NP samples from infants were passaged in enrichment media, and metagenomic DNA was purified and sequenced. In silico capsular serotyping of these 51 metagenomic assemblies assigned known serotypes in 28 samples, and the co-occurrence of serotypes in 5 samples. Eighteen samples were not typeable using known serotypes but did encode for capsule biosynthetic cluster genes similar to non-encapsulated reference sequences.

In addition, the in silico serotype analysis proved powerful in determining the serotypes in S. pneumoniae carriage, and may lead to developing better targeted vaccines to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in these countries.
