In this study, {{we examine the}} effects of tick size on spreads, depths, and quote clustering using trade and quote data for a large sample of KSE-listed stocks. Our results indicate that large tick sizes imposed on high-price stocks are significant binding constraints on absolute spreads, resulting in large spreads for these stocks. We do not find any convincing evidence of larger <b>market</b> <b>depths</b> associated with larger tick sizes. On the contrary, we find stocks that move to smaller tick categories actually exhibit an increase in <b>market</b> <b>depths.</b> Our results also show that quote clustering on the KSE is negatively related to the tick size. Overall, our findings indicate that step-increasing tick sizes are detrimental to market quality, although the adverse effect of binding tick sizes is somewhat mitigated by lower negotiation costs...|$|R

On November 5, 2001, the SET implemented tick size reduction on stocks below THB 25. Even though trading on the Thai Exchange is largely dominated by retail investors, the tick reduction produces similar empirical results found in markets where institutional investors are more dominant.

40|$|Limit order {{markets with}} {{stationary}} dynamics attract equal volumes of market orders and uncanceled limit orders, equalizing the {{supply and demand}} for liquidity and immediacy. To maintain this balance, market orders must share any benefit obtained by limit order traders from more efficient trading conditions, such as better order queuing policies. Therefore an efficient market places a low price on immediacy, producing small bid-ask spreads. Furthermore, when price-discreteness leads to a mainly constant spread, cutting the price tick raises surplus. This is modeled with a stochastic sequential game, using stationarity considerations to bypass direct analysis of traders' intricate market forecasts.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{multiple}} tick sizes implemented by purely order-driven markets {{may not be}} optimal. Evidence from the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) suggests that tick sizes are strong binding constraints on the quoted bid-ask spreads. More than 90 % of the investors quote in one-tick spread, implying that tick sizes may be too large. The findings also indicate that tick sizes between Baht 0. 01 and Baht 1. 00 would, in general, enhance market liquidity by improving <b>market</b> <b>depths</b> and keeping trading costs low. It can be concluded that the SET could have implemented smaller ticks and fewer pricing grids. A reduction in tick size by half for the higher-priced range between Baht 200 - 400 causes minimal change in quoted depths and trading volume, while significantly decreasing quoted bid-ask spreads...|$|R

Using a detailed dataset of daily repurchase transactions on the Stockholm Stock Exchange together with intraday data on bid-ask spreads and order depths {{enable us to}} examine liquidity effects on the actual repurchase days. Overall, we find that repurchase trades inside the order driven trading system contributes to market liquidity through narrower bid-ask spreads and deeper <b>market</b> <b>depths.</b> After controlling for total trading volume, price, and volatility we still find a significant decrease of the bid-ask spread on repurchase days relative to surrounding non-repurchase days. However, repurchases executed as block trades outside the order driven trading system have a detrimental effect on the bid-ask spread, consistent with a negative response {{to the presence of}} informed managerial trading.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} pre-trade information transparency in pre-open call auction on market liquidity on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE). We examine the natural experiment affected by the Shanghai Stock Exchange in July 2006 when it changed its pre-open auction algorithm from an entirely black box into a limited transparent system with a closed order book. We find {{that the increase in}} pre-trade information transparency coincides with a statistically significant reduction in spread at the best quotes. The reduction in spread persists even after controlling for known determinants of depth. Furthermore, there is also evidence of a statistically significant reduction in <b>market</b> <b>depths.</b> Finally, the ratio of trading volume to total volume during call auction increases significantly over the first 15 minutes of continuous trading. We conclude that in a more transparent call auction, the change from an entirely black box into a limit transparent limit order book has led to an improvement in market quality in terms of market liquidity and increased participation in the call auction by investors...|$|R
40|$|We {{study in}} detail and {{explicitly}} solve {{the version of}} Kyle’s model introduced in a specific case in [2], where the trading horizon is given by an exponentially distributed random time. The {{first part of the}} paper is devoted to the analysis of time-homogeneous equilibria using tools from the theory of one-dimensional diffusions. It turns out that such an equilibrium is only possible if the final payoff is Bernoulli distributed as in [2]. We show in the second part that the signal of the market makers use in the general case is a time-changed version of the one that they would have used had the final payoff had a Bernoulli distribution. In both cases we characterise explicitly the equilibrium price process and the optimal strategy of the informed trader. Contrary to the original Kyle model it is found that the reciprocal of <b>market’s</b> <b>depth,</b> i. e. Kyle’s lambda, is a uniformly integrable supermartingale.

50|$|In economics, {{a market}} is {{transparent}} if much is known by many about: What {{products and services}} or capital assets are available, <b>market</b> <b>depth</b> (quantity available), What price, and Where. Transparency is important since {{it is one of}} the theoretical conditions required for a free market to be efficient. Price transparency can, however, lead to higher prices. For example, if it makes sellers reluctant to give steep discounts to certain buyers (e.g. disrupting price dispersion among buyers), or if it facilitates collusion, and price volatility is another concern. A high degree of market transparency can result in disintermediation due to the buyer's increased knowledge of supply pricing.|$|E

50|$|Truly dark {{liquidity}} can {{be collected}} off-market in dark pools using FIX and FAST protocol based APIs. Dark pools are generally {{very similar to}} standard markets with similar order types, pricing rules and prioritization rules. However, the liquidity is deliberately not advertised—there is no <b>market</b> <b>depth</b> feed. Such markets have no need of an iceberg-order type. In addition, they prefer not to print the trades to any public data feed, or if legally required to do so, will do so with as large a delay as legally possible—all to reduce the market impact of any trade. Dark pools are often formed from brokers' order books and other off-market liquidity. When comparing pools, careful checks should be made as to how liquidity numbers were calculated—some venues count {{both sides of the}} trade, or even count liquidity that was posted but not filled.|$|E
5000|$|Some markets allow dark {{liquidity}} to {{be posted}} inside the existing limit order book alongside public liquidity, usually {{through the use}} of iceberg orders.

Such orders will, therefore, get filled less quickly than the fully public equivalent, and they often carry an explicit cost penalty in the form of a larger execution cost charged by the market. Iceberg orders are not truly dark either, as the trade is usually visible after the fact in the market's public trade feed.|$|E

40|$|There is {{consensus}} in the marketing literature that market knowledge and cross-functional collaboration are two fundamental resources for successful product innovation. However, few studies examine the dimensions or characteristics of market knowledge and how and why these resources influence product innovation performance. Drawing on contingency theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm, {{the authors argue that}} knowledge integration mechanisms may account for the effects of market knowledge dimensions (i. e., breadth, depth, tacitness, and specificity) and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation performance. They find that market knowledge specificity and cross-functional collaboration affect product innovation performance through knowledge integration mechanisms. In contrast, whereas the effect of <b>market</b> knowledge <b>depth</b> is partially mediated, market knowledge breadth has a direct, unmediated effect on product innovation performance. A test of an alternative moderating perspective shows that the effects of <b>market</b> knowledge <b>depth</b> and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation are negatively moderated by knowledge integration mechanisms. By showing the differential effects of market knowledge dimensions on product innovation performance, the authors provide a more refined understanding of the interplay among market knowledge, its integration, and the firm’s performance in product innovation. The authors also conclude that by overlooking the role of knowledge integration mechanisms, previous research may have provided an overly optimistic view of the value of cross-functional collaboration in product innovation...|$|R
