40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and numerical study of light propagation in graded-index (GRIN) <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> where the core diameter has been periodically modulated along the propagation direction. The additional {{degree of freedom}} represented by the modulation permits to modify the intrinsic spatiotemporal dynamics which appears in <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers.</b> More precisely, we show that modulating the core diameter at a periodicity close to the self-imaging distance allows to induce a Moiré-like pattern, which modifies the geometric parametric instability gain observed in homogeneous GRIN fibers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> (MMFs) {{are limited}} in data rate {{capabilities}} owing to modal dispersion. However, their large core diameter simplifies alignment and packaging, and makes them attractive for short and medium length links. Recent {{research has shown that}} the use of signal processing and techniques such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) can greatly improve the data rate capabilities of <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers.</b> In this paper, we review recent experimental work using MIMO and signal processing for <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers,</b> and the improvements in data rates achievable with these techniques. We then present models to design as well as simulate the performance benefits obtainable with arrays of lasers and detectors in conjunction with MIMO, using channel capacity as the metric to optimize. We also discuss some aspects related to complexity of the algorithms needed for signal processing and discuss techniques for low complexity implementation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{overview}} {{recent advances}} in the spatio-temporal nonlinear dynamics of optical pulses propagating in <b>multimode</b> optical <b>fibers.</b> The Kerr effect leads to spatial beam self-cleaning in a graded-index <b>multimode</b> optical <b>fiber,</b> followed by sideband series generation spanning multiple octaves. Effectively single mode supercontinuum spanning from the visible to the mid-infrared was also demonstrated. Enhancement of Kerr beam self-cleaning was observed in active fiber with quasi-step index profile. Moreover, mutual self-cleaning was recently reported for both the fundamental and the second harmonic beams in optically poled <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> with cubic and quadratic nonlinearity...|$|R
50|$|A {{single-mode}} laser {{launch into}} the center of a <b>multimode</b> <b>fiber</b> can generate multiple signals that confuse the receiver {{at the other end of}} the fiber. These multiple signals, caused by Differential Mode Delay (DMD) effects, limit the system distance lengths for operating Gigabit Ethernet. Mode Conditioning Patch Cord eliminates these multiple signals by aligning the single-mode launch away from the center of a <b>multimode</b> <b>fiber</b> core. This offset launch creates a transmitted signal that is similar to typical multimode light emitting diode (LED) launches.|$|E
50|$|In <b>multimode</b> <b>fiber</b> optics, mandrel {{wrapping}} is {{a technique}} used to preferentially attenuate high-order mode power of a propagating optical signal. Consequently, if the fibre is propagating substantial energy in affected modes, the modal distribution will be changed.|$|E
50|$|Multimode {{and single}} mode {{are two types}} of {{commonly}} used optical fiber. <b>Multimode</b> <b>fiber</b> uses LEDs as the light source and can carry signals over shorter distances, about 2 kilometers. Single mode can carry signals over distances of tens of miles.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{remarkable}} {{progress in}} wave-front shaping has enabled control of light propagation inside linear media to focus and image through scattering objects. In particular, light propagation in <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> comprises complex intermodal interactions and rich spatiotemporal dynamics. Control of physical phenomena in <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> and its applications {{is in its}} infancy, opening opportunities {{to take advantage of}} complex mode interactions. In this work, we demonstrate a wave-front shaping approach for controlling nonlinear phenomena in <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers.</b> Using a spatial light modulator at the fiber input and a genetic algorithm optimization, we control a highly nonlinear stimulated Raman scattering cascade and its interplay with four wave mixing via a flexible implicit control on the superposition of modes that are coupled into the fiber. We show for the first time versatile spectrum manipulations including shifts, suppression, and enhancement of Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks. These demonstrations illustrate the power of wave-front shaping to control and optimize nonlinear wave propagation. Comment: 11 pages 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|<b>Multimode</b> optical <b>fibers</b> are not {{intended}} to be used with 1550 -nm sources; however, it is desirable to utilize 1300 / 1550 -nm wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) on some <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). No information from fiber vendors nor from the literature is available to support this use. Preliminary studies at KSC have suggested that these fibers might be usable at 1550 -nm if the fibers possessed enough bandwidth when sourced by LEDs. Detailed bandwidth studies were made on 12 <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> using 1300 - and 1550 -nm lasers and LEDs. The results showed that the modal bandwidth at 1550 -nm was about 50 percent of the 1300 -nm value and that the chromatic dispersion could be predicted by extrapolating the vendor's specifications for wavelengths outside the 1550 -nm region. Utilizing these data, predictions of the fiber's optical bandwidth were accurately made. Problems with launch conditions and possible differential attenuation at connectors was noted at 1300 -nm but was less significant at 1550 -nm. It appears that the <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> studied will offer adequate performance in the 1550 -nm region for a number of current KSC needs. Studies of additional fibers are encouraged to gain more confidence and better understanding of the 1550 -nm bandwidth of KSC's <b>multimode</b> optical <b>fibers</b> before committing to 1300 / 1550 -nm WDM...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> and single-mode <b>fibers.</b> <b>Multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|R

Angular dispersion is then applied to the spectrum using a lens. The input facet of a <b>multimode</b> <b>fiber</b> is placed at the lens focus such that the various spectral components are coupled into different fiber modes. The figure inset illustrates how different spectral components are coupled into and propagate in the <b>multimode</b> <b>fiber.</b> The dashed line represents the optic axis of the fiber. Although the configuration shown provides anomalous dispersion, the CMD can be tuned throughout both the anomalous and normal dispersive regimes by adjusting the alignment of the lens and fiber relative to the spatially dispersed spectrum.|$|E

40|$|<b>Multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> are {{attractive}} {{for a variety}} of applications such as internet data transfer, data center hubs, micromanipulation, optogenetics and other biomedical applications. A major hurdle for imaging through <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> is the occurring scrambling, resulting in a randomization of light. Recently, clear imaging has been successfully accomplished using wavefront shaping, but the spatial information was transferred synchronously only. We demonstrate asynchronous information transmission using individual phase conjugations by employing only one spatial light modulator with multiple windows. Our findings pave the way towards individual signal transfer inside strongly scattering media. Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to errors in some equation...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of photon-pair generation in a <b>multimode</b> optical <b>fiber</b> via nonlinear four-wave mixing and intermodal phase-matching. We show that in <b>multimode</b> optical <b>fibers,</b> {{it is possible to}} generate correlated photon pairs in different fiber modes with large spectral shifts from the pump wavelength, such that the photon pairs are immune to contamination from spontaneous Raman scattering and residual pump photons. We also show {{that it is possible to}} generate factorable two-photon states exhibiting minimal spectral correlations between the photon pair components in conventional <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers</b> using commonly available pump lasers. It is also possible to simultaneously generate multiple factorable states from different FWM processes in the same fiber and over a wide range of visible spectrum by varying the pump wavelength without affecting the factorability of the states. Therefore, photon-pair generation in <b>multimode</b> optical <b>fibers</b> exhibits considerable potential for producing state engineered photons for quantum communications and quantum information processing applications...|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} {{deleterious}} mechanically induced modulation is speckle noise created in a <b>multimode</b> <b>fiber</b> by an imperfect splice or imperfectly mated connectors.

50|$|Using an EtherChannel has {{numerous}} advantages, {{and probably}} the most desirable aspect is the bandwidth. Using the maximum of 8 active ports a total bandwidth of 800 Mbit/s, 8 Gbit/s or 80 Gbit/s is possible depending on port speed. This assumes there is a traffic mixture, as those speeds {{do not apply to}} a single application only. It can be used with Ethernet running on twisted pair wiring, single-mode and <b>multimode</b> <b>fiber.</b>|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, a mode {{scrambler}} mode mixer is a device for inducing mode coupling in an optical fiber, or a device that, itself, exhibits a uniform output intensity profile {{independent of the}} input mode volume or modal excitation condition. Mode scramblers are used to provide a modal distribution that is independent of the optical source for purposes of laboratory, manufacturing, or field measurements or tests. Mode scramblers are primarily used to improve reproducibility of <b>multimode</b> <b>fiber</b> bandwidth measurements.|$|E
5000|$|Modal {{dispersion}} {{limits the}} bandwidth of <b>multimode</b> <b>fibers.</b> For example, a typical step-index fiber with a 50 µm core {{would be limited}} to approximately 20 MHz for a one kilometer length, in other words, a bandwidth of 20 MHz·km. Modal dispersion may be considerably reduced, but never completely eliminated, by the use of a core having a graded refractive index profile.

50|$|If <b>multimode</b> <b>fiber</b> {{bandwidth}} {{is measured}} using {{a laser diode}} directly coupled to its input, the resulting measurement can vary {{by as much as}} an order of magnitude. This measurement variability is due to the combination of differences in laser output characteristics (emitted mode power distribution) and the differential mode delay of the fiber. Differential mode delay is the difference in the time delays amongst the fiber's propagating modes caused by imperfections or nonideality of the fiber refractive index profile.|$|E

In 10BASE-F, the 10 represents its maximum throughput of 10 Mbit/s, BASE indicates its use of baseband transmission, and F indicates that it relies on medium of fiber-optic cable. In fact, {{there are at least}} three different kinds of 10BASE-F.

50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of a mode {{scrambler}} {{is to create a}} uniform, overfilled launch condition that can be easily reproduced on multiple measurement systems, so that measurement systems have essentially the same launch conditions and can measure approximately the same bandwidth despite having different laser sources.
