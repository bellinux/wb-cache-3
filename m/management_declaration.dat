40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of a desire to include social factors {{alongside}} environmental and economic considerations in Life Cycle Assessment studies for the construction sector. We describe a specific search for a method to include injurious impact for construction Life Cycle Assessment studies, by evaluating a range of methods and data sources. A simple case study using selected Accident Compensation Corporation information illustrates that data relating to injury could provide a compelling evidence to cause changes in construction supply chains, and could provide an economic motive to pursue further research in this area. The paper concludes that limitations notwithstanding, the suggested approach could be useful as a fast and cheap high level tool that can accelerate the discussions and research agenda that will bring about the inclusion of social metrics in construction sector supply chain <b>management</b> and <b>declarations...</b>|$|R
40|$|A 45 -year-old woman {{presented}} with acute onset of head-ache and confusion. A computed tomography (CT) {{of the brain}} showed predominant intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) without significant subarachnoid hemorrhage (Figure 1 A and B). A CT angiography showed a laterally oriented, left pos-terior communicating artery (PCOM) aneurysm (Figure 1 C). This aneurysm, confirmed by cerebral angiography (Figure 1 D), was successfully coil embolized. The ventriculostomy {{was placed in the}} right lateral ventricle to treat the obstructive hydrocephalus. The patient survived without major neurologi-cal deficits. Although ruptured cerebral aneurysms rarely present as isolated IVH, laterally oriented PCOM aneurysms can rupture through the medial temporal lobe, causing predominant IVH without subarachnoid hemorrhage. 1 This case highlights the importance of urgent vascular imaging for optimal IVH evaluation and <b>management.</b> 2 <b>Declaration</b> of Conflicting Interests The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

In the digital world, images are available in various formats. They are simple to copy and resell without any loss of quality. In Digital Asset Management System (DAMS), media data is handled in compressed and encrypted form. It becomes necessary to watermark this form of data to copyright <b>management</b> purpose, ownership <b>declaration</b> and tamper detection. By watermarking the compressed and encrypted data, there is degradation of an image quality. Rational Dither Modulation is an alternative to Quantization Index Modulation with volumetric invariance. In the proposed scheme, using compression, the information of raw media is packed and an encryption algorithm randomize the compressed bit stream. Rational Dither Modulation embeds watermark in the compressed and encrypted domain and extraction of watermark {{can be done in}} encrypted and decrypted domain. The digital media is often distributed by multiple levels of distributors in encrypted and compressed form. Rational Dither Modulation investigates security, perceptual quality, embedding capacity and robustness...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The OMG Data-Distribution Service (DDS) is an {{emerging}} specification for publish-subscribe datadistribution systems. The {{purpose of the}} specification {{is to provide a}} common application-level interface that clearly defines the data-distribution service. The specification describes the service using UML, thus providing a platformindependent model that can then be mapped into a variety of concrete platforms and programming languages. DDS attempts to unify the common practice of several existing implementations enumerating and providing formal definitions for the QoS (Quality of Service) settings {{that can be used to}} configure the service. In this paper we provide a comparative overview of the data distribution service with respect to high-level architecture. We describe the equivalent terminology and concepts, and highlight the key similarities and differences in the areas of <b>declaration</b> <b>management,</b> object management, data distribution management, ownership management, federation management, and time management. We explore the architectural mapping between HLA and DDS. We develop an outline for translating from one model to the other, and examine the needed supporting transformations and assumptions. We conclude with remarks and observations on building applications that can utilize both HLA and DDS technologies. ...|$|R

Edgardo C and S. Pradhan (eds) (2007) 367,The Many Faces of Corruption: Tracking Vulnerabilities at the Sector Level, Washington DC, World Bank. Customs inefficiencies are well known to impede the integration of developing countries into the global economy. There {{are a number of}} bottlenecks to trading across borders. Among these bottlenecks, with their attendant costs, are: Excessive documentation, inadequate procedures and lack of audit-based controls; lack of risk assessment and management techniques; lack of modern infrastructure; lack of automation and use of computerized procedures; and lack of transparency. All these couples together create an environment rife with corruption as traders seek to process their transaction at whatever cost. Paying bribes then becomes {{the order of the day}} and result into an added cost to trading. In this era of globalization, an enormous demand has been placed on customs administrations especially in Africa to simplify their procedures so as to enable firms to participate meaningfully in international and regional trade. The complexity and costs of transactions, including corruption must be eliminated, thus the urgent need for trade facilitation. This study seeks to emphasize the potential of trade facilitation as a policy measure that can reduce the prevalence and negative effects of corruption in customs. While obviously not a cure-all for the wide variety of corrupt transactions taking place in customs administrations, this study will show that trade facilitation can nonetheless be of considerable help in dealing with corruption in customs.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{outbreak}} of Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa in 2014 - 2015 was unprecedented {{in terms of}} its scale and consequence.   This, together with the emergence of Zika virus as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in 2016, has again highlighted the potential for disease to spread across international borders and provided an impetus for countries to review their Port Health preparedness. This report reviews the legislative framework and actions taken under this framework in advancing and improving Port Health preparedness in Ireland, in response to the declaration of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern for Ebola Virus Disease in August 2014. Findings Infectious disease Shipping and Aircraft Regulations were brought into force in Ireland in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Preparatory actions taken under these and the International Health Regulations necessitated significant levels of cross disciplinary working with other organisations, both within and beyond traditional healthcare settings. Information packs on Ebola Virus Disease were prepared and distributed to airports, airlines, port authorities and shipping agents, and practical exercises were held at relevant sites. Agreements were put in place for contact tracing of passenger and crew on affected conveyances and protocols were established for the <b>management</b> of Medical <b>Declarations</b> of Health from ships coming from West Africa. Conclusions The {{outbreak of}} Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa resulted in significant strengthening of Ireland’s Port Health preparedness, while also highlighting the extent to which preparedness requires ongoing and sustained commitment from all stakeholders, both nationally and internationally, in ensuring that countries are ready when the next threat presents at their borders...|$|R
40|$|Lombardy is {{a region}} of Northern Italy, located in the wide and flat Po Valley where arable crops are {{widespread}} and agriculture is very intensive. Within this region, the GIS system SIARL (Sistema Informativo Agricolo Regione Lombardia), {{is used for the}} registration and <b>management</b> of farmer <b>declarations</b> when applying for EU subsidies. According to provisions under EU law, land use history referring to the past 5 years is required to be documented therefore, land use is registered {{on the basis of the}} declaration at the time of its introduction. In particular, farmers applying for public subsidies and growing GM crops are obliged to declare the GM seeds or plants cropped. The aim of the simulation is to quantify in a real agricultural context, the potential GM cropping area in 3 different intensively cropped areas (municipalities) of Lombardy region. This simulation will take into consideration the historical cropping systems, farming systems and size and rotation schemes. Simulations using 3 different cropping distances, allow for gauging the three municipalities¿ availability of agricultural land suitable to for the expansion of maize cropping to GM cultivars. Results indicated area suitability is very limited in 2 simulations out of 3, but the establishment of an ad hoc procedure for crop declaration prior neighbors¿ authorization could extend the suitable area in all simulations. This suggests that, in this case, land use distribution, more than isolation distances and relative maize area percentage, is the most significant variable. These results can assist in outlining the management control strategy and features of the control program to be triggered. This system is can be adapted to other crops. JRC. DDG.

40|$|Since September 11, 2001, the Department of Energy has, {{on several}} occasions, revised its {{security}} posture based on identified threats and adversaries. These revisions in security posture have driven Departmental sites {{to upgrade their}} defensive and tactical equipment. Subsequent changes in the perceived threats have, in some cases, led {{to a reduction in}} the need for certain types of weapons, thus creating a pool of surplus equipment. These surplus weapons could potentially be used by other Department sites and Federal law enforcement agencies. Recent Office of Inspector General reports have raised concerns with the adequacy of controls related to defensive and tactical equipment. For example, our report on Management Controls Over Defense Related High Risk Property (OAS-M- 08 - 06, April 2008) found that administrative controls over certain defense related high risk property were not sufficient for providing accountability over these items. Because of prior reported weaknesses in controls over defensive and tactical equipment, we initiated this audit to determine whether the Department and its contractors were properly managing excess weapons inventories and selected sensitive equipment used by protective forces. Our review disclosed that the Department was not always properly managing its inventories of excess weapons and selected sensitive equipment. We identified issues with the retention of unneeded weapons at many locations and with the identification and tracking of sensitive items. More specifically: Sites maintained large inventories of weapons that were no longer needed but had not been made available for use by either other Departmental sites or other Federal law enforcement agencies. For instance, at six of the locations included in our review we identified a total of 2, 635 unneeded weapons with a total acquisition value of over $ 2. 8 million that had not been officially declared as excess - an action that would have made them available for others to use. In addition; Sites were not always identifying, tracking and properly disposing of potentially high risk and sensitive equipment. In particular, we identified control weaknesses in this area related to weapons sights and scopes. These issues occurred because the Department did not have processes in place to properly manage excess inventories of weapons. In particular, the Department does not have requirements for ensuring timely declaration of excess weapons. Additionally, certain sites indicated that they were unwilling to give up excess weapons because of the possibility that they may be needed in the future. However, other sites had a need for some of these weapons and could have avoided purchasing them had they been made available through the excess screening process. Also, we found that the Department lacks clear guidance on the identification of high risk/sensitive equipment. Except for immaterial differences, we were able to locate and verify accountability over the items of defensive and tactical equipment we selected for review. Specifically, we took statistical samples of weapons, ammunition, and other related equipment and were able to verify their existence. While these accountability measures were noteworthy, additional action is necessary to strengthen controls over weapon and sensitive equipment <b>management.</b> Untimely <b>declaration</b> of excess weapons may result in an inefficient use of scarce Government resources. Similarly, if selected high risk/sensitive equipment is not properly categorized and tracked, accountability issues may occur. To address these issues, we made recommendations aimed at improving the management of these categories of defensive and tactical equipment...|$|R
