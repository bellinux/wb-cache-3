Due to the ad-hoc nature of daughtercell BS deployments such as pico and femto cells, the mutual interference varies and obviously the coverage probability behaves differently in terms of transmit powers and densities of macrocells and daughtercells. In this paper, we employ repulsive cell activation in the interfering daughtercell network and see {{the impact of a}} <b>minimum</b> <b>separation</b> distance between the daughtercell BSs in terms of coverage under open access and power efficiency.
