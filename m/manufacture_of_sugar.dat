50|$|The sawmill at Trafalgar Vale was {{established}} initially to cut timber for extensions to Burnett's sugar mill, but local orders for milled hardwood had {{encouraged him to}} expand his sawmilling operations. Subsequently, political antipathy toward the indentured labour system and the potential expense of converting his sugar mill to the vacuum pan method, prompted Burnett to turn to sawmilling as his principal enterprise. By November 1884 he had ceased the cultivation and <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> at Trafalgar Vale, and had established in its place what he claimed was the largest country sawmill in the colony.|$|E
50|$|Later Mapes {{became known}} as an {{analytical}} chemist, and his analyses of beer and wines, made at requests of the senate of New York and the temperance societies, were regarded as standard experiments. He {{was one of the}} first manufacturer of magnesium sulfate from magnesium hydrobisilicate and the author of many improvements in tempering steel, distilling, dyeing, and other areas. In 1832 he invented a new system of sugar refining and later an apparatus for manufacturing sugar from the cane. He was the inventor of processes for tanning leather and the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> from West India molasses. He also designed a centrifugal machine for separating molasses from sugar.|$|E
50|$|In 1830 he was {{appointed}} lecturer on natural history at Yale University, and held that place until 1847. He was associated with Silliman in the scientific examination of the culture and <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> that was undertaken by the latter at the special request {{of the secretary of}} the treasury; and the southern states, particularly Louisiana and Georgia, were assigned to him to report upon. From 1834 until 1861, he filled the chair of chemistry of the Medical College of South Carolina in Charleston. He relinquished the position {{at the beginning of the}} Civil War, but in 1865, upon the urgent invitation of his former colleagues, he resumed his duties for a few years.|$|E
50|$|Glycoside hydrolases are {{predicted}} to gain increasing roles as catalysts in biorefiningapplications {{in the future}} bioeconomy.

Cellulases are added to detergents for the washing of cotton fabrics and assist in the maintenance of colours through removing microfibres that are raised from the surface of threads during wear.|$|R
5000|$|Child {{worked for}} some time as the sub-master of the Boston Latin School. He was {{secretary}} of legation in Lisbon about 1820, and subsequently fought in Spain, “defending what he considered the cause of freedom against her French invaders.” Returning to the United States in 1824, he began in 1825 to study law with his uncle, Tyler Bigelow, in Watertown, Massachusetts, and {{was admitted to the}} bar.

40|$|Utah {{is one of}} {{the pioneers}} in the beet-sugar industry. The first sugar factory was brought into the State in 1852, but, like all the early {{attempts}} to produce sugar from beets in the United States, the enterprise was unsuccessful. In 1891 a factory was erected at Lehi when there were less than a half a dozen factories in the United States. From this time on Utah {{has been one of the}} few states of the Union important in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> beet <b>sugar.</b> Since soil, climate, irrigation, and labor conditions are favorable to the crop, it is probable that sugar-beets will continue to be raised in large quantities in Utah...|$|R
50|$|During 1999-2000, {{the water}} quality of the {{reservoir}} has been investigated from 16 sampling points on the river and its tributaries, by the Ministry of Environment and the Litani River Authority {{as a part of}} an exercise to evolve management plan for the Litani River and Lake Qaroun's catchment. It has been noted that seven sewer networks drain directly into the river. Untreated sewage from the towns of Baalbek, Houch el Rafqa, Qaa er Rim, Zahle, Chtoura, Qabb Elias, Bar Elias, Joub Jannine and Qaraoun flow into the Litani River or its tributaries, apart from industrial effluents many factories related to <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar,</b> paper, lead, limestone crushers, agro-industries and also from poultry farms, tanneries and slaughterhouses. The pollution is noted by the high recorded values of BOD5 (79 mg/L) and nitrates (1.7 mg/L) in the Litani River.|$|E
50|$|Gifted with {{remarkable}} energy, he started many commercial enterprises, founding the first cotton factory at Passy in 1801, and a sugar factory in 1802 where Jean-Baptiste Quéruel developed the industrial <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> from sugar beet, {{and for which}} he was created a baron of the Empire. He sat in the chamber of deputies for many years, and was a strong advocate for many humane measures, notably the suppression of the Tours or revolving box at the foundling hospital, the suppression of the death penalty, and the improvement of the penitentiary system. He was made regent of the Bank of France in 1802, and was also member of, and, indeed, founder of many, learned and philanthropic societies. In 1818 He founded with Jean-Conrad Hottinger the first savings bank in France, the Groupe Caisse d'Epargne and maintained a keen interest in it until his death in 1847.|$|E
50|$|In 1862 John Buhot, {{originally}} from Barbados, in the West Indies, experimentally produced sugar granules from cane {{grown in the}} Brisbane Botanical Gardens, demonstrating its potential as a commercial crop in Queensland. A number of farmers were interested in growing cane, but little was known about its cultivation in local conditions, or about the production of sugar. In October 1864, Buhot came to Maryborough to purchase plants from John Eaton who was growing an experimental cane crop. While there, he gave a lecture at the School of Arts on the cultivation and <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> to a large audience. While in Maryborough, Buhot also trialled sugar production from some of Eaton's crop with promising results. Eaton and others formed the Maryborough Sugar Company in August 1865 and purchased 400 acres at Tinana for a plantation and mill. Several blocks were under cane by 1865 and the first crop was crushed by primitive methods producing a coarse yellow sugar.|$|E

50|$|In {{those parts}} of the {{governmental}} Department of Magdeburg which belonged originally to the former Archdiocese of Magdeburg and the Diocese of Halberstadt all Catholic life was not entirely destroyed during the Reformation. Besides fourteen monasteries that continued in existence, there were in Halberstadt a number of benefices in connexion with the cathedral and the collegiate Church of Sts. Peter and Paul. As the entire native population had become Protestant these monasteries were only maintained by the immigration of Catholics who, {{from the time of the}} Treaty of Westphalia, though in small numbers, steadily came into the country; thus there arose around the monasteries small Catholic communities. The monasteries were all suppressed during the great secularization of the beginning of the 19th century, and thirteen parishes were formed, for which the State provided a fund from a part of the property of the monasteries. The other parishes in the governmental Department of Magdeburg were created after the middle of the 19th century, when, in consequence of the development of the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar,</b> increasing numbers of Catholics came into the country; the St. Boniface Association gave the money to found these parishes.|$|E
5000|$|The Codrington owners {{distinguished}} {{themselves by}} ensuring that Betty’s Hope was developed and functioned as the most efficient large-scale sugar estate in Antigua. Two of their family members had the distinction of holding posts of the Governor General of the Leeward Islands between 1689 and 1704; even subsequently {{the members of the}} family also had their name established {{as one of the most}} influential and prosperous planters during the colonial rule. The estate was managed by a few Europeans, but the basic hard skilled and unskilled labour force was provided by the African slaves, which brought accolades to the estate (and then known as the [...] "flagship estate of Antigua"); the slaves were later emancipated in 1834 and they continued to serve the estate as freed labour. The Codringtons had 150 sugar mills in Antigua, of which Betty’s Hope was the first one where they had introduced technology innovations and ideas to carry out large scale cultivation, extraction and <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar.</b> In 1680, there were 393 slaves working on the estate. However, from 1921, sugarcane was extracted at the Central Sugar Factory, even though the Betty's Hope sugar mill was functional. After the Codrington family returned to England, the estate was managed by attorneys, till the early 1900s. In 1944, Betty's Hope was sold by the Codringtons to the Antigua Sugar Estates Ltd.|$|E
