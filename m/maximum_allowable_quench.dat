40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a study aimed at investigating the possibility of increasing the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> stresses in fibre-reinforced plastics compared to current practice. The study consisted of a comparison between the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> stresses of a group of cross-ply laminates, determined by deterministic analyses with safety and model factors as stated in design rules, and their probabilistic responses estimated with a fracture mechanics based model that accounted for material degradation. The results suggest that for the studied cases, the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> stresses do not provide the desired reliability; thus, their increase cannot be motivated. More importantly, the investigation shows that {{a better understanding of the}} effects of matrix cracks, and therefore, the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> crack density in a composite laminate, would lead to better and safer composite structures...|$|R

30|$|We {{investigate}} {{a method to}} set the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power for a secondary base station in dynamic spectrum sharing among secondary users and primary users. In conventional methods, location information is assumed. Thus, the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power can be set by considering the shadowing between the secondary base station and the primary user receivers to satisfy a constraint. Specifically, {{the probability that the}} interference from secondary base station exceeds the acceptable level must be less than the constraint target probability. We assume that the location information is not available at the secondary network. Instead, the secondary base station uses the received signal strength from the primary user transmitter for distance estimation. In this case, we have to consider shadowing not only between the secondary base station and the primary user receivers, but also between the primary user transmitter and the secondary receiver(s). We also need to account for the uncertainty of the distance. In order to satisfy the constraint target probability, we proposed a two-step approach to setting the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power where a transmission decision margin and a transmit power margin are utilized. To reduce these margins, we also propose cooperative <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power setting method utilizing also received signal strength values from several secondary users. Simulation results confirm the validity of the analysis and show the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power setting method, i.e., the capacity based on cooperative <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power setting method is significantly better than that of non-cooperative <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> transmit power setting method. In addition, we show a proper size of radius of additional separation area to protect primary users by the numerical results.|$|R
