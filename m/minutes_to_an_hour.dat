5|$|Riley and Nye made {{arrangements}} with James Pond {{to make two}} national tours during 1888 and 1889. The tours were popular and generally sold out, with hundreds having to be turned away. The shows were usually forty-five <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> long and featured Riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from Nye. The shows were informal {{and the two men}} adjusted their performances based on their audiences reactions. Riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility. Many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows. At a New York City show in March 1888, Augustin Daly was so enthralled by the show he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading Broadway theatre actors.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} step of nixtamalization, kernels of dried maize are cooked in an {{alkaline}} solution at or near the mixture's boiling point. After cooking, the maize is steeped in the cooking liquid for a period. The length of time for which the maize is boiled and soaked varies according to local traditions and the type of food being prepared, with cooking times ranging from a few <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> and soaking times from a few minutes to about a day.|$|E

25|$|They {{are natural}} hunters with an {{excellent}} {{ability to take}} training. Not only are they great pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water, {{making the most of}} their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly (Gottlieb, 1992). Vizslas are excellent swimmers and often swim in pools if one is available. Like all gun dogs, Vizslas require a good deal of exercise to remain healthy and happy. Thirty <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of exercise daily in a large off-leash area is optimal (Coffman 1992).|$|E
25|$|There is {{a gender}} {{division}} of labor {{in the process of}} collecting and sorting the trash in the Zabbaleen system. Usually, it is the Zabbaleen men, sometimes accompanied by children, who go pick up the trash door-to-door from each household. This trash is completely unsorted because there is not a system of recycling at the source in Egypt. It is rare for girls to go to collect the trash and it stops almost entirely after girls reach the age 10. The means of transportation that the Zabbaleen use to transport the trash that they collect are donkey-pulled carts and pickup trucks. After the Zabbaleen pick up the trash, they take the trash back to their village, a trip that may take anywhere from between 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and {{knowing what to do}} {{can mean the difference between}} a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to having abilities becoming stronger during the game, players are able to buy items that provide their own special abilities. Items {{are not limited to}} specific heroes, and can be bought by anyone. In order to obtain an item, players must be able to afford it with gold at shops located on the map, which is primarily obtained by killing enemy heroes, destroying enemy structures, and killing creeps, with the latter being an act called [...] "farming". Only the hero that lands the killing blow on a creep obtains gold from it, an act called [...] "last hitting", but all allies receive a share of gold when an enemy hero dies close to them. Players are also able to [...] "deny" [...] allied units and structures by last hitting them, which then prevents their opponents from getting full experience from them. Gold can not be shared between teammates, with each player having their own independent stash. Players also receive a continuous, but small stream of gold {{over the course of a}} match. Matches usually last between 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> although they can theoretically last forever as long as both Ancients remain standing.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{handling}} of ground combat {{received the most}} substantial criticism. Computer Gaming World's editorial staff wrote that the game's real-time combat system was [...] "handled so fast that players didn't have a chance in 90% of the battles." [...] According to reviewer L.S. Lichtmann, [...] "many are disappointed because the phased, tactical system of Traveller has been modified to have arcade game characteristics." [...] He also stated that the player does not compete on a [...] "level playing field" [...] {{when he or she}} must issue commands in real-time to individual party members engaged in combat while the computer simultaneously controls multiple non-player characters. Paragon responded to these criticisms by releasing an updated version of the game which gave the player the ability to pause the combat to issue orders to party members. But even after this update, some reviewers still found that, whenever possible, it is still far easier for the party to flee from ground combat situations than to fight. Moreover, immediately after the player assumes control of the party {{at the start of the}} game, it is attacked by well-armed opponents. The Computer Gaming World editorial staff criticized this design choice by stating that the [...] "player would have to run away from the first encounter or be killed within two minutes of spending 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> generating a character." ...|$|E

It is known as El Valle del Turabo (Turabo Valley) or La Ciudad Criolla (The Creole City) and its name {{originates}} from the Taíno cacique Caguax. Caguas is both a principal city of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area and the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area.|$|E
2500|$|SCARE for a CURE is an Austin, Texas-based nonprofit {{organization}} that raises money for local charities, including the Breast Cancer Resource Centers. Each year they produce an [...] "extreme, full contact, interactive haunted house adventure" [...] that runs around 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> long. This combination of interactive adventure game and haunted house was pioneered by Richard Garriott at his Britannia Manor haunted attraction which began in 1988 and ran every two years until 1994. [...] The torch was passed to Keith Ewing, former Britannia Manor construction manager, and continued in Wild Basin's Haunted Trails every year from 1996 to 2005.|$|E
2500|$|In June five adult actresses {{met with}} Hall's {{district}} director, Heather Hutt, at the legislator's office on Artesia Boulevard in Compton and presented 650 signed petitions asking that the Assemblyman withdraw his [...] "condoms in porn" [...] bill. At {{the meeting with}} Hutt were adult film actresses Nina Hartley, Alex Chance and Anikka Albrite, along with industry newcomers Mia Li and Charli Piper and Michael Stabile, a publicist {{who has been working}} with Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and Kink.com on the issue. The group expressed their disappointment with the bill {{and the fact that it}} had been created with no input from adult industry representatives. In an interview with AVN magazine, Chance stated the following,"We told [...] we have our own self-regulation..." [...] "We told her we wanted to have our voices heard. They'd had no performer input on this. About condoms and chafing and micro-tears, it didn't seem like she really knew all the details of that. She compared it to a dentist being forced to wear gloves, and maybe it's a little uncomfortable. She didn't realize why we have to have sex from 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> sometimes longer, and why that was necessary. She didn't know that the dangers of it, like if the condom breaks, and that we could get more STI's with the micro-tears, and just the condoms in general: Swelling, yeast infections, things of that nature—she just had no idea." [...] "She also didn't know about the doctors with the FSC that help make the decisions," [...] Chance added. [...] "It's not just a couple of people in a building making decisions for the whole industry. They don't even make decisions on the moratoriums; a doctor does, and she had no idea about that and what the testing protocols—how the doctors work with them to make the most safe tests available; she had no idea." ...|$|E
