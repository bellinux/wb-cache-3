40|$|AbstractVolatile {{compounds}} extracted by simultaneous distillation and extraction (SDE) from Dictyophora rubrovolota Zang, ji et liou {{were analyzed}} by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the aroma-active volatiles were identified by aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) method with gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O). 82 volatile components were identified by GC-MS, including 11 aldehydes, 10 ketones, 6 alcohols, 2 hydroxybenzenes, 9 esters, 19 acids, 14 hydrocarbons, and 11 other compounds. By GC-O analysis, 22 aroma-active compounds were identified, among which seven key flavor volatiles with high flavour dilution factor (FD) ranging from 27 to 3 included 2, 3 -pentanedione (FD 27, 0. 074 mg/kg, yogurt flavor), acetic acid (FD 27, 12. 72 mg/kg, sharp acidity), 2 -methylbutanoic acid (FD 27, 1. 039 mg/kg, smelly socks smell, aldehyde taste), (E) - 2 -octenal (FD 9, 0. 066 mg/kg, pine oil odour), 2 -phenyl- 2 -butenal (FD 9, 0. 12 mg/kg, astringent taste, aldehyde flavor, fragrant beans), benzaldehyde (FD 3, 0. 136 mg/kg, formaldehyde smell, resin taste), 3, 5 -diethyl- 2 -methyl-pyrazine (FD 3, 0. 082 mg/kg, <b>musty,</b> bark corrupt <b>taste,</b> smelly) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{case study}} details the {{deterioration}} of drinking water organoleptic quality in a distribution system by the apparition of a <b>musty</b> <b>taste</b> soon after a storage tank was recoated. Because this case could not be elucidated by the closed-loop stripping analysis followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses, the newer and more sensitive large-volume gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique was used. Chemical, sensory, and microbiological analyses were carried out to identify the compounds involved, their mechanism of formation, and their origin in the distribution system. The <b>musty</b> <b>taste</b> in drinking water was attributed {{to the presence of}} 2, 4, 6 -tribromoanisole (2, 4, 6 -TBA). This compound originated from 2, 4, 6 -tribromophenol (2, 4, 6 -TBP), which might have been metabolized to 2, 4, 6 -TBA by fungi living in the mass of the coating. Although the authors were unable to conclusively trace the origin of 2, 4, 6 -TBP, the study clearly showed that the odor in the drinking water was caused by leaching from the coating...|$|E
40|$|In April 2000, {{the water}} supply for Yorke Peninsula in South Australia was deemed non-potable when {{extracts}} from a proliferation of the benthic cyanobacterium Phormidium aff. formosum in Upper Paskeville Reservoir {{were found to be}} lethally toxic by intraperitoneal injection into mice (400 mg kg- 1). Routine water quality monitoring had failed to detect the development of the Phormidium until complaints of <b>musty</b> <b>taste</b> and odour, attributable to the production of 2 -methyl-isoborneol (MIB), were received from the consumers. The 185 ML open-balancing storage, receiving filtered and chloraminated water from the River Murray, was isolated from the drinking water supply and a health alert was issued to approximately 15, 000 consumers. The identity of the toxin(s) is thus far unknown, but clinical symptoms of toxicity in mice and chemical characteristics are distinct from the known major cyanotoxins. Preliminary characterisation of this toxin indicates that it has low solubility in water and organic solvents and is strongly associated with the particulate cellular material of the filaments. Toxicity of extracts was diminished by boiling and by treatment with chlorine, but not by chloramines. Further testing of floating cyanobacterial mats in the Torrens Lake in the city of Adelaide (Phormidium aff. formosum) and Myponga Reservoir (Phormidium aff. amoenum) in 2000 / 2001 was also found to be toxic by mouse bioassay. Toxicity is yet to be confirmed in monospecific cultured strains and further studies are required to identify the toxin and assess its health significance. Genetic characterisation of isolates has commenced in an attempt to classify their relatedness and to assist in the rapid identification of potentially toxic strains.

40|$|The role {{of natural}} biofilms {{affecting}} {{the water quality}} in rivers has been the main theme in this study. Firstly, the study developed the capacity of biofilms in retention and/or production of DOC. Secondly, the study also approached {{the production of the}} geosmin metabolite by benthic cyanobacterial mats. In the two developed aspects, the structure and function of the biofilms showed their relevance in evaluating the capacity of biofilms on the amelioration of the water quality. The importance of the biofilms on ecological research in running waters has been focus in their capacity of adsorption and transformation of nutrient, and therefore, in the self-purification capacity of streams and rivers. Biofilms are also major sites of carbon cycling in streams and rivers, affecting the water DOC dynamics. Eutrophication of streams and rivers have been also linked with an increase of algal biomass. As a consequence, the massive growth of cyanobacterial mats can cause the production of toxic and nuisance metabolites, like geosmin, a secondary metabolite which causes earthy and <b>musty</b> <b>taste</b> and odor in the water. The first conclusion of this study was that biofilms may {{play an important role in}} the retention of water DOC. We elucidated whether biofilms act as sinks or sources of fluvial DOC, depending on their structure and biomass accumulation. Metabolism (extracellular enzymatic activity) and structure (algae, bacteria, C/N content) of light-growth and dark-growth systems were analyzed over a year. Biofilms from the light-growth regime presented monthly variation in DOC uptake/release rates, but the annual average presented higher DOC uptake than dark-growth biofilms. However, the latter had a constant DOC consumption along the year, permitting a maintenance of low water DOC levels. The biofilm structure and the relative contribution of autotrophs and heterotrophs had a relevant implication in the carbon recycling, since metabolic activities were affected by variations in this structure. Geosmin production was related with the massive growth of benthic cyanobacteria (formed mainly by Oscillatoria limosa) in littoral zones, where water velocity was low, warmer temperatures and high nutrient concentration and low N/P ratio. The masses were further detached and drift downstream, being the responsible for the dispersion of geosmin along the river. The high biomass accumulation per surface unit, may cause a nutrient depletion inside the mat, e. g. nitrogen limitation. Structural and functional differences were found in the different fractions of the cyanobacterial mat (attached vs. free-floating). Free-floating mats presented higher biomass and exoenzymatic activities. Otherwise, the low phosphatase/aminopeptidase ratio found in both compartments indicated a nitrogen limitation inside the mats. Microstructural analyses with oxygen and redox microsensors have been useful to understand the function of the different cyanobacterial patches inside the mat. During the dark, Oscillatoria micro-patches aggregated and accumulated in thick masses where some anoxia conditions were found, giving a very low redox potential. This low diffusion could be associated with resource depletion, limiting the nutrient availability and defining the appropriate conditions for the geosmin production...|$|E
