During machining, the melted material by heat is dispersed into dielectric. The presence of minute metal particles (gap debris) contaminates dielectric fluid. It affects the material removal rate and properties of the machined surface because it exists in the spark gap between work and electrode. This work deals with the effect of the electrical conductivity of a dielectric fluid on the <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> and surface quality by WEDM. The specimens are three types of sintered carbides and a low-carbon steel. Experimental results show that increasing the fraction of cobalt in carbides improves the <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate,</b> but the surface quality is degraded as a greater quantity of solidified metal deposits on the eroded surface.

Tests were devised to investigate the deformation of three different grades of carbide, when machining steel (817 M 40, EN 24) under a wide range of conditions. Each test was carried out on a continuous (60 seconds) and an incremental (5, 5, 10, 20 and 20 seconds) basis. This plan was adopted to investigate transient effects. During each test the cutting forces were measured with a dynamometer, and the boundary temperatures were measured at the tool/chip interface and the tool/shank interface. The permanent deformation took the form of bulging on the flank face and depression of the rake face. With low <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> the deformation was minimal and the cutting edge was stable. High <b>metal</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> caused the tool to deform continuously and this gave an unstable cutting edge.
