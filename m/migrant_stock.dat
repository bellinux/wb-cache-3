There are reports of undocumented Emiratis who, because of their inability to be recognized as full citizens, receive no government benefits and have no labour rights. These stateless Emiratis — also known as bidun — either migrated to the UAE before independence or were natives who failed to register as citizens.

40|$|Recent work {{suggests}} that migrants {{have been a}} major driving force in the dramatic growth of international telephony over recent decades, accounting for large rises in telephone calls between countries with strong immigrant/emigrant connections.

It has also failed to go very far in examining how domestic and relational factors moderate (namely amplify or attenuate) the influence of <b>migrant</b> <b>stocks</b> on international calling. Our contribution addresses these gaps in the literature. For a sample, which includes a far larger number of countries than previous studies, we show that, together with shorter-term visitors, bilateral <b>migrant</b> <b>stocks</b> emerge as the relational variable with one of the substantively largest influences over cross-national patterns of telephone calls.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} global matrices {{of bilateral}} migrant stocks spanning the period 1960 - 2000, disaggregated {{by gender and}} based primarily on the foreign-born concept. Over one thousand separate census and population register records are combined to construct decennial matrices corresponding to census rounds for the entire period. In doing so, we provide for the first time, a complete picture of bilateral global migration over {{the last half of}} the twentieth century. The data reveal that the global <b>migrant</b> <b>stock</b> more than doubled from 76 to 159 million between 1960 and 2000. Quantitatively, South-South migration dominates the global <b>migrant</b> <b>stock,</b> constituting half of all international migration in 2000. In part, this is an artifact of the data, since millions of migrants were created overnight during the dissolution of India and Soviet Union. South-North migration is the fastest growing component of international migration however, and over our period the emigrant stock from Latin America surpassed those of both Europe and South Asia. The United States remains the most important migrant destination in the world, home to one fifth of the world’s migrants and the recipient of no less than fifty of the top migrant corridors in the world. Migration in Western Europe remains largely from elsewhere in Europe and the oil-rich Persian Gulf countries emerge as important destinations for migrants from the Middle East and South Asia.

Borjas? assertion ignores several recent papers that provide precisely that evidence of a powerful pro-trade effect of international migration. Here we extend that body of evidence by looking to history. We show that immigration, primarily from Europe between 1870 and 1910, had an important pro-trade effect on American exports. Our data set spans the exports of 44 commodities to 17 countries observed at 5 year intervals. We use a modified gravity model to examine the migrant stock-export relationship and find that United States exports to a country were positively related to the size of the <b>migrant</b> <b>stock</b> of immigrants from that country. The estimated strength of the effect varied across ?Old? Europe, ?New? Europe, and non-Europe groupings of the trading partner countries. Exports were also found to have been greater to English-speaking countries, and to countries with per capita incomes similar to the United States. This relative per capita income effect became stronger during the latter part of the period, whereas the <b>migrant</b> <b>stock</b> effect diminished after 1885...|$|E

We estimate a gravity model for bilateral remittance flows {{using a variety of}} panel data techniques suitable to control for unobserved heterogeneity as well as simultaneous bias existing between remittances and <b>migrant's</b> <b>stock.</b> The main novelty with respect to the existing literature is the use of transaction costs of remittances as a superior alternative to geographical distance to proxy for remittance costs.

Geographical distance, economic conditions and the unemployment rate in the source countries, however, do not appear to play a substantial role. We also find that geographical distance seems to be a poor proxy for the cost of remitting. This can be better understood in terms of migrant networks and improvements in receiving and source country financial services. While the effect of transaction costs of remittances' on remittance flows is found to be negative, its significance is not robust to changes in the specification of the estimated models...|$|R

40|$|In recent decades, {{the role}} of {{international}} migration has increased dramatically in most European countries. The growth in migration has made some authors proclaim {{the beginning of a}} second Migration Period that could transform the social and cultural identity of Europe. The article presents an analysis of international migration geography in Europe in the last twenty-five years. The authors identify the main trends in migration, provide migration profiles of European countries, and propose a classification based on the recent changes in the <b>migrant</b> <b>stock.</b> Changes in the <b>migrant</b> <b>stock</b> (total emigration and immigration) reflect the level of involvement in international and global processes. They can serve as an indicator of a country’s attractiveness for both foreigners and the country’s citizens. The study shows that European countries are increasingly split into ‘immigrant’ and ‘emigrant’ states. The authors describe spatial patterns of migration. The volume and localisation of migration flows in Europe are affected not only by cultural and historical circumstance, such as a colonial past or a common language. The scale of immigrant influx often does not depend on a donor country’s demographic potential or the level of its socio-economic development. The links between the place of origin and destination are often more complex than it might initially seem. The authors stress the importance of a differentiated immigration policy taking into account ethnic and cultural features of host societies. ...|$|E

Furthermore, emigrants from Turkey to Europe {{are more likely to}} immigrate to destinations where the population of source country nationals is greater.
