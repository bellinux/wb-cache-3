500|$|In July 1980, Bill Lyon of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{wrote that}} many fans unfairly stereotyped McBride as a lazy player {{because of his}} bad knees and his low-key personality. McBride ran with a {{lopsided}} gait, which fans interpreted {{as a lack of}} effort. Lyon wrote that because McBride did not talk about his injuries a lot to the public, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not realize that his knee joint had significantly eroded and that he was [...] "essentially, a one-legged player." [...] Lyon said that McBride's Afro hairstyle and his isolated nature furthered the stereotypes that many fans held. McBride said that he had never been a man who showed much emotion, and {{he thought it would be}} hypocritical if he tried to look more intense just to appease the fans.|$|E
500|$|The Warrior-class design used many well-proven {{technologies}} {{that had been}} used in ocean-going ships for years, including her iron hull, steam engine, and screw propeller; only her wrought-iron armour was a major technological advance. Naval architect and historian David K. Brown wrote, [...] "What made [...] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together, making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world." [...] Being faster, better armoured and harder to hit than her rivals, she was superior to any existing naval ship. The Admiralty immediately stopped the construction of all wooden ships of the line, and ordered another eleven ironclads over the next few years. Jacky Fisher, who was the ship's gunnery lieutenant in 1863–64, later wrote that in spite of this, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not realise at the time what a significant change it would bring about: [...] "It certainly was not appreciated that this, our first armourclad ship of war, would cause a fundamental change in what had been in vogue for something like a thousand years." ...|$|E

500|$|Sunsoft was not {{interested}} in the game for PC, and was instead focused on the video game console market. At the time, consoles had no hard drives and small memory buffers, meaning the game had to be designed around these technical constraints. To solve this issue, they compartmentalized parts of the game's environments into the different Ages. The Millers decided that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not like puzzles. Thus, a good puzzle would feel familiar and part of the world—not like a puzzle, but something for players to figure out like a circuit breaker in their house, using observation and common sense. Cyan did not have fans to please, and did not know exactly who the game would appeal to; Robyn felt like {{they did not have to}} second-guess their choices and could [...] "explore the world as we were designing" [...] and build a game for themselves. In a 2016 interview, Rand Miller stated that they strived to design the puzzles in Myst and their subsequent games by trying to balance three aspects: the puzzles themselves, the environment, and the story. Rand also stated they wanted to make sure that clues to the solutions to puzzles were apparent and presented to the player in a manner for these connections to be made: [...] "once the player finds the solution, if they blame us, then we haven’t done a good job. But if they blame themselves, then we have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Life {{was hard}} for people under Japanese rule. As there was {{inadequate}} food supply, the Japanese rationed necessities such as rice, oil, flour, salt and sugar. Each family was given a rationing licence, and every person could only buy 6.4taels (...) , of rice per day. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not have enough food to eat, and many died of starvation. The rationing system was cancelled in 1944.|$|E
2500|$|The 1924 law {{institutionalized}} the [...] "one-drop rule", defining {{as black}} {{an individual with}} any known black/African ancestry. This was a much more stringent definition than had prevailed legally in the state during the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Civil War, a person could legally qualify as white who had up to one-quarter (equivalent to one grandparent) African or Indian ancestry. [...] In addition, many court cases dealing with racial identity in the antebellum period were decided {{on the basis of}} community acceptance, which usually followed how a person looked and acted, and whether they fulfilled community obligations, rather than analysis of ancestry, which <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not know in detail anyway.|$|E

2500|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Engadine and the Surselva, {{where the}} {{pressure}} of German was equally strong, Romansh was maintained much better and remained a commonly spoken language. According to the linguist Mathias Kundert, one important factor was the different social prestige of Romansh. In the Heinzenberg and Domleschg valleys, the elite had been German-speaking for centuries, so that German was associated with power and education, even though <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not speak it, whereas Romansh was associated with peasant life. In the Engadine and the Surselva by contrast, the elite was itself Romansh-speaking, so that Romansh there was [...] "not only the language spoken to children and cows, but also that of the village notable, the priest, and the teacher." [...] Additionally, Romansh schools had been common for several years before German had become a necessity, so that Romansh was firmly established as a medium of education.|$|E
2500|$|With the Islamic Mughal empire {{falling apart}} in the 18th century, {{regional}} post-Mughal ruling elites and new dynasties from diverse religious, geographical and linguistic background attempted to assert their power {{in different parts of}} India. Bayly states that these obscure post-Mughal elites associated themselves with kings, priests and ascetics, deploying the symbols of caste and kinship to divide their populace and consolidate their power. In addition, in this fluid stateless environment, some of the previously casteless segments of society grouped themselves into caste groups. However, in 18th century writes Bayly, India-wide networks of merchants, armed ascetics and armed tribal people often ignored these ideologies of caste. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not treat caste norms as given absolutes writes Bayly, but challenged, negotiated and adapted these norms to their circumstances. Communities teamed in different regions of India, into [...] "collective classing" [...] to mold the social stratification in order to maximise assets and protect themselves from loss. The [...] "caste, class, community" [...] structure that formed became valuable in a time when state apparatus was fragmenting, was unreliable and fluid, when rights and life were unpredictable.|$|E

60|$|In {{the same}} way, though not so much, people {{found it very}} hard to believe that our Lord grew up as a real human child.

We have no certain proof of it: but it is so beautiful a thought, that one hopes it is true. At least our believing it is a sign that we do believe the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ more rightly than <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> fifteen hundred years ago. For then, too many of them would have been shocked at the notion.|$|E
60|$|I had {{not very}} much to say. It was a record {{of hard work and}} of little adventure; of {{experiments}} in this direction and in that; of the gradual acquisition of the knowledge of books and of men. I took care to ask Strickland nothing about his own doings. I showed not the least interest in him, and at last I was rewarded. He began to talk of himself. But with his poor gift of expression he gave but indications of what he had gone through, and I had to fill up the gaps with my own imagination. It was tantalising to get no more than hints into a character that interested me so much. It was like making one's way through a mutilated manuscript. I received the impression of a life which was a bitter struggle against every sort of difficulty; but I realised that much which would have seemed horrible to <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not in the least affect him. Strickland was distinguished from most Englishmen by his perfect indifference to comfort; it did not irk him to live always in one shabby room; he had no need to be surrounded by beautiful things. I do not suppose he had ever noticed how dingy was the paper {{on the wall of the}} room in which on my first visit I found him. He did not want arm-chairs to sit in; he really felt more at his ease on a kitchen chair. He ate with appetite, but was indifferent to what he ate; to him it was only food that he devoured to still the pangs of hunger; and when no food was to be had he seemed capable of doing without. I learned that for six months he had lived on a loaf of bread and a bottle of milk a day. He was a sensual man, and yet was indifferent to sensual things. He looked upon privation as no hardship. There was something impressive in the manner in which he lived a life wholly of the spirit.|$|E
