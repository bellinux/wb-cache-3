The values of self-ignition delay period were determined when the engine was fuelled by EKODIESEL PLUS 50 hydrocarbon fuel (environmentally friendly winter diesel oil) and FAME (Fatty Acid <b>Methyl</b> Esters) plant <b>fuel,</b> made of plant or animal oils fatty acids methyl esters. Investigations into the engine were conducted in an engine test house equipped with a system for measuring pressures and other fast changing values. In investigations the engine was operated under load conditions at the maximum torque speed n = 1400 rpm and rated power speed n = 2000 rpm. The analysis of results was {{made on the basis}} of averaged pressures in indicator diagrams taken on 100 engine work cycles...|$|R
40|$|Oxygenated {{diesel fuel}} blends have a {{potential}} {{to reduce the}} {{emission of particulate matter}} (PM) and to be an alternative to diesel fuel. This paper describes the emission characteristics of a three compounds oxygenated diesel fuel blend (BE-diesel), on a Cummins- 4 B diesel engine. BE-diesel is a new form of oxygenated diesel fuel blends consisted of ethanol, methyl soyate and petroleum diesel fuel. The blend ratio used in this study was 5 : 20 : 75 (ethanol: <b>methyl</b> soyate: diesel <b>fuel)</b> by volume. The results from the operation of diesel engine with BE-diesel showed a significant reduction in PM emissions and 2 %- 14 % increase of NOx emissions. The change of CO emission was not conclusive and depended on operating conditions. Total hydrocarbon (THC) from BE-diesel was lower than that from diesel fuel under most tested conditions. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and acetone in the exhaust were measured, and the results indicated that use of BE-diesel led to a slight increase of acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and acetone emissions. A small amount of ethanol was also detected in the exhaust from burning BE-diesel. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Jatropha-curcas as a non-edible <b>methyl</b> ester {{biodiesel}} <b>fuel</b> {{source is}} used to run single cylinder, variable compression ratio, and four-stroke diesel engine. Combustion characteristics as well as engine performance are measured for different biodiesel – diesel blends. It {{has been shown that}} B 50 (50 % of biodiesel in a mixture of biodiesel and diesel fuel) gives the highest peak pressure at 1750  rpm, while B 10 gives the highest peak pressure at low speed, 1000  rpm. B 50 shows upper brake torque, while B 0 shows the highest volumetric efficiency. B 50 shows also, the highest BSFC by about (12. 5 – 25 %) compared with diesel fuel. B 10 gives the highest brake thermal efficiency. B 50 to B 30 show nearly the lowest CO concentration, besides CO concentration is the highest at both idle and high running speeds. Exhaust temperature and NOx are maximum for B 50. Delay period is measured and correlated for different blends. Modified empirical formulae are obtained for each blend. The delay period is found to be decreased with the increase of cylinder pressure, temperature and equivalence ratio...|$|R
