5|$|Haunting Ground {{was first}} {{revealed}} in September 2004, {{and was released}} next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual objectification of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating her as an object of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.|$|E
5|$|Lead has {{no known}} physiologically {{relevant}} {{role in the}} body, and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes. Lead also interferes with DNA transcription, enzymes that help in the synthesis of vitamin D, and enzymes that maintain {{the integrity of the}} cell membrane. Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children. Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.|$|E
5|$|Unlike hardness, which denotes only {{resistance}} to scratching, diamond's toughness or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness {{relates to the}} ability to resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it is vulnerable to breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials. As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its {{resistance to}} breakage. Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> in some orientations than others. Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.|$|E
50|$|Depictions {{of actors}} in RPF stories are often heavily {{influenced}} by characters the actors portray. For example, in RPF based around The Lord of the Rings, Viggo Mortensen is frequently shown as taking an Aragorn-like leadership role, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are lighthearted Hobbit-like pranksters, and Elijah Wood is <b>more</b> physically <b>fragile</b> and emotionally vulnerable than his colleagues.|$|R
40|$|Three evangelical Protestant denominations, the Anglicans, Methodists and Presbyterians {{established}} {{missions in}} the Canadian West from 1820 to 1870. Their success was marginal, with no missionary achieving {{the ultimate goal}} of self-sufficient and predominantly agricultural communities. Their existence was never <b>more</b> than <b>fragile.</b> Agriculture was retarded, only in a few cases spontaneous, and always ancillary to hunting and "tripping"...|$|R
50|$|Israel {{insisted on}} the treaty's implementation, and {{threatened}} that it would impose its terms with or without Lebanese consent, but Lebanese public opinion protested â€” and <b>more</b> importantly, the <b>fragile</b> civil war peace process started to unravel.|$|R
25|$|There are {{numerous}} criticisms about DualDiscs, ranging from size to DualDiscs being <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> than conventional CDs.|$|E
25|$|One {{thing is}} not disputed, however: the later one looks in the fourth century, the <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> the social {{consensus}} regarding the liturgy becomes.|$|E
25|$|The {{excavated}} site {{consists of}} two parts: the temple itself, exposed and labeled to show its various stages of development, along with some other associated buildings, and the museum, built to house the smaller and <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> objects.|$|E
5000|$|The obligate {{intracellular}} {{bacteria in}} family Chlamydiaceae are unique in their morphology {{as they do}} not contain detectable amounts of peptidoglycans. [...] However, the extracellular forms of these gram-negative bacteria maintain their structural integrity because of a layer of disulfide bind cross-linked layer of cysteine-rich proteins, which is located between cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane in a manner analogous to peptidoglycan layer in other gram-negative bacteria. In the intracellular forms of the bacterium the disulfide cross linkage is not found, which confers this form <b>more</b> mechanically <b>fragile.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Trieste class DSV were {{replaced}} by the Alvin class DSV, as exemplified by the famous Alvin (DSV-2). The Alvins are more capable, <b>more</b> maneuverable, less <b>fragile,</b> but also can not dive as deep, reaching only a maximum of 20,000 feet (for the Sea Cliff (DSV-4)).|$|R
40|$|A temperature-conditional {{lethal mutant}} of Neurospora crassa, un-t (55701), was {{resistant}} to neutral amino acid analogues {{by virtue of}} a decreased ability to transport these analogues and their natural congeners across the cell membrane. The uptake of acidic, but not basic, amino acids was also impaired, as was the uptake of potassium ions. After preincubation above the tolerated temperature, {{the ability to take}} up a still wider variety of metabolites was greatly reduced. Protoplasts of the mutant were <b>more</b> osmotically <b>fragile</b> than those of wild type. The possibility that the mutant has a generalized membrane defect is discussed...|$|R
25|$|In Australia, a bedourie camp oven is a steel cookpot {{shaped and}} used like a Dutch oven. Named after Bedourie, Queensland, the Bedourie ovens were {{developed}} as a more robust (non-breakable) alternative to the <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> cast-iron Dutch ovens.|$|E
25|$|Nintendo did {{not respond}} {{positively}} to these developments {{and became one of}} the most vocal opponents of ROM image trading. Nintendo and its supporters claim that such trading represents blatant software piracy. Proponents of ROM image trading argue that emulation preserves many classic games for future generations, outside of their <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> cartridge formats.|$|E
25|$|Injury and {{mortality}} of fish, marine mammals, including sea otters, seals, dolphins and whales, and birds by underwater explosions {{has been recorded}} in several studies. Bats can suffer fatal barotrauma in the low pressure zones behind the blades of wind turbines due to their <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> mammalian lung structure {{in comparison with the}} more robust Avian lungs, which are less affected by pressure change.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} common for network administrators to filter IP traffic from and BGP prefixes of {{unallocated}} IPv 4 address space. Now {{that there are}} no longer any unallocated IPv 4 / 8 s, this practise is <b>more</b> complicated, <b>fragile,</b> and expensive. Network administrators are advised to remove filters based on the registration status of the address space. This document explains why any remaining packet and BGP prefix filters for unallocated IPv 4 / 8 s should now be removed on border routers and documents those IPv 4 unicast prefixes that should not be routed across the public Internet...|$|R
5000|$|Linkola often expresses {{his admiration}} for forests and nature in general. He {{is known for his}} deep love of birds. He {{considers}} education to be the [...] "most precious aspect of society," [...] and advocates for universities to be maintained regardless of the cost. In a 2004 interview given at the international bookfair at Turku, Linkola describes the origins of his bitterness towards humankind. In his essay Women as Protectors of Life, he opines that the [...] "soul of a man, beneath its rough surface, is paradoxically <b>more</b> sensitive, <b>fragile</b> and weak than that of a woman." ...|$|R
5000|$|She is {{the mother}} of Seimei and Ritsuka. She has an {{important}} influence over her sons. Being emotionally and mentally weak, Misaki has very little grip on reality, and often hallucinates, particularly after certain events in volume 5. She is abusive and violent and blames Ritsuka's personality change for the reason Seimei [...] "left", demanding that she wants her former Ritsuka back when she beats him. To many, she is seen as a monster, but in volume 5, she has inner dialogues of her own, allowing the reader to witness a <b>more</b> human, <b>fragile</b> side to her behavior which she cannot control.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} proposed, chiefly by Gilad Bracha, {{that the choice}} of type system be made {{independent}} of choice of language; that a type system should be a module that can be plugged into a language as needed. He believes this is advantageous, because what he calls mandatory type systems make languages less expressive and code <b>more</b> <b>fragile.</b> The requirement that types do not affect the semantics of the language is difficult to fulfill.|$|E
25|$|Many {{types of}} sports {{equipment}} {{are made of}} wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, cricket bats are typically made of white willow. The baseball bats which are legal for use in Major League Baseball are frequently made of ash wood or hickory, {{and in recent years}} have been constructed from maple even though that wood is somewhat <b>more</b> <b>fragile.</b> NBA courts have been traditionally made out of parquetry.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{operating}} system and applications all share a single memory space, {{it is possible for}} a bug in any one of them to corrupt the entire operating system, and crash the machine. This is not particularly annoying under a single-application model, in which case the application crashes anyway. But under MultiFinder, any crash will crash all the other running programs as well. The multitasking of multiple applications potentially increases the chances of a crash, making the system potentially <b>more</b> <b>fragile.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{financial}} crisis can have important {{effects on the}} real economy. The <b>more</b> financially <b>fragile</b> are agents the more likely is the occurrence of a {{financial crisis}}. Moreover, financial contagion may have more or less severe consequences on the real economy, depending on the degree distribution of credit interlinkagess. However, financial instability {{may be due to}} real causes. For instance, the deregulation of markets may create the conditions for an increase of inequality. If rich people save a larger part of their income, while the poor are forced to reduce consumption, a lack of aggregate demand may follow, which can eventually lead to a large crisis. ...|$|R
5000|$|Because the {{formation}} of PTH regulates the calcium level in the blood, it can affect {{all areas of the}} body. The overactivity of a parathyroid gland is known as hyperparathyroidism. It is unknown what directly causes hyperparathyroidism. However there are many factors that can cause over-secretion of PTH. The further consequence of this disorder can be osteopenia, or even osteoporosis, which is the loss of bone density. [...] This leaves bones <b>more</b> porous, <b>fragile,</b> and likely to experience fracture. This can be detected by usage of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Interesting enough, a derivative of synthetic PTH is often given to patients with osteoporosis to combat the disease.|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{was in an}} {{advantageous}} {{position to}} expand trade with Latin America, with already strong ties with Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. With {{the opening of the}} Panama Canal in 1914 and the disruption of the transatlantic trade, U.S. exports to Latin America increased. As transportation in the Caribbean became cheaper and <b>more</b> available, <b>fragile</b> tropical imports, especially bananas could be reach mass markets in the United States. U.S. Navy ships deemed surplus following the Spanish American War (1898) were made available to the United Fruit Company, which created its [...] "Great White Fleet." [...] Latin American countries dominated by U.S. interests were dubbed banana republics.|$|R
25|$|According {{to current}} research, in {{approximately}} 2.5% {{of the general}} population the bones of the head develop to only 60â€“70% of their normal thickness in the months following birth. This genetic predisposition may explain why the section of temporal bone separating the superior semicircular canal from the cranial cavity, normally 0.8mm thick, shows a thickness of only 0.5mm, making it <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> and susceptible to damage through physical head trauma or from slow erosion. An explanation for this erosion of the bone has not yet been found.|$|E
25|$|The {{rectification}} {{action is}} due to a thin coating of aluminum hydroxide on the aluminum electrode, formed by first applying a strong current to the cell to build up the coating. The rectification process is temperature-sensitive, and for best efficiency should not operate above 86Â°F (30Â°C). There is also a breakdown voltage where the coating is penetrated and the cell is short-circuited. Electrochemical methods are often <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> than mechanical methods, and can be sensitive to usage variations, which can drastically change or completely disrupt the rectification processes.|$|E
25|$|Striped bass has {{firm and}} flavorful flesh {{with a large}} flake. The hybrid striped bass yields more meat, has a <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> texture, and a blander flavor than wild striped bass. The fish has a mild and {{distinctive}} flavor. In recipes, it can be substituted for milder fish like cod, {{as well as for}} stronger fish like bluefish. Other fish can substitute it, including weakfish, tilefish, blackfish, small bluefish, catfish, salmon, swordfish, and shark. Striped bass is easily grilled in fillets, and is therefore popular in beach communities.|$|E
60|$|He said it gruffly, but he {{was half}} sorry for it the next instant {{when he saw a}} slender little girl {{regarding}} him with wistful eyes across the big reading-table heaped with books. She was curled up, with pencil and pad, in an easy-chair of such generous dimensions that it made her seem <b>more</b> delicate and <b>fragile</b> than she really was.|$|R
5000|$|A {{chromosomal}} {{fragile site}} is a specific heritable point on a chromosome that tends to form a gap or constriction and may tend to break [...] when the cell is exposed to partial replication stress.

25|$|The exact {{pathogenesis}} {{is dependent}} upon the cause. Ulcers and erosions can {{be the result of}} a spectrum of conditions including those causing auto-immune epithelial damage, damage because of an immune defect (e.g., HIV, leukemia, infections e.g. herpes viruses) or nutritional disorders (e.g., vitamin deficiencies). Simple mechanisms which predispose the mouth to trauma and ulceration are xerostomia (dry mouth â€“ as saliva usually lubricates the mucous membrane and controls bacterial levels) and epithelial atrophy (thinning, e.g., after radiotherapy), making the lining <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> and easily breached. Stomatitis is a general term meaning inflammation within the mouth, and often may be associated with ulceration.|$|E
25|$|The pavlova has a {{crisp and}} crunchy outer shell, and a soft, moist marshmallow-like centre, in {{contrast}} to meringue which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of cornflour {{is responsible for the}} marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the cornflour is just another egg white stabiliser in addition to the acid. The consistency also makes the pavlova significantly <b>more</b> <b>fragile</b> than meringue. Because the pavlova is notorious for deflating if exposed to cold air, when cooking is complete it is left in the oven to fully cool down before the oven door is opened.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} F1 T51 was {{the first}} Cooper powered by the 2.5-litre 4-cylinder engine which Cooper and Lotus had commissioned Coventry Climax to build specifically for their rear-engined machines. The pioneering nature of this configuration created problems of its own, since there were so few rear-engined production cars from which a gearbox could be sourced. This shortage eventually created a niche in the market which {{paved the way for}} Hewland's prominence, but in the meantime many different solutions were tried, with varying degrees of success. The works Coopers were fitted with modified Citroen gearboxes, while Rob Walker's team ran bespoke units from Italian specialist Valerio Colotti, although these proved much <b>more</b> <b>fragile.</b>|$|E
40|$|Nurse bees {{were forced}} to rear brood continuously, under field and {{laboratory}} conditions. The weight {{and the length of}} life of the bees they reared decreased when the nurse bees were much older than is normal (40 - 98 days instead of 5 - 16 days). Intestines of emerged bees reared by nurse bees 50 days old and <b>more</b> were very <b>fragile.</b> In the control colonies these phenomena were not observed...|$|R

Patients with a poor prognosis generally proved to be <b>more</b> susceptible to <b>fragile</b> site induction...|$|R
500|$|In {{a review}} of the first-season episode [...] "Solitary", Chris Carabott of IGN commented that Rousseau {{appeared}} to be <b>more</b> emotionally <b>fragile</b> than in later seasons, and was like a [...] "loose cannon". Carabott found that as the series progressed and the mystery around the character was lessened, Rousseau was unable to deliver the same impact she made in her first appearance. In his review of [...] "Numbers", in which Rousseau makes her second appearance, Carabott described Hurley and Rousseau's encounter as [...] "the episode's best moment", as [...] "Hurley finds comfort with someone who we would least expect." [...] Lost co-creator J.J. Abrams commended Furlan for giving the character [...] "heart and soul", and managed to make her [...] "identifiable and complex".|$|R
