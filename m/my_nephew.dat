25|$|The news of {{the victory}} was {{received}} in Britain with the warmest enthusiasm. It was the first certain sign that the mutinies of the summer had not destroyed {{the power and the}} prestige of the Royal Navy. Duncan was at once (21 October) raised to the peerage as Viscount Duncan, of Camperdown, and Baron Duncan, of Lundie in the Shire of Perth (with which came the lands now known as Camperdown Park in Dundee), and there was a strong feeling that the reward was inadequate. Even as early as 18 October his aunt, Lady Mary Duncan, wrote to Henry Dundas, at that time secretary of state for war: Report says <b>my</b> <b>nephew</b> is only made a Viscount. Myself it is nothing, but the whole nation thinks the least you can do is to give him an English earldom. … Am sure were this properly represented to our good king, who esteems a brave, religious man like himself, would be of my opinion. …. It was not, however, till 1831, many years after Duncan's death, that his son, then bearing his title, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and his other children to the rank and precedence of the children of an earl.|$|E

According to a letter he wrote to Edith Sitwell on 14 December, [...] "the final bars of the opera [...] punctuated by hammer-blows" [...] from workmen busy at the Red House. Before he finished the composition draft, Britten wrote to the baritone Owen Brannigan, who had sung in several previous Britten operas, asking if he would take the title role. Britten completed the full score of the opera in March 1958, which he dedicated [...] "To <b>my</b> <b>nephew</b> and nieces, Sebastian, Sally and Roguey Welford, and my young friend Ronald Duncan [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Formula One driver Bruno Senna is {{the nephew}} of Senna (being his sister Viviane's son) of whom he said in 1993: [...] "If you think I'm fast, just {{wait until you see}} <b>my</b> <b>nephew</b> Bruno." [...] Due to the death of his uncle, Bruno {{initially}} gave up motor racing at his family's insistence. He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.|$|E

2500|$|Facing a {{coalition}} which included Austria, France, Russia, Saxony and Sweden, and having only Great Britain, Hesse, Brunswick, and Hanover as his allies, Frederick narrowly kept Prussia {{in the war}} despite having his territories repeatedly invaded. He suffered some severe defeats himself and was frequently at the last gasp, but always managed to recover. Prussia's position became even more desperate when Britain (having made gains in India and the Americas) ended their financial support for Prussia {{after the death of}} King George II, Frederick's uncle. On 6 January 1762, he wrote to Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, [...] "We ought now to think of preserving for <b>my</b> <b>nephew,</b> by way of negotiation, whatever fragments of my territory we can save from the avidity of my enemies". [...] With the Russians slowly advancing towards Berlin, it looked as though Prussia was about to collapse.|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} of 1761 {{was almost as}} abortive as the {{campaign of}} 1760. Frederick acted on the defensive with consummate skill, and the capture of the Prussian fortress of Kolberg on Christmas Day 1761, by Rumyantsev, was the sole Russian success. Frederick, however, was now at the last gasp. On 6 January 1762 he wrote to Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein, [...] "We ought now to think of preserving for <b>my</b> <b>nephew,</b> by way of negotiation, whatever fragments of my territory we can save from the avidity of my enemies," [...] which means, if words mean anything, that he was resolved to seek a soldier's death on the first opportunity. A fortnight later he wrote to Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, [...] "The sky begins to clear. Courage, my dear fellow. I have received the news of a great event." [...] The great event which snatched him from destruction was {{the death of the}} Russian empress (5 January 1762 (N.S.)).|$|E
2500|$|In 202, the warlord Cao Cao, who {{controlled}} the Han central government, led his forces to attack rival warlords Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang at the Battle of Liyang. When Yuan Tan ordered his subordinates Guo Yuan and Gao Gan {{to lead a}} separate force to attack Hedong Commandery, Cao Cao ordered Zhong Yao to recruit forces from Liang Province to deal with Guo Yuan and Gao Gan. Ma Teng responded to Zhong Yao's call and sent his son Ma Chao and Pang De to assist Zhong Yao in attacking Guo Yuan and Gao Gan at Pingyang County (平陽縣; west of present-day Linfen, Shanxi). Pang De led the vanguard, slew Guo Yuan {{in the midst of}} battle and took his head, without knowing that the man he killed was Guo Yuan. After the battle, when Zhong Yao's men searched the battlefield, they found Guo Yuan's headless body. Shortly after, Pang De went to meet Zhong Yao and he threw Guo Yuan's head in front of him. Zhong Yao cried when he recognised Guo Yuan's head because Guo was actually his maternal nephew. Pang De immediately apologised to Zhong Yao, who replied, [...] "Even though Guo Yuan was <b>my</b> <b>nephew,</b> he was an enemy of the state. Why do you apologise?" [...] For his contributions, Pang De was appointed as a General of the Household (中郎將) and made a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯).|$|E

2500|$|While she was {{studying}} English and American literature at Cornell University, Maud {{first met her}} future husband L. Frank Baum at 678 W. Onondaga St., the house of his sister Harriet Baum Neal, and her husband, William Neal. Her roommate, Josie Baum, was Frank's cousin and urged her to meet Frank. During an 1881 Christmas party, Josie's mother, Josephine, walked {{hand in hand with}} Maud to Frank and introduced them to each other, saying, [...] "This is <b>my</b> <b>nephew,</b> Frank. Frank, I want you to know Maud Gage. I'm sure you will love her." [...] Frank replied, [...] "Consider yourself loved Miss Gage", whereupon Maud countered, [...] "Thank you, Mr. Baum. That's a promise. Please see that you live up to it." [...] Not a week elapsed before Frank was certain he was drawn to her; however, she had other beaus. The two were merely friends when she continued her second year in college and Frank went back to working in the theater. On May 15, 1882, Maud traveled to Syracuse to watch Frank perform in The Maid of Arran. In the summer of that year, Frank paid frequent visits to Maud by using his father's horse and buggy to travel eight miles from his theater company in Syracuse to Maud's house in Fayetteville. Not only in awe of Maud's beauty, Frank was also captivated by her poise and sagacity. For Maud, as she {{wrote in a letter to}} a friend, Frank was [...] "very handsome and attractive".|$|E
