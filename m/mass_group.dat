2500|$|Contemporary {{historical}} {{analyses of}} the Hough Riots do not find evidence for claims of communist influence. As early as 1972, historians Estelle Zannes and Mary Jean Thomas pointed out that no evidence existed to implicate either black nationalists or communist organizations in the Hough Riots. Cleveland historian Leonard N. Moore notes that two undercover Cleveland police officers {{spent more than a}} year investigating the JFK House and black nationalist and communist groups in Hough, but found no evidence that these groups or individuals had planned or sustained the riots. In 2003, noted Ohio historian George W. Knepper called the grand jury report a [...] "simplistic and comfortable conclusion" [...] the nearly all-white city administration was more than willing to accept. Kyle Swenson, writing in Cleveland Scene in July 2016, called the grand jury report [...] "almost laughable. Instead of scratching at the deep economic and political grievances that led to a <b>mass</b> <b>group</b> of people to express their frustrations through violence, the official Cuyahoga County explanation was that the commies did it. Seriously." [...] The report, he said, helped reinforce racial tension in Cleveland for decades. In the 21st century, all scholars reject the [...] "official narrative" [...] and its assertion that the riots were fomented and sustained by radical groups, and instead point to social problems like racism and poverty as the riot's cause.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{proposed}} mechanisms driving the morphological transformation of disc galaxies to elliptical galaxies. In this paper, we {{determine if the}} observed transformation in low-mass groups {{can be explained by}} the merger histories of galaxies. We measured the group mass–morphology relation for groups from the Galaxy and <b>Mass</b> Assembly <b>group</b> catalogue with <b>masses</b> from 1011 to 1015 M⊙. Contrary to previous studies, the fraction of elliptical galaxies in our more complete group sample increases significantly with <b>group</b> <b>mass</b> across the full range of <b>group</b> <b>mass.</b> The elliptical fraction increases at a rate of 0. 163 ± 0. 012 per dex of <b>group</b> <b>mass</b> for <b>groups</b> more massive than 1012. 5 M⊙. If we allow for uncertainties in the observed <b>group</b> <b>masses,</b> our results are consistent with a continuous increase in elliptical fraction from <b>group</b> <b>masses</b> as low as 1011 M⊙. We tested if this observed relation is consistent with the merger activity using a gadget- 2 dark matter simulation of the galaxy groups. We specified that a simulated galaxy would be transformed to an elliptical morphology either if it experienced a major merger or if its cumulative mass gained from minor mergers exceeded 30 per cent of its final mass. We then calculated a group mass–morphology relation for the simulations. The position and slope of the simulated relation were consistent with the observational relation, with a gradient of 0. 184 ± 0. 010 per dex of <b>group</b> <b>mass.</b> These results demonstrate a strong correlation between the frequency of merger events and disc-to-elliptical galaxy transformation in galaxy group environments.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} radiological or physical factors to predict the risk of residual mass or local recurrence of primary and secondary hepatic tumors treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Eighty-two patients, with 146 lesions (80 hepatocellular carcinomas, 66 metastases), were treated by RFA. Morphological parameters of the lesions included size, location, number, ultrasound echogenicity, computed tomography density, and magnetic resonance signal intensity were obtained before and after treatment. Parameters of the generator were recorded during radiofrequency application. The recurrence-free group was statistically compared to the recurrence and residual <b>mass</b> <b>groups</b> on all these parameters. Twenty residual masses were detected. Twenty-nine lesions recurred after a mean follow-up of 18 months. Size was a predictive parameter. Patients 2 ̆ 7 sex and age and the echogenicity and density of lesions were significantly different for the recurrence and residual <b>mass</b> <b>groups</b> compared to the recurrence-free group (p < 0. 05). The presence of an enhanced ring on the magnetic resonance control was more frequent in the recurrence and residual <b>mass</b> <b>groups.</b> In the group of patients with residual lesions, analysis of physical parameters showed a significant increase (p < 0. 05) in the time necessary for the temperature to rise.

40|$|Since z~ 1, {{the stellar}} mass density locked in low <b>mass</b> <b>groups</b> and {{clusters}} {{has grown by}} a factor of ~ 8. Here we make the first statistical measurements of the stellar mass content of low <b>mass</b> X-ray <b>groups</b> at 0. 5 <z< 1, enabling the calibration of stellar-to-halo mass scales for wide-field optical and infrared surveys. Groups are selected from combined Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS). These ultra-deep observations allow us to identify bona fide low <b>mass</b> <b>groups</b> at high redshift and enable measurements of their total halo masses. We compute aggregate stellar masses for these halos using galaxies from the Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS (CSI) spectroscopic redshift survey. Stars comprise ~ 3 - 4 % of the total <b>mass</b> of <b>group</b> halos with <b>masses</b> 10 ^{ 12. 8 }<M 200 /Msun< 10 ^{ 13. 5 } (about the mass of Fornax and 1 / 50 th the mass of Virgo). Complementing our sample with higher mass halos at these redshifts, we find that the stellar-to-halo mass ratio decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with other work in the local and high redshift universe. The observed scatter about the stellar-halo mass relation is ~ 0. 25 dex, which is relatively small and suggests that total <b>group</b> stellar <b>mass</b> can serve as a rough proxy for halo mass. We find no evidence for any significant evolution in the stellar-halo mass relation since z< 1. Quantifying the stellar content in groups since this epoch is critical given that hierarchical assembly leads to such halos growing in number density and hosting increasing shares of quiescent galaxies.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the clustering of galaxy groups and clusters in the SDSS using the Berlind et al. (2006) group sample, {{which is designed}} to identify galaxy systems that each occupy a single dark matter halo. We estimate <b>group</b> <b>masses</b> from their abundances, and measure their relative large-scale bias as a function of mass. Our measurements are in agreement with the theoretical halo bias function, given a standard LCDM cosmological model, and they tend to favor a low value of the power spectrum amplitude sigma_ 8. We search for a residual dependence of clustering on other group properties at fixed mass, and find the strongest signal for central galaxy color in high <b>mass</b> <b>groups.</b> Massive groups with less red central galaxies are more biased on large scales than similar <b>mass</b> <b>groups</b> with redder central galaxies. We show that this effect is unlikely to be caused by errors in our mass estimates, and is most likely observational evidence of recent theoretical findings that halo bias depends on a ``second parameter'' other than mass, such as age or concentration. To compare with the data, we study the bias of massive halos in N-body simulations and quantify the strength of the relation between halo bias and concentration at fixed mass. In addition to confirming a non-trivial prediction of the LCDM cosmological model, these results have important implications for the role that environment plays in shaping galaxy properties.
