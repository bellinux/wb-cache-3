25|$|Fishing {{regulations}} and stocking levels have changed {{throughout the years}} in response to prey fish abundance, habitat conditions, and social pressure. Between 1976 and 1977, possession of salmon caught in Lake Ontario or its tributaries was banned due to elevated levels of chemical contaminants such as <b>Mirex</b> and PCBs. In 1995, the practice of snagging was banned due to ethical concerns and social problems on the river (see Snagging ban section below).|$|E
25|$|Mortality {{rates have}} been well {{observed}} in birds; there have been instances where no young have survived to adulthood in areas with high fire ant density. Many birds including cliff nesting swallows, ducks, egrets, quail, and terns {{have been affected by}} red imported fire ants. Ground nesting birds, particularly the least tern (Sterna antillarum), are vulnerable to fire ant attacks. The impact of red imported fire ants on colonial breeding birds is especially severe; waterbirds can experience a mortality rate of 100%, although this factor was lower for early-nesting birds. Brood survival decreases in American cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) if they are exposed to foraging workers. Songbird nest survival decreases in areas with red imported fire ants present, but survival rates in white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) and black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) nests increase from 10% to 31% and 7% to 13% whenever fire ants are not present or when they are unable to attack them. Red imported fire ants may indirectly contribute to low brood survival in the Attwater's prairie chicken. It was first thought that the ants were linked to the decline of overwintering birds such as the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), but a later study showed that ant eradication efforts using the pesticide <b>Mirex,</b> which was known to have toxic side effects, was largely to blame.|$|E

This work was the source for his nickname, [...] "the Exterminator". In the 11 years DeLay ran the company, the Internal Revenue Service imposed three tax liens on him for failure to pay payroll and income taxes. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's ban on <b>Mirex,</b> a pesticide {{that was used in}} extermination work, led DeLay to oppose government regulation of businesses, a belief that he has carried with him throughout his political career.|$|E
2500|$|Kepone was an {{insecticide}} {{produced by}} Allied Signal Company and LifeSciences Product Company in Hopewell. The improper handling and dumping {{of the substance}} into the nearby James River in the 1960s and 1970s drew national attention to its toxic effects on wildlife. As {{a result of the}} contamination the James River from Richmond to the Chesapeake Bay was closed to fishing for over a decade. The product was similar to DDT and is a degradation product of <b>Mirex.</b> In 2009, Kepone was included in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which banned its production and use worldwide ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{food web}} has been damaged {{not only by}} over-fishing, and changes in {{nutrient}} levels, but also by other types of pollution from industrial chemicals, agricultural fertilizers, untreated sewage, phosphates from laundry detergents, and pesticides. Some pollutant chemicals {{that have been found}} in the lake include DDT, benzopyrene and other pesticides; PCBs, aramite, chromium, lead, <b>mirex,</b> mercury, and carbon tetrachloride. The International Joint Commission has identified areas where pollution is particularly intense (point sources) and mapped them as Areas of Concern. [...] A Remedial Action Plan has been developed for each area. [...] Some Lake Ontario areas of concern include the Oswego River and Rochester Embayment on the American side, and Hamilton Harbour and Toronto on the Canadian Side.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mirex</b> is {{a stomach}} insecticide, {{meaning that it}} must be {{ingested}} by the organism in order to poison it. The insecticidal use was focused on Southeastern United States to control the imported fire ants Solenopsis saevissima richteri and Solenopsis invicta. Approximately 250,000 kg of <b>mirex</b> was applied to fields between 1962-75 (US NRC, 1978). Most of the <b>mirex</b> was in the form of [...] "4X <b>mirex</b> bait," [...] which consists of 0.3% <b>mirex</b> in 14.7% soybean oil mixed with 85% corncob grits. Application of the 4X bait was designed to give a coverage of 4.2 g mirex/ha and was delivered by aircraft, helicopter or tractor. 1x and 2x bait were also used. Use of <b>mirex</b> as a pesticide was banned in 1978. The Stockholm Convention banned production and use of several persistent organic pollutant, and <b>Mirex</b> is one of the [...] "dirty dozen".|$|E
50|$|<b>Mirex</b> {{is highly}} {{cumulative}} and amount {{depends upon the}} concentration and duration of exposure.There is evidence of accumulation of <b>mirex</b> in aquatic and terrestrial food chains to harmful levels. After 6 applications of <b>mirex</b> bait at 1.4 kg/ha, high <b>mirex</b> levels were found in some species; turtle fat contained 24.8 mg mirex/kg, kingfishers, 1.9 mg/kg, coyote fat, 6 mg/kg, opossum fat, 9.5 mg/kg, and racoon fat, 73.9 mg/kg. In a model ecosystem with a terrestrial-aquatic interface, sorgum seedlings were treated with <b>mirex</b> at 1.1 kg/ha. Caterpillars fed on these seedlings and their faeces contaminated the water which contained algae, snails, Daphnia, mosquito larvae, and fish. After 33 days, the ecological magnification value was 219 for fish and 1165 for snails.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mirex</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1946, {{but was not}} used in pesticide formulations until 1955. <b>Mirex</b> was produced by the dimerization of hexachlorocyclopentadiene {{in the presence of}} aluminium chloride.|$|E

Humans are exposed primarily through animal meat, fish, and wild game.|$|E
50|$|The Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (<b>MIREX)</b> is {{an annual}} {{evaluation}} campaign for MIR algorithms, coupled to the ISMIR conference. Since {{it started in}} 2005, <b>MIREX</b> has fostered advancements both in specific areas of MIR and in the general understanding of how MIR systems and algorithms are to be evaluated. <b>MIREX</b> is to the MIR community what the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) is to the text information retrieval community: A set of community-defined formal evaluations through which {{a wide variety of}} state-of-the-art systems, algorithms and techniques are evaluated under controlled conditions. <b>MIREX</b> is managed by the International Music Information Retrieval Systems Evaluation Laboratory (IMIRSEL) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mirex</b> is only {{moderately}} toxic in single-dose {{animal studies}} (oral [...] values range from 365 - 3000 mg/kg body weight). It {{can enter the}} body via inhalation, ingestion, and via the skin. The most sensitive effects of repeated exposure in animals are principally associated with the liver, and these effects have been observed with doses as low as 1.0 mg/kg diet (0.05 mg/kg body weight per day), the lowest dose tested. At higher dose levels, it is fetotoxic (25 mg/kg in diet) and teratogenic (6.0 mg/kg per day). <b>Mirex</b> was not generally active in short-term tests for genetic activity. There is sufficient evidence of its carcinogenicity in mice and rats. Delayed onset of toxic effects and mortality is typical of <b>mirex</b> poisoning. <b>Mirex</b> is toxic {{for a range of}} aquatic organisms, with crustacea being particularly sensitive.|$|E
50|$|Characteristic of chlorocarbons, <b>mirex</b> {{does not}} burn easily; {{combustion}} products {{are expected to}} include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, chlorine, phosgene, and other organochlorine species. Slow oxidation produces chlordecone ("Kepone"), a related insecticide that is also banned {{in most of the}} western world, but more readily degraded. Sunlight degrades <b>mirex</b> primarily to photomirex (8-monohydromirex) and later partly to 2,8-dihydromirex.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mirex</b> is an {{organochloride}} {{that was}} commercialized as an insecticide and later banned {{because of its}} impact on the environment. This white crystalline odorless solid is a derivative of cyclopentadiene. It was popularized to control fire ants but by virtue of its chemical robustness and lipophilicity it was recognized as a bioaccumulative pollutant. Ironically, the spread of the red imported fire ant was actually encouraged by the use of <b>Mirex,</b> which also kills native ants that are highly competitive with the fire ants. The United States Environmental Protection Agency prohibited its use in 1976.|$|E

5000|$|Kepone, {{also known}} as chlordecone, is an {{organochlorine}} compound and a colourless solid. This compound is a controversial insecticide related to <b>Mirex</b> and DDT. Its use was so disastrous {{that it is now}} prohibited in the western world, but only after many millions of kilograms had been produced. Kepone is a known persistent organic pollutants (POP), classified among the [...] "dirty dozen" [...] and banned globally by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants as of 2011.|$|E
50|$|Throughout this time, {{continuous}} {{pressure was}} maintained by relevant committees, {{for example the}} Technical Committee on Agricultural Chemicals (TCAC), to reduce approved organochlorine use. By 1981, the use of dieldrin worldwide was limited to sugarcane and bananas, and these uses were deregistered by 1985. In 1987, a nationwide recall system was put into place, and in December of that year, the government prohibited all imports of these chemicals into Australia without express ministerial approval. In 1994, the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals published a use of organochlorines in termite control, recommending the phase-out of organochlorines used in termite control upon development of viable alternatives. The same year, the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand decided to phase out remaining organochlorine uses by 30 June 1995, {{with the exception of}} the Northern Territory. In November 1997, the use of all organochlorines other than <b>mirex</b> was phased out in Australia. Remaining stocks of <b>mirex</b> are to be used only for contained baits for termites in plantations of young trees in the Northern Territory until stocks run out, which is expected in the near future.|$|E

Some POPs {{have the ability to}} volatilize and travel great distances through the atmosphere to become deposited in remote regions. Such chemicals may have the ability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify and can bioconcentrate (i.e. become more concentrated) up to 70,000 times their original concentrations. POPs can affect non-target organisms in the environment and increase risk to humans by disruption in the endocrine, reproductive, and immune systems.|$|E
