5|$|Monk's {{assistant}} Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) {{suspects that}} St. Claire's wife Miranda {{was the person}} who ordered her husband's assassination. Sharona's theory {{is supported by the}} fact that St. Claire is worth $150 million, but Monk thinks about other hypotheses, including one in which Miranda is having an affair with one of St. Claire's assistants. Things become clearer in Monk's <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> watches a news report on the assassination attempt. Monk regroups everyone at the place of the campaign rally to recreate what happened that day.|$|E

On the first episode of Raw following WrestleMania, Swagger tried to cash in his Money in the Bank contract against the WWE Champion John Cena, but changed his <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> realized that Cena was not incapacitated enough to be defeated easily.

Macmillan quickly came to the view that Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. He {{let it be known that}} if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> learned from the British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.|$|E

5|$|Writer Vince Gilligan was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on Time-Life mail order books he read as a child discussing the lives of serial killers. One of the books featured mass murderer Howard Unruh. The episode was also inspired by Ted Serios, whose thought-photographs were mentioned by Fox Mulder in the episode. The use of the dentist chair where Schnauz sat his victims was included considering people's common fear of the dentist. Gilligan had written the role of Schnauz with Taylor Vince in <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{saw him in the}} Adrian Lyne film Jacob's Ladder. Vince had been approached to be a guest star on the show in the first season but declined the role due to it being too small.|$|E

Ali did not change his <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman; he did so for the unity of Islam when the Muslims had clearly turned away from him.|$|E
25|$|Though {{women are}} {{considered}} to be members of the Katipunan, information regarding the women's section were scarce and sometimes conflicting. Teodoro Agoncillo, for example, disregarded Marina Dizon and concluded that Josefa Rizal was the only president of the said section. Gregorio Zaide, on the other hand, mentioned Dizon's presidency in his 1939 publication History of the Katipunan but changed his <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> adopted Dr. Pío Valenzuela's notion that women-members did not elect officers, hence {{there is no room for}} president.|$|E
25|$|Geoffrey's {{composite}} Merlin {{is based}} primarily on Myrddin Wyllt, also called Merlinus Caledonensis, and Aurelius Ambrosius, a mostly fictionalised version of the historical war leader Ambrosius Aurelianus.

Geoffrey had this individual in <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wrote his earliest surviving work, the Prophetiae Merlini (Prophecies of Merlin), which he claimed were the actual words of the legendary madman.|$|E
50|$|On December 1908, Juan Vicente Gómez {{came into}} power with a coup d'état against the {{government}} of Cipriano Castro.

Williams said that he had, {{at the same time}} he prepared the will, written a memorandum for the file stating that Graham was mentally ill, and that he was preparing the will at Graham's direction only to maintain their relationship. The judge in the case ruled that Graham had died intestate. A compromise was eventually reached whereby Katharine Graham gave up part of her inheritance in favor of her children.|$|E

Baron Konstantin von Neurath, the German Foreign Minister was first opposed to this arrangement, but he changed his <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> decided that the British would never accept the 35:100 ratio; having Ribbentrop head the mission {{was the best way}} to discredit his rival.|$|E
25|$|When {{the crime}} lord Vixen hired Slaymaster to {{eliminate}} the Psi-Division, only Betsy, Tom Lennox, and their friend Alison Double were left when Brian defeated him.

Following the repair of the reality warp, an evil version of Captain Britain from another universe named Kaptain Briton switched places with Brian. The double tried to rape Betsy. In self-defense, she telepathically killed him. The same night, the twins were informed of their father's Otherworld origins, and a new intelligence agency called R.C.X. asked them to billet Warpies, children transformed by Jasper's warp, at the Manor, which led to an argument between Betsy and Brian.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} 165, Cassius' {{army had}} reached the twin metropolises of Mesopotamia: Seleucia on the right bank of the Tigris and Ctesiphon on the left. Ctesiphon was taken and its royal palace set to flame. The {{citizens}} of Seleucia, still largely Greek (the city had been commissioned and settled as a capital of the Seleucid Empire, one of Alexander the Great's successor kingdoms), opened its gates to the invaders. The city got sacked nonetheless, leaving a black mark on Lucius' reputation. Excuses were sought, or invented: the official version (promulgated, according to the Historia Augusta, by Asinius Quadratus) had it that the Seleuceni broke faith first. Whatever the case, the sacking marks a particularly destructive chapter in Seleucia's long decline. During the sacking, Roman troops stole the statue of Apollo Comaeus from its temple and brought it back to Rome, where it was installed at {{the temple of the}} Palatine Apollo. This blasphemy may have been on Marcus' <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> called a lectisternium, a great meal offered to the gods, {{at the beginning of the}} Marcomannic Wars (ca. 167) to ward off the evils then being visited on the state.|$|E
25|$|Bournonville {{must have}} had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) in <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only to dream of another - a {{beautiful}} and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For {{the young man in}} the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf girl and her punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid in his grave on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn and the young man, who had slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have been a dream) and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.|$|E
25|$|Silas {{is angry}} with Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) after hearing her give sexual health {{advice on the}} radio, and seeing her on the radio's webcam. Silas stops Lynsey from gaining a {{promotion}} by telling her place of work about the radio show. Silas attacks Lynsey but her screams alert her neighbours, causing him to flee. Lynsey realises that Silas was her attacker and confronts him on numerous occasions, but her allegation is ignored. Lynsey also accuses Silas of murdering India and his grandson, Riley Costello (Rob Norbury), begins to question Lynsey's allegations. Silas experiences a heart attack after Riley questions him. In hospital, Lynsey is assigned as Silas's nurse and withholds his treatment as she assumes he is feigning the attack. Silas later recovers. Silas sees Lynsey giving Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) weight loss drugs and secretly swaps them with his heart medication. Cheryl takes the medication more frequently to suppress her appetite. Whilst Cheryl is alone in her nightclub, she climbs upon the bar and becomes drowsy, causing her to fall. She is found unconscious by Lynsey and begins to recover in hospital. Lynsey is told by a doctor that tests showed a high amount of sedative in Cheryl's system. Silas makes Cheryl doubt Lynsey's state of <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> tells her that he thinks Lynsey could be capable of swapping the drugs.|$|E
