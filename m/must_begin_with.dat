25|$|Music scholar Martha Hume wrote:When you shake all the {{stardust}} {{off this}} tale, what you <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> is an uneducated child {{from one of}} the most isolated cultures in the United States who was given in marriage to a man some six years her senior, a man who was a violent and sometimes brutal alcoholic, who was similarly uneducated and without any job skills to speak of. Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where the child had no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that there were times when the family had nothing to eat but dandelion greens, and you have a situation that might well have led to murder. But what actually happened was so improbable, so unimaginable, that the lives of Loretta and Mooney Lynn became one of the great legends of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|In September 1920, the CSG made a {{strategic}} {{decision that the}} defence of the northern frontier <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> a rush into Belgium. The French army never deviated from {{the belief that the}} loss of the agricultural, mining and industrial resources could never be repeated. In September, the Franco-Belgian Accord of 1920 was signed, for military co-operation; if international tension increased, the Belgians would request assistance and the French would send an army to the Belgian-German border, making it the main line of French resistance to a German attack. As the policy was studied, it became clear that a force moving to the Belgo-German border would have to be mobile if it were to forestall the Germans for a defensive battle from prepared positions. Motorised transport would be necessary to rush forward French troops, then ferry engineer stores to fortify the positions. The French army created mobile fortification parks stocked with material for fortification, ready to be moved by road and rail but if the Belgian army was overwhelmed, the French might be forced into an encounter battle and a war of movement in the central Belgian plain. French strategy was to avoid a decisive battle early on, after the disaster of the Battle of the Frontiers in 1914 but the necessity of avoiding a war on French soil, meant that a forward move could not be avoided.|$|E

Arguing that any remaking of the former Confederate governments <b>must</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> steps to open the electorate to blacks as well as whites, he warned that black rights and loyal Unionists' safety could be protected in no other way. In time, he turned {{into one of the}} most militant advocates of Johnson's impeachment, and by far the most respected of them. Unlike his colleagues, a hostile observer wrote, he brought to the cause [...] "the advantage of a cultivated mind, an extensive reading and a scholarly acquaintance with all of history that could be mustered into such a service." [...] In December 1867, he made the case for impeaching the president without charging him with having committed actual crimes— contending, in effect, that impeachment was a political, and not just a judicial process. (He did not expect impeachment to pass and did not foresee the Senate convicting Johnson; what he hoped for, instead, was a statement on the House's part that the president had committed high crimes and misdemeanors, in effect a resolution of censure). The House did not agree, but two months later, in February 1868, Johnson's removal of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton (in contravention of a law drafted by Stanton and Boutwell requiring Senate confirmation of such acts) united Republicans behind a resolution of impeachment. [...] Boutwell chaired the committee that drafted the articles of impeachment, and presented them to the House for debate. He was chosen as one of the managers of the impeachment proceedings that followed.|$|E
