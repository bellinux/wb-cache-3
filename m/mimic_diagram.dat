40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{suggested}} that for some tasks, graphical displays which visually integrate information {{from more than one}} source offer an advantage over more traditional displays which present the same information in a separated format. Three experiments are described which investigate this claim using a task which requires subjects to control a dynamic system. In the first experiment, the integrated display is compared to two separated displays, one an animated <b>mimic</b> <b>diagram,</b> the other an alphanumeric display. The integrated display is shown to support better performance in a control task, but experiment 2 shows that part of this advantage may be due to its analogue nature. Experiment 3 considers performance on a fault detection task, and shows no difference between the integrated and separated displays. The paper concludes that previous claims made for integrated displays may not generalize from monitoring to control tasks...|$|E
30|$|The {{failures}} in the cyber layer make their corresponding part in the physical layer unobservable and uncontrollable. Thus, in the <b>mimic</b> <b>diagram</b> of the physical layer, the unobservable and uncontrollable part should {{be removed from the}} optimal security and mitigation action calculation. The tripping of overloaded transmission lines generates new nodes in the physical layer disconnected from others and to be islands. The generator in a self-supply island can keep the energy interdependence still working, while that in a non-self-supply island can no longer keep the energy interdependence working, and thus, the cyber node is shut down. The state of a cyber node depends on whether the node is equipped with a backup power source. The failures that occur in the physical layer are unobservable, and thus, no effective security controls can be taken. For the observable and controllable part, the latest operation state data are sent to the control center in the cyber layer step-by-step. After the derivation of the security controls in the control center, the control data are sent back to the corresponding node to act correctly. If the data transmission delay is beyond the RRT threshold, the operation state or the control commands will not be executed accurately in the current stage.|$|E

40|$|This project {{shows how}} an {{interactive}} object based {{graphical user interface}} for a plant supervision or control application may be implemented using state-of-the-art software languages and tools. In many current plant supervisory, control and data acquisition systems (SCADA) data presentation is limited to archaic character based graphics and text based prompts {{with little or no}} use of pointing devices. With the emergence of object-oriented programming languages and graphics function libraries this project shows how a decisive upgrade in the graphics for these systems may be achieved, thereby bringing realism into plant <b>mimic</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The <b>mimic</b> <b>diagrams</b> created in this project consist of a static background, acquired by the use of scanning devices or paint packages, and a dynamic background of icons, generated using object-oriented C++ classes. The project is an object-oriented application and hence illustrates the object-oriented paradigm. The thesis introduces the area of supervisory, control and data acquisition systems. It examines graphic standards and operating system options, and highlights the need for a user friendly extensible graphic interface to telemetry systems. It also shows how object-orientation should provide for systems that are not only easier to extend and maintain but may also spawn parts which may be used for future projects. The thesis, based on experience gained throughout the project, examines C++, classes, inheritance, problems associated with C++ environments and the dangers of product incompatibility. It discusses graphic elements, such as bitmaps, icons and menus, and shows how object-orientation may be applied to them. It expounds on real-time considerations and icon animation and details the full project implementation including compilation and memory management systems used. Finally it points to the future, to the impact of object-oriented programming on technical management, to object-oriented databases and the object-oriented SCADA workstation of the future, and to changes imminent in C++ itself...|$|R
40|$|New turnkey data {{acquisition}} systems purchased from industry are being integrated into CERN's Technical Data Server. The short time available for system integration {{and the large}} amount of data per system require a standard and modular design. Four different integration layers have been defined in order to easily 'plug in' industrial systems. The first layer allows the integration of the equipment at the digital I/O port or fieldbus (Profibus-DP) level. A second layer permits the integration of PLCs (Siemens S 5, S 7 and Telemecanique); a third layer integrates equipment drivers. The fourth layer integrates turnkey <b>mimic</b> <b>diagrams</b> in the TCR operator console. The second and third layers use two new event-driven protocols based on TCP/IP.

Recently the CERN Controls Board recommended a SCADA system {{for use in the}} CERN experiments and the controls sectors. The Technical Control Room (TCR) currently monitors the complete technical infrastructure at CERN using a component-ware architecture. A migration to the recommended SCADA system has been started in order to be ready for the monitoring of the future LHC infrastructure. This gives the advantage of having an integrated tool for alarms, <b>mimic</b> <b>diagrams,</b> trending and data acquisition but requires a careful analysis of the hard- and software architecture.

40|$|Process Industries are {{hazardous}} in nature. They require good instrumentation {{support for}} control and monitoring various parameters like pressure, flow, level, temperature, speed, vibration, displacement, etc. Sensors {{are to be}} installed at remote fields and measured variables are brought to the operator station for further processing. Initially separate TVs are installed at operator station to view the remote field images (Photographs) taken through analog (conventional) cameras. By viewing both the computer monitor and separate TVs, control signals are generated for abnormalities in the plant by human intervention, which may lead to errors due to human fatigue, sleeplessness in the night, etc. In the present days the signals from sensors are compared and control action is initiated. This also is not full proof method due to errors in sensors. Now due to the invent of digital cameras, analog cameras are replaced by digital cameras at remote fields and the digital signals of real time field images can be directly integrated in to the computer. With the help of emerging DIP(Digital Image Processing) technology these digital images are compared with already stored standard images of remote field and control action is initiated by computer automatically for abnormalities for parameters like level, flow, speed etc by matching the images.

An annealed distribution, however, which is more adequate to liquid mixtures, precludes the stability of this biaxial phase. We then use a two-temperature formalism, and assume a separation of relaxation times, to show that a partial degree of annealing is already sufficient to stabilize a biaxial nematic structure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new computational method for fully automated triangular mesh generation, consistently applicable to wire-frame, surface, solid, and nonmanifold geometries. The method, called bubble meshing, {{is based on}} the observation that a pattern of tightly packed spheres <b>mimics</b> a Voronoi <b>diagram,</b> from which a set of well-shaped Delaunay triangles and tetrahedra can be created by connecting the centers of the spheres. Given a domain geometry and a node-spacing function, spheres are packed on geometric entities, namely, vertices, edges, faces, and volumes, in ascending order of dimension. Once the domain is filled with spheres, mesh nodes are placed at the centers of these spheres and are then connected by constrained Delaunay triangulation and tetrahedrization. To obtain a closely packed configuration of spheres, the authors devised a technique for physically based mesh relaxation with adaptive population control. The process of mesh relaxation significantly reduces the number of ill-shaped triangles and tetrahedra...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of a hybrid SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system for the air suspension 'flash' alumina calciner at Aluminium de Grece St. Nicholas plant. The system includes two additional modules, an 'expert system' based on 10 years of commissioning and operating experience and a dynamic model continuously predicting the quality of the product. It is implemented on an industrial PC under an industrial control software environment and interfaces to the furnace through a programmable logic controller (PLC) system. The system guides the furnace operator to reduce sensible heat losses by operating with a marginal excess air flow rate, to take advantage of the higher energy efficiency at higher production rates and, at the same time, to avoid potentially dangerous operating conditions leading to loss of production and consequential energy losses. It also performs the traditional SCADA functions (data acquisition, maintaining history files for important parameters and display of important operating parameters in both a <b>mimic</b> process <b>diagram</b> and a series of graphs.) In addition to these tasks a simplified dynamic model gives the operator a prediction of the current value of the main product quality parameter, which can only be measured with laboratory equipment. Preliminary results have shown that reduction of secondary air flow rate and reduced downtime achieved by the operator under the guidance of the system can reduce energy consumption by as much as 10 %. A similar, or even greater, improvement in energy efficiency can be expected by implementing a similar system to cement calcination kilns based on the same technology. © European Communities 1997.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{comprehensive}} derivation of the intrinsic electronic phase diagram of the iron-oxypnictide superconductors in the normal state based on {{the analysis of the}} electrical resistivity ρ of both LaFeAsO 1 - xFx and SmF eAsO 1 - xFx {{for a wide range of}} doping. Our data give clear-cut evidence for unusual normal-state properties in these new materials. In particular, the emergence of superconductivity at low doping levels is accompanied by distinct anomalous transport behavior in ρ of the normal state which is reminiscent of the spin-density wave (SDW) signature in the parent material. At higher doping levels ρ of LaFeAsO 1 - xFx shows a clear transition from this pseudogap-like behavior to Fermi-liquid–like behavior, <b>mimicking</b> the phase <b>diagram</b> of the cuprates. Moreover, our data reveal a correlation between the strength of the anomalous features and the stability of the superconducting phase. The pseudogap-like features become stronger in SmF eAsO 1 - xFx where superconductivity is enhanced and vanish when superconductivity is reduced in the doping region with Fermi-liquid–like behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} {{of the age of}} the bulge has led to two contradictory results. On the one side, the color-magnitude diagrams in different bulge fields seem to indicate a uniformly old (> 10 Gyr) population. On the other side, individual ages derived from dwarfs observed through microlensing events seem to indicate a large spread, from ∼ 2 to ∼ 13 Gyr. Because the bulge is now recognised as being mainly a boxy peanut-shaped bar, it is suggested that disk stars are one of its main constituents, and therefore also stars with ages significantly younger than 10 Gyr. Other arguments as well point {{to the fact that the}} bulge cannot be exclusively old, and in particular cannot be a burst population, as it is usually expected if the bulge was the fossil remnant of a merger phase in the early Galaxy. In the present study, we show that given the range of metallicities observed in the bulge, a uniformly old population would be reflected into a significant spread in color at the turn-off which is not observed. Inversely, we demonstrate that the correlation between age and metallicity expected to hold for the inner disk would conspire to form a color-magnitude diagram with a remarkably small spread in color, thus <b>mimicking</b> the color-magnitude <b>diagram</b> of a uniformly old population. If stars younger than 10 Gyr are part of the bulge, as must be the case if the bulge has been mainly formed through dynamical instabilities in the disk, then a very small spread at the turn-off is expected, as seen in the observations.

40|$|DIMG 92 est un simulateur de {{formation}} sur le procédé pétrochimique DIMERSOL (procédé IFP de dimérisation du propylène). En simulant le réacteur et ses équipements annexes, les opérateurs s'exercent à conduire l'unité et comprennent les effets des divers paramètres à prendre en compte. Le simulateur est composé de deux logiciels : - Un logiciel de modélisation, basé sur la représentation mathématique de connaissances physico-chimiques et physiques. Aucun empirisme n'est utilisé dans le modèle. Ce logiciel a été développé par l'Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP). - Un logiciel d'environnement de simulation dynamique pour la formation. Ce logiciel à interface graphique et interactive est distribué par la société française Réalisation en Systémique Industrielle (RSI). Industrial {{units are}} tending {{to become more}} and more complex and are characterized by a very high degree of integration. The operating of such units requires highly skilled operators. This is why dynamic simulators have training as their prime goal. The DIMG 92 simulator falls within this category. It simulates the reaction section of the DIMERSOL G process in a steady state or not. The DIMERSOL G process is designed for the dimerization of propylene into hexene. In the modeled unit, the reaction section includes a liquid-phase reactor and a pump-around on which a heat exchanger is installed. The heat exchanger, which uses water as the cooling fluid, evacuates the heat of reaction. The reaction temperature is between 45 and 55 °C. The reactor pressure is in the vicinity of 22 effective bars. The catalyst is in a liquid state. A standard feedstock is made up of 30 weight % inert matter and 70 % propylene. Modeling is broken down into three parts : the kinetics, the reactor, the heat exchanger. Mathematical modeling of the oligomerization kinetics was performed at Institut Français du Pétrole (IFP) in 1987. By taking into consideration the initiation, prolongation and termination reactions starting with propylene and hexene, we can understand the oligomerization kinetics in the DIMERSOL G process. The deactivation of the catalyst is represented by a first-order kinetics. With a reduced number of constants, the model takes the following aspects into consideration :(a) The production of heavy oligomers (no propagation reaction is neglected). (b) The formation of oligomers combined with the catalyst. (c) The deactivation of the catalyst in time and the temperature. The kinetic constants and activation energies were determined so that the model can restore the different kinetic results of pilot tests. The modeling of the reactor considers that this reactor is perfectly stirred and always full of liquid. The principal equations reflect the balances of the molecular species. There are also molar balances for the olefins, for the olefins combined with the catalyst, for the inert matter, for the active catalyst and for the deactivated catalyst. An overall mass balance and a mass balance for the sum of olefinic species are added on. A heat balance is used to predict the temperature of the reactor. Other calculations are performed to obtain the selectivities, the conversion and the outflow of each constituent. The modeling of the heat exchanger is done by a static model. The outlet temperatures of the fluids {{and the power of the}} heat exchanger are calculated by making an estimate of the efficiency of the heat exchanger. The programming of the model is modular. This makes for a standardized and coherent whole. The modules are written in FORTRAN 77. The user has access either to a static solution to find a stable operating point or dynamic calculating during which the console operator can introduce various disturbances in the variables of the process. In the static module the balances for the reactor form a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that is solved by a Newton-Raphson algorithm. The dynamic module mainly includes the integration, in relation to the processing time of the system of differential equations for the balances relative to the reactor. The above two modules make use of various joint subroutines. The modules containing the modeling of the reaction section are integrated in the SORYA-MX application. This application is a graphic and interactive interface designed for training simulators. SORYA-MX is distributed by the French company Réalisation en Systémique Industrielle(RSI). SORYA-MX has a time management system capable of controlling the accelaration of the simulation at will. It is a multitask application. SORYA-MX has two levels of use :(1) A designerlevel for configuring the simulator by creating, for example, <b>mimic</b> <b>diagrams,</b> alarm levels, operating data sheets, controllers, disturbance scenarios, etc. (2) A userlevel for activating the functionalities defined by the designer level, for controlling the controllers, for safeguarding, etc. As the result of this environment, learning on the simulator is much like operating the unit via a centralized control system. This type of simulator has already shown proof of its effectiveness :(a) At the level of research, as a working support for the designing of expert systems or for designing advanced controls. (b) At the level of training, for operators of units operating under an IFP process license. By a fairly fine kinetic model for oligomerization and careful programming, the model thus developed can be used as a basis for other studies. In the future, it seems desirable to : (a) Increase the degree of modeling (reactors in cascade, modeling of impurities and of start-up). (b) Extend modeling to similar processes. Nevertheless, for pursuing this project it is absolutely necessary to arouse greater interest among customers during the selling of processes for this training tool and among process engineers on the spot for obtaining a better understanding of internal phenomena...|$|R
