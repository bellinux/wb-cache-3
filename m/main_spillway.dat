25|$|Mangla {{reservoir}} had {{an initial}} reservoir capacity of 5.88 Million Acre-feet (MAF), which reduced to 4.674 MAF in 2005 {{due to the}} sedimentation and was likely to reduce further.

40|$|Spillway flow, a {{classical}} problem of hydraulics, is generally a gravity-driven free surface flow. Spillway flows are essentially rapidly varying flows near the crest with pronounced {{curvature of the}} streamlines in the vertical direction. Two processes simultaneously occur in the flow over the crest, that is, formation and gradual thickening of the turbulent boundary layer along the profile, and gradual increase in the velocity and decrease in the depth of <b>main</b> flow. <b>Spillway</b> hydrodynamics can be obtained through physical modelling or numerical modelling. Physical modelling of spillways is expensive, cumbersome and time-consuming. The main difficulties in solving the spillway problem numerically are: rapidly varying flow, existence of both subcritical and supercritical flows, development of turbulent boundary layers, unknown free surface and air entrainment. Numerical simulation of such flows over spillways in all flow regimes is a challenging task. This paper describes a numerical model and its application to a case study to investigate the hydraulic characteristics of flow over spillway crest profiles by simulating the velocity distribution, pressure distribution and discharge characteristics. Results of the numerical modelling are compared with those from the physical modelling and found to be satisfactory...|$|R
