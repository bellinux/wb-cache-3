5|$|Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based {{systematics}} {{have usually}} given the Hexapoda {{the rank of}} superclass, and identified four groups within it: insects (Ectognatha), springtails (Collembola), Protura, and Diplura, the latter three being grouped together as the Entognatha {{on the basis of}} internalized mouth parts. Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data. A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic (where the last common ancestor was not a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group),</b> with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta. Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa {{have been shown to be}} paraphyletic, so rather than using ranks like subclass, superorder, and infraorder, it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings (in which the last common ancestor is a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group).</b> The following represents the best-supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta.|$|E
