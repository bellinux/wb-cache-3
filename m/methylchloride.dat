50|$|Since many of {{the uses}} of antihistamines involve {{conditions}} such as rashes, which should be treatable by local application, there is some rationale for developing drugs for topical use. The known side effects of antihistamines could in principle be avoided if the drug were functionalized to avoid systemic absorption. The known poor absorption of quat salts make such derivatives attractive for nonabsorbable antihistamines for topical use.Thus, reaction of the well-known antihistaminic drug promethazine with <b>methylchloride</b> leads to thiazinamium chloride.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemisorption}} of <b>methylchloride</b> (CH 3 Cl) on Si(100) is studied {{from first}} principles. We find that, {{among a number}} of possible adsorption configurations, the lowest-energy structure is one in which the <b>methylchloride</b> molecule is dissociated into CH 3 and Cl fragments which are bound to the two Si atoms of the same surface dimer. Our calculations show that dissociative chemisorption of <b>methylchloride</b> on Si(100) may proceed along different reaction paths characterized by different energy barriers that the system must overcome: some dissociation processes are mediated by a molecular precursor state and, at least in one case, we find that the dissociation process is nonactivated, in agreement with recent experimental findings.

40|$|The dissociative {{electron}} transfer reaction CH 3 Cl+e−→CH 3 •+Cl− {{in aqueous solution}} is studied by using a QM/MM method. In this work the quantum subsystem (a <b>methylchloride</b> molecule plus an electron) is described using density functional theory while the solvent (300 water molecules) is described using the TIP 3 P classical potential. By means of molecular dynamics simulations and the thermodynamic integration technique we obtained the potential of mean force (PMF) for the carbon–chlorine bond dissociation of the neutral and radical anion species. Combining these two free energy curves we found a quadratic dependence of the activation free energy on the reaction free energy in agreement with Marcus’ relationship, originally developed for {{electron transfer}} processes not involving bond breaking. We also investigated dynamical aspects by means of 60 dissociative trajectories started {{with the addition of}} an extra electron to different configurations of a <b>methylchloride</b> molecule in solution. The PMF shows the existence of a very flat region, in which the system is trapped during some finite time if the quantum subsystem quickly losses its excess kinetic energy transferring it to the solvent molecules. One of the most important factors determining the effectiveness of this energy transfer seems to be the existence of close contacts (hydrogen bonds) between the solute and the solvent. Estanislao.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of arylacetonitriles and methyl arylacetates with dimethylcarbonate (DMC) at 180 - 220 degrees C {{in the presence}} of a weak base (K 2 CO 3), produces the mono-methylderivatives (2 -arylpropionitriles and methyl 2 -aryl propionates, respectively) with a selectivity higher than 99 %. This reaction has a wide range of applications since the products obtained are well known intermediates for non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Contrary to the usual methylating agents (<b>methylchloride</b> and dimethyl sulfate), the reaction with the non-toxic DMC takes place with only a catalytic amount of the base; accordingly, no inorganic salts are produced.

With {{the exception of}} trichloroethene they showed mixing ratios well above the lower limit of detection. The <b>methylchloride</b> distribution was uniform with average mixing ratios of 532 ± 8 and 550 ± 12 ppt in {{the northern and southern}} Hemispheres, respectively. Dichloromethane increased linearly between the Intertropical Convergence Zone and 45 °N with average mixing ratios of 36 ± 6 ppt and was almost constant in the southern hemisphere with an average of 18 ± 1 ppt. Tetrachloroethene mixing ratios were between less than 1 and 10 ppt in the northern hemisphere and always below 3 ppt in the southern hemisphere. Similar to dichloromethane, tetrachloroethene was nearly constant in the southern hemisphere and increased linearly toward northern latitudes. This is compatible with the predominantly industrial origin of these compounds. Trichloroethene varied between 0. 3 ppt and about 15 ppt in the northern hemisphere with an average of 3 ± 1 ppt and was generally lower than 1 ppt in the southern hemisphere with mixing ratios often near or below the detection limit of 0. 1 ppt. For CH 3 Cl we estimate a global turnover of 3. 5 × 1012 g/yr which is compatible with previous results. Using a simple model calculation our measurements imply a global turnover for CH 2 Cl 2 and C 2 Cl 4 of 0. 9 × 1012 g/yr and 0. 6 × 1012 g/yr, respectively...|$|E

Chapter three describes an experimental investigation of the pyrolysis of 4 -dimethylsilylbut-l-ene and 5 -dimethylsilylpent-l-ene, with and without excess <b>methylchloride</b> as a silyl radical trap. The results of computer modelling of the pyrolysis of 4 -dimethylsilylbut- 1 -ene with excess <b>methylchloride</b> are described, in which information concerning the isomerisation of an alpha-silyl radical to a silyl radical via a hydrogen shift is obtained. Chapter four describes the results of an experimental investigation of the reactions of dimethylsilene and dimethylsilylene with anions. Chapters five and six contain the results of computer modelling of three related pyrolysis mechanisms composed of complex series of unimolecular rearrangements of silylenes, silenes, disilenes and disilacyclopropanes. Chapter seven describes an experimental determination of Arrhenius parameters for the trapping of dimethylsilene by butadiene, together with the results of pyrolysis of butadiene adducts of methylsilene, dimethylsilene and dimethylsilylene. Chapter eight is an experimental investigation of the pyrolysis of cis and trans dimethy 1 (1 -propenyl) vinylsilane with excess 2, 3 -dimethylbutadiene as a silylene trap. Interpretation of the results as a cis-trans isomerisation and decomposition of the cis isomer via a silacyclopropane intermediate are reinforced by the results of computer modelling of both systems. Chapter nine describes an experimental investigation of the pyrolysis of 1, 2 -dimethyldisilane with and without butadiene as a silylene trap. Computer modelling of the pyrolysis with the absence of butadiene is used to clarify the pyrolysis mechanism.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} {{degradation and}} detoxification of chlorinated xenobiotic compounds requires {{the production of}} enzymes {{that are capable of}} recognizing and converting compounds which do not occur at significant concentrations in nature. We have studied the catabolic route of 1, 2 -dichloroethane {{as an example of a}} pathway for the conversion of such a synthetic compound. In strains of Xanthobacter and Ancylobacter that have been isolated on 1, 2 -dichloroethane, the first catabolic step is catalyzed by a hydrolytic haloalkane dehalogenase. The enzyme converts 1, 2 -dichloroethane to 2 -chloroethanol but is also active with many other environmentally important haloalkanes such as <b>methylchloride,</b> methylbromide, 1, 2 -dibromoethane, epichlorohydrin, and 1, 3 -dichloropropene. Further degradation of 2 -chloroethanol proceeds by oxidation to the carboxylic acid and dehalogenation to glycolate. The aldehyde dehydrogenase prevents toxicity of the reactive chloroacetaldehyde that is formed as an intermediate and is necessary for establishing a functional 2 -chloroethanol degradative pathway in a strain that is not capable of growth on this compound. - Environ Health Perspec...|$|E

METHODS: Calorimetric method {{was used to determine}} the blood concentraiton of DDVP, and 3 P 97 software was used to calculate the parameters of toxicokinetics. Ellman’s method was used to determine the ChE activity in plasma. The toxicodynamics curve in vivo and the concentration-effect curve in vitro were drawn to compare the effects of Nef on these two curves. RESULTS: In the rabbit poisoned by ig DDVP 12. 5 mg/kg there was almost no effect of Nef on the toxicokinetics of DDVP. The slope of toxicodynamics curves for depressed ChE increased about 3 times after treatment with Nef 7. 5 mg/kg and pyratoxime <b>methylchloride</b> (2 -PAM·Cl) 50 mg/kg, compared with the untreated group, there was a higher significant difference (P 0. 05).

40|$|Soil {{bacteria}} are heavily exposed to environmental methylating agents such as <b>methylchloride</b> {{and may have}} special requirements for repair of alkylation damage on DNA. We have used functional complementation of an Escherichia coli tag alkA mutant to screen for 3 -methyladenine DNA glycosylase genes in genomic libraries of the soil bacterium Bacillus cereus. Three genes were recovered: alkC, alkD and alkE. The amino acid sequence of AlkE is homologous to the E. coli AlkA sequence. AlkC and AlkD represent novel proteins without sequence similarity to any protein of known function. However, iterative and indirect sequence similarity searches revealed that AlkC and AlkD are distant homologues of each other within a new protein superfamily that is ubiquitous in the prokaryotic kingdom. Homologues of AlkC and AlkD were also identified in the amoebas Entamoeba histolytica and Dictyostelium discoideum, but no other eukaryotic counterparts of the superfamily were found. The alkC and alkD genes were expressed in E. coli and the proteins were purified to homogeneity.

A kinetic scheme, involving more than 300 elementary reactions and 46 molecular and radicalic species, has been developed based on general thermochemical kinetic theories {{as well as the}} consolidated know-how in the field of hydrocarbon pyrolysis. Several comparisons with commercial and laboratory experimental data indicate a fair agreement in a wide area of lower and higher pressures (up to 30 atm) also covering the high temperature range of <b>methylchloride</b> pyrolysis (1000 -degrees-C). Mathematical model of EDC pyrolysis furnaces already allows to evaluate process performances and alternatives accounting for fouling rates and on-stream times. The kinetic scheme can be applied to study the methane chlorination reaction system and the dichloroethane (EDC) pyrolysis system. The kinetic scheme is coupled with a furnace model and appropriate mathematical techniques to solve the resulting system of material, energy and momentum conservation equations. A coking model has also been incorporated as fouling of coils determines the run length of the furnaces. Simulation of the pyrolysis of EDC to produce vinyl chloride shows that the results are in reasonable agreement with observed values and trends. Application of the model for the design of coils and evaluation of process alternatives is discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the spatial and {{temporal}} variations of the mixing ratios of organic trace gases in the lower troposphere were investigated. Air samples were collected in stainless steel canisters and analyzed for their contents of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nonmethane hydrocarbons and halocarbons. Characterizations of the used gas chromatographic systems {{and the results of}} international intercomparison experiments showed that the analytical methods are suitable for the measurement of organic trace gases at low concentration levels. The latitudinal distribution of trace gases in the boundary layer over the Atlantic was measured during the cruise of the German research vessel 'Polarstern' as part of the ALBATROSS campaign (October/November 1996). The measurements covered a latitude range between 67 N and 45 S. In this work the distribution of some halogenated hydrocarbons in marine air was measured for the first time. Highest mixing ratios of hydrocarbons and several anthropogenic halocarbons (CH_ 2 Cl_ 2, CHCl_ 3, 1, 2 -C_ 2 H_ 4 Cl_ 2, C_ 2 HCl_ 3, C_ 2 Cl_ 4 und CH_ 3 Br) were observed in the northern hemisphere between 42 N to 67 N latitude.

40|$|Information of {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) in buildings in Hong Kong is relatively scared compared to other countries. Information of how much VOC accumulation comes from occupants themselves, from building materials and other outdoor sources are scarce even on a global basis. This study aimed at collecting information of the levels of individual VOCs using US-EPA Method TO- 14. Twenty building premises including offices and public places such as customer service centers, shopping centers, etc. were studied, Samples were taken during the time slots when the mechanical ventilation system was operating. The 43 VOCs were grouped into three categories, i. e. aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons and organohalogen. The most dominant VOCs found in the indoor samples were benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes (BETX), chloroform and trichloroethylene as 100 % of the samples were found to contain these VOCs. Besides, more than 75 % of the samples were found to contain 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene, <b>methylchloride</b> and dichloromethane. The wt% of chlorinated hydrocarbons (48 %) and the wt% of aromatic hydrocarbons (38 %) only differed by about 10 % in the office sector. Organohalogen (14 %) contributed to the smallest {{fraction of the total}} on all the premises in the office sector on weight basis. A completely different distribution pattern was found in the non-office sector. The most abundant class of VOCs in terms of weight was aromatic hydrocarbons (80 %). The second abundant class of VOCs was chlorinated hydrocarbons (14 %) and was much less than the level of aromatic hydrocarbons in terms of weight. Organohalogen (6 %) contributed to the smallest fraction of the total on all the premises in the non-office sector on weight basis. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. October 2015. Major: Chemistry. Advisor: Darrin York. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 194 pages. Molecular modeling and computer simulation techniques can provide detailed insight into biochemical phenomena. This dissertation describes the development, implementation and parameterization of two methods for the accurate modeling of chemical reactions in aqueous environments, with a concerted scientific effort towards {{the inclusion of}} charge-dependent non-bonded non-electrostatic interactions into currently used computational frameworks. The first of these models, QXD, modifies interactions in a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular (QM/MM) mechanical framework to overcome the current limitations of ‘atom typing’ QM atoms; an inaccurate and non-intuitive practice for chemically active species as these static atom types are dictated by the local bonding and electrostatic environment of the atoms they represent, which will change {{over the course of}} the simulation. The efficacy QXD model is demonstrated using a specific reaction parameterization (SRP) of the Austin Model 1 (AM 1) Hamiltonian by simultaneously capturing the reaction barrier for chloride ion attack on <b>methylchloride</b> in solution and the solvation free energies of a series of compounds including the reagents of the reaction. The second, VRSCOSMO, is an implicit solvation model for use with the DFTB 3 / 3 OB Hamiltonian for biochemical reactions; allowing for accurate modeling of ionic compound solvation properties while overcoming the discontinuous nature of conventional PCM models when chemical reaction coordinates. The VRSCOSMO model is shown to accurately model the solvation properties of over 200 chemical compounds while also providing smooth, continuous reaction surfaces for a series of biologically motivated phosphoryl transesterification reactions. Both of these methods incorporate charge-dependent behavior into the non-bonded interactions variationally, allowing the ‘size’ of atoms to change in meaningful ways with respect to changes in local charge state, as to provide an accurate, predictive and transferable models for the interactions between the quantum mechanical system and their solvated surroundings...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of granular sludge from upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors for bioremediation of chlorinated pollutants was evaluated by using carbon tetrachloride (CT) {{as a model}} compound. Granular sludges cultivated in UASB reactors on methanol, a volatile fatty acid mixture, or sucrose readily degraded CT supplied at a concentration of 1, 500 nmol/batch (approximately 10 μM) without any prior exposure to organohalogens. The maximum degradation rate was 1. 9 μmol of CT g of volatile suspended solids− 1 day− 1. The main end products of CT degradation were CO 2 and Cl−, and the yields of these end products were 44 and 68 %, respectively, of the initial amounts of [14 C]CT and CT-Cl. Lower chlorinated methanes accumulated in minor amounts temporarily. Autoclaved (dead) sludges were capable of degrading CT at rates two- to threefold lower than those for living sludges, indicating that abiotic processes (mediated by cofactors or other sludge components) {{played an important role}} in the degradation observed. Reduced components in the autoclaved sludge were vital for CT degradation. A major part (51 %) of the CT was converted abiotically to CS 2. The amount of CO 2 produced (23 %) was lower and the amount of Cl− produced (86 %) was slightly higher with autoclaved sludge than with living sludge. Both living and autoclaved sludges could degrade chloroform. However, only living sludge degraded dichloromethane and <b>methylchloride.</b> These results indicate that reductive dehalogenation, which was mediated better by living sludge than by autoclaved sludge, is only a minor pathway for CT degradation. The main pathway involves substitutive and oxidative dechlorination reactions that lead to the formation of CO 2. Granular sludge, therefore, has outstanding potential for gratuitous dechlorination of CT to safe end products...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Organophosphorus nerve agents irreversibly inhibit {{acetylcholine}}sterase, {{causing a}} toxic buildup of acetylcholine at muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Current medical countermeasures to nerve agent intoxication increase survival if administered {{within a short}} period of time following exposure but may not fully prevent neurological damage. Therefore, there is a need to discover drug treatments that are effective when administered after the onset of seizures and secondary responses that lead to brain injury. Methods To determine potential therapeutic targets for such treatments, we analyzed gene expression changes in the rat piriform cortex following sarin (O-isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate) -induced seizure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were challenged with 1 × LD 50 sarin and subsequently treated with atropine sulfate, 2 -pyridine aldoxime <b>methylchloride</b> (2 -PAM), and the anticonvulsant diazepam. Control animals received an equivalent volume of vehicle and drug treatments. The piriform cortex, a brain region particularly sensitive to neural damage from sarin-induced seizures, was extracted at 0. 25, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after seizure onset, and total RNA was processed for microarray analysis. Principal component analysis identified sarin-induced seizure occurrence and time point following seizure onset as major sources of variability within the dataset. Based on these variables, the dataset was filtered and analysis of variance was used to determine genes significantly changed in seizing animals at each time point. The calculated p-value and geometric fold change for each probeset identifier were subsequently used for gene ontology analysis to identify canonical pathways, biological functions, and networks of genes significantly affected by sarin-induced seizure over the 24 -h time course. Results A multitude of biological functions and pathways were identified as being significantly altered following sarin-induced seizure. Inflammatory response and signaling pathways associated with inflammation were among the most significantly altered across the five time points examined. Conclusions This analysis of gene expression changes in the rat brain following sarin-induced seizure and the molecular pathways involved in sarin-induced neurodegeneration will facilitate the identification of potential therapeutic targets for the development of effective neuroprotectants to treat nerve agent exposure. </p...|$|E
40|$|Some heterocyclic {{systems were}} {{investigated}} for ambident electrophilic behaviour. Of the cases {{reported in the}} literature, the majority involve nucleophilic attack, most frequently by cyanide on a halomethyl aromatic system to give as the major product, the expected cyanomethyl compound ('normal' product) accompanied by the compound derived from SNl' or SN 2 ' attack of cyanide ('abnormal' product). In the present work, the halomethyl derivatives of the following systems were investigated: benzothiophene, thiophene, benzofuran, furan, and pyrazine. Triphenyl- <b>methylchloride</b> was also investigated for comparison. The ability of these systems to display ambident electrophilic behaviour is correlated with their structure. Solvent effects are also investigated. 2 -Furfuryl was taken as a model system because of its great tendency to give abnormal products. The system was made to rearrange under conditions in which the temperature {{and the nature of}} the nucleophile and leaving group were varied. The competition between 'normal' and 'abnormal' product formation appears to be kinetically controlled. The interesting transformation of 2 -bromomethyl- 5 -methylthiophene to 3 -bromo- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene has been reported to occur. A detailed examination of this reaction was undertaken and the mechanism is discussed. At the end of the Thesis, a report of the work completed in industry* as part of the CAPS scheme is given. The objective of this work was to examine synthetic procedures for obtaining the enantiomers of 4 (5) -(2 -aminopropyl) imidazole (? -methylhistamine) and 4 (5) -(2 -amino-l-methylethyl) imidazole (B -methylhist-amine) in order to provide new compounds for biological testing.

40|$|Whole air {{drawn from}} four heights within the high {{elevation}} (3, 340 m asl), deep, winter snowpack at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, were sampled into stainless steel canisters, and subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography for 51 volatile inorganic and organic gases. Two adjacent plots with similar snow cover were sampled, one over bare soil {{and a second}} one from within a snow-filled chamber where Tedlar/Teflon-film covered the ground and isolated it from the soil. This comparison allowed for studying effects from processes in the snowpack itself versus soil influences on the gas concentrations and fluxes within and through the snowpack. Samples were also collected from ambient air above the snow surface for comparison with the snowpack air. Analyzed gas species were found to exhibit three different kinds of behavior: (1) One group of gases, i. e., carbon dioxide (CO 2), chloroform (CHCl 3), dimethylsulfide (CH 3) 2 S, carbondisulfide (CS 2), and dichlorobromomethane (CHBrCl 2), displayed higher concentrations inside the snow, indicating a formation of these species and release into the atmosphere. (2) A second group of compounds, including carbon monoxide (CO), carbonyl sulfide (COS), the hydrocarbons methane, ethane, ethyne, benzene, and the halogenated compounds <b>methylchloride</b> (CH 3 Cl), methylbromide (CH 3 Br), dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2), bromoform (CHBr 3), tetrachloromethane (CCl 4), CFC- 11, CFC- 12, HCFC- 22, CFC- 113, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, methylchloroform, HCFC- 141 b, and HCFC- 142 b, were found at lower concentrations in the snow, indicating that the snow and/or soil constitute a sink for these gases. (3) For 21 other gases absolute concentrations, respectively concentration gradients, were too low to unequivocally identify their uptake or release behavior. For gases listed {{in the first two}} groups, concentration gradients were incorporated into a snowpack gas diffusion model to derive preliminary estimates of fluxes at the snow-atmosphere interface. The snowpack gradient flux technique was found to offer a highly sensitive method for the study of these surface gas exchanges. Microbial activities below this deep, winter snowpack appear to be the driving mechanism behind these gas sources and sinks. Flux results were applied to a simple box model to assess the potential contribution of the snowpack uptake rates to atmospheric lifetimes of these species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{the acute}} {{toxicity}} of organophosphorus nerve agents {{is known to}} result from acetylcholinesterase inhibition, the molecular mechanisms involved {{in the development of}} neuropathology following nerve agent-induced seizure are not well understood. To help determine these pathways, we previously used microarray analysis to identify gene expression changes in the rat piriform cortex, a region of the rat brain sensitive to nerve agent exposure, over a 24 -h time period following sarin-induced seizure. We found significant differences in gene expression profiles and identified secondary responses that potentially lead to brain injury and cell death. To advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in sarin-induced toxicity, we analyzed gene expression changes in four other areas of the rat brain known to be affected by nerve agent-induced seizure (amygdala, hippocampus, septum, and thalamus). Methods We compared the transcriptional response of these four brain regions to sarin-induced seizure with the response previously characterized in the piriform cortex. In this study, rats were challenged with 1. 0 × LD 50 sarin and subsequently treated with atropine sulfate, 2 -pyridine aldoxime <b>methylchloride,</b> and diazepam. The four brain regions were collected at 0. 25, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after seizure onset, and total RNA was processed for microarray analysis. Results Principal component analysis identified brain region and time following seizure onset as major sources of variability within the dataset. Analysis of variance identified genes significantly changed following sarin-induced seizure, and gene ontology analysis identified biological pathways, functions, and networks of genes significantly affected by sarin-induced seizure over the 24 -h time course. Many of the molecular functions and pathways identified as being most significant across all of the brain regions were indicative of an inflammatory response. There were also a number of molecular responses that were unique for each brain region, with the thalamus having the most distinct response to nerve agent-induced seizure. Conclusions Identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in sarin-induced neurotoxicity in these sensitive brain regions will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics that can potentially provide broad-spectrum protection in five areas of the central nervous system known to be damaged by nerve agent-induced seizure. </p...|$|E
