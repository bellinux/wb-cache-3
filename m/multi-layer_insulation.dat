5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of <b>multi-layer</b> <b>insulation.</b> One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of <b>multi-layer</b> <b>insulation</b> keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E

40|$|Crude oil {{moving through}} the 800 -mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline must be kept at a {{relatively}} high temperature, about 180 degrees Fahrenheit, to maintain the fluidity of the oil. In Arctic weather, that demands highly effective insulation. General Electric Co. 's Space Division, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, provided it with a spinoff product called Therm-O-Trol. Shown being installed on the pipeline, Therm-O-Trol is a metal-bonded polyurethane foam especially formulated for Arctic insulation. A second GE spinoff product, Therm-O-Case, solved a related problem involved in bringing hot crude oil from 2, 000 -foot-deep wells to the surface without transferring oil heat to the surrounding permafrost soil; heat transfer could melt the frozen terrain and cause dislocations that might destroy expensive well casings. Therm-O-Case is a double-walled oil well casing with <b>multi-layered</b> <b>insulation</b> which provides an effective barrier to heat transfer.

40|$|The {{design of}} light yet highly {{insulated}} cryogenic tanks {{is a key}} enabling technology for hydrogen-fuelled flights, especially when operation in the harsh thermal environment associated with hypersonic speeds is envisaged. This paper examines the use of different insulation systems for cryogenic hypersonic tanks. The investigation for a Mach 5 flight shows {{that a combination of}} foam and fully load-bearing aerogel blanket leads to the lightest tank, with a gravimetric efficiency of 73 %. If the aerogel blanket cannot be strengthened sufficiently so that it can bear the full load, then a combination of foam and fibrous insulation materials gives the best solution with a gravimetric efficiency of 70. 3 %. This is around 10 % better than (non-load-bearing) aerogel or <b>multi-layer</b> <b>insulations.</b> However, the performance of the foam-fibrous insulation is more sensitive to the external skin temperature than that of other insulation materials so that a foam-multilayer insulation system becomes more efficient at speeds beyond Mach 9. This demonstrates that it is critical to make the best use of each material and that proper combinations of materials can considerably improve the performance of the insulation system.

2500|$|Cassidy and Marshburn started EVA 5 at 11:33 UTC {{when they}} {{switched}} their suit power to internal battery. For this spacewalk, the [...] absorbent {{system in the}} suits were changed from Lithium Hydroxide to METOX due to problems with Cassidy's usage. Cassidy completed the reconfiguring of power channels in the Zenith 1 patch panel which are used for the control moment gyroscopes. Before the rewiring, two of the gyroscopes were fed by the same power channel. Since {{a failure of the}} channel can knock down two gyros and put the station in a degraded position the reconfiguration was made necessary. This rewiring made the two gyros to operate from separate power channels. Meanwhile, Marshburn secured some <b>multi-layered</b> <b>insulation</b> on the Dextre. Later both the spacewalkers installed video cameras on the front and back of the Japanese exposed facility which will be used in dockings of the Japanese cargo crafts and normal operation. The cameras flew up in launch configuration and now have been installed in an operational configuration, thus completing the JEF assembly. Meanwhile, due to Cassidy's METOX limitation, the deployment of the PAS was deferred to a future spacewalk. Instead some get ahead tasks were completed which included installation of handrails and a portable foot restraint.|$|R

40|$|The main {{insulation}} {{system in}} HVDC transformer consists of oil-paper insulation. The formation of space charge in oil/paper insulation system {{can not only}} affect the dielectric strength, but also relate to the stability and security of HVDC transformer. Moisture has detrimental effect on the electrical breakdown strength and insulation life of oil-paper insulation. Thus a better understanding the influence of moisture on the charge distribution in <b>multi-layer</b> oil-paper <b>insulation</b> system becomes increasingly practical importance. In the present study, the space charge dynamics in three layers oil-paper insulation system with three different moisture concentrations (0. 28, 1. 32 and 4. 96 %) were investigated using the PEA technique under 6 kV.

40|$|Beginning in 2005, {{an optical}} {{measurement}} center (OMC) {{was created to}} measure the photometric signatures of debris pieces.

As research progressed, modifications {{were made to the}} equipment. A customized rotary table was built to overcome the robot s limitation of 180 degree wrist rotation and provide complete 360 degree rotation with little human interaction. This change allowed an initial phase angle (source-object-camera angle) of roughly 5 degrees to be adjusted to 7, 10, 15, 18, 20, 25, or 28 degrees. Additionally, the Johnson R and I CCD filters were replaced with the standard astronomical filters suite (Bessell R,I). In an effort to reduce object saturation, the two generic aperture stops were replaced with neutral density filters. Initially data were taken with aluminum debris pieces from the European Space Operations Centre ESOC 2 ground test and more recently with samples from a thermal <b>multi-layered</b> <b>insulation</b> (MLI) commonly used on rocket bodies and satellites. The ESOC 2 data provided light curve analysis for one type of material but many different shapes, including flat, bent, curled, folded, and torn. The MLI samples are roughly the same size and shape, but have different surfaces that give rise to interesting photometric light curves. In addition, filter photometry was conducted on the MLI pieces, a process that also will be used on the ESOC 2 samples. While obtaining light curve data an anomalous drop in intensity was observed when the table revolved through the second 180 degree rotation. Investigation revealed that the robot s wrist rotation is not reliable past 80 degrees, thus the object may be at slightly different angles at the 180 degree transition.

A {{need was}} {{identified}} to test <b>multi–layer</b> vacuum super <b>insulation</b> (MLVSI) used in cryogenic applications for hydrogen storage. The study {{focuses on the}} application of commercially available MLVSI to a locally patented liquid hydrogen cryogenic storage system. This led to an investigation {{of different types of}} <b>multi–layer</b> vacuum <b>insulation</b> configurations, as well as further research on tank inlet coupling configurations. It includes the manufacturing of a liquid nitrogen testing cryostat to be able to test and evaluate the system performance. The first set of tests was based on the development of an inlet coupling configuration to limit heat transfer through the inner tank inlet, of a double cryogenic tank system in order to reduce gas boil–off. The couplings were manufactured {{in the form of a}} bellow to handle cryogenic vacuum levels, while ensuring low heat transfer rates between inner and outer tanks. It was found that various coupling designs can be considered to limit gas boil–off. The second set of tests was conducted on a specific MLVSI configuration to determine its effectiveness to insulate the spherical header surface of a typical hydrogen storage vessel. The installation procedure, to limit heat transfer and boil–off due to edge effects in this configuration was investigated. It was found that insulation–overlap–edge effects will always have an impact on insulation performance when a spherical header of a storage vessel is insulated, due to its specific geometry. A time efficient way to install MLVSI on such a spherical header is presented and evaluated. Further investigations were carried out by combining findings into one single system to determine the performance of an optimised insulated cryogenic system. It was found that copper plate discs installed between the vanes of a bellowed inlet/outlet nozzle is the most promising to limit heat transfer to the cryogenic fluid. Master...|$|R
