40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the career paths of women <b>managers</b> <b>in</b> the service area of higher {{education}} and women <b>managers</b> <b>in</b> the hospital industry service area. A secondary purpose was to identify factors that influence the advancement of women <b>managers</b> <b>in</b> those areas. This research outlined the career paths of women <b>managers</b> <b>in</b> the service industry in educational and in non-educational organizations. It identified encouragements and impediments to the promotion of qualified women in the areas of management within the service industry. Findings from the study show that there is no significant difference between the career paths of women <b>managers</b> <b>in</b> higher education and women <b>managers</b> <b>in</b> the hospital industry. There are no differences between the education, training, length of tenure, motivation for employment, mentoring, emotional support or career impediments of women <b>managers</b> <b>in</b> service area of both higher education and the hospital industry. The following conclusions were drawn from the study: 1. Women in the service field of higher education and the hospital industry face very similar histories. 2. Entry into the profession can be found through a variety of sources and it is through the investigation of these sources that a woman will find entry into this field. 3. Very few women reported career impediments and many reported having the emotional support of family and friends. 4. The true reason why the experienced, educated, trained woman manager has not progressed up the career and salary ladder until the past several years has not been found. Both groups are being motivated by opportunity for advancement and salary. 5. Most women <b>managers</b> <b>in</b> the service have been the determinants of their own career advancement. The women desiring to become <b>managers</b> <b>in</b> the service field must realize that the future of her career and its advancement lies with her own decisions and her own initiative. The woman manager must be responsible for her own future. Department of Educational LeadershipThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

5|$|Although Arsenal {{was founded}} in 1886, {{it was not until}} 1897 that the club {{appointed}} a permanent <b>manager</b> <b>in</b> charge of first-team affairs, with Thomas Mitchell universally recognised as Arsenal's first professional manager. Mitchell joined Arsenal five months after resigning from Blackburn Rovers in October 1896. The Scotsman's time at Woolwich Arsenal was brief and he left his post barely a year into his contract, though he did manage to take the club from tenth to fifth in the league. Mitchell guided Arsenal through a respectable cup run which culminated in the first round proper. William Elcoat succeeded Mitchell as <b>manager</b> <b>in</b> April 1898, and set about reviving the squad with new additions. The changes did not have the desired effect; his team finished seventh in a league of 18 and were beaten 6–0 by Derby County in the FA Cup first round. He departed in February 1899, and like his predecessor only remained for a season.|$|E
