40|$|Fixed {{effects in}} the <b>model</b> <b>for</b> backfat {{thickness}} and the time on test were evaluated. Data records from large scale farm in period from January 1998 to December 2007 were analyzed. Two models were developed. Fixed effects of genotype, season and weight {{were included in the}} <b>model</b> <b>for</b> backfat thickness. The <b>model</b> <b>for</b> time on test was simpler than <b>model</b> <b>for</b> backfat thickness, containing only fixed effects of genotype and season. Choice of the model was based on coefficient of regression and degrees of freedom. The <b>model</b> <b>for</b> backfat thickness explained 56 % of the variability, while the <b>model</b> <b>for</b> time on test explained 65 % of variability. The results of this investigation will be useful in future development of the <b>model</b> <b>for</b> prediction of breeding values for gilts in field test...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{characters}} are shared between Bright Falls and Alan Wake, including diner waitress Rose, Dr. Emil Hartman, radio host Pat Maine and Alan Wake himself, who appears briefly in the final episode.

5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as <b>models</b> <b>for</b> their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUsing {{discrete}} time process algebra {{with relative}} timing, a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the I 2 C-bus is designed. The {{model of the}} I 2 C-bus {{is divided into three}} parts: a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the bus lines, a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the master interfaces and a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the slave interfaces. The model of the bus lines is based on a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> a wired-AND. <b>For</b> the <b>models</b> of the interfaces, the approach is to start from a high level bus protocol and refine it step by step. First, a single master without timing constraints is considered. Then the model is adapted to deal with the timing constraints. Then also the restriction to a single master is relaxed. It turns out that the <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the slave interfaces can be based on the <b>model</b> <b>for</b> the master interfaces. The use of the model obtained is discussed and illustrated...|$|R

30|$|As {{the figure}} suggests, the {{accounting}} <b>model</b> <b>for</b> a given resource is an aggregation of three elementary models: a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> traffic consumption, a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> operation consumption and a <b>model</b> <b>for</b> resource consumption. In particular, the accounting {{model of a}} particular resource will be strongly consumer–centric if all the three of its elementary models are strongly consumer-centric. These elementary models operate independently from each other, thus they can be specified and examined separately.|$|R
