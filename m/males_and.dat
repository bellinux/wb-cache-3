5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for <b>males</b> <b>and</b> 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female {{employer}} to the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees <b>and</b> also <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers. The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by both employers and employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employer to the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees <b>and</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers. The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find {{the most frequently used}} types of request used by both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers <b>and</b> both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers mostly used the same types of request expressions to both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees. However, the writer found various types of request used by both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees to both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers. The result of this research showed that both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, both to their <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees. However, both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees used various types of request, both to <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employer. Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers <b>and</b> both <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employees...|$|R

5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
