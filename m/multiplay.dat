50|$|Multiboxing or Two boxing, dual boxing, or <b>multiplaying,</b> is {{a method}} of playing {{multiplayer}} games where the player controls two or more characters at the same time. On MUDs (the predecessors of MMORPGs) this is easy to accomplish using a MUD client, and the practice is generally called <b>multiplaying.</b> The term box informally refers to computer, and this form of arrangements can be expensive, usually requiring two computers and two subscriptions for online games where necessary. Players may wish to play on two computers when {{it is difficult to}} play two copies of a game on the same computer, such as modern 3D MMORPGs. However, software designed for multiboxing 3D MMORPGs on the same computer is available as well. Many players often use a high powered gaming system with more than one monitor and a powerful video card to play in this fashion as well. Multiboxing describes a player that is running two or more characters simultaneously, but usually implies more than two.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA multi-imaging {{strategy}} is proposed and experimentally tested {{to improve the}} accuracy of photon counting with an electron <b>multiplaying</b> charge-coupled device (EMCCD), by {{taking into account the}} random nature of its on-chip gain and the possibility of multiple photodetection events on one pixel. This {{strategy is}} based on Bayesian estimation on each image, with a priori information given by the sum of the images. The method works even for images with large dynamic range, with more improvement in the low light level areas. In these areas, two thirds of the variance added by the EMCCD in a conventional imaging mode are removed, making the physical photon noise predominant in the detected image...|$|R
5000|$|The game's {{move to the}} Michigan server brought several changes: {{during the}} move, the old site was {{available}} in [...] "Anarchy Mode", a traditional experience when the game moved from one server to another, with all rules on player killing, <b>multiplaying,</b> wizard-mortal interference, and other guidelines of Law suspended. Since all player files had already been backed up prior to the move, none of this had any long-term effect on players and allowed them to [...] "blow off steam". It proved popular enough that the Senate considered hosting regular Anarchy events on an alternate port of the new server; the Anarchy port was used to host some parts of a mudwide competition called the AAlympics, for example. In addition, the move prompted a change from 25-hour mandatory reboots to 49-hour reboots, which were tested in late April and then made permanent. (These reboots, common in MUDs to recover memory leaks and to clear 'trash' items which accumulate, restore the world to a default state, leaving characters to regain equipment from scratch.
