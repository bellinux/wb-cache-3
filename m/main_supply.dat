5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread {{that at one point}} over 650,000 people were out of power in the Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant further to the northeast. These towers were the <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which {{less than a year later}} would be struck by another tornado.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the dive bombers were attacking, the 20 torpedo bombers were also {{approaching}} Hornet from two different directions. Despite suffering heavy losses from anti-aircraft fire, the torpedo planes planted two torpedoes into Hornets side between 09:13 and 09:17, knocking out her engines. As Hornet came to a stop, a damaged Japanese dive bomber approached and purposely crashed into the carrier's side, starting a fire near the ship's <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> of aviation fuel. At 09:20, the surviving Japanese aircraft departed, leaving Hornet dead in the water and burning. Twenty-five Japanese and six American aircraft were destroyed in this attack.|$|E

In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E
5|$|In May, General Gaskin began {{planning}} to retake {{the city of}} Karmah, which sat astride a <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> route between Fallujah and Baghdad and was an important insurgent stronghold. Unlike other locales, Karmah had no definable perimeter, making it easy for outsiders to access, as when insurgents fled to Karmah after being pushed out of Baghdad. Gaskin sent one of his aides to Jordan to meet with Sheikh Mishan, head of Karmah's largest tribe, the Jumayli. Sheikh Mishan fled to Jordan in 2005 after receiving threats from AQI. Gaskin's aide was able to persuade the sheikh to return in June, partnered with 2nd Battalion 5th Marines. By October, insurgent attacks had dropped to almost zero.|$|E
5|$|This heavy {{night and}} day battle cost the NK 2nd Division most of its {{remaining}} offensive strength.

5|$|Aside from locally formed militia units, the {{military}} {{did not have}} a significant presence in the Moncton area until the beginning of the Second World War. In 1940, a large military supply base (later known as CFB Moncton) was constructed on a railway spur line north of downtown next to the CNR shops. This base served as the <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> depot for the large wartime military establishment in the Maritimes. In addition, two Commonwealth Air Training Plan bases were also built in the Moncton area during the war: No. 8 Service Flying Training School, RCAF, and No. 31 Personnel Depot, RAF. The RCAF also operated No. 5 Supply Depot in Moncton. A naval listening station was also constructed in Coverdale (Riverview) in 1941 to help in coordinating radar activities in the North Atlantic. Military flight training in the Moncton area terminated at the end of World War II and the naval listening station closed in 1971. CFB Moncton remained open to supply the maritime military establishment until just {{after the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Clandestine {{trade with}} other nations continued, {{initially}} at a reduced level; among other things, Portugal illicitly labelled unsold Rhodesian tobacco as Mozambican product, then sold it on Salisbury's behalf in Europe and Asia. Through this {{and a series of}} similar sanction-busting operations Rhodesia avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson, and, with the help of South Africa and Portugal, gradually became more self-sufficient. Aiming to directly cut off the <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> lines of oil to Rhodesia, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at Beira and Lourenço Marques, Wilson set up the Beira Patrol, a Royal Navy squadron based in the Mozambique Channel, in March 1966. This blockade was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. Too small to cover both Beira and Lourenço Marques, and unable to legally fire on tankers once they were in Portuguese waters, the patrol met with little success, but it endured regardless for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} defend against the North Korean penetration, Ridgway {{immediately}} ordered the US X Corps to reinforce the South Korean defenses. However, {{with most of the}} US X Corps still assembling at Pusan, the only unit that was available in the Eighth Army's reserve was the US 2nd Infantry Division, which was still recovering from its earlier losses in the Ch'ongch'on River valley. On December 28, Ridgway ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to defend Wonju while placing the division under US X Corps control. After the US 7th Infantry Division of the US X Corps finished reorganization on December 30, Ridgway ordered Major General Edward Almond, commander of the US X Corps, to develop Route 29 as its <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> route, and the 7th Infantry Division was subsequently tasked with defending it.|$|E

During its year of deployment, the brigade {{established}} Prisoner of War holding areas for over 3,600 Iraqi prisoners and conducted <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> route patrolling over 2,500 kilometers in southern Iraq. The Brigade entered Baghdad in April 2003 and began establishing the new Iraqi Police Service and rebuilding Iraqi police stations. From {{the beginning of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom until February 2004 the Brigade provided command and control for seven Military Police battalions, one Mechanized Infantry battalion, 30 Military Police companies, and two Law and Order detachments. The Brigade’s MPs conducted over 24,000 combat patrols, apprehended over 2,400 criminals, confiscated 7,500 illegal weapons, and trained over 10,000 Iraqi police officers. During their deployment, the Brigade recovered several precious artifacts, such as the Mask of Warka, which was recovered on 23 September 2003. The brigade returned to Sandhofen in 2004 only to return to Iraq in 2007.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1668, the Venetians were victorious in a hard-fought night battle off {{the island}} of St Pelagia, where 2,000 Ottoman troops and 12 galleys {{attempted}} to seize a small Venetian galley squadron. Forewarned of their intentions Morosini reinforced it, and won a costly victory, {{which was to be}} Venice's last victory at sea in this war. Reinforced again with Papal and Hospitaller ships, the Venetians maintained a blockade of Canea, the Ottomans' <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> base, during summer. To secure their anchorage off St Todero island, the allied forces seized the fortress island of St Marina, a minor success which did not in the end prevent the Kapudan pasha's fleet, bearing fresh troops and supplies, from reaching Canea in September, after the Maltese–Papal squadron had departed.|$|E

Those of the regiment who had chosen to re-enlist, along with the remaining draftees who had joined the unit in 1863, were consolidated with the 32nd Massachusetts. The remaining men of the 22nd who had served their three years and {{did not wish to}} re-enlist, 125 in number, returned to Boston by railroad, arriving on October 10.

5|$|On August 9, fifteen Texas Rangers {{with their}} Indian scouts, located Victorio's <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> camp on Sierra Diablo.

Carpenter's attack {{scattered}} the Indian guards while the troopers secured 25 head of cattle, provisions and several pack animals. Victorio under increasing pressure, short of food and more importantly water, began to head south in two main groups. By August 11, Carpenter was on the trail in pursuit but, with horses tired and thirsty from the campaign, the chase was slow. Carpenter divided his command, with Nolan with his company and Texas Rangers on one route, while he took {{the rest of the}} command on another route. On August 13, Nolan reached the Rio Grande where Indian scouts reported that Victorio had crossed the border into Mexico the evening before. Carpenter arrived later and ordered the cavalrymen to rest near the river.|$|E
5|$|The UN counterattack at Inchon {{collapsed}} the North Korean {{line and}} cut off all their <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> and reinforcement routes. On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting {{to get as much}} of their army as possible into North Korea. The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18–19. After the forces there, the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North. The US units rapidly pursued them north, passing over the Naktong River positions, which were no longer of strategic importance.|$|E

5|$|Gotovina {{said that}} {{although}} Operations Winter'94, Leap1 and Leap2 were planned and executed as three distinct operations, they represent a unified military action. Operation Winter'94 ostensibly failed to achieve its primary objective of relieving pressure on the Bihać pocket by drawing off VRS and ARSK forces to contain the attack; however, that was due to a decision by Chief of VRS General Staff General Ratko Mladić and not to mistakes in planning or execution. Faced with a choice between continuing with the attack on Bihać and blocking the advance from the Livanjsko field, the VRS chose not to move its forces, but Bihać was successfully defended by the 5thCorps of the ARBiH. The secondary objective of Operation Winter'94 was achieved more easily; the Croatian forces approached the Knin-Drvar road and directly threatened the <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> route between the Republika Srpska and the RSK capital. Operations Leap1 and2 built on the achievements of Operation Winter'94, threatened Bosansko Grahovo and created conditions to isolate Knin in Operation Summer'95, which was executed the following month. The advance was strategically significant; Mladić's decision not to react to Operation Winter'94 was a gamble which ultimately cost the Republika Srpska territory extending to Jajce, Mrkonjić Grad and Drvar and brought about {{the destruction of the}} RSK as the advances of the Croatian forces paved the way for Operation Storm.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the US 1st Marine Division {{was holding}} firm against the Chinese 39th Army to the east, and the {{withdrawal}} of the South Koreans had left their flank exposed. However, with the Chinese 39th and 40th Armies only tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the 9th Army Group against possible counterattacks from the 1st Marine Division, the Chinese did not exploit this opportunity and the Americans remained relatively unmolested. Yet with the forward UN positions in both the US I Corps and US IX Corps sectors increasingly untenable as the Chinese exploited gaps between formations, Van Fleet ordered a withdrawal to the Kansas Line in the mid-morning. Hoge subsequently ordered the US Marines to form a new defensive position beyond the Pukhan River, between the Hwachon Reservoir and the new position to be occupied by the South Korean 6th Division. Hoge's plan relied on the South Koreans reforming and offering some resistance, and although a rearguard of 2,500 men was belatedly established it was in no condition to fight. Fearing a breakthrough, Hoge ordered the 27th Brigade, as the corps' reserve, to establish defensive positions north of Kapyong on the afternoon of 23 April as a precaution in the event the South Koreans were unable to hold, tasking them with blocking the two approaches to the village and to prevent the Chinese from cutting Route 17, a key route south to Seoul and an important <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> route.|$|E
5|$|The {{navigation}} then {{passes to}} the east of Southampton Airport, while further east is the river channel and the Itchen Valley Country Park. Between the two waterways is Decoy Covert, a small wood which contained a duck decoy. The lock nearby is called Decoy Pond Lock, below which is Sandy Lock. There is little water in this section, since its <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> has been cut off, and although there are springs along this section, the channel is periodically blocked where occupation bridges have been replaced by earth embankments. Sandy Lock has much barbed wire in it, possibly dumped when the wartime defences of the airport were dismantled. The final lock on this section is Mans Bridge Lock, shortly after the modern crossing by the M27 motorway. The cut then rejoins the main river, and passes under the A27 road. The current bridge was constructed in 1975, and replaced a bailey bridge erected during the Second World War. Just below it is a single arched stone bridge dating from the early nineteenth century, which was the original course of the road. It has been restored and is used as a footbridge.|$|E
