5|$|Spain's varied Mediterranean cuisines {{includes}} the cooking of Andalusia, <b>Murcia,</b> Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic islands. Paella is a characteristic Spanish dish, originally from Valencia, radiating {{early on to}} Catalonia and <b>Murcia</b> along Spain's Mediterranean coast. It comes in many versions, and may contain a mixture of chicken, pork, rabbit, or shellfish, sautéed in {{olive oil in a}} large shallow pan, with vegetables, and typically round-grain rice (often of the local albufera, arròs bomba, sénia varieties or similar) cooked to absorb the water and coloured with saffron. The dish may be varied with artichoke hearts, peas, sweet peppers, lima beans, string beans, or sausages.|$|E

The families had previously alleged that police had assaulted the mother of one of the condemned in Carabanchel Prison in Madrid during her final meeting with her son. The remains of Sánchez Bravo were later reinterred in <b>Murcia,</b> with those of Ramón García Sanz being reinterred in Madrid. Juan Paredes, who had been buried in Barcelona, was reinterred in Zarautz on 12 January 1977.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Contador {{announced}} that he had tested positive for the banned clenbuterol from a sample taken during his now-disqualified 2010 Tour victory. He was suspended from racing during an investigation until February 2011.

With overall victory in the Tour he was aiming to complete the Giro-Tour double, last achieved by Marco Pantani in the 1998 Tour. Schleck had placed second to Contador in the previous two Tours and won the young rider classification in the previous three. In the lead up to the Tour his best results were third in the one-day race Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the mountains classification of the Tour de Suisse. Evans, podium finisher in the 2007 and 2008 Tours, had a successful season before the Tour, winning the general classifications of both the Tour de Romandie and Tirreno–Adriatico, as well as second place in the Critérium du Dauphiné.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 15 July 1798 {{was a minor}} naval {{battle of}} the French Revolutionary Wars, fought off the Spanish Mediterranean coast by the Royal Navy ship of the line HMS Lion under Captain Manley Dixon and a {{squadron}} of four Spanish Navy frigates under Commodore Don Felix O'Neil. Lion {{was one of several}} ships sent into the Western Mediterranean by Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent, commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet based at the Tagus in Portugal during the late spring of 1798. The Spanish squadron was a raiding force that had sailed from Cartagena in <b>Murcia</b> seven days earlier, and was intercepted while returning to its base after an unsuccessful cruise. Although together the Spanish vessels outweighed the British ship, individually they were weaker and Commodore O'Neil failed to ensure that his manoeuvrees were co-ordinated. As a result, one of the frigates, Santa Dorotea, fell out of the line of battle and was attacked by Lion.|$|E
5|$|With {{his goal}} tally nearly {{reaching}} 40 goals after spending two full seasons in Sporting's main team, Villa got his chance in Spain's top-flight when Sporting were in financial difficulty – newly promoted Real Zaragoza signed him for approximately €3million {{in the summer}} of 2003. The striker had no trouble adapting to playing at the higher level, netting 17 times in his first season at Zaragoza. His league debut came during Zaragoza's first La Liga game since his arrival, where the team were defeated 1–0 away by Galician side Deportivo de La Coruña while his first goal came two games later, an eighth-minute goal against Real <b>Murcia</b> which put Zaragoza 2–0 up in a match which ended 3–0. 4 December 2003 saw him net his first brace (two goals) in a 2–2 draw against Athletic Bilbao and on 25 April 2004, he scored his first hat-trick in a tight 4–4 draw against Sevilla which saw Villa score all four of Zaragoza's goals, putting his team ahead on two occasions.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November, Benzema scored {{his second}} {{goal of the}} {{campaign}} against Real <b>Murcia</b> in the 2010–11 edition of the Copa del Rey.

In his first match since being inserted into the starting lineup permanently, he scored his first Champions League goal {{of the season in}} a group stage fixture against Dutch club Ajax. In Madrid's final group stage tie against French outfit Auxerre, Benzema scored his first hat trick for the club in a 4–0 win. The first goal he scored was Real Madrid's 300th goal in the Champions League era. Two weeks later, Benzema converted another hat trick, this time in an 8–0 thrashing of Levante in the Copa del Rey. In the team's first fixture of the 2011 calendar year, he assisted on the game-winning goal scored by Ronaldo in a 3–2 win over Getafe. In late January, {{for the first time in}} his Real Madrid career, Benzema scored goals in back-to-back matches. On 23 January, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win at home against Mallorca. Three days later, Benzema repeated his efforts scoring the only goal in a win over Sevilla in the first leg of the team's Copa del Rey semi-final tie. Real Madrid later advanced to its 37th Copa del Rey final in club history after beating Sevilla 2–0 in the second leg.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century during <b>Murcia’s</b> agricultural period, Sucina was a dependent town within <b>Murcia’s</b> jurisdiction. Shortly thereafter, a local parish in Sucina was formed in 1744 by Don Balthazar Artega y Gamba, with the parish represented by a priest from La Orden de Los Clérigos Menores (The order of the young clergy), Don Juan Matheo. In 1768, 919 parishioners were recorded. In the early 19th century, between 1820-1823, Sucina’s Ayuntamiento was erected. Around this era, construction was under way for the inhabitants of the town, whereby 50 terraced houses were built including 400 semi-detached homes, purely for the town's labourers.|$|R

25|$|PP {{claims in}} Barcelona were cast {{off after the}} tally of Spaniards voting abroad gave an even larger margin for the PSC and secured their 14th seat in the constituency. However, the Electoral Commission found {{irregularities}} in <b>Murcia</b> after determining on 5 November {{that the number of}} voters and of ballot papers did not match up in fifteen wards. The new provisional results published on 6 November, which did not include the wards where irregularities had been found, awarded the last seat to PSOE by just two votes. Some IU members openly accused the PSOE of fraud, claiming that Socialist intervenors had voted twice in some wards not just in <b>Murcia,</b> but also in Málaga, Madrid and La Rioja—where, however, election results had not been contested—. A new tally in <b>Murcia</b> resulted in the Commission awarding the seat to IU on 11 November, which prompted the PSOE to announce that they would appeal to the Superior Court of Justice of <b>Murcia.</b> Concurrently, both the PP and the CDS alleged to have found irregularities in several polling stations in Melilla and Pontevedra, where the PSOE had also been awarded seats by a handful of votes, and asked for the vote to be declared void. The chaotic situation was further aggravated when, on 22 November, the PP denounced that it had found cases of duplicity of names in the Ceuta electoral register, with the party demanding for the election to be repeated in <b>Murcia</b> after claiming irregular procedures in the vote tally conducted by the Electoral Commission. The Spanish Attorney General, Javier Moscoso, entered the fray and stated on 24 November that the disputed <b>Murcia</b> seat belonged to the PSOE. On 1 December, the Superior Court of <b>Murcia</b> voided the election results in the constituency and required the government to call a by-election within three months.|$|E
