500|$|While on tour Madonna {{participated in}} the Raising Malawi {{initiative}} by partially funding an orphanage in and traveling to that country. While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in October 2006. The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do. She addressed this on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying {{that there were no}} written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. She described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when she first met him. Banda's biological father, Yohane, commented, [...] "These so-called human rights activists are harassing <b>me</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> threatening me that I am not aware of what I am doing ... They want me to support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband." [...] The adoption was finalized in May 2008.|$|E
500|$|With a {{shooting}} budget of $700,000, Saw began principal photography on [...] at Lacy Street Production Facility in Los Angeles for 18 days. The bathroom {{was the only}} set {{that had to be}} built. Danny Glover completed his scenes in two days. Due to the tight shooting schedule, Wan could not afford to shoot {{more than a couple of}} takes per actor. [...] "It was a really tough struggle for <b>me.</b> <b>Every</b> <b>day,</b> it was me fighting to get the shots I did not get. I had high aspirations, but there's only so much you can do. I wanted to make it in a very Hitchcockian style of filmmaking, but that style of filmmaking takes time to set up and so on," [...] Wan said about the very short shooting schedule. He said the style instead ended up being [...] "more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with" [...] and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.|$|E
500|$|Robson {{appeared}} on The Today Show on May 16, 2013, {{to discuss the}} allegations. Robson told interviewer Matt Lauer that Jackson was [...] "a pedophile and a child sexual abuser" [...] who [...] "performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him" [...] over a seven-year period, beginning in 1990 when Robson {{was seven years old}} when he visited Jackson's Neverland Ranch for the first time. In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had [...] "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time with that he replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's [...] "special friend" [...] in 1990. In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call <b>me</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial. He said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has never}} been proven who {{actually}} fired the final shot into his ear, or determined whether this shot was made during the gunfight {{or as part of}} a possible execution, with wide speculation remaining regarding the subject. Some of Escobar's relatives believe that he had committed suicide. His two brothers, Roberto Escobar and Fernando Sánchez Arellano, believe that he shot himself through the ear. In a statement regarding the topic, the duo would state that Pablo [...] "had committed suicide, he did not get killed.

[...] Kornheiser had not written a regular column for the paper's print edition since 2006. However, Wilbon and Tony continued to tape a [...] "Talking Points" [...] mini online TV feature for the Washington Post until June 3, 2009 when an installment termed the final one was posted on the Post's site.

2500|$|This {{personal}} {{loss was}} immediately followed, on 15 May, by {{the resignation of}} Admiral Fisher after continuing disagreements with Churchill and in frustration at the disappointing developments in Gallipoli. Aged 74, Fisher's behaviour had grown increasingly erratic and, in frequent letters to Lloyd George, he gave vent to his frustrations with the First Lord of the Admiralty; [...] "Fisher writes to <b>me</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> or two {{to let me know}} how things are going. He {{has a great deal of}} trouble with his chief, who is always wanting to do something big and striking." [...] Adverse events, press hostility, Tory opposition and personal sorrows assailed Asquith, and his position was further weakened by his Liberal colleagues. Cassar considers that Lloyd George displayed a distinct lack of loyalty, and Koss writes of the contemporary rumours that Churchill had [...] "been up to his old game of intriguing all round" [...] and reports a claim that Churchill [...] "unquestionably inspired" [...] the Repington Letter, in collusion with Sir John French. Lacking cohesion internally, and attacked from without, Asquith determined that his government could not continue and he wrote to the King, [...] "I have come decidedly to the conclusion that the [...] must be reconstituted on a broad and non-party basis." ...|$|E
