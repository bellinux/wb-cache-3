5|$|<b>Microbial</b> <b>culture</b> from a {{throat swab}} is a {{reliable}} and affordable alternative to an RST which has high sensitivity and specificity. However, a culture requires special facilities and usually takes 48 hours to give a result, whereas an RST can give a result within several minutes.|$|E
5|$|Although an RST cannot {{distinguish}} GAS infection from asymptomatic carriage of the organism, most authorities recommend antibiotic {{treatment in}} the event of a positive RST result from a person with a sore throat. US guidelines recommend following up a negative result with a <b>microbial</b> <b>culture,</b> whereas European guidelines suggest relying on the negative RST.|$|E
5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with <b>microbial</b> <b>culture,</b> which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E
40|$|Quantification of Bdellovibrio-and-like organisms (BALOs) by <b>microbial</b> <b>culturing</b> has {{a number}} of {{substantial}} drawbacks. Therefore a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was designed for the culture-independent enumeration of the Bdellovibrionaceae. After optimization, the dynamic range of the qPCR assay was assessed, the specificity was evaluated and a comparison with quantitative <b>microbial</b> <b>culturing</b> was made. To evaluate the suitability of the qPCR assay for analysing environmental samples, fresh water samples were investigated by <b>microbial</b> <b>culturing</b> and by the qPCR assay. The results revealed a substantial difference between the two techniques and indicate that most Bdellovibrionaceae cells are left undetected in environmental samples when only current <b>microbial</b> <b>culturing</b> techniques are used. The application of this new technique is therefore likely to confirm the hitherto underestimated sizes and roles of predatory bacterial populations in nature. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or <b>microbial</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Microbial</b> <b>cultures</b> for {{diagnosis}} of neonatal sepsis suffer from low sensitivity and reporting delay. Advances in molecular microbiology have fostered new molecular assays that are rapid and may improve neonatal outcomes. We assessed whether molecular assays have sufficient sensitivity (> 0. 98) and specificity (> 0. 95) to replace <b>microbial</b> <b>cultures</b> in the {{diagnosis of}} neonatal sepsis and explored heterogeneity by use of subgroup analyses based {{on the type of}} assay, gestational age of the neonate, and type of sepsis onset. We performed the systematic review as recommended by the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Working Group. Electronic bibliographic databases, conference abstracts, personal files, and reference lists of identified articles were searched. We included studies of case-control or consecutive series design, which evaluated molecular assays (index test) in neonates with suspected sepsis (participants) in comparison with <b>microbial</b> <b>cultures</b> (reference standard). Two reviewers independently assessed the methodologic quality of the studies and extracted data. A bivariate random-effects model was used for meta-analysis of the 23 included studies, and summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were generated. Mean sensitivity and specificity were 0. 90 (95 % CI: 0. 78 - 0. 95) and 0. 96 (95 % CI: 0. 94 - 0. 97), respectively. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and broad-range conventional PCR had higher sensitivity and specificity than other assays.

30|$|Commonly applied {{assumptions}} consider microbial {{populations in}} bioreactors as uniform, thus leveling individual properties of subpopulations to averages. However, {{it is increasingly}} accepted that clonal <b>microbial</b> <b>cultures</b> comprise individuals that are not identical, differing in terms of DNA content and cell physiology (Brehm-Stecher and Johnson [2004]; Delvigne and Goffin [2013]). Heterogeneity of clonal <b>microbial</b> <b>cultures</b> may result from several distinct sources, either from internal biological origins, such as mutations, cell cycle decisions and age distribution, or from ‘external’ technical factors (Avery [2006]; Müller et al. [2010]). Notably, external factors interact with biological properties, yielding the superimposition of both impacts in the population.

Past research on nestmate recognition indicates cuticular hydrocarbons are important nestmate discriminators for social insects, but other factors are likely to contribute to colony-specific odors. Here we experimentally tested whether external microbes contribute to nestmate recognition in red harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex barbatus). We changed the external microbiome of ants through topical application of either antibiotics or <b>microbial</b> <b>cultures.</b> We then observed behavior of nestmates when treated ants were returned to the nest.
