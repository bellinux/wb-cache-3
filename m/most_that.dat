5|$|The BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award is {{the main}} award of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony, which takes place each December. The winner is the sportsperson, judged by a public vote, to have {{achieved}} the <b>most</b> <b>that</b> year. The recipient must either be British or reside and play {{a significant amount of}} their sport in the United Kingdom. The winner is selected by a public-vote from a pre-determined shortlist. The most recent award winner is tennis player Andy Murray, who won in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Baker {{was named}} {{captain of the}} {{football}} team in 1913, his senior year. Princeton finished {{with a record of}} five wins, two losses, and one tie. Over his three-year football career with the Tigers, Baker scored 180 points, a school record that lasted until 1964 when Cosmo Iacavazzi broke it in the final quarter of his last college game. Baker caught over 900 punts in his career, and averaged 300 yards in punt returns per season. He was awarded a varsity letter in football five times; combined with the three letters he earned in hockey, his total was the <b>most</b> <b>that</b> could be earned at Princeton at the time.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Parsons {{drafted a}} {{proposed}} organization and charter for the AFSWP, which they sent to Eisenhower and Nimitz for approval in July 1947. Groves {{did not get}} everything that he asked for; he wanted a status {{equal to that of}} a deputy to the Chief of Staff and Chief of Naval Operations, but the <b>most</b> <b>that</b> Eisenhower and Nimitz would allow was a status equal to that of the heads of a technical service, although Groves still reported directly to them. They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although Groves was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the National Security Act of 1947 created an independent Air Force, Groves reported to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General Roscoe C. Wilson, who had worked on the Silverplate project during the war.|$|E

5|$|The BBC's Sports Personality of the Year {{was created}} by Paul Fox, {{who came up with}} the idea while he was editor of the {{magazine}} show Sportsview. The first award ceremony took place in 1954 as part of Sportsview, and was presented by Peter Dimmock. Held at the Savoy Hotel on 30 December 1954, the show lasted 45minutes. It consisted of one award for the sportsperson judged by the public to have achieved the <b>most</b> <b>that</b> year. Voting was by postcard, and rules presented in a Radio Times article stipulated that nominations were restricted to athletes who had featured on the Sportsview programme since April. For the inaugural BBC Sportsperson of the Year award, 14,517 votes were cast and Christopher Chataway beat fellow athlete Roger Bannister. The following year the show was renamed Sports Review of the Year and given a longer duration of 75 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Southwest Pacific {{was not a}} {{promising}} theater of war for the strategic bomber. The bombers of the day {{did not have the}} range to reach Japan from Australia, and there were no typical strategic targets in the theater other than a few oil refineries. This set up a doctrinal clash between Kenney, an attack aviator, and Walker, the bomber advocate. The long-standing Air Corps tactic for attacking shipping called for large formations of high-altitude bombers. With sufficient mass, so the theory went, bombers could bracket any ship with walls of bombs, and do so from above the effective range of the ship's anti-aircraft fire. However the theoretical mass required was two orders of magnitude greater than what was available in the Southwest Pacific. A dozen or so bombers was the <b>most</b> <b>that</b> could be put together, owing to the small number of aircraft in the theater and the difficulties of keeping them serviceable. The results were therefore generally ineffective, and operations incurred heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 1902 Briarcliff Lodge building {{burned to}} the ground on September 20, 2003. The building was scheduled for demolition within 18 months (they had applied for demolition permits the week before the fire). The owner, Barrington Venture, had planned to raze the building and construct the Garlands, a 385-unit senior living center, which was opposed by local historians and architects. The fire thus ended the preservation effort. The fire started near the main entrance and was suppressed by mid-day; it was deemed suspicious by fire officials, including Briarcliff's fire chief. Residents began calling at 6:37 am, after noticing smoke coming from the site. The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department was the first to arrive, at 6:40 am, later followed by Ossining, Sleepy Hollow, Millwood, Pleasantville, Chappaqua, Croton, and Pocantico Hills, totaling about 150 firefighters. The fire also spread to the lodge's 9-story west wing, through its wooden attic even though a concrete block firewall stood between both sections. The fire departments contained the fire to prevent it from spreading north or to the village water tower, and therefore saved the water tower and village and commercial radio antennae. The north wing was damaged but still standing. After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which sifted through the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson. <b>Most</b> <b>that</b> remained of the original section was the stone facade and chimneys. Contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its duration, Leon-Eline lasted 29days, {{a record}} {{longevity}} for a storm {{in the southern}} Indian Ocean. The track was over 11,000km (6,800mi), or about 25% of the Earth's circumference. However, Eline was in the south-west Indian Ocean for 21days, which is the third most on record. It was behind Cyclone Alibera in 1989 and Cyclone Georgette in 1968, the latter of which lasted 24days in the basin. The MFR noted that Eline was the strongest cyclone to strike the nation in several decades. The storm was uncommon in its landfall on mainland Africa; only 5% of storms in the basin do so, and <b>most</b> <b>that</b> cross or form in the Mozambique Channel turn to the south. Eline was unusual in maintaining its identity so far inland, aided by increased moisture and enhanced upper-level environmental conditions over southern Africa. The storm's long track brought heavy rainfall across Madagascar and southern Africa, causing additional widespread flooding.|$|E
5|$|It is archaeologically {{difficult}} to distinguish Diocletian's fortifications from those of his successors and predecessors. The Devil's Dyke, for example, the Danubian earthworks traditionally attributed to Diocletian, cannot even be securely dated to a particular century. The <b>most</b> <b>that</b> {{can be said about}} built structures under Diocletian's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier (where he followed the works built under Probus along the Lake Constance-Basel and the Rhine–Iller–Danube line), on the Danube- where a new line of forts {{on the far side of}} the river, the Ripa Sarmatica, was added to older, rehabilitated fortresses – in Egypt, and on the frontier with Persia. Beyond that, much discussion is speculative, and reliant on the broad generalizations of written sources. Diocletian and the tetrarchs had no consistent plan for frontier advancement, and records of raids and forts built across the frontier are likely to indicate only temporary claims. The Strata Diocletiana, built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of Bostra, is the classic Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts – defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons – followed by further fortifications in the rear. In an attempt to resolve the difficulty and slowness of transmitting orders to the frontier, the new capitals of the tetrarchic era were all much closer to the empire's frontiers than Rome had been: Trier sat on the Rhine, Sirmium and Serdica were close to the Danube, Thessaloniki was on the route leading eastward, and Nicomedia and Antioch were important points in dealings with Persia.|$|E

25|$|There is {{much focus}} on handball, too. The women's {{national}} team celebrated great successes during the 1990s. On the men's side, Denmark has won eight medals—two gold (in 2008 and 2012), three silver (in 2011, 2013 and 2014) and three bronze (in 2002, 2004 and 2006)—the <b>most</b> <b>that</b> have been won by {{any team in}} European Handball Championship history.|$|E
25|$|By 1999, {{the public}} was clamoring for a {{unification}} bout versus the WBC World Champion, Lennox Lewis of the United Kingdom. That bout happened in March of that year. The bout was declared a controversial draw after twelve rounds, where it appeared to <b>most</b> <b>that</b> Lewis dominated the fight. Holyfield claimed his performance was hindered by stomach and leg cramps. Holyfield and Lewis were ordered by the three leading organizations of which they were champions to have an immediate rematch.|$|E

25|$|Cavour {{agreed with}} Napoleon to cede Savoy and Nice to France, {{in order to}} annex Tuscany and Emilia to Piedmont. Plebiscites were {{arranged}} with huge majorities in all these provinces to approve the changes. Cavour managed to convince <b>most</b> <b>that</b> uniting Italy would make up for these territorial losses. With this, {{the first stage of}} unification was completed. It was now up to Garibaldi to overthrow the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and bring southern Italy into Piedmont's control.|$|E
25|$|Air-sea rescue {{by flying}} boat or {{floatplane}} was a method used by various nations before World War II {{to pick up}} aviators or sailors who were struggling in the water. Training and weather accidents could require an aircrew to be pulled from the water, and seaplanes were occasionally used for that purpose. The limitation was that if the water's surface were too rough, the aircraft {{would not be able}} to land. The <b>most</b> <b>that</b> could be done was to drop emergency supplies to the survivors.|$|E
25|$|Koreans, {{along with}} many other Asians, were experimented on in Unit 731, a secret {{military}} medical experimentation unit in World War II. The victims who died in the camp included at least 25 victims from the former Soviet Union and Korea. General Shiro Ishii, the head of Unit 731, revealed during the Tokyo War Crime Trials that 254 Koreans were killed in Unit 731. Some historians estimate up to 250,000 total people were subjected to human experiments. A Unit 731 veteran attested that <b>most</b> <b>that</b> were experimented on were Chinese, Koreans and Mongolians.|$|E

25|$|To {{turn the}} program around Iowa State hired Wisconsin {{defensive}} coordinator, Dan McCarney. The lone bright spot that McCarney inherited was sophomore phenom running back Troy Davis. Davis {{would go on}} to break nearly every Iowa State rushing and touchdown records, <b>most</b> <b>that</b> still stand. Troy twice earned unanimous All-American honors and was the first NCAA Division I-A running back to rush for over 2,000 yards in back-to-back seasons, a feat {{that has yet to be}} repeated. Davis finished 5th and 2nd in Heisman voting in his 1995 and 1996 campaigns respectively. McCarney would go 10–34 in his first four seasons as the Cyclones head coach.|$|E
25|$|The convincing {{evidence}} {{which was to}} overturn this view became known only after Morley's death, starting with Yuri Knorozov's work in the 1950s. Over the next decades other Mayanists such as Proskouriakoff, Michael D. Coe, and David H. Kelley would further expand upon this phonetic line of enquiry, which ran counter to the accepted view but {{would prove to be}} ever more fruitful as their work continued. By the mid-1970s, it had become increasingly clear to <b>most</b> <b>that</b> the Maya writing system was a logosyllabic one, a mixture of logograms and phonetic components that included a fully functional syllabary.|$|E
25|$|During the 1870s it was {{believed}} by <b>most</b> <b>that</b> the transcontinental railway would take a northwesterly direction from Portage la Prairie. Many thought that the route would most likely go through either Minnedosa or Rapid City, Manitoba because they were both located at natural river crossings. Rapid City was the front runner for {{the site of the}} new railway and had prepared for the impending building boom accordingly. But suddenly, in 1881, the builders of the railway decided to take a more westerly route from Winnipeg, towards Grand Valley. Grand Valley was located on the northern side of the Assiniboine, opposite the side of the river where present-day Brandon sits.|$|E
