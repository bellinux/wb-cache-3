Fans {{wondered}} why the show's staff were supporting Villanova over the North Carolina Tar Heels; one Internet writer hypothesized that it was a reference to the season 9 episode [...] "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson", in which after one of his typical alcoholic binges, Barney Gumble can only recall [...] "giving a guest lecture at Villanova, or <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> street corner." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

6000|$|Going {{down the}} street, you would meet a typical {{commercial}} traveller, dapper and alert. Anon, you encountered a heavily bearded Australian.

60|$|How {{important}} that card {{was to become}} he did not dream, yet he {{decided that it was}} a pretty good card. In turn, he doubted. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> trick of Luck to bring calamity and disaster upon him. Suppose Dede wouldn't have him, and suppose he went on loving her more and more, harder and harder? All his old generalized terrors of love revived. He remembered the disastrous love affairs of men and women he had known in the past. There was Bertha Doolittle, old Doolittle's daughter, who had been madly in love with Dartworthy, the rich Bonanza fraction owner; and Dartworthy, in turn, not loving Bertha at all, but madly loving Colonel Walthstone's wife and eloping down the Yukon with her; and Colonel Walthstone himself, madly loving his own wife and lighting out in pursuit of the fleeing couple. And what had been the outcome? Certainly Bertha's love had been unfortunate and tragic, and so had the love of the other three. Down below Minook, Colonel Walthstone and Dartworthy had fought it out. Dartworthy had been killed. A bullet through the Colonel's lungs had so weakened him that he died of pneumonia the following spring. And the Colonel's wife had no one left alive on earth to love.|$|E

40|$|Blazars show {{rapid and}} high {{amplitude}} variability. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> interesting to question {{what kind of}} process the variability corresponds to. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of the instability of the accretion flows. In this work, Fermi daily light curves of 130 sources are analyzed, and the distributions of daily variability are compared by using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test. The results can be summarized as follows:(1) in most cases, the distributions are not Gaussian; (2) some pairs of the distributions are similar...|$|R
5000|$|In addition, {{his open}} letter to Zhao Yong has drawn {{worldwide}} attention to the high-ranked officials putting pressure on the Chinese press.

5000|$|In consequence, the {{expression}} of art saturated with history, deformed by modernity, diverging {{from the direction of}} art in the free world. Perhaps the experience of the crowd, waiting passively in line, but ready to trample, destroy or adore on command like a headless creature, became the core of my analysis. And <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fascination with the scale of the human body. Or a desire to determine the minimal amount necessary to express the whole.|$|E
5000|$|Shaun Ward {{spoke of}} the album in 1990, during an {{interview}} with his band Everyday People.
