5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} stick to one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it and looked for another opportunity.

Even though Hispanics now heavily populate the area that was once predominantly black, such transition has improved over time. The building of a stronger and <b>more</b> <b>understanding</b> community could help to prevent social chaos arising between the two groups.

25|$|In 1987, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the motion picture, Simon Hawke {{produced}} a novelization of Friday the 13th. One of the few additions to the book was Mrs. Voorhees begging the Christy family to take her back after the loss of her son; they agreed. Another addition in the novel is <b>more</b> <b>understanding</b> in Mrs. Voorhees' actions. Hawke felt the character had attempted to move on when Jason died, but her psychosis got the best of her. When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance that what happened to her son could happen again. Her murders were against the counselors, because she saw them all as responsible for Jason's death.|$|E

This was the first Church Synod to {{explicitly}} examine the issue of pastoral care for people in same-sex civil unions and marriages, identifying {{it as one of}} several concerns which were unheard of until a few years ago. The synod's working document called for less judgment towards people that are gay and <b>more</b> <b>understanding</b> towards same-sex couples in civil unions or marriages, as well as an equal welcome for children of such couples (including conferring baptism), while still rejecting the validity of same-sex marriage itself. However, when the synod convened to discuss the issue, the final report failed to contain the proposed language as it did not manage to receive the necessary two-thirds support of attending bishops' support.|$|E

According to Total Film, Nolan manages to create such strong characters and story that the third-act action sequences cannot compare to [...] "the frisson of two people talking", and Katie Holmes and Christian Bale's romantic subplot has a spark [...] "refreshingly free of Peter Parker/Mary Jane-style whining".|$|E
500|$|Another step to {{move the}} game from the {{apparent}} hip-hop nature was through its song selection. Jackson felt the first game was weighted too heavily to the genre, with about 60% of the songs being hip-hop. The songs in DJ Hero 2 represent {{a wider variety of}} music, including dance, drum and bass, and techno, along with some contributions from hip-hop. Jackson noted {{that they were able to}} work better with artists and publishers for DJ Hero 2, after the successful launch of the first game; with artists and publishers now knowing what to expect, [...] "there is <b>more</b> <b>understanding,</b> so it has opened the doors to us in terms of getting more popular music", according to Jackson. [...] However, licensing for such music remained a difficult barrier. Mixes for DJ Hero 2 are made first through computer-aided mixing of the two song tracks combined with effects noises, with simultaneous authoring of the gameplay markers. Noise for the scratching sections are filled in by recording the sounds of the tracks actually scratched on a DJ deck.|$|E

500|$|McGovern {{had made}} several real estate {{investments}} in the D.C.area and became interested in hotel operations. In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in Stratford, Connecticut, {{with the goal of}} providing a hotel, restaurant and public conference facility. It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in Wall Street Journal and the Nation's Restaurant News. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, [...] "I... wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S.senator and a <b>more</b> <b>understanding</b> presidential contender." [...] His statement would still be resonating with American conservatives two decades later.|$|E

[...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be <b>more</b> <b>understanding</b> instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle.

To promote the book, Trump held a January 5 press conference at Trump Tower, which aired on C-SPAN. [...] He signed books and answered questions from reporters, once asserting, [...] "I {{may be too}} honest to be a politician." [...] Trump's book, consisting of 286 pages, covers Trump's political positions and policy proposals, including strict anti-crime measures, increased pressure on China, fair trade, border control, increased military spending, support for public capital punishment, and the implementation of single-payer health care. [...] It advocates eliminating soft money contributions to political parties and full disclosure of campaign donations to political candidates, but calls {{for the removal of}} limits on the amount of donations, arguing, [...] "f you want to give your life savings to Al Gore, that should be between you, Al Gore and your psychiatrist." [...] In addition, it raises concerns about terrorism, proposing the creation of a national lottery to raise funds for anti-terrorism programs, and offers a choice to North Korea to disarm or face military strikes. [...] The America We Deserve also includes praise for former boxer Muhammad Ali, Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa, as well as Trump's future political opponents Florida governor Jeb Bush and New York governor George Pataki, among others. It cites friendships with baseball player Sammy Sosa and entertainer Sean Combs as making Trump <b>more</b> <b>understanding</b> of racial diversity. Trump later backpedaled his book's praise of Combs after Combs was charged with violating gun laws following a shooting at a New York nightclub. [...] Trump said he did not [...] "know [...] really well." [...] The book condemns Congressman Jerrold Nadler as a [...] "hack" [...] for opposing Trump's development of waterfront real estate in Manhattan, and describes Senator Bob Smith as [...] "the dumbest guy in the U.S. Senate" [...] after he grilled Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry on abortion when she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1999 upon her nomination to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. [...] It criticizes Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley as a [...] "phony" [...] for his Senate sponsorship of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that purportedly hurt Trump financially. [...] It also notes the hypocrisy of both an unnamed Senator and an unnamed conservative columnist who each engaged in extramarital affairs at Trump's hotels and resorts while they attacked President Clinton for the Lewinsky scandal. [...] In a scathing review, New York Magazine described the book as inadvertently satirical. Booklist pondered whether Trump was [...] "the only man ever to run for president in order to promote a book." [...] Dave Saltonstall of the New York Daily News, labeled it as autobiographical and reported that it contains [...] "enough details to paint a fairly comprehensive picture of what a Trump presidency might look like." ...|$|E
