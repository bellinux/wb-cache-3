5|$|Conquistador Hernán Cortés {{passed through}} <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol {{territory}} in 1525, and {{described it as}} sparsely populated. In the 16th century, the coastal towns of Campin and Tzoite were given in encomienda to Hernando Sánchez de Aguilar; they fell within the jurisdiction of colonial Bacalar, on the Yucatán coast near Chetumal. Although some <b>Manche</b> Ch'ols visited the Dominican friars in Cobán, Verapaz, in 1564, the central <b>Manche</b> were not contacted by the Spanish again until 1603, when Dominican missionaries first attempted to evangelise them, and started to gather the scattered inhabitants into towns. In {{the second half of}} the 16th century, the still-independent <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol became a refuge for Christianised Maya living under Spanish domination in Verapaz, who wished to escape and live as apostates among them and their Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours. In 1596, Dominican friar Juan Esguerra reported seeing eleven <b>Manche</b> traders in Cahabón; he claimed that the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol were frequent visitors to the town. In 1600 the regular presence of <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol traders in Cahabón was again reported, and they were said to arrive in greater numbers for the town's festivities in honour of its patron saint. Friar Esguerra complained in 1605 of the great number of Christianised Q'eqchi' Maya of Cahabón that were fleeing the town to live as apostates among the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol.|$|E
5|$|In 1678 the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol {{population}} was devastated by disease; {{in the area}} around the town of San Lucas Tzalac it killed every child under six years old and almost all of those under the age of ten. Total deaths, including adults, numbered over 400 and the epidemic prompted all the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol in the affected region to abandon the mission towns and flee into the forest. The Spanish made a number of further attempts to pacify the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol, but these were ultimately unsuccessful, and the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol rebelled in 1689. In that year many <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol were forcibly relocated to the Urrán Valley in the highlands, resulting in the abandonment of many of the <b>Manche</b> orchards; this eventually led to the collapse of the regional trade network that by then had been fully linked with colonial Guatemala and supplied it with unknown quantities of cacao.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol {{lacked a}} complex {{political}} organisation, and possessed no large towns within their territory. Their largest settlement was <b>Manche</b> itself, with about one hundred multi-family houses. <b>Manche</b> {{was also the}} name of the principal lineage at <b>Manche</b> and this lineage was the origin of the populations of the other <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol towns. Nito was another principal settlement, and an important port for maritime trade that maintained strong links with places as far away as the province of Acalan in what is now southern Campeche in Mexico. Otherwise, the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol lived in generally small settlements governed by one or more chieftains; they were less politically complex than their Lakandon and Itza neighbours, and were not ruled by a principal king or chieftain. They grew relatively little maize, rather concentrating their agricultural production upon the prestige crops of cacao, annatto and vanilla. All the main settlements, both on the coast and inland, were noted for their prodigious cacao and annatto plantations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol subsisted upon a maize-based diet; maize {{was mostly}} {{consumed}} in liquid form, {{such as in}} posole, and was probably eaten as tamales. The <b>Manche</b> diet also included beans, chilli, sweet potato and turkey. Plantain and sugar cane {{were introduced to the}} <b>Manche</b> after European contact.|$|E
5|$|By 1606 {{the missionaries}} had {{concentrated}} many <b>Manche</b> Ch'ols in nine new mission towns, and {{had started to}} penetrate {{the territory of the}} neighbouring Mopan Maya, who were on the borders of the fiercely independent Itza of central Petén. By 1628 the Dominicans were tending to 6,000 Maya in the part of <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol territory that they had gained access to. This figure included some apostate refugees from Spanish-controlled Cahabón. Estimates of the total <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol population in the mid-17th century vary from 10,000 to 30,000, with prominent 20th-century Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson preferring the lower figure as opposed to the high-end estimates by 17th-century chroniclers. The Dominican penetration of Mopan territory alarmed the Itza, who started to harass the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol, driving them away from the mission towns.|$|E
5|$|By 1710 the {{population}} of <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol in Belén had fallen to just four; everyone else had {{died as a result}} of disease, hunger and melancholy. By 1770 the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol were all but extinct; their original territory had been abandoned and had reverted to wilderness, and the few survivors relocated to the highlands numbered not more than 300 in the whole Urran Valley, where there were almost as many Spanish and ladinos. Many <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol in Verapaz were absorbed into the expanding Q'eqchi' Maya population, which gradually occupied the vacated <b>Manche</b> lands. It is possible that a few <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol survived in the forested interior of Toledo District in Belize, to be later absorbed by incoming Q'eqchi' in the late 19th century. In the very early part of the 19th century, a handful of Maya were still recorded as speaking Ch'ol in Cobán.|$|E
5|$|From {{the middle}} of the 16th century the Dominican Order had been tasked with the {{peaceful}} conversion of the Ch'ol of Verapaz and southern Petén, and their concentration into new colonial towns. The Itza became fearful that the newly converted <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol would lead the Spanish to Nojpetén. In 1628 the towns of the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Dominican friar Francisco Morán as their ecclesiastical head. Morán favoured a more robust approach to the conversion of the <b>Manche</b> and moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north. The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the <b>Manche</b> to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements. The Itza, worried about the southern approaches to their territory, may have instigated a <b>Manche</b> rebellion that took place in Lent 1633.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, Franciscan missionaries argued that further {{attempts}} at peaceful pacification of the Ch'ol were useless and argued for armed intervention against the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol and their Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours. The <b>Manche</b> were forcibly relocated in the Guatemalan Highlands, {{where they did}} not prosper. By 1770, most of the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol were extinct. The few survivors were soon absorbed into the surrounding Q'eqch'i Maya population.|$|E
5|$|The French {{squadron}} {{had become}} disorganised in its initial pursuit the British, with <b>Manche,</b> under Captain Jean Dornal de Guy, falling substantially to leeward of the flagship. Seeing this, Stewart realised {{that the best}} hope his convoy had of survival was to unite and attack <b>Manche</b> together. The combined batteries of the East Indiamen could be deployed en masse, hopefully inflicting enough damage to drive <b>Manche</b> away and discourage Hamelin in Vénus from attacking alone. Signalling his intentions to the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom, Stewart turned towards Vénus and bore down on her. Hamelin, realising the threat his scattered squadron faced, signalled for his ships to join up. With the wind against him however, {{it was obvious that}} Windham would reach <b>Manche</b> first.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol were {{a former}} Ch'ol-speaking Maya people inhabiting the extreme south {{of what is}} now the Petén Department of modern Guatemala, the area around Lake Izabal (also known as the Golfo Dulce), and {{southern}} Belize. The <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol took the name <b>Manche</b> from the name of their main settlement. They were the last group of eastern Cholan-speakers to remain independent and ethnically distinct. It is likely that they were descended from the inhabitants of Classic period (c. 250-900 AD) Maya cities in the southeastern Maya region, such as Nim Li Punit, Copán and Quiriguá.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol were {{integrated}} into a regional trade network that included their Itza and Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours, and involved the exchange of <b>Manche</b> produce such as cacao, annatto and vanilla for salt, the only Maya source of which was controlled by the Itza after the Spanish conquest of the province of Acalan. This trade monopoly was maintained by force {{on the part of}} the Itza, who vigorously ensured that the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol remained subservient to them. After the <b>Manche</b> towns on the coast of Belize fell under Spanish control in the 16th century, they continued to have close links with the independent inland <b>Manche</b> settlements. Trade continued and intermarriage was common. The towns in the Cancuén River drainage traded via land and riverine routes with both the independent Itza (notably with Nojpetén) and with colonial Verapaz (principally with Cobán and Cahabón).|$|E
5|$|The conquering Spanish {{carried out}} several {{operations}} to relocate the <b>Manche</b> to Alta Verapaz, with their relocation being completed in 1697, {{a short time}} after the Spanish finally defeated their Itza Maya neighbours to the northwest. Most of the surviving <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol were forcibly resettled in the Guatemalan Highlands, in the villages of El Chol and Belén, in the Urran Valley near Rabinal. The resettled <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol suffered from the abrupt change of climate from tropical lowland rain forest to the cold highlands. They were often not provided with suitable clothing by their Spanish overlords, and many died. The depopulation of the <b>Manche</b> and Lakandon Ch'ol lands, and the resulting collapse of long-standing trade routes, resulted in the gradual impoverishment of colonial Verapaz.|$|E
5|$|The first Catholic missionaries entered {{southern}} Petén in 1596 {{to convert}} the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol and the Mopan. The Q'eqchi' of Verapaz long had close ties with the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol. The colonial Maya towns of Cobán and Cahabón, in Alta Verapaz, traded quetzal feathers, copal, chile, cotton, salt and Spanish-produced iron tools with their lowland Lakandon and <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol neighbours, receiving cacao and achiote in exchange. Many Q'eqchi' from Verapaz fled Spanish control to settle among the Lakandón and <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol. These fugitives strengthened the existing ties between the independent Ch'ol and the Spanish-controlled Maya of Verapaz; the constant flow of Maya between colonial Verapaz and independent Petén led to religious syncretism that the Spanish religious authorities were unable to prevent. This relationship did not hinder the Spanish from using the Q'eqchi' to help conquer and reduce the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol.|$|E
5|$|The first Spanish {{contact with}} the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol was in 1525, when an {{expedition}} led by Hernán Cortés crossed their territory. From the early 17th century onwards, Dominican friars attempted their concentration into mission towns and their conversion to Christianity. These attempts alarmed their warlike Itza neighbours to the northwest, who attacked the mission towns and fomented rebellion among the <b>Manche.</b> The <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol in the mission towns were badly affected by disease, which also encouraged them to flee the towns.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main trade routes {{used by the}} <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol; the first went north along the Mopan River to Chacchilan, then {{overland}} to Nojpetén. The second followed the Cancuén River to Yol, and there joined the Pasión River northwards, leaving the river when it turned west and continuing overland to Nojpetén. Xocmo, on the Sacapulas River, was a trading port where the <b>Manche</b> and Lakandon Ch'ols met to trade cacao and annatto. Xocmo had a major fair, still taking place as late as 1676, where traders arrived from various colonial and independent settlements; these included Nojpetén and the towns of Cobán, San Agustín Lanquín and Sacapulas in colonial Verapaz. The Chols traded cacao and annatto into the encomienda towns of Verapaz in exchange for metal tools (particularly axes and machetes) and salt. Other products traded to the <b>Manche</b> by the Q'eqchi' of colonial Verapaz included cotton textiles and quetzal feathers. The Q'eqchi' used this trade to supply products demanded by their Spanish overlords under the repartimiento system. The <b>Manche</b> produced a number of products for trade, manufactured from resources in the southern Maya Mountains of Belize; these included blowguns, bows and arrows, finely sculpted greenstone axes, hammocks, manos and metates, pottery, and cane, {{all of which were}} traded across the southern Maya region.|$|E
5|$|At 12:00, Dornal de Guy on <b>Manche</b> {{pulled away}} from her {{battered}} opponent, obeying Hamelin's order to join with his flagship. Hamelin then sent <b>Manche</b> and Créole after the slow Charlton and United Kingdom, using Vénus to chase Windham. Stewart had used the break in the action to effect rudimentary repairs to his battered ship and, with the agreement of his officers, determined to abandon the other ships and escape alone. <b>Manche</b> and the corvette rapidly overhauled and captured Charlton and United Kingdom, their captains Charles Mortlock and William D'Esterre making no serious attempt to resist or escape. Vénus however became embroiled in a lengthy chase as Stewart threw all not essential stores overboard {{in an effort to}} make his ship lighter and faster. For five days, Windham led Vénus in pursuit across the Bay of Bengal and it was not until 10:30 on 22 November that Hamelin finally closed with the British ship and forced her surrender.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} Xocolo and Amatique, {{backed by the}} threat of Spanish action, persuaded a {{community}} of 190 Toquegua to settle on the Amatique coast in April 1604. The new settlement immediately suffered a drop in population. In 1628 the towns of the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Francisco Morán as their ecclesiastical head. Morán moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north. The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the <b>Manche</b> to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 17th century Spanish {{priorities}} changed, and {{the failure}} of the peaceful efforts of the Dominicans to convert the Ch'ol combined with the increasing British presence in the Caribbean led the colonial authorities to end the Dominican monopoly and allow the Franciscans and other orders to enter the region; military options were also viewed more favourably. Between 1685 and 1689, the Q'eqchi' of Cobán and Cahabón were forced to assist the Spanish in their armed expeditions against the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol and in forcibly relocating them to Verapaz. These actions depopulated the southern Petén and led to the breakdown of the trade routes linking colonial Guatemala with the independent Maya of Petén. From 1692 to 1694, Franciscan friars Antonio Margil and Melchor López were active among the <b>Manche</b> and Lakandon Ch'ol. They were eventually expelled by the Ch'ol; upon their return to Santiago de Guatemala they proposed three invasion routes into southern Petén and neighbouring Chiapas. Throughout the 17th century, Spanish missionaries encountered considerable reticence among the <b>Manche,</b> until the Spanish finally decided to move them to an area where they could be more easily controlled. At the time of contact there were perhaps 10,000 Manche; these were devastated by war and disease, with the survivors relocated to Rabinal in the modern department of Baja Verapaz. After 1700 the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol ceased to play any part in the history of Petén.|$|E
5|$|In 1622 a {{military}} expedition {{set out from}} Yucatán led by Captain Francisco de Mirones and accompanied by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado; this expedition was a disaster, and the Spanish were massacred by the Itza. In 1628 the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol of the south were placed under {{the administration of the}} colonial governor of Verapaz within the Captaincy General of Guatemala. The <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol unsuccessfully rebelled against Spanish control in 1633. In 1695 {{a military}} expedition tried to reach Lake Petén Itzá from Guatemala; this was followed in 1696 by missionaries from Mérida and in 1697 by Martín de Ursúa's expedition from Yucatán that resulted in the final defeat of the independent kingdoms of central Petén and their incorporation into the Spanish Empire.|$|E
5|$|The highly {{specialised}} <b>Manche</b> production {{methods for}} annatto, cacao and vanilla were {{adopted by the}} incoming Q'eqchi' and are still applied on a small scale. Among the modern-day Q'eqchi', a tradition still exists that these orchards belong to their ancestors, the ch'olcuink spirits, who lack salt and swap cacao for it.|$|E
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} the Itza was the most {{powerful}} polity in the Petén lowlands of northern Guatemala, centred on their capital Nojpetén, on an island in Lake Petén Itzá. The second polity in importance was that of their hostile neighbours, the Kowoj. The Kowoj were located {{to the east of}} the Itza, around the eastern lakes: Lake Salpetén, Lake Macanché, Lake Yaxhá and Lake Sacnab. Other groups are less well known and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Kejache, the Icaiche, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Mopan, the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol and the Yalain. The Kejache occupied an area north of the lake on the route to Campeche, while the Mopan and the Chinamita had their polities in the southeastern Petén. The <b>Manche</b> territory was to the southwest of the Mopan. The Yalain had their territory immediately to the east of Lake Petén Itzá.|$|E
5|$|Although {{diplomatic}} {{representation is}} reserved to the Crown, Jersey {{has been developing}} its own international identity over recent years. It negotiates directly with foreign governments on matters within the competence of the States of Jersey. Jersey maintains the Bureau des Iles Anglo-Normandes in Caen, France, a permanent non-diplomatic representation. A similar office, the Maison de Normandie in St. Helier, represents the Conseil général of <b>Manche</b> and the Regional Council of Normandy. It also houses the Consulate of France. In July 2009, a Channel Islands Tunnel was proposed to connect Jersey with Lower Normandy.|$|E
5|$|COVRA (Centrale Organisatie Voor Radioactief Afval) is the Dutch interim {{nuclear waste}} {{processing}} and storage company in Vlissingen, which stores the waste produced in their only remaining {{nuclear power plant}} after it is reprocessed by Areva NC in La Hague, <b>Manche,</b> Normandy, France. Until the Dutch government decides {{what to do with}} the waste, it will stay at COVRA, which currently has a license to operate for one hundred years. As of early 2017, there are no plans for a permanent disposal facility.|$|E
5|$|Hamelin's {{forces were}} {{immediately}} effective: Caroline attacked a westbound convoy of East Indiamen in the Action of 31 May 1809 in the Bay of Bengal and captured two, the Streatham and Europe. She seized several other small vessels on the cruise before slipping back to Île Bonaparte with her prizes in August. Hamelin too cruised in the Bay of Bengal {{during the summer}} and autumn, Vénus accompanied by <b>Manche</b> and the corvette Créole. On 26 July, Vénus captured the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) warship Orient off the Nicobar Islands.|$|E
5|$|Rowley {{first learned}} of the {{operations}} off Grand Port on 22 August, when Windham arrived off Saint Paul. Eager to support Pym's attack, Rowley immediately set sail in his frigate HMS Boadicea, with the transport Bombay following with two companies of the 86th Regiment of Foot to provide a garrison on any territory seized in the operation. The headwinds were strong {{and it was not}} until 29 August that Rowley arrived off Grand Port, having been notified of the situation there by Magiciennes launch the previous day. Sighting a cluster of frigates around Île de la Passe, Rowley closed with the island before turning sharply when Vénus and <b>Manche</b> raised their colours and gave chase. Rowley repeatedly feinted towards the French ships and then pulled away, hoping to draw them away from Grand Port in the hope that Bombay might board the now unprotected Iphigenia and capture her. Bombay was thwarted by the reappearance of Astrée and Entreprenant and Rowley was chased by Vénus and <b>Manche</b> back to Saint Denis, anchoring there on 30 August. Rowley attempted a second time to rescue Iphigenia from Grand Port the following week, {{but by the time he}} returned Bellone and Minerve had been refloated and the French force was far too strong for Rowley's flagship to attack alone.|$|E
5|$|Sizeable Maya populations {{existed in}} Petén before the conquest, {{particularly}} around the central lakes {{and along the}} rivers. Petén was divided into different Maya polities engaged in a complex web of alliances and enmities. The most important groups around the central lakes were the Itza, the Yalain and the Kowoj. Other groups with territories in Petén included the Kejache, the Acala, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Xocmo, the Chinamita, the Icaiche and the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol.|$|E
5|$|The Kejache {{occupied}} a territory {{to the north}} of the Itza, between the lakes and what is now Campeche. To the west of them was Acalan, inhabited by a Chontal Maya-speaking group with their capital in the south of what is now Campeche state. The Ch'olan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Petén in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation among the Spanish. The Xocmo were another Ch'olan-speaking group; they occupied the remote forest somewhere to the east of the Lakandon. Never conquered, the Xocmo escaped repeated Spanish attempts to locate them and their eventual fate is unknown; they may be ancestors of the modern Lacandon people. The <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol held territory in the extreme south of what is now the Petén department. The Mopan and the Chinamita had their polities in the southeastern Petén. The <b>Manche</b> territory was to the southwest of the Mopan.|$|E
5|$|The Kowoj {{were the}} second in importance, and they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located {{to the east of}} the Itza, around the eastern lakes: Lake Salpetén, Lake Macanché, Lake Yaxhá and Lake Sacnab. Other groups are less well known, and their precise {{territorial}} extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Kejache, the Icaiche, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Mopan, the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol and the Yalain.|$|E
5|$|Trade routes {{not only}} {{supplied}} physical goods, they facilitated {{the movement of}} people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica. Shifts in trade routes occurred with {{the rise and fall}} of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse. Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity; for example, the Contact period <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol traded the prestige crops of cacao, annatto and vanilla into colonial Verapaz.|$|E
5|$|Before their {{defeat in}} 1697 the Itza {{controlled}} or influenced much of Petén {{and parts of}} Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their capital was Nojpetén, an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá. The Kowoj were the second in importance; they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located around the eastern Petén lakes. The Yalain occupied a territory that extended eastwards to Tipuj in Belize. Other groups in Petén are less well known, and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Icaiche, the Kejache, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol, and the Mopan.|$|E
5|$|Gordon arrived off Port Napoleon on 17 September, {{hoping to}} find Rowley {{maintaining}} the blockade off the port in Boadicea. Rowley was however off Île Bourbon, sparring with Bouvet's frigates, and therefore Gordon only found Hamelin's squadron in the harbour. This force consisted of the frigates Vénus and <b>Manche</b> with the corvette Victor. Recognising that he was heavily outnumbered, Gordon sailed westwards towards Île Bourbon to meet with Rowley and pass on the location of Hamelin's squadron. French lookouts on shore spotted Ceylon but mistook her for a troopship due to her unusual construction. The sighting was rapidly passed on to Hamelin, who immediately gave chase with Vénus and Victor.|$|E
5|$|In 1694, two Franciscan friars set {{out from}} Guatemala {{to see if they}} could succeed where the Dominicans had failed. Antonio Margil and Melchor López left Cobán in August 1693 to seek out the hostile Lakandon Ch'ols in the depths of the rainforest. Antionio Margil had already spent two years among the <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol. Although they found the Lakandon, the mission was a failure and the friars were forced to flee. Disappointed by their failure, in April 1694 the friars wrote a letter to the {{president}} of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, Jacinto de Barrios Leal, stating their belief that any further peaceful attempts at converting the Ch'ol peoples were pointless, and that the time had come for military action.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the breed}} are shown {{annually}} at the Paris International Agricultural Show. There are fairs {{held for the}} breed at Lessay and Gavray, in <b>Manche.</b> The National Stud at Saint-Lo remains involved in the maintenance {{and development of the}} breed, and organizes the annual national competition for the breed. The stud also organizes events at which to present the breed to the public, including the Normandy Horse Show. The Norman Cob is beginning to be exported to other countries, especially Belgium. In that country, some are bred pure, while others are crossed on the Ardennes to improve the latter's gaits. Approximately 15 horses are exported annually, traveling to Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy for leisure, logging and agricultural uses.|$|E
5|$|No Spanish {{military}} expeditions {{were launched}} against the Maya of Belize, although both Dominican and Franciscan friars penetrated {{the region in}} attempts at evangelising the natives. The only Spanish settlement in the territory was established by Alonso d'Avila in 1531 and lasted less than two years. In 1574, fifty households of <b>Manche</b> Ch'ol were relocated from Campin and Yaxal, in southern Belize, to the shore of Lake Izabal, but they soon fled back into the forest. In order to counter Spanish encroachment into their territory, the local Maya maintained an uneasy friendship with British loggers operating in central Belize. In 1641, the Franciscans established two reducciones among the Muzul Maya of central Belize, at Zoite and Cehake; both settlements were sacked by Dutch corsairs within a year.|$|E
5|$|In July 1809, Hamelin had {{departed}} Île de France for the Bay of Bengal in Vénus, {{accompanied by the}} corvette Créole and the frigate <b>Manche.</b> The frigates were both armed with at least 40 cannon each and the corvette 14. All three ships were crewed by {{a full complement of}} experienced sailors drawn from the pool of unemployed men stranded in Île de France by the British blockade. This force was followed a month later by the similarly sized frigate Bellone. Hamelin's early cruises were successful: operating initially off the Nicobar Islands, Vénus captured the HEIC armed ship Orient on 26 July. After this however, targets became scarcer and despite the capture of a number of small merchant vessels, Hamelin was forced to take his squadron further east and south to find British shipping to attack. On 10 October, he raided the small trading port of Tappanooly on Sumatra, captured its British population and razed the town.|$|E
5|$|On 31 December, the {{battered}} Vénus docked in Rivière Noire and Stewart and his men, {{who had never}} {{had an opportunity to}} seize their freedom, were marched to Port Louis, where they witnessed the arrival of <b>Manche,</b> accompanied by Créole, Charlton and United Kingdom on 1 January 1810. For their services, Stewart and his fellow prisoners were later released and allowed to sail to the Cape of Good Hope. There they discovered Windham, which had failed to arrive at Île de France. Although her prize crew had retained control of the ship following the storm, they had been sighted, chased and seized within sight of Île de France on 29 December by the newly arrived British frigate HMS Magicienne under Captain Lucius Curtis. Bellone and her prizes arrived at Port Louis on 2 January, having slipped past Rowley's blockade during a period of calm weather.|$|E
