500|$|Guitarist John Frusciante and bassist Flea wrote much of [...] "Give It Away" [...] during jam {{sessions}} {{in the early}} 1990s. Following the Chili Peppers' tour in support of Mother's Milk (1989), the duo spent time in a side project called H.A.T.E. with members of Fishbone. During their tenure in the group, the guitarist and bassist created the main riff and accompanying bassline for [...] "Give It Away". The rhythm was played at several H.A.T.E. performances shortly thereafter, but when the side project disbanded Frusciante and Flea believed the track would be appropriate for the Chili Peppers' upcoming record. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis agreed, and upon hearing {{the rest of the}} Chili Peppers play the song he began chanting [...] "give it away, give it away, give it away now". The phrase had been something the vocalist intended to incorporate into a song for the band's new record, {{but it was not until}} he heard the bassline that the lyrics fit. Kiedis said, [...] "I was so struck by Flea's bass part, which covered the whole length of the instrument's neck, that I jumped up and marched over to the mic, <b>my</b> <b>notebook</b> in tow.

2500|$|Game 6 is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most controversial games in NBA history, as numerous questionable calls went against the Kings in the fourth quarter. The Lakers, led by O'Neal's 41 points and 17 rebounds, won 106-102, setting the stage for Game 7 in Sacramento. There are allegations that the game was affected by the referees in relationship to the Tim Donaghy scandal. The Lakers shot 40 free throws overall, 27 in the fourth quarter alone, and the Kings' big men were plagued with foul trouble (Divac, Webber, Scot Pollard, and Lawrence Funderburke were called for 20 fouls, with Divac and Pollard both fouling out). Webber nearly had a triple double (26 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists), Bibby scored 23, and Divac had 12 points and 12 rebounds. The Washington Post sports columnist Michael Wilbon responded to the calls in Game 6: [...] "I wrote down in <b>my</b> <b>notebook</b> six calls that were stunningly incorrect, all against Sacramento, all in the fourth quarter when the Lakers made five baskets and 21 foul shots to hold on to their championship." [...] For example, Wilbon pointed out that Kobe Bryant did not get a foul called on him after elbowing Mike Bibby in front of an official.|$|E

6000|$|This theme, {{which lay}} outside my plan {{to depict the}} West, had long demanded to be written, and I now set about it with vigor.

60|$|I {{had begun}} my studies of Alpine botany just {{eighteen}} years before, in 1842, {{by making a}} careful drawing of wood-sorrel at Chamouni; and bitterly sorry I am, now, that the work was interrupted. For I drew, then, very delicately; and should have made a pretty book if I could have got peace. Even yet, I can manage my point a little, and would far rather be making outlines of flowers, than writing; and I meant to have drawn every English and Scottish wild flower, like this cluster of bog heather opposite,[4]--back, and profile, and front. But 'Blackwood's {10} Magazine,' with its insults to Turner, dragged me into controversy; and I have not had, properly speaking, a day's peace since; so that in 1868 my botanical studies were advanced {{only as far as}} the reader will see in next chapter; and now, in 1874, must end altogether, I suppose, heavier thoughts and work coming fast on me. So that, finding among <b>my</b> <b>notebooks,</b> two or three, full of broken materials for the proposed work on flowers; and, thinking they may be useful even as fragments, I am going to publish them in their present state,--only let the reader note that while my other books endeavour, and claim, so far as they reach, to give trustworthy knowledge of their subjects, this one only shows how such knowledge may be obtained; and it {{is little more than a}} history of efforts and plans,--but of both, I believe, made in right methods.|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} of “aphlorisms ” {{resulted from a}} search in my old manuscripts. At that time I was preoccupied everyday with noting down in <b>my</b> little <b>notebook</b> various interesting-to-me expressions that I heard or that came to my mind. Etymologically, aphorism + floral = aph(L) orism, which is a short reflection written on a floral design, or a short poetry accompanied by an artistic background. They are colorful contemplations. Maximus in minimis (Lat.) means very much in very little [max in min], or condensed thought, or ideating essence. They are actually maxims, adages, sayings mostly in one line (uni-stich) with a title, as a metaphoric statement, a breathing momentum that oils our soul. The Romanian poet Ion Pillat (1891 - 1945) has published a volume of verses in 1936, just called “Poems in one line”, while I similarly published the book “Through Tunnels of Words ” (trilingual: Romanian-French-English) in 1997 with one-verse lyrics.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Peter Zhang, {{in writing}} {{on the work of}} Deleuze and Guatarri, {{identifies}} what he calls Deleuzian minor rhetoric 1 : namely the need to step outside of the major language and occupy the position of minority. This position of minority, which for Deleuze is a position of power, is achieved through the process of becoming, a constant state of mobility. In a sense {{this is one of the}} motivations for my project - understanding the language of printmaking I find myself invested in by considering the material qualities of printmaking as well as the process or act of printing through a number of visual forms. In order better to understand my own position within printmaking, I have used this project to explore the figure or persona of the printmaker and in doing so I am journeying towards the Deleuzian position of minority by questioning ways of thinking about print and the printmaker. This project is located within the fine arts practice of printmaking, but positions itself as an investigation of the liminal, in-between processes of printmaking in terms of alchemy and ritual through the figure of the printmaker. The project is everything in-between the initial idea for a print and the final product, a space I have come to refer to as The Printer's Grey. This reflects my own art-making methodology and my particular approach and thinking within printmaking, where <b>my</b> <b>notebooks</b> and proofs hold the same importance as the eventual printed product. These objects all reveal a creative process, which is flexible and shifting rather than one that merely renders an image in printed form. In drawing attention to the in-between processes during the act of making I assert both its instrumental role in the creation of the print as well as the importance of the process as a site of thinking through the visual. Specifically in relation to printmaking, The Printer's Grey speaks to and seeks to draw into the gallery space aspects of the in-studio process of making a print - aspects which often remain hidden when viewing a print...|$|R
