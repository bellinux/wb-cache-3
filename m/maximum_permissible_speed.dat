40|$|Purpose. Studies of {{the effect}} of {{aerodynamic}} pressure on the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>speeds</b> of a high-speed train on the existing railway infrastructure. Methodology. The study of the magnitude and direction of the aerodynamic pressure, its effect on the maximum speeds of a high-speed train was carried out on a train model composed of axisymmetric bodies with conical forms of head and tail parts. Findings. Determined the values of the aerodynamic pressure at different distances from the train are, when the high-speed train moves at a speed of 200 km/h or more. The maximum speeds of a high-speed train are determined taking into account the state of the infrastructure of the existing railway, ensuring the safe operation of a high-speed railway. Originality. Theoretical studies of aerodynamic pressure from secondary air currents formed during the movement of high-speed trains are performed on a model of a train composed of identical axisymmetric bodies with conical forms of head and tail moving in a compressible medium. The results of the research allow the regularity of the change in aerodynamic pressure during the movement of a high-speed train. Practical value. The obtained results allow to establish: 1) the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>speeds</b> of a high-speed train taking into account the technical condition of permanent devices and structures of the existing railway infrastructure; 2) technical parameters of individual objects and structural elements of the infrastructure of high-speed iron subjected to the effect of aerodynamic pressure for a given maximum speed of high-speed trains...|$|R

The <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> train <b>speed</b> limits range from 65 km/h on most of the double track sections, to 40 km/h on the single track, and 30 km/h over the tram/train level crossing on the line.|$|R

2500|$|The J {{class was}} {{introduced}} for both passenger and goods traffic on Victoria's branch line network, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> of 45mph (72km/h), later raised to 50mph (80km/h). Dynamometer car tests showed the locomotive developed [...] at the drawbar at around 20-25mph (32–40km/h), which suited {{the relatively low}} speed limits {{of much of the}} Victorian branch line network.|$|E
2500|$|All lines but the Yellow Line are {{equipped}} with automatic train control. Generally, the train operator does the closing of doors and starts the DA (Départ automatique, automatic departure), and then the train drives itself. The train operator can also drive the train manually {{at his or her}} discretion. Signalling is effected through coded pulses sent through the rails. Coded speed orders and station stop positions transmitted through track beacons are captured by beacon readers mounted under the driver cabs. The information sent to the train's electronic modules conveys speed information, and {{it is up to the}} train automatic control system computer to conform to the imposed speed. Additionally, the train computer can receive energy-saving instructions from track beacons, providing the train with four different economical coasting modes, plus one mode for maximum performance. In case of manual control, track speed is displayed on the cab speedometer indicating the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>speed.</b> The wayside signals consist of point (switch/turnout) position indicators in proximity to switches and inter-station signalling placed at each station stop. Trains often reach their maximum speed of [...] in 16 to 26 seconds depending on grade and load.|$|E
2500|$|Pilots {{soon learned}} that the Me 262 was quite maneuverable despite its high wing loading and lack of {{low-speed}} thrust, especially if attention was drawn to its effective maneuvering speeds. The controls were light and effective {{right up to the}} <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> and perfectly harmonised. The inclusion of full span automatic leading-edge slats, something of a [...] "tradition" [...] on Messerschmitt fighters dating back to the original Bf 109's outer wing slots of a similar type, helped increase the overall lift produced by the wing by as much as 35% in tight turns or at low speeds, greatly improving the aircraft's turn performance as well as its landing and take off characteristics. As many pilots soon found out, the Me 262's clean design also meant that it, like all jets, held its speed in tight turns much better than conventional propeller-driven fighters, which was a great potential advantage in a dogfight as it meant better energy retention in maneuvers. Luftwaffe test pilot and flight instructor Hans Fey stated, [...] "The 262 will turn much better at high than at slow speeds and, due to its clean design, will keep its speed in tight turns much longer than conventional type aircraft." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} dive brakes were mostly used on dive bombers, which needed to dive very steeply, but without {{exceeding}} their red line speed, {{in order to}} drop their bombs accurately. The airbrakes or spoilers fitted to gliders often function both as landing aids, to adjust the approach angle, {{and to keep the}} aircraft's <b>speed</b> below its <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> indicated air <b>speed</b> in a vertical dive. Most modern combat aircraft are equipped with air brakes, which perform the same function as dive brakes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicles}} can accelerate {{at a rate}} of [...] Their <b>permissible</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>speed</b> is 90 km/h. The {{electric brake}} can slow the vehicles at a similar rate of 0.8 m/s², down to 20 km/h. At that point, the vehicle switches automatically to the electropneumatic brake, to compensate for the declining electric braking performance. The electric brake is also designed for continuous loading, which occurs in applications such as persistent braking of a fully loaded train on a 4.5 ‰ slope (e.g. Davos - Küblis). The vehicles' output per hour is [...] at 45 km/h.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} Digital Tachograph is {{a regulatory}} instrument (mandatory by Council Regulation since 1 st May 2006) {{to enforce the}} application of social regulations in road transport especially with the view to increase traffic safety. It records the work and the rest times of drivers {{as well as the}} vehicle speed over time with the aim to ensure that appropriate rest periods are taken by drivers and that a <b>maximum</b> of <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> is not exceeded. The original and prime functionality of the Digital Tachograph is to document, i. e. to record, the driving history of a driver and his vehicle. Nevertheless controls by the road safety authorities are rather inefficient while time-consuming. The proposed update to the existing regulation would rather guarantee the Digital Tachograph as a compliance device rather than as an accurate recorder of driving history. Basic innovation is the application of short range communication technologies (like RFID) allowing the road authorities to scan by-passing vehicles and thus increasing the throughput by the order of ten.

40|$|Ballast is most {{commonly}} used as a structural component of rail track due to its high load bearing capacity, resiliency and rapid drainage. However, ballast along coal freight corridors often becomes fouled due to spilling of coal from moving wagons, in addition to further track deterioration attributed to particle breakage and pumping of soft subgrade. Highly fouled ballast needs to be cleaned or replaced to maintain the desired track resiliency, load bearing capacity and the track alignment. In order to identify the risk associated with fouling, {{it is important to}} accurately assess the amount of fouling. In this paper, the use of Void Contaminant Index (VCI) compared to other mass-based indices is critically examined. A series of isotropically consolidated drained triaxial tests using a large scale cylindrical triaxial apparatus have been conducted on both clean and fouled ballast with varying VCI to assess the stress-strain and degradation characteristics. In accordance, a non-linear shear strength envelope for clean and fouled ballast is presented in a non-dimensional form. The <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> train <b>speed</b> under different level of fouling is also proposed...|$|R
40|$|Subject of investigation: {{development}} of {{the design of the}} rig of a screw submersible pump with a surface drive for enhancing the effectiveness of operation of wells with complicated conditions. Analytical dependences are obtained for pressure losses for the hydraulic resistance in the screw hyrotor-type pump, and for the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> rotational <b>speed</b> of the rotor, which interconnect the technological and operational factors. Consideration is given to the energy balance of the rig. The investigation deals with the influence of the fluid viscosity on the pump characteristic with a kinetic ratio of 9 : 10. Field tests of the rig of the screw submersible pump with the surface drive were carried out. The production prototype of the screw submersible pump with the surface drive is put into use. The positive results of the tests were appropriately certified. The use of the developed rigs makes it possible to reduce the cost of the production of high-viscosity oil with a high sand and gas content from shallow wells and from low-production wells.

50|$|The {{station was}} built between 1900 and 1902 {{according}} to a design by Czesław Domaniewski on the broad gauge Warsaw-Kalisz Railway. In 1914 the line rebuilt to standard gauge and in 1916, the line became double track. The section from Błonie to Sochaczew was electrified in 1959 and in 1961 the next section to Kutno was electrified. The electrification of the E20 line was completed in 1988. In 1992 the modernisation of the section Warsaw - Poznan started, with the task to adapt the E20 route to a driving speed of 160 km/h.

50|$|In Saarbrücken Hauptbahnhof, {{the speed}} is {{generally}} limited to 60 km/h. In the following Saarbrücken-Schafbrücke and Rentrisch-St. Ingbert sections the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> is 90 km/h. Between Schafbrücke and Rentrisch it is 100 km/h and from Scheidt (Saar) it is 110 km/h. Shortly after St. Ingbert station the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> is gradually increased to 120 km/h, 140 km/h and 160 km/h. The <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> shortly after Limbach is 150 km/h, but, {{due to a}} narrow curve radius before Homburg (Saar) Hauptbahnhof, it is reduced to 110 km/h (120 km/h in the opposite direction). After this curve, the maximum allowed speed is restored to 160 km/h but in Einsiedlerhof marshalling yard it is reduced to 140 km/h again. From the entrance signal to Kaiserslautern Hauptbahnhof it is reduced to 100 km/h (90 km/h in the opposite direction) but the maximum speed is returned at the next curve to 140 km/h and raised to 150 km/h outside the station.|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to a static design, a dynamic analysis has to be performed for bridges for which the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> train <b>speed</b> exceeds 200 km/h. This analysis {{requires a lot of}} computing time, for this reason Svedholm and Andersson (2016) have developed a simple tool describing the relationship between the first eigenfrequency of the bridge, the span length and the minimum mass to fulfill the regulation specified in EN- 1990. However, these diagrams are based on 2 D beam models in which the 3 D dynamic effects are not considered. An evaluation of the torsional modes has been performed by analyzing parametrized 3 D bridge models, in order to obtain design diagrams including these effects. To do so, a frequency domain analysis has been implemented, based on a steadystate step previously performed in a FEM software. This approach provides a fast way to solve the equation of motion due to the Fourier transform properties, and allows applying several load configurations which are convenient for a parametric study. From this analysis it can be concluded that the thickness to fulfill the demands is larger for 3 D models than for 2 D. On one hand, contribution of torsional modes of vibration is more significant for the shortest span length, {{and on the other hand}} shear-lag effects lead to a reduction of the total resisting bending section...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -A {{two-dimensional}} aerofoil of NACA 0015 {{section was}} tested at zero incidence in the Royal Aircraft Establishment 10 ft x 7 ft High-speed Wind Tunnel and measurements {{were made of}} (a) Static pressure on the aerofoil surface at Reynolds numbers of 1 * 4 x 10 G to 5. 5 x 10 G (b) Static pressure on the aerofoil surface, on the tunnel walls and in the stream between the aerofoil and the walls at R = 2. 8 x 106. All the tests were made at Mach numbers of 0. 7 upwards and were continued past the choking Mach number of 0. 764 until either the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> fan <b>speed</b> was reached or the maximum available power was being used. The {{results showed that the}} choking Mach number was about 0. 764 at Reynolds numbers from 1 * 4 x 106 to 2. 8 x 106. Above M = 0. 760 the development of the supersonic region towards the walls was extremely rapid in terms of tunnel Mach number. At M = 0 - 761 the sonic line was only about half-way out to the tunnel walls and at M = 0. 764 it had reached them. Before and during choking quite large changes in the aerofoil pressure distributions were producetl by varying the Reynolds number. At M = 0. 73 and 0. 75 the shape of the pressure distribution curves indicated the possibility of a A-shock at the lower Reynolds numbers and a single shock at the higher Reynolds numbers. 1.
