Estimations of <b>microcapillary</b> <b>columns</b> of immunoprecipitate compare favorably with ultracentrifugal analysis of S 0 - 400 lipoproteins. An equa-tion derived from these data converts millimeters of lipoprotein precipitate into milligrams lipoprotein S 0 - 400 per 100 ml. serum.

A. VAILABLE EVIDENCE frequently points to an association of ather-osclerosis with impaired lipid metabolism (1). Estimations of serum glyceride as well as cholesterol appear valuable in distinguishing normal from atherosclerotic individuals (2, 3). A majority of these serum lipids are transported by low-density lipoproteins which have also been implicated in atherogenesis (4). Olson (5, 6) suggests not only that serum low-density lipoproteins are the agent for atheroscle-rosis, but also that this view may be defended according to Koch’s postulates.

The gondola includes instruments to measure the concentrations of condensation nuclei (CN), cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), optically detectable aerosol (OA.) (r {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 15 - 2. 0 microns), and optical scattering properties using a nephelometer (lambda = <b>530</b> <b>microns).</b> All instruments sampled from a common inlet which was heated to 40 C on ascent and to 160 C on descent. Flights with the CN counter, OA counter, and nephelometer began in July 1994. The CCN counter was added in November 1994, and the engineering problems were solved by June 1995. Since then the flights have included all four instruments, and were completed in January 1998. Altogether there were 20 flights from Laramie, approximately 5 per year, and 2 from Lauder. Of these there were one or more engineering problems on 6 of the flights from Laramie, hence the data are somewhat limited on those 6 flights, while a complete data set was obtained from the other 14 flights. Good CCN data are available from 12 of the Laramie flights. The two flights from Lauder in January 1998 were successful for all measurements. The results from these flights, and the development of the balloon-bome CCN counter have formed the basis for five conference presentations. The heated and unheated CN and OA measurements have been used to estimate the mass fraction of the aerosol volatile, while comparisons of the nephelometer measurements were used to estimate the light scattering, associated with the volatile aerosol.

To understand turbulence, measurements were done in the riser with <b>530</b> <b>micron</b> glass beads using a PIV technique. This report summarizes the measurements and simulations completed as described in details in the attached paper, ''Computational and Experimental Modeling of Three-Phase Slurry-Bubble Column Reactor. '' The Particle Image Velocimetry method described elsewhere (Gidaspow and Huilin, 1996) {{was used to measure}} the axial and tangential velocities of the particles. This method was modified {{with the use of a}} rotating colored transparent disk. The velocity distributions obtained with this method shows that the distribution is close to Maxwellian. From the velocity measurements the normal and the shear stresses were computed. Also with the use of the CCD camera a technique was developed to measure the solids volume fraction. The granular temperature profile follows the solids volume fraction profile. As predicted by theory, the granular temperature is highest at the center of the tube. The normal stress in the direction of the flow is approximately 10 times larger than that in the tangential direction. The is lower at the center where the is higher at that point. The Reynolds shear stress was small, producing a restitution coefficient near unity. The normal Reynolds stress in the direction of flow is large due to the fact that it is produced by the large gradient of velocity in the direction of flow compared to the small gradient in the {theta} and r directions. The kinetic theory gives values of viscosity that agree with our previous measurements (Gidaspow, Wu and Mostofi, 1999).

As with most plants the number of seeds produced varies much, it might be thought that the present case was one merely of variability. But this view must be rejected, {{as far as the}} less fertile plants in these three classes are concerned: first, because none of the plants in Class 5 attained their proper height, which shows that they were in some manner affected; and, secondly, because many of the plants in Classes 5 and 6 produced anthers which were either contabescent or included small and shrivelled pollen-grains.

40|$|Experimental and {{computational}} {{investigations of}} dilute gas/particle flow in a vertical lifter are performed. The effect of superficial gas velocity, particle density, {{particle size distribution}} and particle loading on particle velocities, particle fluctuations and particle cross-moment have been studied experimentally using laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) and particle image velocimetry (PIV). The results from the experimental investigation is compared with the computational investigation using FluentR. The experimental measurements are performed on a lab-scale vertical lifter, consisting of a fluidizing silo and a receiving tank with a glass pipe in which the solids phase is transported. The particles are placed in the fluidization tank and transport air enters {{at the bottom of}} the silo. The transport pipe is suspended above the inlet and as the transport air passes the opening, the particles are dragged into the air flow and transported upwards to the receiving tank. Fluidizing air is used to control the particle loading in the system and supplied through a distribution plate. The test section of the transport pipe is made of glass to enable the use of the optical laser based investigation techniques, LDA and PIV. Two types of powders are used, ZrO 2 and glass, each with two different particle size distributions, average diameter of 260 and <b>530</b> <b>micron</b> and 120 and 518 micron, respectively. The experimental techniques LDA and PIV are used to investigate a dilute gas/particle vertical flow. The two techniques are also evaluated for use on this type of flow. LDA is a single point measurement technique, which means that one point is measured at a time. The acquisition stops when a pre-set criteria is reached, this can either be based on sample number or time. A measurement spanning over the whole cross-section of the pipe consists of several points. These points makes up a cross-sectional profile. PIV on the other hand is a whole field technique and consequently the whole cross-section of the pipe is measured simultaneously. Within a given time interval two laser pulses light up the flow and the reflection of the particles is captured by a camera. Satisfactory measurements of all the particle types are performed using LDA. The mean axial and normal particle velocities and fluctuations as well as the cross-moment, are measured at varying particle volume fraction and superficial gas velocity. The value of the measured quantities will vary depending on the particle size, particle density, particle volume fraction and superficial gas velocity. A comparison between the particle types show that the mean axial particle velocity is highest for the lighter and smaller particles, but the fluctuations are greatest for the larger and heavier particles. For smaller particles LDA is a very efficient measurement tool. For the largest particles the acquisition can be time consuming due to relatively few particles in the system. PIV measurements are generally performed satisfactory on all of the particle types. The exception is measurements performed on the smaller particles at the higher particle volume fractions. The mean axial and normal particle velocities and fluctuations including the crossmoments are measured at varying particle volume fraction and superficial gas velocity. The results from the measurements show that the measured quantities will vary depending on the particle size, particle density, particle volume fraction and superficial gas velocity. When comparing the particle types, it is observed that the mean axial particle velocity is highest for the smaller and lighter particles while the fluctuations are lower than for the larger and heavier ones. The combination of particles larger than commonly used tracer particles and higher particle volume fractions is challenging, but overall the PIV technique works well. Comparison between LDA and PIV results show generally a good agreement for the mean axial particle velocity. The mean axial and normal particle fluctuations and the particle crossmoment are generally measured lower when using PIV. Simulations are performed using FluentR and the model Euler-Euler, where both phases are  regarded as being continua. The kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) is included for the solids phase. Initially only the single transport pipe is simulated in 2 d and 3 d. The flow in this pipe is dilute and therefore the simulations which included KTGF and the Gidaspow drag model are compared to simulations enabling the constant viscosity model (CVM) and the Schiller-Naumann drag model. The results from the simulations show very little difference between the two simulations. Euler-Euler with KTGF 2 d and 3 d simulations are performed for all of the particle types. Little difference between 2 d and 3 d simulations are observed. A comparison between simulations and experimental results, LDA and PIV, showed good agreement for axial particle velocity for all of the particle types. The upward transport of particles in a vertical pipe is also simulated using Euler-Lagrange. Here a number of particles are tracked and compared to the experiments with good agreement. Simulations of the vertical lifter, a silo containing the particles and a transport pipe, show that simulations using Euler-Euler including KTGF and the Gidaspow drag model over-predicted the particle volume fraction in the pipe compared to the experiments. The reason for this discrepancy is that the experimental set-up is modified to give low particle volume fractions in the transport pipe to enable the use of lasers to investigate the flow.

Here a {{convenient}} watering-place, not commanded by the opposite bank, and the shade of eight or ten thorny bushes afforded the first suitable bivouac. At 3.30 P.M. on the 30th the march was continued eight and a half miles to a spot some little distance beyond Shebabit. The pace was slow, and the route stony and difficult. It was after dark when the halting-place was reached. Several of the men strayed from the column, wandered in the gloom, and reached the bivouac exhausted. General Hunter had proposed to push on the next day to Hosh-el-Geref, but the fatigues of his troops in the two night marches had already been severe, and as, after Abu Haraz, the track twisted away from the river so that there was no water for five miles, he resolved to halt for the day and rest. Hosh-el-Geref was therefore not reached until the 1st of August--a day later than had been expected; but the rest had proved of such benefit to the troops that the subsequent acceleration of progress fully compensated for the delay. The column moved on again at midnight and halted at daybreak at Salmi. In the small hours of the next morning the march was resumed. The road by the Nile was found too difficult for the Maxim guns, which were on wheels, and these had to make a detour of twenty-eight miles into the desert while the infantry moved ten miles along the river. In order that the Maxims should not arrive alone at Dakfilli, General Hunter had marched thither with the IXth Soudanese at 11 P.M. on the previous day. The rest of the column followed a few hours later. On the 4th, by an eighteen-mile march through deep sand, El Kab was reached. A single shot was fired from the opposite bank of the river as the cavalry patrol entered the village; and there was no longer any doubt that the Dervishes knew of the advance of the column. Both the troops and the transport were now moving admirably; nevertheless, their sufferings were severe.|$|R
60|$|The lessened {{fertility}} of most {{of these}} illegitimate plants is in many respects a highly remarkable phenomenon. Thirty-three plants in the seven classes were subjected to various trials, and the seeds carefully counted. Some of them were artificially fertilised, but the far greater number were freely fertilised (and this is the better and natural plan) {{through the agency of}} insects, by other illegitimate plants. In the right hand, or percentage <b>column,</b> in Table <b>5.30,</b> a wide difference in fertility between the plants in the first four and the last three classes may be perceived. In the first four classes the plants are descended from the three forms illegitimately fertilised with pollen taken from the same form, but only rarely from the same plant. It is necessary to observe this latter circumstance; for, as I have elsewhere shown, most plants, when fertilised with their own pollen, or that from the same plant, are in some degree sterile, and the seedlings raised from such unions are likewise in some degree sterile, dwarfed, and feeble. (5/3. 'The Effects of Cross and Self- fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom' 1876.) None of the nineteen illegitimate plants in the first four classes were completely fertile; one, however, was nearly so, yielding 96 per cent of the proper number of seeds. From this high degree of fertility we have many descending gradations, till we reach an absolute zero, when the plants, though bearing many flowers, did not produce, during successive years, a single seed or even seed-capsule. Some of the most sterile plants did not even yield a single seed when legitimately fertilised with pollen from legitimate plants. There is good {{reason to believe that the}} first seven plants in Class 1 and 2 were the offspring of a long-styled plant fertilised with pollen from its own-form shortest stamens, and these plants were the most sterile of all. The remaining plants in Class 1 and 2 were almost certainly the product of pollen from the mid-length stamens, and although very sterile, they were less so than the first set. None of the plants in the first four classes attained their full and proper stature; the first seven, which were the most sterile of all (as already stated), were by far the most dwarfed, several of them never reaching to half their proper height. These same plants did not flower at so early an age, or at so early a period in the season, as they ought to have done. The anthers in many of their flowers, and in the flowers of some other plants in the first six classes, were either contabescent or included numerous small and shrivelled pollen-grains. As the suspicion at one time occurred to me that the lessened fertility of the illegitimate plants might be due to the pollen alone having been affected, I may remark that this certainly was not the case; for several of them, when fertilised by sound pollen from legitimate plants, did not yield the full complement of seeds; hence it is certain that both the female and male reproductive organs were affected. In each of the seven classes, the plants, though descended from the same parents, sown at the same time and in the same soil, differed much in their average degree of fertility.|$|R
