25|$|By the 1970s, the Dubois Brothers, in {{the west}} end, had become the most {{prevalent}} loan sharks using the bars they had taken as their offices in order to run their loan sharking business. In order for a borrower to obtain a loan they had to {{pay a visit to}} one of the Dubois Brothers offices or businesses where if the loan were approved they would either receive the money directly or delivered later to them. It was expected of the borrower to make their payments in cash to the same location that they borrowed from and the interest of the loan was substantial usually sitting around 30%. One of their associates who turned informant, Dugenais, told police that majority of the Dubois Brothers loan shark customers were taxi drivers who would take the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the night clubs and racetrack. One of the clients had claimed that because he could not afford to pay his $50 debt, which he ran up playing billiards, to Adrien Dubois {{he had no choice but}} to agree to be forced into the drug trade as a drug pusher claiming that they were greedy and took more profit than they should have.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Jefferson {{drafted a}} [...] "Bill for More General Diffusion of Knowledge" [...] {{to create a}} {{universal}} public education, but most planters at the time did not want tax <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> educating poor children. Nonetheless, Thomas Jefferson started the first public university, The University of Virginia, in 1819. The first free public school systems were established around 1851, although unlike Northern and Western states, public education was not required under the Virginia state constitution until 1870, after an innovation in the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868 (although paying for such education became controversial in the next decade).|$|E

[...] "Even if they are not hurt or they don't go to hospital, we will still give them this money." [...] The carrier may pay more after the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board completes its investigation into the accident.

Born {{to a family}} of sharecroppers in Texas, {{she went into the}} cotton fields at a young age but also studied in a small segregated school and went on to attend one term of college at Langston University. [...] She developed an early interest in flying, but African Americans, Native Americans, and women had no flight-school opportunities in the United States, so she saved up <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> France to become a licensed pilot. She soon became a successful air show pilot in the United States, and hoped to start a school for African-American fliers. [...] She {{died in a plane crash}} in 1926 while testing her new aircraft.

2500|$|The tour began [...] in 1929 and {{at various}} times the tournament players had {{attempted}} to operate independently from the club professionals. With an increase of revenue in the late 1960s due to expanded television coverage, a dispute arose between the touring professionals and the PGA of America on how to distribute the windfall. The tour players wanted larger purses, where the PGA desired the <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the general fund to help grow the game at the local level. Following the final major in July 1968 at the PGA Championship, several leading tour pros voiced their dissatisfaction with the venue and the abundance of club pros in the field. The increased friction resulted in a new entity in August, what would eventually become the PGA Tour. Tournament players formed their own organization, American Professional Golfers, Inc. (APG), independent of the PGA of America.|$|E

2500|$|Metro Toronto greatly {{expanded}} {{the ability to}} finance capital works projects and Gardiner followed three principles in the allocation of money. Gardiner chose under his chairmanship to negotiate the amount of <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> local municipalities, but did not interfere in the actual ways the local municipalities spent the money. He also pursued a policy of balance between {{the city and the}} suburbs. He pushed for the Bloor-Danforth subway, located mostly in the City, but he also pushed for a uniform water rate, a policy that favoured the suburbs. His third principle was to limit demand. While in 1953, he claimed that [...] "there was nothing we could not afford", in 1954, he cautioned against the belief that [...] "Metro has more money in the aggregate than we all had individually." [...] Later in his term, Gardiner named $100 million as the upper limit of annual capital borrowing. He held onto the total figure [...] "it was a nice round number" [...] until 1961, when he agreed to a five per-cent increase.|$|E
2500|$|On September 27, 1969, Pacific Union College {{students}} Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard were picnicking at Lake Berryessa on a {{small island}} connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge. A white man, about 5'11" [...] weighting more than 170 lbs with combed greasy brown hair, approached them wearing a black executioner's-type hood with clip-on sunglasses over the eye-holes and a bib-like device on his chest that had a white 3"x3" [...] cross-circle symbol on it. He approached them with a gun, which Hartnell {{believed to be a}} [...]45. The hooded man claimed to be an escaped convict from a 2 words jail of either Colorado or Montana (police officer estimated he meant Deer Lodge, Montana), where he had killed a guard and stolen a car, explaining that he needed their car and <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Mexico. He had brought precut lengths of plastic clothesline and told Shepard to tie up Hartnell, before he tied her up. The killer checked, and tightened Hartnell's bonds after discovering Shepard had bound Hartnell's hands loosely. Hartnell initially believed it to be a weird robbery, but the man drew a knife and stabbed them both repeatedly. The killer then hiked 500 yards back up to Knoxville Road, drew the cross-circle symbol on Hartnell's car door with a black felt-tip pen, and wrote beneath it: [...] "Vallejo/12-20-68/7-4-69/Sept 27–69–6:30/by knife." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, Pennsylvania, owing to a concurrence of events, could not pay the interest on her debt for two years and a half, though she is doing it now, and will doubtless continue to do it. The sudden breaking down of that colossal moneyed institution, the soi-disant Bank of the United States, after it ceased to be in reality a bank of the government, brought about such a state of the circulation as rendered payment, by any of the ordinary means known to government, impossible. I know what I say, and repeat impossible. It is well known that many persons, accustomed to affluence, had to carry their plate to the mint, in order to obtain <b>money</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> market. Then something may be attributed to the institutions, without disparaging a people's honesty. Our institutions are popular, just as those of France are the reverse; and the people, they who were on the spot--the home creditor, with his account unpaid, and with his friends and relatives in the legislature, and present to aid him, contended for his own money, before any should be sent abroad." ...|$|E
6000|$|Before they parted, Alan made a {{proposal}} that was startling in the extreme. He would be at Collette's that night about twelve, he said. Why should not John come there and get the <b>money?</b> <b>To</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Collette's was to see life indeed; it was wrong; it was against the laws; it partook, in a very dingy manner, of adventure. Were it known, {{it was the sort}} of exploit that disconsidered a young man for good with the more serious classes, but gave him a standing with the riotous. And yet Collette's was not a hell; it could not come, without vaulting hyperbole, under the description of a gilded saloon; and if it was a sin to go there, the sin was merely local and municipal. Collette was simply an unlicensed publican, who gave suppers after eleven at night, the Edinburgh hour of closing. If you belonged to a club, you could get a much better supper at the same hour, and lose not a jot in public esteem. But if you lacked that qualification, and were an-hungered, or inclined towards conviviality at unlawful hours, Collette's was your only port. You were very ill supplied. The company was not recruited from the Senate or the Church, though the Bar was very well represented on the only occasion on which I flew in the face of my country's laws, and, taking my reputation in my hand, penetrated into that grim supper-house. And Collette's frequenters, thrillingly conscious of wrong-doing and [...] "that two-handed engine (the policeman) at the door," [...] were perhaps inclined to somewhat feverish excess. But the place was in no sense a very bad one; and it is somewhat strange to me, at this distance of time, how it had acquired its dangerous repute.|$|E
