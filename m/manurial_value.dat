30|$|The {{result of}} the {{experiment}} indicated that all the parameters were improved by the decomposition using earthworms and the C/N ratio was within the limits that indicate the maturity of the compost. The organic carbon, organic matter, total nitrogen, phosphorus, copper, iron, zinc and manganese contents were analyzed and found to be improved after decomposition. The added crop residues and animal manures enhanced the decomposition process and <b>manurial</b> <b>value</b> of the khat leaf waste.|$|E

In all the treatments, {{a decrease in}} pH and OC total but increase in EC, N total, P total, Ca total, K total and heavy metals was recorded. Our results demonstrate that if Vitex is mixed 2 : 1 with BPS and vermicomposted employing E. eugeniae its <b>manurial</b> <b>value</b> can be increased...|$|E
40|$|The <b>manurial</b> <b>value</b> of P. glabra seed-cake in India {{has been}} {{attributed}} to nitrification inhibitors. In laboratory experiments with soil samples, both seed and bark extracts inhibited the oxidation of NH 4 -N (NH 4 -N concn. approx. twice that of controls at 45 days), the effect being slightly greater with the seed extract. Dried leaves had no such effect. It is concluded that components of the alcoholic seed extract may be used to increase the efficiency of ammoniacal fertilizer...|$|E
30|$|The results {{indicate}} that the vermicompost prepared from cow dung and HSW + cow dung have higher <b>manurial</b> <b>value</b> and had significant effects on the growth and productivity of marigold plants than control (without amendments). The growth and flowering of plants was improved with the addition of vermicomposts in potting media in appropriate quantities. Maximum growth and productivity of marigold plants was observed in cow dung vermicompost-amended potting media. Although vermicomposts have shown potential in sustainable crop production but further studies are required to determine the long-term effects of vermicompost application in field conditions.|$|E
40|$|Deep litter manure {{contains}} considerable {{amounts of}} plant nutrients {{and is therefore}} used as a fertiliser in crop production. However, the <b>manurial</b> <b>value</b> of deep litter manure is reduced by ammonia volatilisation and uneven land spreading. Although storage before spreading may improve the spreading evenness of deep litter manure, it may also influence the potential for ammonia losses. A study was therefore designed to investigate how storage of deep litter ma-nure influences spreading evenness and ammonia volatilisation following land spreading. The ammonia volatilisation following land spreading {{was found to be}} reduced by 44 % following storage, as the ammonium content of the deep litter manure had declined considerably during the storage period. The spreading evenness of both mass and nutrient content of deep litter manure was found to be improved by storage. During spreading deep litter manure was found to be separated into bands of mainly straw or heavier material. However, this separation did not significantly influence the evenness in distribution of the nutrient content of neither stored nor unstored deep litter manure...|$|E
30|$|Gutiérrez-Miceli et al. (2007) {{reported}} that application of sheep-manure vermicompost in tomato crop increased the plant heights and crop yield. Addition of sheep-manure vermicompost decreased soil pH and acidity. The tomatoes harvested from the vermicompost applied agricultural fields had higher carbohydrate content. Arancon et al. (2008) {{reported that}} application of vermicomposts produced enhanced germination, growth and flowering of petunia plant. The effects of neem (Azadirachta indica) vermicompost were studied {{on the growth}} and yield of Brinjal (Solanum melongena) by Gajalakshmi and Abbasi (2004). Sangwan et al. (2010) conducted a pot culture experiment to assess the quality of vermicompost produced from filter cake mixed with cow and horse dung on the growth and productivity of marigold. The filter cake + cow dung and horse dung vermicomposts have higher <b>manurial</b> <b>value</b> and synergistically affected the growth and productivity of crop. Addition of 10 and 20  % pig manure-based vermicompost in media mixes had positive effects on plant growth (Bachman and Metzger 2008). Roberts et al. (2007) investigated the effect of Dendrobaena veneta-derived vermicompost on the germination, growth, yield, marketability and vitamin C content of tomatoes. The results showed that vermicompost significantly increased germination rates (176  %) and improved the marketability of fruits at 40 and 100  % substitution rates due to the lower incidence of physiological disorders (blossom end rot and fruit cracking).|$|E
40|$|Antidating written {{human history}} the dung of animals, chalk, marl, wood ashes and other {{substances}} were probably used {{to increase the}} productivity of the soil. These practises {{found their way into}} the earliest farming activities of the Chinese, Persians, Greeks and Romans. (3) (11) In the Hebrew scriptures mention is made of the 2 ̆ 2 Dung Gate 2 ̆ 2. (10) This was undoubtedly a place given to the marketing of manures. That manure was used as a soil amendment in Asia Minor in Biblical times is not questioned. The famous Roman agricultural writer Cato (234 B. C.) wrote at length on manures and their handling. He gave bird manure preference and spoke of the <b>manurial</b> <b>value</b> of legumes. (3) Jethro Tull believed tillage was manure and contended that manures only benefit the soil because of improved physical condition after application. Liebig, the well known German agricultural chemist, gave prominence to the theory that small quantities of minerals added to the soil would suffice as manure. (1) Today the general ideas of soil fertility and the use of manures and fertilizers incorporates the views of these earlier students with better explanations of the relationships of one usage to the other.

The body weight gain (g/bird) of experiment birds was recorded to be 1597. 28 ± 34. 66, 1595. 10 ± 32. 65, 1611. 12 ± 34. 66 and 1581. 26 ± 32. 65 under R 1, R 2, L 1 and L 2, respectively and influenced significantly by age only. Average weekly total feed intake (g/bird), FCR (Kg/Kg gain), average weekly water intake (ml/bird), water: feed intake ratio and performance efficiency factor were 512. 50 ± 6. 54, 1. 59 ± 0. 14, 1525. 10 ± 25. 08, 2. 80 ± 0. 08 and 212. 10 ± 27. 18, respectively and influenced significantly by age.

However, feed cost per kg gain (Rs/Kg), feed cost per dressed weight (Rs/kg), total production cost (Rs) on Ration I was 16. 32 ± 1. 88, 28. 31 ± 0. 29 and 18692. 15 ± 36. 98, respectively and {{were significantly higher than}} Ration II (15. 22 ± 1. 66, 25. 69 ± 0. 14 and 17642. 76 ± 17. 05) where as net profit/bird (Rs. 4. 46 ± 0. 08 and 8. 45 ± 0. 68), return over feed cost (Rs. 9461. 86 ± 0. 35 and 11347. 96 ± 2. 65) and return as percent of feed cost (184. 44 ± 0. 04 and 206. 76 ± 0. 02) were significantly lower in Ration I than Ration II.
