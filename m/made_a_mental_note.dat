60|$|Canon Spratte {{smiled and}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the remark, which {{he thought would}} do very well from his own lips.|$|E
60|$|Lucy Coulson did not inquire {{whether he}} was acquainted with the lady in question, but <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the fact.|$|E
60|$|I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> {{never to}} seem fairly {{friendly}} to an explorer. If you do, he always decides {{to stay the}} night.|$|E
60|$|There {{were one}} or two amongst those present in the Council room at Westminster that evening, who noted and never forgot a certain indefinable dignity which seemed to come to Stenson's aid and enabled him to face {{what must have been}} an unwelcome and anxious ordeal without discomposure or disquiet. He entered the room {{accompanied}} by Julian and Phineas Cross, and he had very much the air {{of a man who has}} come to pay a business visit, concerning the final issue of which there could be no possible doubt. He shook hands with the Bishop gravely but courteously, nodded to the others with whom he was acquainted, asked the names of the few strangers present, and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> careful <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of what industries and districts they represented. He then accepted a chair by the side of the Bishop, who immediately opened the proceedings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please, Miss Winslow! In {{the name}} of the--what was it--Order of the Blue Bowl?" [...] He was making <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> that Olive's last name was Dunleavy.|$|R
60|$|CONFUCIUS [standing {{formally}} {{at the end}} of {{the table}} with his hands palm to palm] I make <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> that you do not wish the Americans to be described as barbarians.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon I'll {{stay here}} to see the thing out," [...] {{answered}} Williamson. Edwards <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the frontiersman's evasive answer.|$|E
60|$|Wolfenden {{swore to}} himself softly. He {{could have been}} there. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> to leave a card at the Embassy that afternoon.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{they got}} into a hansom, and Mrs. d'Aubigne having given the address in Pimlico, of which George {{instantly}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note,</b> they started.|$|E
60|$|Making <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of both, Ralph hurried out. A {{policeman}} directed him to {{the tall}} office building in which his friend had rooms, and he was soon on his way thither.|$|R
60|$|He set {{off at a}} pace which {{rendered}} protest unavailing. Mr. Tredgold turned, and, making <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of {{the fact}} that Miss Drewitt had suddenly added inches to her stature, walked on by her side.|$|R
5000|$|As I went to {{the front}} I was making <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> not to look up [...] "subdolous." [...] That trick of his, closing an {{argument}} by using a word he knew damn well I had never heard, was probably subdolous.|$|R
60|$|The {{distinguished}} foreigners {{looked at}} each other and then at Miss Jones. Each <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the average cold-blooded ferocity of the young American female.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drummond'll be good next year," [...] said Trevor. And he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> to tell Allardyce, {{who would}} succeed {{him in the}} command of the school football, {{to keep an eye}} on the player in question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Calm yourself, my good woman, calm yourself," [...] {{said the}} senior partner. He {{perceived}} that the evil prophesied {{by his son}} had come upon him, and he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of this fresh instance of Ezra's powers of foresight.|$|E
5000|$|Return to full-force {{climbing}} if easy climbing yields no pain. Continue taping (it {{will also}} serve as <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the previous injury) and avoid tweaky crimps and pockets for several months, since complete tendon healing can take 100 days or more.|$|R
5000|$|Kath {{has many}} {{different}} Habits and lines which she continues with throughout the series. She often talks to {{herself in her}} mind while making grinning faces; She also says [...] "make <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> Kath.." [...] and says the <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> out loud. When Kath knows {{something is going to}} happen she remarks [...] "I can Feel it in me waters!".|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, the lady's-maid {{immediately}} {{stored up}} <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> {{on the subject}} in the lasting tablets of her memory, and did not fail gently to insinuate her views upon the question to Lady Exmoor, as she arranged the pearls in the false plaits for dinner that very evening.|$|R
6000|$|The {{inspector}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note.</b> Tallente {{threw the}} remains of his cigarette into the sea. [...] "I am going to bed now." [...] he said. [...] "Can I offer you any refreshment, Mr. Inspector, or are your investigations not yet complete?" ...|$|E
60|$|Half-a-dozen men of {{more or less}} {{importance}} <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> to nod to Kingston Brooks {{next time}} they saw him, and Mr. Bullsom trudged up his avenue with fresh schemes maturing in his mind. In the domestic circle he further unburdened himself.|$|E
60|$|Jean had smelled whisky {{upon his}} {{entrance}} to this cabin. Bill {{was a hard}} drinker, and his father was not immune. Blaisdell, too, drank heavily upon occasions. Jean <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> {{that he would not}} permit their chances to become impaired by liquor.|$|E
60|$|Are not Black and Green {{ready at}} the {{appointed}} place? O yes! They glide out of shadow as we stop. Imperturbable Black opens the cab- door; Imperturbable Green takes <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of the driver. Both Green and Black then open each his flaming eye, and marshal {{us the way}} that we are going.|$|R
60|$|He wandered idly {{through her}} rooms, {{scarcely}} noting {{at what he}} gazed, but gazing with fondness at it all. Like everything else of hers, it was distinctive, different, eloquent of her. But when he glanced into the bathroom with its sunken Roman bath, {{for the life of}} him he was unable to avoid seeing a tiny drip and making <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> for the ranch plumber.|$|R
60|$|Another boy stood up, and {{eyed the}} letter very hard while Squeers <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> {{abstract}} of the same.|$|R
60|$|At {{the time}} I did not fancy her {{appearance}} and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> {{to the effect}} that I would never like Miss Ashley. I had no use for cool, businesslike women--women should have no concern with business. Nellie would never have troubled her dear, curly head over it.|$|E
60|$|The {{guns were}} {{standing}} on the green; the soldiers and horses were scattered about, and the handsome captain whom Dare had pointed out to Havill was inspecting the buildings in the company of the quartermaster. Dare <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of these things, and, apparently changing a previous intention, went out from the barracks and returned to the town.|$|E
60|$|Then Mr Dean {{began to}} smell another rat, besides that {{which he was}} just then in pursuit of, for the Colonel had {{incidentally}} mentioned to him the circumstance of the estate passing away from him, owing to a new will having been recently discovered. Although the matter was not the detective's present business, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of it.|$|E
2500|$|After contemplating his own {{procrastination}} habits, philosopher John Perry authored {{an essay}} entitled [...] "Structured Procrastination", wherein he proposes a [...] "cheat" [...] method as a safer approach for tackling procrastination: using a pyramid scheme {{to reinforce the}} unpleasant tasks needed {{to be completed in}} a quasi-prioritized order. In other words, the procrastinator should postpone tasks with <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> that one feels to do while engaged in a work that requires their current attentional focus.|$|R
60|$|Soon Larry {{disappeared}} {{inside the}} tent, and they crouched behind the bushes to await developments. While waiting, Ben <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> {{calculation of the}} number of the enemy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bob, {{you are a}} good fellow," [...] exclaimed George, as {{he grasped}} the moonlighter by the hand, and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> vow that he would never speak harshly to him again.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of {{that piece}} of {{information}} with {{a good deal of}} satisfaction. I could kill this miscreant now, if I got a chance, and no one would know it. But this very reflection made me so lighthearted that my Conscience could hardly keep his seat, but was like to float aloft toward the ceiling like a toy balloon. I said, presently: ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{journey to}} Blentz {{was a short}} one. They had been much nearer that grim {{fortress}} than either had guessed. At {{the outskirts of the}} town they were challenged by Austrian sentries, through which Maenck passed with ease after the sentinel had summoned an officer. From this man Maenck received the password that would carry them through the line of outposts between the town and the castle--"Slankamen." [...] Barney, who overheard the word, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of it.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Trelawny {{came very}} quickly. When Mr. Corbeck saw her, he seemed {{somewhat}} surprised. But his annoyance and excitement had not disappeared; quite enough remained {{to cover up}} any such secondary and purely exoteric feeling as surprise. But as she spoke he never took his eyes off her; and I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> that I would find some early opportunity of investigating {{the cause of his}} surprise. She began with an apology which quite smoothed down his ruffled feelings: ...|$|E
50|$|As the new day is dawning, sleepless Paula {{is aware}} of the fact that the biggest revelation yet in the lives of her two {{children}} is imminent. She also makes <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> to explain to them that they should decide wisely whether to tell anybody the news or not as the implications would be far-reaching: Grandma Helen, for one, might feel cheated out of her grandchildren. On the other hand, Paula can well imagine that her mother-in-law, by sheer maternal instinct, has known about their secret all along.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Rachel, {{before she}} had fairly closed the door, had taken <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> of {{everything}} that was on that table. There were three plates laid, so that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but the dishes were everyday dishes {{and there was only}} crab-apple preserves and one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any particular company. Yet what of Matthew's white collar and the sorrel mare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.|$|R
6000|$|But on {{this late}} summer afternoon, Carter Watson was curious. As he moved along he paused before a gaudy {{drinking}} place. The sign above read, [...] "The Vendome." [...] There were two entrances. One evidently {{led to the}} bar. This he did not explore. The other was a narrow hallway. Passing through this {{he found himself in}} a huge room, filled with chair-encircled tables and quite deserted. In the dim light he <b>made</b> out <b>a</b> piano in the distance. Making <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>note</b> that he would come back some time and study the class of persons that must sit and drink at those multitudinous tables, he proceeded to circumnavigate the room.|$|R
