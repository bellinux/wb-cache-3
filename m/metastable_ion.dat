In their heyday <b>metastable</b> <b>ions</b> were recognized as having importance for establishing fragmentation sequences and for distinguishing between isomeric ion structures. Today, in many respects the utility of <b>metastable</b> <b>ions</b> has been superseded by a systematic application of CID techniques; yet the evaluation of their shape is still of importance for questions of reaction energies and ion thermochemistry...|$|R

40|$|Unprecedented {{demands for}} uniformity, throughput, anisotropy, and damage control in {{submicron}} pattern transfer are spurring development of new, low pressure, high charge density plasma reactors. Wafer biasing, independent of plasma production in these new systems {{is intended to}} provide improved ion flux and energy control so that selectivity can be optimized and damage can be minimized. However, as we show here, an inherent property of such discharges is the generation of significant densities of excited, metastable ionic states that can bombard workpiece surfaces with higher translational and internal energy. Absolute <b>metastable</b> <b>ion</b> densities are measured using the technique of self-absorption, while the corresponding velocity distributions and density scaling with pressure and electron density are measured using laser-induced fluorescence. For a low pressure, helicon-wave excited plasma, the <b>metastable</b> <b>ion</b> flux is at least 24 % of the total ion flux to device surfaces. Because the <b>metastable</b> <b>ion</b> density scales roughly as the reciprocal of the pressure and as {{the square of the}} electron density, the metastable flux is largest in low pressure, high charge density plasmas.

40|$|After {{the work}} done by M. van de Grift and N. Sadeghi on the ion {{velocity}} distribution in an ICP, some new measurements are planned for the future to extend their results. In this paper we will describe these results and the drawn conclusions which motivate our work. Velocity distribution functions (VDF’s) of 3 d’G 912 metastable argon ions in an ICP reactor were determined using Doppler Shifted Laser Induced Fluorescence (DSLIF). In the direction perpendicular to the reactor axis, the VDF was found Gaussian shaped with no average velocity, whereas along the reactor axis, the VDF was showing a clear acceleration of the ions in the presheath towards the Bohm velocity when reaching the sheath edge. The kinetic energy, gained in the electric field {{was found to be}} transferred by collisions to directions perpendicular to the reactor axis, especially for high pressures. A Monte-Carlo model has been used to’ determine the relation between the <b>metastable</b> <b>ion</b> VDF and ground state ion VDF. It was shown that at high pressures they are quite similar. Nevertheless, at low pressures, the two profiles do not correspond any more: Quenching of metastable ions lead to a depletion of the low velocity component of the <b>metastable</b> <b>ion</b> VDF and so that <b>metastable</b> <b>ion</b> VDF is no longer an image of ground state ion VDF...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{information}} can be obtained on wave-particle interactions and wave fields by direct measurement of perturbed ion distribution functions using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). For practical purposes, LIF is frequently performed on metastable states that are produced from neutral gas particles and ions in other electronic states. If the laser intensity is increased to obtain a better LIF signal, then optical pumping can produce systematic effects depending on the collision rates which control metastable population and lifetime. We numerically simulate the ion velocity distribution measurement and wave-detection process using a Lagrangian model for the LIF signal for the case where metastables are produced directly from neutrals. This case requires more strict precautions and is important for discharges with energetic primary electrons and a high density of neutrals. Some of the results also apply to metastables produced from pre-existing ions. The simulations show that optical pumping broadening affects the ion velocity distribution function (IVDF) $f_ 0 (v) $ and its first-order perturbation $f_ 1 (v,t) $ when laser intensity is increased above a certain level. The results also suggest that ion temperature measurements are only accurate when the <b>metastable</b> <b>ions</b> can live longer than the ion-ion collision mean free time. For the purposes of wave detection, the wave period has to be significantly shorter than the lifetime of <b>metastable</b> <b>ions</b> for a direct interpretation. It is more generally true that <b>metastable</b> <b>ions</b> {{may be viewed as}} test-particles. As long as an appropriate model is available, LIF can be extended to a range of environments.
