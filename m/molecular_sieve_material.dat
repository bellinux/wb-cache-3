40|$|Mesoporous silica <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> are {{emerging}} candidates {{for a number}} of potential applications involving adsorption and molecular transport due to their large surface areas, high pore volumes, and tunable pore sizes. Recently, several research groups have investigated the potential of functionalized mesoporous silica <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> as advanced <b>materials</b> in separation devices, such as membranes. In particular, mesoporous silica with a two- or three-dimensional pore structure {{is one of the most}} promising types of <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>materials</b> for gas separation membranes. However, several important challenges must first be addressed regarding the successful fabrication of mesoporous silica membranes. First, a novel, high throughput process for the fabrication of continuous and defect-free mesoporous silica membranes is required. Second, functionalization of mesopores on membranes is desirable in order to impart selective properties. Finally, the separation characteristics and performance of functionalized mesoporous silica membranes must be further investigated.

40|$|During its {{operational}} life, the Shuttle Program {{has experienced}} numerous {{failures in the}} Nitrogen Tetroxide (N 2 O 4) portion of Reaction Control System (RCS), {{many of which were}} attributed to iron-nitrate contamination. Since the mid- 1980 's, N 2 O 4 has been processed through a molecular sieve at the N 2 O 4 manufacturer's facility which results in an iron content typically less than 0. 5 parts-per-million-by-weight (ppmw). In February 1995, a Tiger Team was formed to attempt to resolve the iron nitrate problem. Eighteen specific actions were recommended as possibly reducing system failures. Those recommended actions include additional N 2 O 4 molecular sieving at the Shuttle launch site. Testing at NASA White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) determined an alternative <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>material</b> could also reduce the water-equivalent content (free water and HNO 3) and thereby further reduce the natural production of iron nitrate in N 2 O 4 while stored in iron-alloy storage tanks.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{kinds of}} <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> <b>materials,</b> TC- 5 A and PSA- 5 A, were {{produced}} to satisfy with special requirement of manned space flight. Their CO 2 adsorption performances were investigated and compared through two experiments, the thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) experiment and packed bed column experiment. Besides, some kinetic equations were compared {{according to the}} TGA experimental data, and their errors were analyzed. Finally, the classic linear driving force (LDF) model is improved to the new Avrami’s model, and two models are analyzed based on the packed bed data. The TGA data shows that the CO 2 loading has an approximately linear relationship with the CO 2 concentration, and the best fit adsorption temperature range is from 283 to 303 K. The packed bed column results show that water vapor in air can affect the CO 2 adsorption performance badly. The new Avrami’s model is proved more suitable to reflect the complex adsorption mechanism for two <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves.</b> The <b>materials</b> are proved having much better adsorption capacity than the other adsorbents with room temperature and low CO 2 concentration (⩽ 1. 0 % in volume), and they can meet the aerospace requirements.

It has been found that the aluminum content and the type of charge balancing cations in the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> play an important role on the amount of organic adsorbed due to a higher affinity of strong Bronsted acid sites and surface cations to hydrocarbons and carbonyl moieties. High selectivity of the <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> towards oxidation products was achieved without influencing additive compounds in the oxidized oil, and thus results in high degrees in oil purification Lip to 90 % depending on the oil formulation.

Temperatures above 423 K are {{necessary in order}} to promote the alkylation reaction. A major competing reaction that deactivates the catalyst is the oligomerization of PO that provides for deposition of these oligomers on the catalyst surface. A high 2 -MN to PO ratio as well as the addition of PO in a semi-batch mode of operation help minimize the oligomerization reaction. The main reaction products are an O-alkylated product (I) and four C-alkylated products: 1 -(2 -methoxy- 1 -naphthyl) - 2 -propanol (II), 2 -(2 -methoxy- 1 -naphthyl) propanol (III), 1 -(6 -methoxy- 2 -naphthyl) - 2 -propanol (IV) and 2 -(6 -methoxy- 2 -naphthyl) propanol (V).

The influences of prehydrolysis time of TEOS on the structure of hybrid materials were specially investigated. It is found that the introduction of SiW 11 into the system results in the decreases of critical micelle concentration of surfactant P 123 and the consequent loss of ordered assembly due to salting-out effect. Therefore, it is necessary to provide sufficient time for prehydrolysis in order to acquire ordered mesophase. It is also observed that the length of prehydrolysis time depends on the ratio of SiW 11 in inorganic precursors. Longer prehydrolysis time is needed and lower structure order is obtained when the ratio of SiW 11 increases. In addition, the prehydrolysis time affects the distribution of polyoxometalates in the hybrid materials.

Effect of the synthesis methods on the Sn-containing MCM- 41 were studied. The results showed that Sn species were mainly incorporated into the framework of MCM- 41 <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis method (DHT), while Sn species were mainly existed on the wall surface of Sn-MCM- 41 <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> prepared by template-ion exchange method (TIE). The catalytic properties of Sn containing MCM- 41 <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> in Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone were investigated. Catalytic activity results show that under the reaction condition of n(H 2 O 2) :n(Cyclohexanone) £½ 3 : 1, 30 g dioxane, at 70 ¡䟦or 6 h, the conversion of cyclohexanone and the selectivity of ε-caprolactone reach 40. 02 % and 45. 69 %, respectively...|$|R

In {{order to achieve}} different NLO processes in these materials we varied the guest molecules. Paranitroaniline (PNA) and dimethylaminobenzonitrile (DMABN) were investigated in different <b>molecular</b> <b>sieve</b> hosts (AlPO- 5, ZSM- 5, VPI- 5). These two groups of materials studied can be described by qualitatively different models: ensembles of oriented two-level or three-level systems. In contrast to <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves</b> loaded with PNA which can only mix waves of the same polarization, for the DMABN based materials the mixing of waves of different polarizations is observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{epoxidation}} reaction using heterogeneous solid catalysts with H 2 O 2 as oxidants are {{environmentally friendly}} routes to produce extensively useful epoxides which are traditionally obtained from capital-intensive or environmentally polluted processes. In this paper, {{various types of}} solid catalysts for the epoxidation of olefins with H 2 O 2 as oxidants are reviewed. The efficient catalysts reported include microporous and mesoporous <b>molecular</b> <b>sieves,</b> layered-type <b>materials,</b> inorganic oxides, supported catalysts, zeolite encapsulated metal complexes, polyoxometalates, and supported organometallic catalysts. The proposed reaction mechanisms over different solid catalysts are summarized. The problems and perspectives to further efficiently improve the catalytic performances of the concerned heterogeneous catalysts for epoxidation reaction are remarked...|$|R
