She helps Cinderella finish her chores to get her on time for the royal ball, but Drizella and Anastasia continue to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> to make them work. Jaq and Gus make a dress for Cinderella while Kilala secretly finishes the chores. Cinderella also teaches her the proper ways of eating, walking, singing and dancing like a princess. Anastasia steals her Tiara during a confrontation and decides to use it to brainwash the prince. After the Fairy Godmother helped Cinderella to the ball, Kilala asks for her help. At the ball, she knocks down Drizella before she can hypnotize the prince and sends the Tiara flying out the balcony. Just then, Cinderella arrive and the dance goes smoothly as ever. Kilala finds the Tiara broken and shattered. The Fairy Godmother appears and restores it, with a new gem added to it: a white diamond, given by Cinderella. When Kilala returns to the human world, her body is healed. She and Rei are then captured and taken to a devastated Paradiso. Kilala is thrown in an Internment Camp and Rei is taken to be brainwashed and forced to help the Coup. Kilala saves him before they can and the two declare their feelings for one another.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Deep, Deep Trouble" [...] {{illustrates}} the things Bart raps {{about in the}} song, showing how he is forced by Homer to mow the lawn after throwing a buzzing alarm clock at his father in his sleep. When Homer tells Bart to hurry up, Bart accidentally runs over the sprinkler {{and as a result}} he has to stay at home when the family goes to see a boat show. After they leave, Bart decides to throw a party and invites his friends. They <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> in the house and when Homer and Marge return home, Bart realizes he is in deep trouble. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post thought the video was not [...] "nearly as clever as the cartoon" [...] and that it had [...] "'promotional gimmick' written all over it." [...] "Then again, I never thought the video of the dance rap 'Do the Bartman' would be a ratings hit when it aired in December. So what do I know?", she added.|$|E
500|$|The 1974 {{documentary}} film Hearts and Minds, which {{was critical of}} the United States' role in the Vietnam War, featured Coker briefly. Coker, {{at the time of}} filming, had recently returned from {{six and a half years}} of internment in North Vietnamese camps for American prisoners of war– where he had endured torture and other mistreatment by his captors. The film shows a homecoming parade in his honor in his hometown of Linden, New Jersey, where he tells the assembled crowd on the steps of city hall that if the need arose, that they must be ready to send him back to war. Answering a student's question about what Vietnam looked like, he responded: [...] "Well, if it wasn't for the people, it was very pretty. The people over there are very backward and very primitive, and they just <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> out of everything." [...] Time magazine's Stefan Kanfer criticized the lack of balance in the film's portrayal of Coker, noting that [...] "he camera, which amply records the agonies of South Vietnamese political prisoners, seems uninterested in the American lieutenant's experience of humiliation and torture." ...|$|E
