500|$|Another version, sung by Charles Edward Carpenter—a Lawrenceburg, Tennessee {{business}} man and World War II Veteran (born in Crewstown, TN)—to {{his children and}} grandchildren in Middle Tennessee during the mid- to late 1900s speaks of Old Dan Tucker's love of a hard drink.

500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{featured}} {{the first meeting}} of Daenerys Targaryen and Yara and Theon Greyjoy, and Yara's first meeting with Tyrion Lannister. Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh <b>my</b> <b>goodness</b> – I was so excited when I saw that I had a scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share a lot of little looks and there's some playful language in how we talk to one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.' They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Poole {{refers to}} Eli Gold as a [...] "wartime consigliere", a {{reference}} to the Tom Hagen lawyer character in the 1972 Mafia film The Godfather, which is itself based on a Mario Puzo novel of the same name. In turn, Gold disparagingly refers to Poole as a [...] "Shiksa Bambi", {{a reference to}} the title character of the 1942 Disney animated film Bambi, about a naive deer unaccustomed to the realities and horrors of the real world. Kurt McVeigh's country mannerisms and dress prompt Diane to refer to him as the Marlboro Man, a cowboy-like figure used in tobacco advertisements for Marlboro cigarettes. Upon learning about his morals, Diane said he was {{like something out of a}} novel by Herman Melville, the 19th century novelist who wrote Moby-Dick and Billy Budd. She also jokingly asks whether Kurt is related to Timothy McVeigh, the man convicted of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, by saying: [...] "Oh <b>my</b> <b>goodness</b> what an unfortunate name. Hopefully no relation." [...] Diane, a liberal, is taken aback by the conservative Kurt's enthusiasm for Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee. As a joke, Kurt sends her a copy of Palin's 2009 memoir, [...] She in turn sends him the parody book Going Rouge: A Candid Look Inside The Mind Of Political Conservative Sarah Palin, which is filled with empty pages.|$|E

6000|$|Those {{were his}} first words. In justice to papa (and a little {{for my own}} sake too) I {{told him he was}} quite wrong. I said: [...] "Trust <b>my</b> father's <b>goodness,</b> trust his kindness, as I do." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, a British Prisoner {{fan club}} {{arranged}} for Florance {{to visit the}} United Kingdom to appear in their 'On the Outside' tour. Florance arrived with fellow cast member Amanda Muggleton, and the pair were extremely well received. They were mobbed at the airport; Florance said, [...] "Oh <b>my</b> <b>goodness</b> me. I didn't dream of it. I've never had anything like that in my whole life". Florance and Val Lehman were given a civic reception by the Mayor of Derby on 22 August, an occasion that was poignant for Florance because her first husband {{had been in the}} Derbyshire Yeomanry. At this time Florance was already unwell, and while on the tour had to have a large tumour removed. Despite this setback, she was back on tour within days.|$|E
2500|$|The {{change in}} {{wardrobe}} {{was a factor}} Hendrickson especially needed to become accustomed to. [...] "On my first day, Maggie was wearing a miniskirt," [...] she said. [...] "In one of the scenes, Bianca fainted to the floor, {{and we had to}} do a few takes. The one that they [...] was when I went to catch her and bent over, forgetting that I was wearing a miniskirt. When I realized, I turned to everyone and was like, ' Oh, <b>my</b> <b>goodness!</b> I flashed the entire set. Sorry, guys. I'm not used to wearing miniskirts on the show [...] I'm used to wearing baggy pants!.'" [...] Though the change in wardrobe was a different feel, Hendrickson welcomed the new look. [...] "I used to get a little frustrated with what I wore as Frankie; I was sick of looking like a rugrat," [...] she stated. [...] "But now, I really like my wardrobe. I'm excited that Maggie wears skirts all the time!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, the Spice Girls {{reformed}} {{and announced}} plans to embark upon a reunion tour, from which they {{were said to have}} earned £10 million each (approximately $20 million). Victoria had previously stated that she and her former Spice colleagues were enjoying their solo careers in various fields, saying [...] "We're all still doing our own thing." [...] Their Greatest Hits album was released in early November 2007 and the tour began on 2 December 2007. At its advent, Beckham said [...] "I wanted my children to see that Mummy was a pop star. It was the last opportunity for them to stand in a crowd full of people screaming for the Spice Girls." [...] When Beckham had her hair coloured brown for the tour, she stated that her sons immediately reacted by saying [...] "Oh <b>my</b> <b>goodness,</b> it's Posh Spice. She's back." [...] She was {{the only member of the}} group not to sing a solo song on the tour, instead posing in the style of a fashion show on a makeshift catwalk, whereas the others each performed a number from their solo careers.|$|E

2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{told what}} {{happened}} in [...] after Moses asked to behold God's Presence in [...] Moses foretold that he would behold God's Glory and make atonement for the Israelites' iniquities on Yom Kippur. On that day, Moses asked God (in the words of [...] ) [...] "Show me, I pray, Your Glory." [...] God told Moses that Moses {{was not able to}} see God's Glory lest he die, as [...] reports God said, [...] "men shall not see Me and live," [...] but for the sake of God's oath to Moses, God agreed to do as Moses asked. God instructed Moses to stand at the entrance of a cave, and God would cause all God's angels to pass before Moses. God told Moses to stand his ground, and not to fear, as [...] reports, [...] "And He said, I will make all <b>My</b> <b>Goodness</b> pass before you." [...] God told Moses that when he heard the Name that God had spoken to him, then Moses would know that God was before him, as [...] reports. The ministering angels complained that they served before God day and night, and they were unable to see God's Glory, but this man Moses born of woman desired to see God's Glory. The angels arose in wrath and excitement to kill Moses, and he came near to death. God intervened in a cloud to protect Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And the Lord descended in the cloud." [...] God protected Moses with the hollow of God's hand so that he would not die, as [...] reports, [...] "And it shall come to pass, while My Glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with My hand." [...] When God had passed by, God removed the hollow of God's hand from Moses, and he saw traces of the Shechinah, as [...] says, [...] "And I will take away My hand, and you shall see my back." [...] Moses began to cry with a loud voice, and Moses said the words of [...] "O Lord, O Lord, a God full of compassion and gracious [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Moses asked God to pardon the iniquities of the people in connection with the Golden Calf. God told Moses that if he had asked God then to pardon the iniquities of all Israel, even to the end of all generations, God would have done so, as it was the appropriate time. But Moses had asked for pardon with reference to the Golden Calf, so God told Moses that it would be according to his words, as [...] says, [...] "And the Lord said, ‘I have pardoned according to your word.'" ...|$|E
