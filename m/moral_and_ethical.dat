5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, each player creates their player {{character}} and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each {{edition of the}} game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E
5|$|Sheryl Crow is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Sheryl Crow, {{released}} on September 24, 1996 by A Records. Unlike its predecessor Tuesday Night Music Club, which was written by a casual collective formed by Crow and several other musicians, Sheryl Crow was entirely produced by Crow, who wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans, Louisiana. The album covers topics of American life, relationship breakups, and <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> issues, while encompassing a variety of music genres such as rock, blues, alternative rock, country, and folk.|$|E

5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E

The title story described an international biology research laboratory in Central Europe. This became reality after a meeting in 1962 with Victor F. Weisskopf, James Watson and John Kendrew. When the European Molecular Biology Laboratory was established, the library was named The Szilard Library and the library stamp features dolphins. Other honors that he received included the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, and the Humanist of the Year in 1960. A lunar crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him in 1970. The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award, established in 1974, is given in his honor by the American Physical Society.|$|E

From the public policy perspective, since the cost of increasing the fine is marginal to that of the cost of increasing surveillance, one can conclude that the best policy is to maximize the fine and minimize surveillance.|$|E
40|$|This study tested an {{expanded}} {{model of the}} Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) incorporating positive <b>moral</b> attitude <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> self identity, {{in the domain of}} sustainably sourced food. The expanded model variables were included in a path analysis with other food choice motives in order to determine their relative importance. The sample consisted of 137 participants (M = 28, F = 109), recruited online via email and newsletter distribution lists. Participants completed an online questionnaire containing the TPB scales of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and intention; measures of positive <b>moral</b> attitude <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> self identity; <b>and</b> food choice motives taken from the Food Choice Questionnaire incorporating revisions by Lindemann and Väänänen (2000). Results indicated that the expanded TPB model was robust, with positive <b>moral</b> attitude <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> self identity significantly predicting attitudes towards, and intention to purchase sustainably sourced food. Of the food choice motives, only health <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> values significantly predicted intention, and health and price predicted attitudes; however, overall the TPB model was more parsimonious.

25|$|The Quran {{is viewed}} {{to be the}} scriptural {{foundation}} of Islam and is believed by Muslims to have been revealed, without issue, to Muhammad by the angel Gabriel. Criticism of the Quran has frequently occurred since western scholarship has looked to decipher, understand and verify the claims of Islamic thought {{as stated in the}} Quran. Issues relating to the authenticity and morality of the Quran are criticized. Both critics and some scholars of western, eastern and secular backgrounds claim to have discovered scientific errors adding allegations of contradictions in the Quran while questioning its interpreted <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> message.|$|E

25|$|Forgiveness in Hinduism {{does not}} {{necessarily}} require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations. Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind and {{letting go of the}} harm or hurt caused by someone or something else. Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> life (dharmic life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one's personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from anger (akrodhi).|$|E

25|$|Hence in {{accordance}} with the natural karmic laws, consequences occur when one utters a lie, steals something, commits acts of senseless violence or leads the life of a debauchee. Rather than assume that moral rewards and retribution are the work of a divine judge, the Jains believe that there is an innate moral order to the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of karma. Morality and ethics are important, not because of the personal whim of a fictional god, but because a life that is led in agreement with <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> principles is beneficial: it leads to a decrease and finally to the total loss of karma, which means: to ever increasing happiness.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} {{is currently the}} basis for cloning animals (such as the famous Dolly the sheep), and has been theoretically proposed as a possible way to clone humans. Using SCNT in reproductive cloning has proven difficult with limited success. High fetal and neonatal death make the process very inefficient. Resulting cloned offspring are also plagued with development and imprinting disorders in non-human species. For these reasons, along with <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> objections, reproductive cloning in humans is proscribed in more than 30 countries. Most researchers believe that {{in the foreseeable future}} it will not be possible to use the current cloning technique to produce a human clone that will develop to term. It remains a possibility, though critical adjustments will be required to overcome current limitations during early embryonic development in human SCNT.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{has a role}} in {{discussing}} the {{issues related to the}} social order. Social and economic issues are vital to her not from a technical point of view but in terms of <b>moral</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethical</b> issues involved. Ethical considerations include the nature of private property. Within the Catholic Church several conflicting views had developed. Pope Pius XI declares private property essential for the development and freedom of the individual. Those who deny private property, deny personal freedom and development. But, said Pius, private property has a social function as well. Private property loses its morality, if it is not subordinated to the common good. Therefore, governments have a right to redistribution policies. In extreme cases, the Pope grants the State a right of expropriation of private property.|$|E
