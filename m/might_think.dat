5|$|In 1924 Walpole {{moved into}} a house near Keswick in the Lake District. His large income enabled him to {{maintain}} his London flat in Piccadilly, but Brackenburn, {{on the slopes of}} Catbells overlooking Derwentwater, was his main home {{for the rest of his}} life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often found their way into his fiction. The critic James Agate commented that one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> from some of Walpole's stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was probably only consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole's life. In Hart-Davis's words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole's long-sought conception of a perfect friend. Cheevers, a policeman, with a wife and two children, left the police force and entered Walpole's service as his chauffeur. Walpole trusted him completely, and gave him extensive control over his affairs. Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost always with him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in Hampstead for Cheevers and his family.|$|E
5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

25|$|The {{heart of}} Buddhist thought is its insight philosophy, which uses {{critical}} inquiry to challenge dogma and to reveal how seemingly fixed ideas are more arbitrary than we <b>might</b> <b>think.</b> Applying this philosophy, {{we see that}} social customs are not fixed laws but evolving conventions that serve a purpose in a particular culture and time. Marriage {{is one of these}} conventions. It is not a rigid law but a social custom that evolves.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} reform {{of all was}} the emancipation of the serfs, a policy that was unpopular with large sections of the nobility. When the committee appointed to bring it about dug in their heels and made difficulties, Alexander II asked Konstantin to join the committee in September 1857. Where the Tsar was unsure of himself, his younger brother was more forceful, quick tempered, and cared not what others <b>might</b> <b>think</b> of him.|$|E
25|$|A draft {{bill for}} a Harris Tweed Act was also drawn up to reflect these {{proposed}} changes with the express aim {{of protecting the}} intellectual property of Harris Tweed as a local asset to the communities of the Outer Hebrides. By December 1990 the final draft of the bill and been circulated and by April 1991 the eleven members of the Harris Tweed Association unanimously approved the terms subject to such alterations as the Parliament of the United Kingdom <b>might</b> <b>think</b> fit to make to it.|$|E
25|$|Due to spin-orbit coupling, undoped GaAs {{single crystal}} {{exhibits}} much larger Faraday rotation than glass (SiO2). Considering the atomic arrangement is different along the (100) and (110) plane, one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> the Faraday rotation is polarization dependent. However, experimental work revealed an immeasurable anisotropy in the wavelength range from 880–1,600nm. Based {{on the large}} Faraday rotation, one {{might be able to}} use GaAs to calibrate the B field of the terahertz electromagnetic wave which requires very fast response time. Around the band gap, the Faraday effect shows resonance behavior.|$|E

25|$|With all {{the focus}} on veterans, the {{children}} are left {{to grow up in}} sometimes harsh, usually very strict environments with no recognition and no help. With enormous differences between military children and civilian children, one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> that there would be inquiry into the effects, yet few can be found readily available. Mary Edwards Werstch writes about her experiences, as well as the experiences of those she has interviewed, in her book Brats: Growing up inside the Fortress. Pat Conroy also sheds light on the difficult circumstances of growing up in his book (later a movie), The Great Santini.|$|E
25|$|Based on this, one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> that, if the wavefunction {{for each}} {{particle}} (in more precise terms, the quantum field for each particle type) were simultaneously mirror-reversed, then the {{new set of}} wavefunctions would perfectly satisfy {{the laws of physics}} (apart from the weak interaction). It turns out that this is not quite true: In order for the equations to be satisfied, the wavefunctions of certain types of particles have to be multiplied by −1, in addition to being mirror-reversed. Such particle types are said to have negative or odd parity (P=−1, or alternatively P=–), while the other particles are said to have positive or even parity (P=+1, or alternatively P=+).|$|E
25|$|One common {{misconception}} of BDSM and kink is {{that women}} are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. Roy Baumeister (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we <b>might</b> <b>think</b> otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about femininity; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like feminization of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.|$|E

25|$|Ships of the Mediterranean Fleet {{operating}} from Alexandria began making heavy radio {{traffic in the}} hope of diverting Luftwaffe attention to possible preparations for a major operation in the eastern Mediterranean. On 24 September Admiral Somerville shifted his flag from Nelson to Rodney and Nelson sailed west into the Atlantic at 18:15 escorted by Garland, Piorun and Isaac Sweers to give the impression the strength of Force H was being reduced. Nelson turned back after dusk to join the merchant ships from convoy WS 11X, now redesignated convoy GM 2 as the second convoy from Gibraltar to Malta. Force H separated from the merchant ships {{in the early hours of}} 25 September so Axis aerial reconnaissance <b>might</b> <b>think</b> only Force H was at sea. Fulmars from Ark Royal provided air cover over the convoy.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} provides insights {{in other}} situations {{such as the}} Monty Hall problem, a game show scenario in which a car is hidden behind one of three doors, and two goats are hidden as booby prizes behind the others. Once the contestant has chosen a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, eliminating that door as an option. With only two doors left (one with the car, the other with another goat), the player must decide to either keep their decision, or switch and select the other door. Intuitively, one <b>might</b> <b>think</b> the player is choosing between two doors with equal probability, and that the opportunity to choose another door makes no difference. But probability spaces reveal that the contestant has received new information, and can increase their chances of winning by changing to the other door.|$|E
25|$|Commodity ETFs trade {{just like}} shares, are simple and {{efficient}} and provide exposure to an ever-increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, softs and agriculture. However, {{it is important}} for an investor to realize that there are often other factors that affect the price of a commodity ETF that might not be immediately apparent. For example, buyers of an oil ETF such as USO <b>might</b> <b>think</b> that as long as oil goes up, they will profit roughly linearly. What isn't clear to the novice investor is the method by which these funds gain exposure to their underlying commodities. In the case of many commodity funds, they simply roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This does give exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the term structure, such as a high cost to roll.|$|E

25|$|Cornelia calls Dr. Wells back to {{the house}} to examine Richard's body. Dale asks Wells to hide the {{blueprint}} she took from Richard, because the others <b>might</b> <b>think</b> that she killed him for it. Reginald Beresford, a lawyer waiting in his car after he drove Richard to the house, comes inside. Reginald recognizes Jack, and the exposure of her fiancé makes Dale admit that she gave Wells the blueprint with the hidden room. Wells claims that he does not have the blueprint; Cornelia reveals other evidence incriminating him, and Anderson asks to question him alone. Wells knocks Anderson unconscious during the interrogation and drags him into another room. Before Wells can go to the hidden room, a stranger claiming to have lost his memory after he was attacked and tied up in the garage appears at the terrace door. When the guests try to identify the unknown man, they discover that they have been locked in the house. At {{the end of the second}} act, Cornelia finds the Bat's calling card, a black paper bat, tacked to a door.|$|E
25|$|Alessandro Malaspina, {{commander}} of the corvettes Descubierta and Atrevida, arrived in Mexico in 1791 during his scientific and political voyage throughout the Spanish colonies. Malaspina assigned several of his officers to investigate the colonial archives and records. This {{was one of the}} political tasks of the Malaspina expedition, for which Malaspina and his officers had royal authority above that of the viceroy, authorizing access to any and all documents they <b>might</b> <b>think</b> relevant. Dionisio Alcalá Galiano was in command of the party of Malaspina's officers. While in Mexico Malaspina received orders from the king of Spain to investigate a rumored Northwest Passage in Alaska. While returning to Acapulco Malaspina learned of the discovery of the entrance to the Strait of Georgia, a result of the expedition of Francisco de Eliza sent by Güemes Padilla in 1791 to the Pacific Northwest. Güemes Padilla had been preparing another expedition to explore the Strait of Juan de Fuca since 1791. It was to be under the command of Francisco Antonio Mourelle, using two newly built schooners, Mexicana and Sutil. But Malaspina was able {{to take control of the}} schooners, replace Mourelle with Alcalá Galiano, and sent the ships to explore the Strait of Georgia. Galiano's expedition took place in 1792. Because Malaspina was imprisoned for political reasons upon his return to Spain in 1794 the account of his expedition was never published. Galiano's exploration account was published in 1802, but with all mention of Malaspina removed. It was instead said that Galiano operated under the direction of Güemes Padilla instead of Malaspina. This fiction continues to be widely cited to the present day.|$|E
