40|$|Abstract. Adhesives {{are widely}} used in {{industrial}} world. However, {{it is difficult to}} characterize their mechanical properties because those strongly depend on environmental and mechanical conditions such as temperature, humidity or strain rate. In this paper, we focus on the strain rate dependence of the interfacial strength and investigate the interfacial strength by peel tests under several peel rates. The results show that, in low rate case (under 10 - 2 mm/s), the interfacial strength was constant and, in <b>middle</b> <b>rate</b> case (10 - 2 to 103 mm/s), the interfacial strength increased with the peel rate. Over 103 mm/s case, the interfacial strength became lower than those in <b>middle</b> <b>rate</b> cases.

The ball displacement perpendicular to sliding surface and friction force during the initial stage resulted in different consequences with different percentage of RH. The <b>middle</b> <b>rate</b> of RH 49 % showed a contradictory behavior with the common sense known that friction force of sliding decreases with increment of RH. Friction force of sliding can be dominated by water meniscus and water viscosity {{as well as local}} solid-solid contact in atmosphere at certain rate of RH...|$|R
30|$|By {{investigating}} into {{input-output tables}} {{of the four}} periods from 1997 to 2010, the relationship between logistics industry and related industries can be analyzed. The trend of the development degree of logistics industry and its correlation degree with relative industries can be seen. Thus the theoretical basis for scientific judgment on logistics industry’s status and its influence on national economy is provided. By calculating the direct consumption coefficient of each industry’s sector against logistics and the direct consumption coefficients of the logistics industry against various sectors, and <b>middle</b> demand <b>rate</b> as well as <b>middle</b> input <b>rate,</b> {{the author of this}} thesis gains the following conclusions.|$|R

It can be widely applied in emergency searching, disaster salvation and military applications etc. As <b>middle</b> and high <b>rate</b> sensor network node energy is limited, so energy efficient {{is the primary}} issue for Sensor network Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design. BEB back-off algorithm cause more collision when node is in <b>middle</b> or high <b>rate.</b> A new back-off algorithm named ACW (Adaptive Contention Window) is proposed in this paper, which adjusts the CW {{based on the number}} of historical collision. In ACW, the adjustment of CW can properly reflect the state of medium contention, which results in improvements of throughput and reducement delay in MHWSN...|$|R

30|$|In the simulation, {{we assume}} that the number of users is K= 6, and the {{spreading}} factor is N= 16. Thus, for the satellite communications on-the-move system with a <b>middle</b> <b>rate</b> (e.g., 1 Mbps), this means the occupied bandwidth is nearly 20 MHz, and the spectrum density is reduced by about 13 dB. The spreading sequences are derived from gold sequences. The average performance over all users in the asynchronous case is considered. In the simulation, an LDPC encoder of code rate, rate= 1 / 2, was used as the error control code. The LDPC block length was set to be L= 1, 024. We assume that the receiver knows the spreading sequences exactly and each user’s propagation delay can be acquired through the timing and synchronization module. The following simulation is done in the asynchronous case.|$|R
