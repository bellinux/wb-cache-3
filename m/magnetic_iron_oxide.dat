30|$|However, it is a {{technological}} challenge to control size, shape, stability, and dispersibility of NPs in desired solvents. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> NPs {{have a large}} surface-to-volume ratio and therefore possess high surface energies.

30|$|Among the <b>magnetic</b> {{material}}s, <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> play a {{major role}} in many areas of chemistry, physics and material sciences. In particular, <b>magnetic</b> <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> such as magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and maghemite (γ-Fe 2 O 3) have been investigated intensively for environmental and bio-applications (Daniel-da-Silva et al. 2007, 2008; Rebolledo et al. 2008; Hong et al. 2008; Li et al. 2007). Magnetite based materials with high magnetic characteristic are very effective as adsorbents for heavy metal ions removal. Superparamagnetic particles adhered to the target can be removed very quickly from a matrix using a magnetic field, but they do not retain their magnetic properties when the field is removed (Yantasee et al. 2007). However, it should be pointed out that uncoated magnetic nanoparticles are highly susceptible to oxidation when exposed to atmosphere and also susceptible to leaching under acidic conditions (Ren et al. 2008; Mahmoudi et al. 2011). In addition to convenient magnetic properties and low toxicity and price, Fe 3 O 4 exhibit high surface to volume ratios, depending on the particle size, which associated to their ability for surface chemical modification can enhance the capacity for heavy metal adsorption in water treatment processes.|$|R
