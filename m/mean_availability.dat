50|$|End of the 1990´s, {{the demand}} for an energy {{increase}} up to about 1500 MeV arose. This was accomplished by adding a fourth accelerator stage. Adding another RTM was not possible {{because it would have}} required bending magnets of ~2200 tons each. Therefore, the technique was modifiedby splitting the 180°-dipoles into a system of symmetric pairs of 90°-dipoles, each forming an achromatic 180° bending system with magnets of only 250 tons each. To compensate for the strong vertical defocusing due to the 45° pole-face inclination between the magnets, these dipoles incorporate an appropriate field gradient normal to this pole edge. In this scheme there are two non-dispersive sections which allow to install two linear accelerators. To meet the microtron coherence conditionwithin the confined space of existing experimental areas the acceleration frequency of one of these linacs is twice the MAMI-B frequency of 2.45 GHz.The other linac still operates at 2.45 GHz for enhanced longitudinal stability. This special rf scheme gave rise to the name Harmonic Double-Sided Microtron (HDSM). MAMI-C is the worldwide first acceleratorusing this concept (Kaiser, K.H. et al., 2000). The construction work started in 2000. End of December 2006, within one day, the first test beam was guided through all 43 recirculations and reached the design energy of 1508 MeV. After only a few weeks of beam tests, the first nuclear physics experiment was conducted in February 2007. About 50% of the MAMI beam time in 2007 (7180 h) was used for 1.5 GeV operation. All design parameters of the HDSM, including the max. current of 100 µA (151 kW of beam power), have been verified. End of 2009 an energy of 1604 MeV was reached.The <b>mean</b> <b>availability</b> of the beam for experiments (> 80%) is at a very high level, a clear demonstration that the HDSM scheme is as reliable and stable as the RTM cascade.|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates {{medicine}} prices, their {{availability and}} affordability in Brazil, considering the differences across {{three types of}} medicines on the market (originator brands, generics and similar medicines) and different types of facilities (private pharmacies, public sector pharmacies and “popular pharmacies”), using an established methodology. Data on prices and availability of 50 medicines (originator brand, lowestpriced generic and similar medicines) were collected from public, private and popular pharmacies (N= 56) across six cities in Southern Brazil. Median prices obtained are divided by international reference prices to derive the median price ratio (MPR). In the private sector, prices were 8. 6 MPR for similar medicines, 11. 3 MRP for generics and 18. 7 MRP for originator brands, respectively. <b>Mean</b> <b>availability</b> was 65 %, 74 % and 48 % for originator brands, generics and similars, respectively. The number of working days needed {{to pay for a}} complete medicine treatment (affordability) varied considerably between medicines aimed at treating acute and chronic diseases and by type of medicine. In the public sector, the <b>mean</b> <b>availability</b> of similar medicines was 2 - 7 times higher than that of generics. The mean overall availability in the public sector ranged from 68. 8 % to 81. 7 %. In “popular pharmacies”, <b>mean</b> <b>availability</b> was greater than 90 % in all cities. This analysis finds that availability of medicines in the public sector does not meet the challenge for supplying essential medicines to the entire population, as stated in the Brazilian constitution. This has unavoidable repercussions for affordability, particularly amongst the lower socio-economic strata. Policies targeted to reduce the prices of the generics need to be implemented in Brazil, as well as making them more widely available. Popular pharmacies may help overcome the lack of medicines in the public sector, but the limited number of medicines distributed in these facilities is of concern...|$|E

The considerations have been demonstrated {{on the basis of}} a real city bus transport system in a chosen agglomeration. The executive subsystem consisting of elementary subsystems of the type human – technical object (operator – transport means) whose serviceability and reliability have a direct influence on capability to perform the transport task is directly responsible for accomplishment of the city transport system tasks. In order to develop a model of means of transport serviceability there were determined significant states of the operational use process and there was made a division and reduction of the number of states in terms of the availability criterion. On this basis, an event model of the process of transport means operational use, and then a mathematical model of this process, were built with the assumption that its model is a homogenous Markov’s process X(t). Next, boundary values of availability coefficient for the distinguished availability levels of transport means used in the city transport system were determined for operational data obtained from a real city bus transport system.

However, due to the ambiguity of assessment measure and lack of assessment methods, {{it is difficult to}} assess the power curve. For solving the problem, a method based on performance reliability is proposed in this article. Using the operating data recorded in SCADA, the measured power curve was tested, and according to the manufacturer promised power curve, based on performance reliability theory, a method of assessing power curve was proposed. Using the method provided herein, the power curves of 5 wind turbines, which were erected in a wind farm in north China, were assessed. Results show that the method is accurate, simple and practical. And it provides an important theoretical basis for power curve assessment of wind turbine in site.

Pakistan, despite being in the late implementation phase of the strategy, continues to report high under-five mortality due to pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, and malnutrition &#x 2013; the main targets of the strategy. Objective: The study determines the factors influencing IMCI implementation at public-sector primary health care (PHC) facilities in Matiari district, Sindh, Pakistan. Design: An exploratory qualitative study with an embedded quantitative strand was conducted. The qualitative part included 16 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with stakeholders which included planners and policy makers at a provincial level (n= 5), implementers and managers at a district level (n= 3), and IMCI-trained physicians posted at PHC facilities (n= 8). Quantitative part included PHC facility survey (n= 16) utilizing WHO health facility assessment tool to assess availability of IMCI essential drugs, supplies, and equipments. Qualitative content {{analysis was used to}} interpret the textual information, whereas descriptive frequencies were calculated for health facility survey data. Results: The major factors reported to enhance IMCI implementation were knowledge and perception about the strategy and need for separate clinic for children aged under 5 years as potential support factors. The latter can facilitate in strategy implementation through allocated workforce and required equipments and supplies. Constraint factors mainly included lack of clear understanding of the strategy, poor planning for IMCI implementation, ambiguity in defined roles and responsibilities among stakeholders, and insufficient essential supplies and drugs at PHC centers. The latter was further substantiated through health facilities&#x 2019; survey findings, which indicated that none of the facilities had 100 % stock of essential supplies and drugs. Only one out of all 16 surveyed facilities had 75 % of the total supplies, while 4 out of 16 facilities had 56 % of the required IMCI drug stock. The <b>mean</b> <b>availability</b> of supplies ranged from 36. 6 to 66 %, while the <b>mean</b> <b>availability</b> of drugs ranged from 45. 8 to 56. 7 %. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the Matiari district has sound implementation potential; however, bottlenecks at health care facility and at health care management level have badly constrained the implementation process. An interdependency exists among the constraining factors, such as lack of sound planning resulting in unclear understanding of the strategy; leading to ambiguous roles and responsibilities among stakeholders which manifest as inadequate availability of supplies and drugs at PHC facilities. Addressing these barriers is likely to have a cumulative effect on facilitating IMCI implementation. On the basis of these findings, we recommend that the provincial Ministry of Health (MoH) and provincial Maternal Neonatal and Child Health (MNCH) program jointly assess the situation and streamline IMCI implementation in the district through sound planning, training, supervision, and logistic support...|$|E

Socio-economic changes in rural Spain have reduced traditional sheep grazing in juniper woodlands, which are now increasingly used for wood production.

Different from the general strategy, the COMPASS IGPs are predefined with a resolution of 2. 5 A degrees and 5 A degrees in latitude and longitude. The need for this special IGPs distribution is investigated with experiments using real data. The performance of the COMPASS ionospheric grid is analyzed in terms of accuracy and availability.
