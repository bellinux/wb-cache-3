40|$|Abstract: The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the <b>mean</b> <b>access</b> <b>delay</b> characteristics in term of the channel load for networked sensor/control systems in LonWorks/EIA- 709 technology. The system modelling is focused on the Media Access Control protocol that provides the load prediction and determines the key network characteristics. The network model assumes the consistency of load prediction between the nodes, and that the Transaction Control Sublayer does not introduce limitations on the data transmission. The latter means that the numbers of concurrent outgoing transactions being in progress are unlimited. Furthermore, it is assumed that the destination addresses of transmitted messages are distributed rather than concentrated on particular nodes. The analytical approach based on Markov chains is applied. The calculation of transition probabilities of the Markov chain is exemplified by the load scenario where all the transactions are acknowledged, unicast, and the optional collision detection is enabled. On the basis of the stochastic analysis, the probabilities of a successful transmission and collision, respectively, are computed. Furthermore, the numerical results of the <b>mean</b> <b>access</b> <b>delay</b> are reported. The simulative validation of analytical results is provided...|$|E

40|$|A {{wireless}} {{local area}} network (WLAN) is a flexible data communication system that can act as an extension to a wired LAN within a building or campus for portable terminals. However, always-on wireless connectivity for smaller devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDA), is limited by terminal battery capacity. The main aim of the PDAnet project is to improve the performance and power efficiency of short-range wireless access networks through the use of effective medium access control (MAC) protocols and adaptive packet scheduling. Having demonstrated the power efficiency of the PDAnet MAC protocol [1], we now propose an adaptive packet scheduling technique for improved performance. Although the new technique is similar in complexity to Round Robin, its performance is much better in terms of both link-layer access delay and power consumption. Simulation of a three-terminal piconet confirmed that the new scheduling technique is able to reduce the <b>mean</b> <b>access</b> <b>delay</b> of high traffic terminals in the network by up to 55. 1 %.

In this paper, we design and evaluate a reservation random access (RRA) scheme that multiplexes voice traffic at the talkspurt level to efficiently integrate voice and data traffic in outdoor microcellular environments. The scheme involves partitioning the time frame into two request intervals (voice and data) and an information interval. Thus, any potential performance degradation caused by voice and data terminals competing for channel access is eliminated. We consider three random access algorithms for the transmission of voice request packets {{and one for the}} transmission of data request packets. We formulate an approximate Markov model and present analytical results for the steady state voice packet dropping probability, <b>mean</b> voice <b>access</b> <b>delay</b> and voice throughput.

40|$|Cyclic-Reservation Multiple-Access (CRMA) is an {{effective}} access scheme for high-speed networks. In CRMA, the headend periodically generates reserve commands. If necessary, each station may reserve a number of empty slots in each reserve command. For each reserve command, the headend generates a cycle of length equal to {{the total number of}} empty slots which are reserved to serve the reservations. Generally speaking, a longer cycle length <b>means</b> a longer <b>access</b> <b>delay</b> and a lower throughput. Therefore, it is desirable to study how to reduce the cycle length.

30|$|In EDCA, {{differences}} in contention parameter values assigned to ACs create different channel access priorities. ACs (such as AC_VO and AC_VI) with high priority {{are assigned to}} smaller values of CWmin and CWmax and a larger value of TXOP limit, compared with ACs with low priority. However, high-priority flows just produce small aggregated sizes, because the small CW enables a flow to quickly transmit the arrived packets after a short waiting time. As a result, high-priority flows have high overhead and low channel utilization. Skordoulis et al. [16] gave such an example. Consider an HDTV application that has a mean rate of 19.2 Mbps and a constant MSDU size of 1500 bytes. Then, the packet interarrival time at the MAC layer is 625 microsecond (μs). Now, as the first packet arrives at the buffer, the node initiates a channel access using the AC_VI parameters. From [28], the <b>mean</b> MAC <b>access</b> <b>delay</b> (which is the interval between when the packet arrives at the buffer and when the packet arrives at the receiver) for the packet should be equal to about 241 μs.

In such systems, files are either {{replicated}} or coded to ensure reliability, i. e., file recovery from server failures. This redundancy in storage can further be exploited to improve system performance (<b>mean</b> file <b>access</b> <b>delay)</b> through appropriate load-balancing (routing) schemes. However, it is unclear whether coding or replication is better from a system performance perspective since the corresponding queueing analysis of such systems is, in general, quite difficult except for the trivial case when the system load asymptotically tends to zero. Here, we study the more difficult case where the system load is not asymptotically zero. Using the fact that the system size is large, we obtain a mean-field limit for the steady-state distribution of the number of file access requests waiting at each server. We then use the mean-field limit to show that, for a given storage capacity per file, coding strictly outperforms replication at all traffic loads while improving reliability. Further, the factor by which the performance improves in the heavy-traffic is at least as large as in the light-traffic case. Finally, we validate these results through extensive simulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{majority}} of analytical {{work on the}} performance of IEEE 802. 11 [1] focuses on predicting the throughput and the mean delay of only the medium access, although higher layer applications and protocols are interested in the total performance of the MAC layer. Seen in this perspective, surprisingly little focus has been on predicting the queueing delay. The main contribution of this paper opposed to other works is that it presents the full delay distribution through the z-transform. As a result, the <b>mean</b> medium <b>access</b> <b>delay</b> is found by the first order moment of the transform, and the mean queueing delay by the second order moment. Together this gives the average total delay associated with the MAC layer. The z-transform is derived from an analytical model that works in the whole range from a lightly loaded, non-saturated channel to a heavily congested, saturated medium. The model describes the priority schemes of the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism of the IEEE 802. 11 e standard [2]. EDCA provides class-based differentiated Quality of Service (QoS) to IEEE 802. 11 WLANs, and distinguishes between four different traffic classes – called Access Categories (AC). By setting the number of ACs to one, and by using an appropriate parameter setting, the results presented are also applicable to the legacy 802. 11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) [1]. The model predictions are calculated numerically and validated against simulation results. A good match between the analytical predictions and simulations was observed...|$|R

We also extend the analysis to the contention-window-based backoff model which is widely adopted in practical MAC protocols. It will be revealed that both the retransmission-probability-based and the contention-window-based models exhibit the same stable region and achieve similar queueing performance in most cases, which justifies the intuition that was taken but remained unverified in previous studies: the retransmission-probability-based backoff model can serve as a good approximation of the contention-window-based one...|$|E

The main feature of this protocol is that the token contains a special field called the rotation counter. This counter can be examined by every station and is used to count down the number of packets transmitted in one cycle. In each cycle, voice packets are collected first, and data packets could be transmitted only if the counter value is non-zero. In this way, voice packets are given a higher priority to access the network so that their real-time requirement can be satisfied. Two variations of the protocol, RCP-I and RCP-II, are presented. They have different delay performances. In RCP-I, the <b>mean</b> voice packet <b>access</b> <b>delay</b> {{is dependent on the}} offered data load, while in RCP-II, such delay can be made almost independent with a small delay jitters.
