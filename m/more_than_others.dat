5|$|In {{the first}} war league after the {{outbreak}} of World War II (1940–41) Stockport finished in 35th place overall in the Northern Regional League after playing 29 games. League standings were calculated by goal average {{over the course of}} games played, with some teams playing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> In 1945–46, English football still did not have a football season; however, The FA Cup competition was resumed. Stockport was eliminated from the 1945–46 FA Cup in the first round after a 3–2 aggregate loss to Rochdale. The first post-war league season 1946–47 saw Stockport finish fourth in Division 3 (North) with 24 wins and 50 points.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{nutrient}} deficiencies {{can cause}} a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants {{to a lack of}} head growth. Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause stunted growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants. Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural phenolics such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests. Certain varieties contain <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others,</b> and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.|$|E

These individuals usually live and work near each other. Monthly fares will vary, depending on the origination point of the van and the daily miles involved. Riders pay only for the portion of the trip they use. For instance, if the service picks up riders in different counties, it's possible for some riders to pay <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E
25|$|Figures such as agent Max Clifford {{have advised}} gay players {{to keep their}} {{sexuality}} a secret {{for the sake of}} their careers, saying that to be openly gay would potentially damage their playing prospects. This would also apply abroad, where even if accepted in England a gay player might face a new barrier if he wished to play in a country less accepting of homosexuality. Coming out would undoubtedly bring a gay player abuse from the terraces, and perhaps elsewhere too; this would affect some players <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E

25|$|Frankston High School {{is one of}} {{the most}} reputable state {{government}} schools in Victoria with an excellent academic record attained through a range of extension programs. Admittance to the school is determined by residing within its catchment area. Real estate agents market residential properties as being near the school more often than any other, except Balwyn High School, in the Melbourne inner-eastern suburb of Balwyn North. Research from the Real Estate Institute of Victoria (REIV) also identified that properties in the catchment area of the school sell for 16.9% <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others</b> in Frankston compared with 4% more in Balwyn North.|$|E
25|$|In tennis, {{grass is}} grown on very hard-packed soil, and the bounce of {{a tennis ball}} may vary {{depending}} on the grass's health, how recently it has been mowed, and the wear and tear of recent play. The surface is softer than hard courts and clay (other tennis surfaces), so the ball bounces lower, and players must reach the ball faster resulting in a different style of play which may suit some players <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> Among the world's most prestigious court for grass tennis is Centre Court at Wimbledon, London which hosts the final of the annual Wimbledon Championships in England, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments.|$|E
25|$|Many radical {{views of}} transsaccadic memory exist. Some are favoured <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others</b> {{because of the}} {{evidence}} that supports them. One less-accepted theory, Breitmeyer's spatiotopic fusion hypothesis, suggested that successive images are fused based on environmental coordinates and not retinal ones. In other words, our memory stores a sequence of images from our surroundings, and joins the images together to give us a full representation in our brain. The orientation of our retinas do not have an influence on this form of memory. This theoretical form of memory supposedly stores highly detailed representations of the world in a high capacity spatial buffer. Research and experiments by other psychologists provide empirical evidence against these claims.|$|E

25|$|While PMS {{is linked}} to the luteal phase, the causes of PMS are not clear, but several factors may be involved. Changes in hormones during the menstrual cycle seem to be an {{important}} factor; changing hormone levels affect some women <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> Chemical changes in the brain, stress, and emotional problems, such as depression, do not seem to cause PMS but they may make it worse. Low levels of vitamins and minerals, high sodium, alcohol, and/or caffeine can exacerbate symptoms such as water retention and bloating. PMS occurs more often in women who are between their late 20s and early 40s; have at least 1 child; {{have a family history of}} depression; and have a past medical history of either postpartum depression or a mood disorder.|$|E
25|$|Passive {{immunity}} is {{also provided}} through colostrum and breast milk, which contain IgA antibodies that are {{transferred to the}} gut of the infant, providing local protection against disease causing bacteria and viruses until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. Maternal antibodies protect against some diseases <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others</b> such as measles, rubella, and tetanus compared to the protection provided against polio, and pertussis. Maternal passive immunity offers immediate protection, though protection mediated by maternal IgG typically only lasting {{four to six months}} after birth. Protection mediated by IgA is dependent on the length of time that an infant is breastfed, {{which is one of the}} reasons the World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for at least the first two years of life.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, opioid {{prescribing}} increased significantly. Once used {{almost exclusively}} {{for the treatment of}} acute pain or pain due to cancer, opioids are now prescribed liberally for people experiencing chronic pain. This has been accompanied by rising rates of accidental addiction and accidental overdoses leading to death. According to the International Narcotics Control Board, the United States and Canada lead the per capita consumption of prescription opioids. The number of opioid prescriptions in the United States and Canada is double the consumption in the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand. Certain populations have been affected by the opioid addiction crisis <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others,</b> including First World communities and low-income populations. Public health specialists say that this may result from unavailability or high cost of alternative methods for addressing chronic pain.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} millennium, dialects had diverged so far that some of the more {{geographically}} distant ones had become mutually unintelligible and distinct. With the evolved Latin vernaculars viewed as different languages with local norms, specific orthographies would in time be developed for some. Since all modern Romance varieties are continuations of this evolution, Vulgar Latin is not extinct but survives in variously evolved forms as today's Romance languages and dialects. In Romance-speaking Europe, recognition of the common origin of Romance varieties was replaced by labels recognizing and implicitly accentuating local differences in linguistic features. Some Romance languages evolved <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> In terms of phonological structures, for example, a clear hierarchy from conservative to innovative is found in comparing Italian, Spanish and French (e.g. Latin amica > Italian amica, Spanish amiga, French amie; Latin caput > Italian capo, Spanish cabo, French chef).|$|E
25|$|In mid-1918, {{with the}} ending of the German Spring Offensive, the Australian troops started to conduct {{offensive}} patrols into no man's land. As the front lines after the Spring Offensive lacked fortifications and were non-continuous, it was discovered that the patrols could infiltrate the German outpost line and approach the outposts from behind. In this manner, the outposts could be taken quickly, and with minimal force. This tactic was first reported as being used on 5 April 1918 by the Australian 58th Battalion, 15th Brigade, 5th Division. However, within a few weeks all five of the Australian divisions (and the New Zealand Division) were using the tactic, with some units using the tactic <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others</b> (for example, the 3rd Division conducted the tactic on three out of every five days in April). In some units, it was treated as a competition, with companies of the 41st Battalion competing to see who could capture the most prisoners.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 {{the league}} signed a £315million deal with ITV Digital, but in March 2002 the channel {{was put into}} {{administration}} by its parent companies when the league refused to accept a £130million reduction in the deal.

It covers Football League, League Cup and Football League Trophy matches and {{the full range of}} media: terrestrial and pay television, broadband internet, video-on-demand and mobile services. The deal represents a 135% increase on the previous deal and works out at an average of over £1.2 million per club per season, though some clubs will receive <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> Sky will provide the majority of the coverage and the BBC broadcast 10 exclusively live matches from the Championship per season and the semi-finals and finals of the League Cup.|$|E
