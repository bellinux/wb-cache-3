Manufacturing industry can be considered as the fourth large one in Jordanian economy. In last decade, the growth rate in this sector is the second one after transport and communications. The gross fixed capital formation in manufacturing is the third one. In this paper we need a cross sectional data for cost shares, factor inputs, factor prices, and output. Main source of data for manufacturing industry in Jordan is the Industry Survey-Department Statistics- the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The data for factor inputs and output were transferred to logarithm. A point around which production function should be estimated was chosen.

40|$|Distributed {{models to}} {{forecast}} the {{spatial and temporal}} occurrence of rainfall-induced shallow landslides are based on deterministic laws. These models extend spatially the static stability models adopted in geotechnical engineering, and adopt an infinite-slope geometry to balance the resisting and the driving forces acting on the sliding mass. An infiltration model is used to determine how rainfall changes pore-water conditions, modulating the local stability/instability conditions. A problem with {{the operation of the}} existing models lays in the difficulty in obtaining accurate values for the several variables that describe the material properties of the slopes. The problem is particularly severe when the models are applied over large areas, for which sufficient information on the geotechnical and hydrological conditions of the slopes is not generally available. To help solve the problem, we propose a probabilistic Monte Carlo approach to the distributed modeling of rainfall-induced shallow landslides. For the purpose, we have modified the Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability Analysis (TRIGRS) code. The new code (TRIGRS-P) adopts a probabilistic approach to compute, on a cell-by-cell basis, transient pore-pressure changes and related changes in the factor of safety due to rainfall infiltration. Infiltration is modeled using analytical solutions of partial differential equations describing one-dimensional vertical flow in isotropic, homogeneous materials. Both saturated and unsaturated soil conditions can be considered. TRIGRS-P copes with the natural variability inherent to the mechanical and hydrological properties of the slope <b>materials</b> <b>by</b> allowing <b>values</b> of the TRIGRS model input parameters to be sampled randomly from a given probability distribution.

40|$|A color-order {{system is}} a {{conceptual}} system of organized color perceptions. The Munsell Color System was the first color-order system developed by Munsell in 1905 as a teaching aid for art students [9]. His goal was to have both a numerical system and a physical exemplification, achieved via the Atlas of the Munsell Colors [10]. A color-order system exemplification is a physical system that depicts a color-order system. His guiding principle was equality of visual spacing. The original Atlas has undergone considerable refinement and development based on extensive visual experimentation resulting in the current specification, the Munsell System, and its various exemplifications. During late 1930 s, a subcommittee of the Optical Society of America performed further visual experiments to improve the visual spacing between color samples. More sophisticated color matching experimental techniques were used [11], totaling over three million observations in the final specifications [12]. A Munsell notation is defined as H V/C for hue (H), value (V), and chroma (C). The Munsell system is cylindrical in nature with a central lightness axis (Munsell <b>value)</b> surrounded <b>by</b> chromatic planes arranged in a hue circle. For a given hue, the colors have equal visual spacing. However, between hues, the more chromatic colors are further apart than less chromatic colors are. Between 1947 and 1974, the Optical Society of America developed a new color-order system, called the OSA Uniform Color Scales (OSA-UCS), that alleviated this deficiency. Unfortunately, the OSA-UCS is very complex and very difficult to sample colors at constant hue or chroma, thus greatly limiting its usage.

Back EMF waveforms of prototype motors are measured in order to validate the analytical predictions. The solution of the magneto-quasi-static Maxwell's Equations are applied to the analysis of eddy currents and torque measurements are made to verify the theoretical predictions. Simplified motor models are discovered which yield symbolic solutions for optimal motor parameters as a function of mass.

In this work the attention is focused on the selection of materials to be employed as friction pads in FREEDAM joints, providing alternative solutions based on the application by means of thermal spray techniques of carbides and of metallic or intermetallic materials on steel plates. To date, twelve tests on eight different coating materials combined with stainless steel plates have been realized. The tests performed until now, which are mainly devoted to evaluate the behaviour of the friction interfaces in terms of static and kinetic friction coefficient and in terms of degradation, are inspired to the sliding test proposed by EN 1090 - 2 adopting the loading protocol suggested by the EN 12159 for the qualification of seismic devices.

We surveyed commercial pellet manufacturers in 2010, collecting annual production data for 2009. Weighted-average inputs to, and emissions from, the pelletization process were determined. The pellet making unit process was combined with existing LCI data from hardwood flooring residues production, and a life-cycle impact assessment was conducted using the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) model. The potential bioenergy and embodied nonrenewable energy in 907 kg (1 ton, the functional unit of this study) of wood fuel pellets was also calculated. The pelletization of wood requires significant amounts of electrical energy (145 kWh/Mg), but the net bioenergy balance is positive.
