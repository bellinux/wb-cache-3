40|$|Control loops in self-adaptive {{systems are}} {{typically}} {{conceived as a}} sequence of four computations: Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (<b>MAPE).</b> During {{the development of a}} traffic monitoring system with support for self-healing, we have noticed that simple <b>MAPE</b> loops are not sufficient to deal with the more complex failure sce-narios. To manage the adaptations in these scenarios, we extend <b>MAPE</b> loops with support for two types of coordination. First, we introduce support for intra-loop coordination enabling <b>MAPE</b> com-putations within one loop to coordinate with one another. Intra-loop coordination allows the execution of multiple sub-loops within one control loop. Second, we introduce support for inter-loop coordi-nation enabling <b>MAPE</b> computations across multiple loops to coor-dinate with one another. Inter-loop coordination allows the <b>MAPE</b> computations of different loops to coordinate the various phases of adaptations. We show how we used the extensions to support self-healing in the traffic monitoring system.

40|$|International audienceEvent {{exploration}} is {{the process}} of exploring a topologically known environment to gather information about dynamic events in this environment. Using multi-robot systems for event exploration brings important challenges such as finding and communicating relevant information. This paper presents a solution to these challenges in form of a distributed decision-theoretic model called <b>MAPING,</b> in which each agent computes a communication and an exploration strategy by assessing the relevance of an observation for another agent. The agents use an extended belief state that contains not only their own beliefs but also approximations of other agents’ beliefs. <b>MAPING</b> includes a forgetting mechanism to ensure that the event-exploration remains open-ended. To overcome the resolution complexity due to the extended belief state we use a method based on the well-known adopted assumption of variables independence. We evaluate our approach on different event exploration problems with varying complexity. The experimental results on simulation show the effectiveness of <b>MAPING,</b> its ability to scale up and its ability to face real-word applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Self-adaptation is {{typically}} realized using a control loop. One prominent approach for organizing a control loop in self-adaptive systems is {{by means of}} four components {{that are responsible for}} the primary func-tions of self-adaptation: Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute, together forming a <b>MAPE</b> loop. When systems are large, complex, and hetero-geneous, a single <b>MAPE</b> loop may not be sufficient for managing all adaptation in a system, so multiple <b>MAPE</b> loops may be introduced. In self-adaptive systems with multiple <b>MAPE</b> loops, decisions about how to decentralize each of the <b>MAPE</b> functions must be made. These decisions involve how and whether the corresponding functions from multiple loops are to be coordinated (e. g., planning components coordinating to prepare a plan for an adaptation). To foster comprehension of self-adaptive sys-tems with multiple <b>MAPE</b> loops and support reuse of known solutions, it is crucial that we document common design approaches for engineers. As such systematic knowledge is currently lacking, it is timely to reflect on these systems to: (a) consolidate the knowledge in this area, and (b) to develop a systematic approach for describing different types of con-trol in self-adaptive systems. We contribute with a simple notation for describing interacting <b>MAPE</b> loops, which we believe helps in achieving (b), and we use this notation to describe a number of existing patterns of interacting <b>MAPE</b> loops, to begin to fulfill (a). From our study, we outline numerous remaining research challenges in this area. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe mean {{absolute}} percentage error (<b>MAPE)</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used measures of forecast accuracy, due to its advantages of scale-independency and interpretability. However, <b>MAPE</b> has the significant disadvantage that it produces infinite or undefined values for zero or close-to-zero actual values. In order to address this issue in <b>MAPE,</b> we propose a new measure of forecast accuracy called the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE). MAAPE has been developed through looking at <b>MAPE</b> from a different angle. In essence, MAAPE is a slope as an angle, while <b>MAPE</b> is a slope as a ratio, considering a triangle with adjacent and opposite sides that are equal to an actual value and the difference between the actual and forecast values, respectively. MAAPE inherently preserves the philosophy of <b>MAPE,</b> overcoming the problem of division by zero by using bounded influences for outliers in a fundamental manner through considering the ratio as an angle instead of a slope. The theoretical properties of MAAPE are investigated, and the practical advantages are demonstrated using both simulated and real-life data...|$|R
