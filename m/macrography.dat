The cathodically protected structure was a slab and a pile cap. Before the construction of cathodic protection system, the <b>macrography</b> was carried out. As {{a result of the}} <b>macrography,</b> many corrosion traces were confirmed in this structure. The trace was mainly focused on joint and zones that concrete cover was eliminated. To apply the cathodic protection system, many onsite techniques have been adopted. In addition, to confirm the inner state of steel in concrete properly, a corrosion monitoring sensor (DMS- 100, Conclinic Co. Ltd) has been applied. Test factors were corrosion & cathodic protection potential, 4 hour depolarization potential, resistivity and current density.

40|$|Dissimilar {{friction}} stir {{butt welds}} between the 2014 -T 6 and the 6061 -T 6 Al alloys were performed with various sets of welding parameters including a lateral {{shift of the}} tool from the initial separation between the plates to be welded and by placing the alloys, either on the advancing, or on the retreating side of the weld. Torque and temperature measurements during welding as well as <b>macrographies</b> and hardness profiles measurements were performed after welding. It {{was found that the}} welding torque, the temperature, the metal flow and the welds' hardness profile depend on the proportion of each alloy included in the stirred zone. Those results are attributed to the difference between the softening temperatures of both alloys. The 6061 alloy's HAZ is the weak link in all dissimilar welds. The evolution of the hardening precipitation, the hardness and the local yield strength in the 6061 alloy are therefore modeled. The model reasonably well predicts the experimentally measured hardness of both similar and dissimilar welds. It also explains the influence of the alloys placement or tool lateral shift on the welds hardness by their influence on the precipitate radius and volume fraction. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Welding {{cheap and}} ductile 6 xxx Al alloys with high {{strength}} 2 xxx Al alloys is desirable {{for instance in}} specific aeronautical applications. These alloys present different rheological behaviors and melting temperatures which affect the ability to produce sound dissimilar friction stir welds. Dissimilar friction stir butt welds made of 2014 -T 6 Al alloys were performed with various welding parameters including shifts of the tool from the initial separation between theplates to be welded and placing one alloy either on the advancing, or on the retreating side of the weld. Temperature measurements during welding, mechanical characterization (transverse tensile tests and hardness profiles) and macrographic observations were performed. <b>Macrographies</b> on sections perpendicular to the welding direction reveal different metal flow patterns in the weld nugget. If the 2014 alloy {{is placed on the}} advancing side of the weld, an abrupttransition between the weld nugget and the 6061 alloy is observed on macrographs leading to premature fracture in tension. Dissimilar welds are cooler on the 6061 side of the weld, i. e. the weakest side of the weld, than the corresponding 6061 similar weld, limiting the growth of the hardening precipitates. This leads thus to higher strength of the dissimilar welds. Dissimilar welds with the weld center shifted towards the 2014 alloy present lower temperatures than unshifted welds on the 6061 side of the weld, also leading to higher strength...|$|R

The detailed knowledge of material flow around rotating tool, and of the microstructural evolution occurring during this process, constitute the fundamental input to realize analysis and simulation models {{in order to determine}} a optimal tool design and high structural efficiency welds. In the present research, an integrated mechanical-metallurgical-morphological analysis has been performer, to evaluate the influence of the different technological parameters on the characteristics of the joint. The experimental plan has been realized varying the tool sinking, the tool rotation rate and the performance time during the sinking. The process has been performed on AA 6082 T 6 whit thickness equal to 1. 0 mm and on AA 105 O aluminum sheets of 0. 5 mm. The latter material (AA 1050) has been utilized as weld marker of the material flow. Realized joints have been subjected to macrographic analysis that allowed to determine flow material variations. Beginning from the <b>macrographies</b> of the transversal section of every joint, a morphological analysis has been effected on the variation of the surface of interface among the two materials. For each image the threshold image has been so obtained. The presence of two different types of surfaces in the different zones of the joint has been emphasized. Furthermore micrographic analysis, tensile tests and micro-hardness Vickers tests allowed to determine microstructural variations and strength characteristics of the joints in order to chose the best set of operative parameters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: E glass epoxy {{laminates}} {{were made}} by a hand layup process. Laminates containing the central portion having either a 2 layer larger cell sized thicker width or a 3 layer thinner width flexible foam were also fabricated by the same route using a room temperature curing resin. Test coupons were cut from the fabricated laminates and im-pacted by a pendulum, having facility to load specific values for its mass, {{on the face of}} the laminate. Impacts {{were made by}} a single mass or a two stage impact operations involv-ing preliminary hits, first by a smaller mass and then by a larger mass. The energy values associated with the process were computed. Macroscopy on failed test coupons was done to identify the dominant mode of failure and correlate the mechanical test data with failure processes. It is seen that foam bearing materials absorb increased impact energy compared to plain laminates and further, the cell-size/interfacial area of the foam plays a significant role in altering the fracture phenomena.

40|$|International audienceModelling {{tools for}} the {{ultrasonic}} inspection of bimetallic welds, which link ferritic {{and stainless steel}} parts, are presented. Those structures are difficult to control as anisotropy, heterogeneity and grain orientation distribution can impede the detection of defects. Dynamic ray tracing is an efficient method to simulate the ultrasonic propagation in welds. The weld {{can be described as}} a set of several anisotropic homogeneous domains with a given crystallographic orientation. In this case, the rays travel in straight lines inside each homogeneous domain. Nevertheless, if the domains are small compared to the wavelength and exhibit strong variations in grain orientation, a chaotic behaviour of rays may be observed, leading to inaccurate results. To overcome this problem, a smooth description of the grain orientation has to be used. To achieve such a description, the grain orientations are computed on a grid thanks to image processing techniques performed on a <b>macrography</b> of the weld. In this paper, we first present the image processing techniques that have been implemented. Then, we expose our first modelling results using dynamic ray tracing on a smooth description of the grain orientation and compare it to results obtained using a set of homogeneous domains to describe the weld and experimental results...|$|E

In this thesis, techniques and methods for the characterisation of behaviour and properties of ingots and forgings. The root causes for quality issues in open-die forgings are {{shown to be}} numerous. Ingot structure in cast tool steel was analyzed, and the main imperfections were centre macrosegregation, and mid radius A-segregations. For overheated steel forgings and low reductions after reheating, a high ultrasonic attenuation and low Charpy-V toughness was found. It {{could be related to}} the coarse grain structure found. Only a high forging reduction after reheating will break down the coarse structure. Shorter reheating times and lower forging temperatures gave higher toughness and lower ultrasonic attenuation. Some reduction in toughness was also found from the inclusion field {{from the bottom of the}} ingot. Accurate attenuation measurements require a lathe turned surface, complicating in-between-measurements in heat treatment sequences. But on carefully surface prepared forgings, attenuation measurement can be used to determine the success of grain refinement in the heat treatment.

Foram feitas as soldagens com os seguintes processos e materiais: processo eletrodo revestido (SMAW), tubo e calha em aço ASTM A 335 P 5, metal de adição AWS E 8018 -B 8 (experimento "F"). Processos MIG/MAG pulsado (GMAW-P) e arame tubular auto-protegido (FCAW-S), tubo e calha em aço API 5 L X 70, metais de adição AWS ER 80 S-G e AWS E 71 T- 11, respectivamente (experimento "R"). Para detectar as trincas a frio foram realizados exame visual e a inspeção com líquidos penetrantes. Adicionalmente as soldas foram avaliadas por macrografia e medição de dureza. Não foram detectadas trincas, apesar da utilização de metais de base e de adição com alto carbono equivalente e da junta com alta restrição, com o objetivo de aumentar as tensões. Admite-se que não houve fissuração devido ao uso de processos e/consumíveis com baixo teor de hidrogênio.

40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) —Universidade de Brasília, Faculdade de Tecnologia, Departamento de Engenharia Mecânica, 2016. Neste trabalho se apresenta uma metodologia para união de tubos pelo processo de soldagem com a deposição do passe de raiz. Na realização da soldagem de topo, externa e sem abertura de raiz, a altura da face de raiz é um fator {{fundamental}} para obter penetração total. Em alguns casos, mata-juntas (podem ser de cobre o de materiais cerâmicos) são usadas para evitar vazamentos de solda. Porém, o cobre pode ocasionar inclusões e corrosão, além de trazer muitas dificuldades no momento de instalação e gerar grandes custos em campo. Assim sendo, realizou-se uma análise do efeito da penetração utilizando-se o método de fase de nariz decrescente na soldagem de passe de raiz sem uso de cobre-junta nem abertura de raiz, para as seguintes posições críticas de soldagem: plana, vertical e sobrecabeça. A análise foi feita utilizando o processo de soldagem MIG/MAG por curto-circuito derivativo, GMAW-CMT (Gas Metal Arc Welding - Cold Metal Transfer), com arame AWS ER 70 S- 6 (1, 2 mm) e o gás de proteção Ar+ 25 %CO 2. O Planejamento Composto Central foi utilizado como ferramenta para a melhor organização dos testes e para análise dos resultados fez-se uma otimização utilizando a teoria de Desirability para múltiplas respostas, usando chapas planas de aço 1020 com chanfro estreito em U. Logo, valida-se esta metodologia de penetração completa em soldagem orbital de meia volta descendente em um tubo ASTM 106 por meio do processo de soldagem curto-circuito convencional com a ajuda da potência de soldagem mesurada. Os testes foram realizados com arames consumíveis de diâmetros 0, 9 e 1, 2 mm. Ensaios de macrografia mostraram os passes de raiz com bom aspecto visual e sem defeitos internos, sugerindo assim a possibilidade de execução da soldagem com penetração total. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTIn {{this manuscript}} is presented a methodology {{to realize the}} pipe union by the welding process with the deposition of the root pass. In the butt welding execution external without open root, {{the height of the}} root face is a key factor for getting full penetration. Sometimes, copper-joints are used to prevent leaks. Though, copper can cause inclusions and corrosion, producing many troubles during the installation and generating large costs in the work area. Therefore, it was performed a penetration effect analysis using the slanted nose phase, method in root pass welding without the use of copper-joint or root opening, for the following critical welding positions: flat, vertical and overhead. The analysis was performed using the welding process MIG/MAG by derivative short circuit, GMAW-CMT (Gas Metal Arc Welding – Cold Metal Transfer), with AWS ER 70 S- 6 wires (1. 2 mm) a with Ar+ 25 %CO 2, as shielding gas. The Central Composite Design (CCD) was used as a tool for a better organization of the tests, whereas to analyze the results it was made an optimization based on the Desirability theory for multiple responses, employing flat sheets of 1020 steel with a narrow-gap in U-shape. Then, this full penetration methodology in orbital welding turned down was validated in a ASTM 106 pipe through the conventional short-circuit welding process, with the joint established in the previous stages. The tests were performed with wires of 0. 9 and 1. 2 mm in order to evaluate the welding power. <b>Macrography</b> tests showed root pass with an acceptable visual appearance and without internal defects, thereby suggesting the possibility of welding execution with full penetration...|$|E
40|$|Os aços inoxidáveis duplex (AID) vêm se apresentando como uma {{excelente}} alternativa para aplicações em que elevada resistência à corrosão e alta resistência mecânica são requeridas. Em paralelo, vê-se uma corrida dos fabricantes dos AID pela obtenção de ligas cada vez mais baratas. Nesse contexto, surgem os aços inoxidáveis lean duplex (AILD), os quais apresentam menores teores de elementos de liga de elevado custo, como níquel e molibdênio. Entretanto, os AID, incluído os AILD, apresentam inferior soldabilidade em relação aos aços inoxidáveis austeníticos, devido a dificuldade de se manter suficientes proporções de austenita na zona termicamente afetada (ZTA) sem que haja precipitação de fases intermetálicas deletérias na microestrutura. Nesse sentido, esse trabalho teve como objetivo a avaliação da soldagem multipasse de chapas espessas de 22 mm da liga inoxidável lean duplex UNS S 32304. Inicialmente foi realizada a caracterização do metal de base (MB) e dos consumíveis de soldagem usados. Em seguida, com objetivo de se determinar a energia de soldagem a serusada na etapa posterior, foi realizada uma avaliação microestrutural de corpos prova confeccionados a partir de dois cordões parcialmente sobrepostos sobre chapa, soldados através do processo GTAW autógeno com quatro energias de soldagem (HI) distintas: 1, 0, 1, 5, 2, 0 e 2, 5 kJ. mm- 1. Por ultimo, foram soldadas seis corpos de provas através dos processos de soldagem SMAW, GMAW e FCAW e consumíveis com dois tipos de composição química, 2209 (22 %Cr, 9 %Ni e 3 %Mo) e 2307 (23 %Cr e 7 %Ni). Para esses, determinou-se à produtividade através da aquisição do tempo de arco aberto e a integridade da junta soldada através do ensaios por raios-X. Após isso, foram extraídos corpos de prova para ensaios de tração, dobramento, Charpy, macrografia, microdureza, microscopia óptica e MEV com EDS. Tanto o metal de base quanto os consumíveis de soldagem apresentaram composição química e propriedades mecânicas dentro das faixas especificadas pela normas relativas a cada material. A zona fundida (ZF) dos CPs obtidos por GTAW apresentaram grãos de ferrita grosseiros e baixo teor de austenita, enquanto a ZTA teve elevada ferritização, porém em menor intensidade que a ZF, sendo a HI de 2, 0 kJ. mm- 1 escolhida por sua relativa maior proporção de austenita. Foram encontradas descontinuidades consideradas aceitáveis segundo ASME B 31. 3 em alguns dos experimentos, porém isso não influenciou negativamente osresultados mecânicos, os quais se apresentaram acima do metal de base e especificado por normas de fabricação desses materiais. Já a análise metalográfica mostrou a microestrutura da 15 ZF de todos os testes com proporção de austenita acima de 48 %, ao contrário do obtido na zona termicamente afetada, em que se obteve resultados a partir de 17 % de austenita. Ainda verificou-se maiores teores de inclusões não metálicas, identificadas por EDS como óxidos de Mn, Si, Ti e Al, nos processos geradores de escória (SMAW e FCAW) quando comparado ao processo GMAW. Dessa maneira, conclui-se que foi possível obter soldas integras e atendendo aos requerimentos mecânicos em todos os experimentos, contudo observou-se baixas proporções de austenita na ZTA, o que sugere o aumento da energia de soldagem em trabalhos futuros. The {{duplex stainless}} steels (DSS) {{have been presented}} as an excellent alternative for applications where high corrosion resistance and high mechanical strength are required. In parallel, it has been seen a rush of the DSSs manufacturers to obtain ever cheaper alloys. In this context, the lean duplex stainless steels (LDSS) come up {{with lower levels of}} high cost alloying elements, such as nickel and molybdenum. However, the DSS, including the LDSS, has worse weldability in comparison with the austenitic stainless steels, due to the difficulty in maintaining sufficient proportions of austenite in the heat affected zone (HAZ) in parallelwith no precipitation of deleterious intermetallic phases in the microstructure. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the multipass welding of 22 mm thick plates of the lean duplex stainless steel alloy UNS S 32304. Initially, it was carried out the characterization of the base metal andwelding consumables. Then, {{in order to determine the}} heat input to be applied in later stage, specimens were welded by bead on plate technique using autogenous GTAW process with four different heat input (HI) : 1. 0; 1. 5; 2. 0; 2. 5 kJ. mm- 1. Lastly, six specimens were weldedthrough the SMAW, GMAW and FCAW processes applying consumables of two different chemical composition, 2209 (22 % Cr, 9 % Ni and 3 % Mo) and 2307 (23 % Cr and 7 % Ni). It was determined the productivity by acquiring the open arc time, while the soundness was evaluated through the x-ray tests. After that, it was extracted specimens for tensile, bending. Charpy, <b>macrography,</b> microhardness, optical microscopy and SEM with EDS tests. Both the base metal and welding consumables have presented chemical composition and mechanical properties within the ranges specified by the standards for each material. The GTAW weldmetal (WM) presented coarse ferrite grains and low level of austenite, while the HAZ showed high ferritization, but at a lower intensity than the WM. The HI of 2. 0 kJ. mm- 1 has been chosen by its relatively higher proportion of austenite. Acceptable discontinuities according ASME B 31. 1 were found in some of the experiments, but it did not influence the mechanical results, which have presented above the base metal and standards. The metallographic analysis showed the austenite proportion above 48 % in the WM microstructure, while it was obtained in some cases 17 % of austenite in the heat affected zone. The welding process that produces slag (SMAW and FCAW) have presented higher levels of non-metallic inclusions, identified by EDS as oxides of Mn, Si, Ti and Al. So, it was possible to obtain sound welds that met the mechanical requirements in all experiments, however, all experiments had lowproportions of austenite in the HAZ, which suggests increasing the heat input in future work...|$|E
