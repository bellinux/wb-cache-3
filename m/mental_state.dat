40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{defends the}} explanatory value of unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>states.</b> Unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> are a subject’s information-bearing states with certain properties. These states possess features {{that make them}} <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> but do not possess the properties that make them conscious <b>mental</b> <b>states.</b> The claim is that some human behaviors, driven by perceptual and cognitive <b>mental</b> <b>states,</b> are best explained by employing unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> {{of one kind or}} another. The general idea is that the explanatory value of unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> equals the number of a subject’s behaviors valuably explained by their <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> minus the number of the subject’s behaviors that are valuably explained by their conscious <b>mental</b> <b>states.</b> Support for the claim that some human behaviors are best explained by employing unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> comes in three forms. First, there is a coherent information-processing model for <b>mental</b> <b>states.</b> This model can account for certain of a subject’s perceptually and cognitively driven behaviors, in part or whole, with unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>states.</b> Second, independent criteria regarding human subject’s conscious <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> support explanations that use unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>states.</b> Finally, unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> are supported by the success of models that employ such states found in modern psychological and neurological explanations of some human behaviors. This dissertation will also support the idea that the set of unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> in human subjects are moderately unified, made of various kinds, and are numerous. Unconscious <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> in empirical psychology and neuroscience are often called a subject’s “cognitive unconscious” (Kihlstrom 1987). The explanatory value of the “cognitive unconscious” has been recently attacked, for example by Searle (1990), as well as others. This dissertation defends the explanatory value of the cognitive unconscious against these attacks...|$|R

5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of <b>mental</b> <b>state</b> of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms.

40|$|Scientists have {{traditionally}} assumed that {{different kinds of}} <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> (e. g., fear, disgust, love, memory, planning, concentration, etc.) correspond to different psychological faculties that have domain-specific correlates in the brain. Yet, growing evidence points to the constructionist hypothesis that <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> emerge from the combination of domain-general psychological processes that map to large-scale distributed brain networks. In this paper, we report a novel study testing a constructionist model of the mind in which participants generated three kinds of <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> (emotions, body feelings, or thoughts) while we measured activity within large-scale distributed brain networks using fMRI. We examined the similarity and differences {{in the pattern of}} network activity across these three classes of <b>mental</b> <b>states.</b> Consistent with a constructionist hypothesis, a combination of large-scale distributed networks contributed to emotions, thoughts, and body feelings, although these <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> differed in the relative contribution of those networks.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> can be {{conveyed by}} metaphorical expressions in texts {{of a personal}} nature. Figurative language is understood {{to play an important}} role in the expression of such complex nuanced phenomena (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999; Kövecses, 2000; Gibbs, Leggit & Turner, 2002). This study focuses on two main groups of metaphors, linked to <b>mental</b> <b>states,</b> in the Smith Journal of “The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath”. ‘Mental state’ here refers to various aspects of cognitive functioning, but with a focus on <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> of affect — <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> that are intrinsically valenced (Ortony & Turner, 1990). Specifically, this paper focuses on metaphors of MOTION and SPLIT SELF. Both manual intensive analyses and automated corpus methodologies are employed in the investigation: Wmatrix (Rayson, 2009) is used to explore relevant expressions, in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of metaphor groups. Relevant expressions are identified by an in-depth manual analysis of sample journal entries. The MIP procedure (Pragglejaz, 2007) is used for metaphor identification, and interpretations draw on research in psychology. Metaphors of <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> are analyzed in terms of their implications for conveying various aspects of <b>mental</b> <b>states,</b> such as valence and interpretations draw on research in psychology.

30|$|Secondly, {{there is}} a way to {{describe}} the justification of beliefs through <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> because j-factors are <b>mental</b> <b>states.</b> This approach is the mentalist internalism [2].

But this position towards justification is not unchallenged [13].|$|R

Experimental results yield an average recognition rate of 87. 4 % for 6 <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> groups: agreement, concentrating, disagreement, interested, thinking and unsure.

Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Putnam {{abandoned}} his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind. His change of mind was {{primarily due to}} the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions {{with respect to the}} externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language). He also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same <b>mental</b> <b>state</b> could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.|$|E
40|$|In {{studying}} folk psychology, {{cognitive and}} developmental psychologists have mainly {{focused on how}} people conceive of non-experiential states such as beliefs and desires. As a result, we {{know very little about}} how non-philosophers (or the folk) understand the <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> that philosophers typically classify as being phenomenally conscious. In particular, it is not known whether the folk even tend to classify <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> in terms of their being or not being phenomenally conscious in the first place. Things have changed dramatically in the last few years, however, with a flurry of ground-breaking research by psychologists and experimental philosophers. In this article I will review this work, carefully distinguishing between two questions: First, are the ascriptions that the folk make with regard to the <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> that philosophers classify as phenomenally conscious related to their decisions about whether morally right or wrong action has been done to an entity? Second, do the folk tend to classify <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> in the way that philosophers do, distinguishing between <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> that are phenomenally conscious and <b>mental</b> <b>states</b> that are not phenomenally conscious...|$|R

5|$|Lambert's {{essay about}} metaphysics, Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"), is another autobiographical reference. Balzac wrote the essay {{himself as a}} boy, and – as in the novel – it was confiscated by an angry teacher. Lambert's genius and {{philosophical}} erudition are reflections of Balzac's self-conception. Similarly, some critics and biographers have suggested that Lambert's madness reflects (consciously or not) Balzac's own unsteady <b>mental</b> <b>state.</b> His plans to run for parliament and other non-literary ambitions led observers {{at the time to}} suspect his sanity.|$|E
5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a <b>mental</b> <b>state</b> that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E

Sexuality and the repression of desire are dominant motifs, similar to Balu Mahendra's previous film Moodu Pani (1980). The film also explores the possibility of unresolved sexual tension between the protagonists. Critic K.
