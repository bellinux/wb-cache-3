At 1:50 pm (IST), as {{he sat on a}} sofa, he asked a member of his family to slow the fan down and immediately collapsed. His personal physician Ramana Rao was called for, who rushed within three minutes, and performed external cardiac massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Rajkumar was then taken to MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital and was administered intracardiac injections. Efforts to revive him failed and was pronounced dead at 2:05 pm (IST).|$|E
2500|$|In July 2004, Zhao was {{embroiled in}} further {{controversy}} when a pregnant lady named Zou Xue accused Zhao of assaulting {{her in a}} restaurant over a business dispute. Zhao and Zou had been business partners, and opened a bar together in Beijing. Zou claimed that Zhao had instructed her chauffeur to hit Zou after a business dispute. Zou filed a lawsuit demanding compensation {{as well as a}} public apology. Zhao denied hitting Zou, but the public were not on Zhao's side. However, the incident quickly had a dramatic twist when the media investigated that Zou's <b>medical</b> <b>check-up</b> report was fake, and was produced by a hospital managed by her family members. The court then rejected Zou's lawsuit against Zhao. In addition, people found that Zou was the L'Offciel editor who stepped down due to the [...] "Japanese flag" [...] incident. The public was more convinced that the [...] "Japanese flag" [...] incident was a set-up and Zou was somehow involved. Zhao regained the public's support.|$|E

[...] "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" [...] is also extended to add time for Max's <b>medical</b> <b>check-up</b> that is shown and for the dialogue about Max eating cotton balls and other theories {{to get out of}} the draft. The extended music is used as underscoring for dialogue after [...] "Dear Prudence", [...] "Something", and [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps".

Darling", [...] "Across the Universe", and [...] "Helter Skelter".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor is}} also, that, for example {{decision-makers}} in government offices and upper echelons {{are not allowed}} to show weaknesses or signs of disease etc., because this would immediately lead to doubts of the ability for further responsibility. Only 20% of managers (e.g. in Germany) do sports regularly and also only 2% keep regularly preventive <b>medical</b> <b>check-up.</b> In such a position other priorities seem to be set and the time is lacking for regular sports. Frightening is that the job has such a high priority, that people waive screening as a sign of weakness. In contrast to that, the burnout syndrome seems to be gaining popularity. There seems nothing to be ashamed to show weaknesses, but quite the opposite: The burnout is part of a successful career like a home for the role model family. Besides that the statement which describes the burnout as a [...] "socially recognized precious version of the depression and despair that lets also at the moment of failure the self-image intact" [...] fits and therefore concludes [...] "Only losers become depressed, burnout against it is a diagnosis for winners, more precisely, for former winners.".|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} {{returned to}} Jackson's Neverland ranch {{and a day}} later their mother joined them after resuming preparations {{for the trip to}} Brazil—although, she would later testify, she did not really want to go. From February 25 to March 2 the family, along with some of Jackson's staff, stayed in a hotel in Calabasas, California, and went shopping in preparation for the trip to Brazil. After that, the family stayed at Neverland again. On March 10, the mother and the accuser drove from Neverland to Kaiser Permanente Hospital with a urine sample of the accuser, Gavin, for a scheduled <b>medical</b> <b>check-up.</b> On the way to the hospital, Janet spilled the urine sample on the passenger-side floor of the car. [...] When asked by a Jackson employee what happened, Janet said that she spilled the urine accidentally. [...] At the hospital, Gavin received numerous tests for his kidney, including a dye test. [...] The urine sample, however, was insufficient for one of the tests, and it came back inconclusive. Afterward, the accuser returned to Neverland, while the mother went to stay with her fiance. It would be the boys' last stay at the Neverland ranch. Apparently, the accuser was very angry with his mother that she would not allow him to return.|$|E
