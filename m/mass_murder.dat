5|$|Several Einsatzgruppen leaders, {{including}} Ohlendorf, claimed at {{the trial}} to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews. To date no evidence {{has been found that}} such an order was ever issued. German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able to convict the Einsatzgruppen leaders as accomplices to <b>mass</b> <b>murder.</b> However, if it could be established that the Einsatzgruppen had committed <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> without orders, then they could have been convicted as perpetrators of <b>mass</b> <b>murder,</b> and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.|$|E
5|$|Sonderbehandlung is a German noun meaning special {{treatment}} in English. While it {{can refer to}} any sort of preferential treatment, it is known primarily as a euphemism for <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> used by Nazi functionaries and the SS, who commonly used the abbreviation S.B. in documentation. It first came to prominence during Action T4, where SS doctors killed mentally ill and disabled patients between 1939 and 1941, {{and was one of}} a number of nonspecific words the Nazis used to document <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> and genocide. Another notable example was Sonderbehandlung 14f13.|$|E

5|$|The Westroads Mall {{shooting}} was a mass shooting that occurred on December 5, 2007, at a Von Maur department store in Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska. The gunman, nineteen-year-old Robert A.

It was the deadliest <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> in Nebraska since the rampage of Charles Starkweather in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The killings {{were the}} first act of <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> {{committed}} by the Ustaše upon coming to power. Estimates {{of the number of}} victims vary.

5|$|While {{the term}} Holocaust {{generally}} {{refers to the}} systematic <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> of the Jewish people in Nazi-occupied Europe, the Nazis also murdered {{a large number of}} non-Jewish people who were considered subhuman (Untermenschen) or undesirable. Some victims belonged to several categories targeted for extermination, e.g. an assimilated Jew {{who was a member of}} a communist party or someone who identified as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Pechersky {{returned}} to Rostov-on-Don, where he lived before the war, and started working as administrator in an Operetta theater. The <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> of Jews at the Sobibor death camp {{became part of the}} charges against leading Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials.

5|$|Poland, {{home of the}} world's largest Jewish {{community}} {{before the}} war, lost 3,300,000 (90percent) of its Jewish population. Although the Germans rigorously imposed {{the death penalty for}} hiding Jews, some Poles hid Jews (saving their lives) despite the risk to themselves and their families. Although reports of the Holocaust had reached Western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> of Jews in Poland was low at the time; the first references in The New York Times, in 1942, were unconfirmed reports rather than front-page news.|$|E

5|$|The Gudovac {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} killing of around 190 Bjelovar Serbs by the Croatian nationalist Ustaše movement on 28 April 1941, during World War II. The massacre occurred {{shortly after the}} German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia {{and the establishment of}} the Ustaše-led Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). It was the first act of <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> committed by the Ustaše upon coming to power, and presaged a wider Ustaše-perpetrated campaign of genocide against Serbs in the NDH that lasted {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The Watch has grossed $35,353,000 in North America and $32,914,862 {{in other}} territories for a {{worldwide}} total of $68,267,862 against {{a budget of}} $68 million. In the week before release, pre-release tracking showed that up to 25 percent of North American audiences were reluctant to visit cinemas following the <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> in a Colorado cinema the previous week. This, plus competition from the simultaneous launch of the 2012 Summer Olympics, would negatively impact ticket sales for The Watch. Tracking showed that the film could earn $13–15million during its opening weekend.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the German Army invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. The LSSAH and Das Reich were {{attached}} to separate army Panzer corps. Fritz Klingenberg, a company commander in the Das Reich, led his men across Yugoslavia to the capital, Belgrade, where a small group in the vanguard accepted the surrender of the city on 13 April. A few days later Yugoslavia surrendered. SS police units immediately began taking hostages and carrying out reprisals, a practice that became common. In some cases, {{they were joined by}} the Wehrmacht. Similar to Poland, the war policies of the Nazis in the Balkans resulted in brutal occupation and racist <b>mass</b> <b>murder.</b> Serbia became the second country (after Estonia) declared Judenfrei (free of Jews).|$|E

5|$|In July 1995, {{forces of}} the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) {{captured}} the town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, which had been cut off and surrounded {{despite the presence of}} soldiers from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Thousands of refugees had crowded into the town to escape the Serb advance. Following the Serb takeover of Srebrenica, an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically massacred by Serb forces between 11–15 July and another 25,000–30,000 were subjected to ethnic cleansing. It was the largest act of <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> in Europe since World War II.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985, the largest <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> in Canadian history; the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989, a university shooting targeting female students; and the Oka Crisis of 1990, {{the first of a}} number of violent confrontations between the government and indigenous groups. Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a US-led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s, including the UNPROFOR mission in the former Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Rudolf Vrba (11 September 1924– 27 March 2006) was a Slovak-Jewish {{biochemist}} who, as {{a teenager}} in 1942, was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland. He became known for having escaped from the camp in April 1944, {{at the height of the}} Holocaust, and for co-writing a detailed report about the <b>mass</b> <b>murder</b> that was taking place there. Distribution of the report is credited with having halted the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944, saving over 200,000 lives. After the war Vrba became a noted biochemist in England and Canada.|$|E
