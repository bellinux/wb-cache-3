5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Shawn Michaels versus Ric Flair in a singles match. The hype to this match began on May 26, 2003 during {{an episode of}} Raw, where Michaels challenged Flair to a singles match for later during the show, which Flair accepted. As the match {{was about to take}} place, the other General Manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the Flair versus Michaels match was to take place at Bad Blood instead of on the broadcast of Raw. Later on that episode, Flair and Michaels lost to World Champion Triple H in a Handicap match after Flair cheap shoted Michaels, enabling Triple H to finish him off with the Pedigree. The following <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> an episode of Raw, Michaels and Flair were in a promotional in-ring segment, where they both discussed who was the better wrestler. Later during the program, Michaels, along with Kevin Nash and The Hurricane defeated Evolution. The feud between Flair and Michaels enhanced on the June 9, 2003 episode of Raw. During the show, Flair and Michaels managed Randy Orton and The Hurricane, respectively; after Orton defeated The Hurricane, Flair and Michaels were scripted to brawl until the program went into a commercial break.|$|E

25|$|The two crews {{continued}} transfer operations, and Finke and Pettit {{worked together}} to reconfigure the Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) to try to dampen any vibration that may be contributing to the unit's shutting down prematurely. The unit has continued to operate sporadically, shutting itself down after {{two to three hours}} of operations, and the engineers on the ground are still evaluating the possible causes and solutions. Managers on the ground would make a decision <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> whether to extend Endeavours mission by one docked day, to help with the troubleshooting of the Water Recovery System (WRS). The Endeavour crew had several hours of off-duty time, and participated in media interviews.|$|E
25|$|Following The Rock's suspension, Triple H's {{feud with}} the Brothers of Destruction {{continued}} with Austin now on his side. On the edition of April 5, 2001 of SmackDown!, Triple H challenged Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho for his title and after interference from Commissioner William Regal {{and his wife}} Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley defeated Jericho to win his third Intercontinental Championship. The feud with Undertaker and Kane was temporarily put on hold after Triple H and Austin entered a brief rivalry with the Hardy Boyz, which resulted in Jeff Hardy beating Triple H for the Intercontinental Championship the following week and Triple H promptly regaining the title the next <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> Raw.|$|E

25|$|The 2005 World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) draft lottery, {{the third}} WWE draft, {{took place over}} a three-week period in June. There were ten draft picks and an eleven-person trade {{conducted}} between the promotion's two brands: Raw and SmackDown!, where twenty-two superstars were drafted and traded overall. The draft took place on WWE's two-hour television programs, Raw, which aired on Spike TV, and SmackDown!, which aired on UPN. Post-draft trades were announced on WWE's official website, WWE.com. The draft picks were announced each <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> Raw and each Thursday on SmackDown! from June 6 to June 30. Each draftee was drafted at random. Every Superstar and Diva from Raw and SmackDown! was eligible to be drafted, including announcers, commentators, and general managers.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{entered into}} further {{negotiations}} with the Lombard League cities and with Pope Celestine III on his Imperial coronation, and ceded Tusculum to the Pope. At Easter <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> 15 April 1191, in Rome, Henry and his consort Constance were crowned Emperor and Empress by Celestine. The crown of Sicily, however, was harder to gain, as the Sicilian nobility had chosen Count Tancred of Lecce as their king. Henry began his work campaigning in Apulia and besieging Naples, but he encountered resistance when Tancred's liensman Margaritus of Brindisi came to the city's defence, harassed Henry's Pisan navy, and nearly destroyed the later arriving Genoese contingent. Moreover, the Imperial army had been heavily hit by an epidemic, and Henry ultimately had to abandon the siege. Constance, who {{was left in the}} palace of Salerno as a sign that he would soon return, was betrayed and handed over to Tancred.|$|E
25|$|TNT did allow a final Nitro show to {{air from}} Panama City Beach, Florida {{which had been}} {{scheduled}} for the following <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> March 26. McMahon opened the last-ever episode of WCW Monday Nitro with a simulcast with WWF Monday Night Raw, which aired from Cleveland, Ohio, with a self-praising speech. The final WCW World Heavyweight Championship match for the show and the company saw WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Booker T defeat Scott Steiner to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The main event featured Sting defeating Ric Flair with the Scorpion Deathlock as a culmination of their trademark feud, then both men embraced one another at the match's conclusion. This was a direct parallel to the very first Nitro, where Sting vs. Flair was also the main event. After the Sting/Flair match, Vince appeared on Raw to close Nitro and to declare victory over WCW. Vince's son Shane McMahon then appeared on Nitro, declaring that it was actually he who had bought WCW. This initiated a storyline in which Shane led a WCW invasion of the WWF, which lasted from March to November 2001 and {{marked the end of}} WCW.|$|E

[...] He {{took the oath}} publicly on the following <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> the East Portico of the United States Capitol. In his inaugural address, Hayes attempted to soothe the passions of the past few months, saying that [...] "he serves his party best who serves his country best". He pledged to support [...] "wise, honest, and peaceful local self-government" [...] in the South, as well as reform of the civil service and a full return to the gold standard.

500|$|In Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both {{members of}} OPEC, no {{official}} warnings had been issued due to Gonu. The storm {{was not expected}} to disrupt oil supplies from these two nations. However, oil prices rose early on June 5 because of concerns of disruptions caused by Gonu, {{as well as the}} threat of nationwide strikes in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer. Crude oil for July delivery rose $1.13, or 1.7percent, to $66.21 <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest close in 15 days. Futures reached $66.48, the highest intraday price since April 30. The contract was at $65.95 a barrel, down 26cents, in after-hours electronic trading at [...] Tuesday in Singapore. Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, said he doubted the increase could be attributed to Gonu. [...] "I don't know if you can really attribute any of the gain to the cyclone," [...] he said. [...] "It's an excuse, as opposed to a reason, for the rise in prices." ...|$|E
500|$|Although eleven {{songs were}} {{originally}} slated for the album, only ten made the final track listing. A song penned by Hanneman, entitled [...] "Final Six," [...] {{was meant for}} inclusion, with the song name originally declared as the album's title by vocalist Tom Araya to George Stroumboulopoulos of CBC's The Hour. Questioned about the album's title by Kevin and Bean of Los Angeles KROQ-FM, King replied [...] "I'm not positive it's been nailed yet. I think last week was the deadline and I'm not sure where it ended up, so I'm gonna {{have to take the}} fifth on that one. The way it was going, my vote was overlooked, soâ€¦ That's why I'm not real thrilled about it." [...] However, Araya took one weekend off for vacation during the recording of the album and required a two-hour gall bladder operation the following <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> May 5, 2006. Thus, he was unable to finish the vocals for the song in time for the album's release. King hinted [...] "Final Six" [...] might appear on a special digipack release of Christ Illusion: a release which eventually surfaced in July 2007. [...] "Final Six" [...] also appeared on the soundtrack to the film [...] the following year.|$|E

500|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} Goldberg versus Chris Jericho in a singles match. The buildup to the match began on May 12, 2003 during {{an episode of}} Raw, where a [...] "mystery assailant" [...] attempted to run Goldberg over with a vehicle, though Goldberg was able to avoid it. Later that night, Goldberg went on to defeat Christian in a Steel Cage match. The following <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> Raw, {{it was determined that}} Lance Storm was the [...] "mystery assailant". He, however, told Austin that he was only hired to run Goldberg over and that Jericho conspired the attack. On the May 26, 2003 [...] episode of Raw, Jericho held a promotional in-ring segment titled The Highlight Reel. During the segment he explained that he conspired the attack because he grew jealous towards Goldberg's success in WCW, disliking Goldberg's ego and felt that since joining the WWE, he had achieved everything he had ever wanted in his career esp. becoming the first WWE Undisputed Champion in history and all that was left was to defeat Goldberg and challenged him to a singles match at Bad Blood. Afterwards, Goldberg came down to the ring and accepted Jericho's challenge, and {{as he was about to}} perform a spear, Jericho sprayed Goldberg's eyes with pepper spray.|$|E
500|$|Shearer was {{unveiled}} {{at a press}} conference the following day by club managing director Derek Llambias. In explaining his acceptance of a managerial role at Newcastle at this time, Shearer stated that he would not have done this for any other club in this position, including his two other previous Premier League clubs. Amid persistent questioning regarding the permanency of the appointment, Llambias announced that Shearer was to be manager for the remaining eight games, and after his recovery, Joe Kinnear would return as manager {{after the end of the}} season. Shearer confirmed that the BBC had agreed to giving him an 8-week sabbatical from his Match of the Day role. Llambias also confirmed Dennis Wise had left his executive role at the club and the club had no plans to appoint a replacement, with Shearer stating that [...] "the people that have moved, were moving on anyways, that had nothing to do with me". Wise's presence had previously been speculated as being a blockage to any possible appointment of a manager. Shearer accepted the surprise offer on the <b>Monday</b> <b>on</b> the condition that he could bring in Iain Dowie as his assistant. Shearer also brought in Paul Ferris to oversee club medical, physio and dietary matters. Ferris had previously worked with Shearer in his playing days, and had been at the club for 13 years prior to an earlier departure under then manager Glenn Roeder.|$|E
