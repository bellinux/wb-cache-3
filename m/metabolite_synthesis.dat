40|$|The vast {{repertoire}} of toxic fungal secondary metabolites {{has long been}} assumed to have an evolved protective role against fungivory. It still remains elusive, however, whether fungi contain these compounds as an anti-predator adaptation. We demonstrate that loss of secondary metabolites in the soil mould Aspergillus nidulans causes, under the attack of the fungivorous springtail Folsomia candida, a disadvantage to the fungus. Springtails exhibited a distinct preference for feeding on a mutant deleted for LaeA, a global regulator of Aspergillus secondary metabolites. Consumption of the mutant yielded a reproductive advantage to the arthropod but detrimental effects on fungal biomass compared with a wild-type fungus capable of producing the entire arsenal of secondary metabolites.

Chistoserdova et al. reported that M. flagellatus’ genome closely matched some of the predictions set forth by other researchers. The genomic data conclusively indicated that M. flagellatus {{is closely related to}} members of the Methylophilaceae family. Most of the genes encoded in the M. flagellatus genome are dedicated to its methylotrophy functions (i.e.: breaking down one-carbon compounds), and these genes are present in more than one identical or non-identical copy. Chistoserdova et al. also proved that M. flagellatus is an obligate methylotroph; this is the direct consequence of an incomplete set of genes that cannot encode 3 critical enzymes (dehydrogenases) of the TCA cycle. One last notable point to mention is that the M. flagellatus’ genome does not code for any secondary <b>metabolite</b> <b>synthesis</b> pathways such as antibiotic biosynthesis, and no known xenobiotic degradation pathways are encoded. A general self conjecture is that the absence of these self-defense mechanisms would help explain why M. flagellatus has no pathogenic qualities.|$|E

Plants possess a number of adaptive, avoidance, or acclimation mechanisms to cope with HT situations.

This organelle is delineated by two membranes whose synthesis requires an extensive exchange of phospholipids with other cellular organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vacuolar membranes in yeast. These transfers of phospholipids are thought to occur by a non-vesicular pathway at contact sites between two closely apposed membranes. In plants, {{little is known about the}} biogenesis of mitochondrial membranes. Contact sites between ER and mitochondria are suspected to play a similar role in phospholipid trafficking as in yeast, but this has never been demonstrated. In contrast, it has been shown that plastids are able to transfer lipids to mitochondria during phosphate starvation. However, the proteins involved in such transfer are still unknown. Here, we identified in Arabidopsis thaliana a large lipid-enriched complex called the mitochondrial transmembrane lipoprotein (MTL) complex. The MTL complex contains proteins located in the two mitochondrial membranes and conserved in all eukaryotic cells, such as the TOM complex and AtMic 60, a component of the MICOS complex. We demonstrate that AtMic 60 contributes to the export of phosphatidylethanolamine from mitochondria and the import of galactoglycerolipids from plastids during phosphate starvation.
