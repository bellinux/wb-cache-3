Numerous experiments were conducted {{in an attempt to}} answer some of the questions arising from exposure to ionizing radiation, especially X radiation. Some of the research involved the radiosensitivity of cells and some involved animals. The effects of radium in humans was also evaluated. Other studies were performed in biology, such as the effect of photoperiodism on plant growth and the biological of beryllium...|$|R

40|$|As the {{selected}} theory of {{transfer of knowledge}} from the scientific <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> (in the sphere of physical bases of circular accelerators) to students of radiological branches the theory of curricular process was used. This theory was formulated {{in the world by}} M. Pasche, T. G. Gardner, M. Certon, M. Gayl, in the Czech and Slovak Republics by J. Průcha, J. Brockmeyerová, P. Tarábek, P. Záškodný. On the base of the curriculum process theory, in the sphere of <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> curriculum process can be defined as a sequence of transformations T 1 -T 5 variant forms of curriculum: "conceptual curriculum" as a communicable scientific system of <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> (first variant form of curriculum as transformation T 1 output from a scientific system to a communicable scientific system) "intended curriculum" as an educational system of <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> (second variant form of curriculum as transformation T 2 output from a communicable scientific system to an educational system) "project curriculum" as an instructional project of <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> (third variant form of curriculum as transformation T 3 output from an educational system to a teaching project) "implemented curriculum- 1 " as the preparedness of educator to education in <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> (fourth variant form of curriculum as the first transformation T 4 output from an educational project to implementation of teaching) "implemented curriculum- 2 " as the results of education in <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> (fifth variant form of curriculum as the second transformation T 4 output from an educational project to implementation of teaching) "attained curriculum" as applicable results of education in <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> (sixth variant form of curriculum transformation T 5 output from implementation of teaching to application of the results of teaching). In this thesis, in the sphere of physical bases of circular accelerators the transformation between the intended curriculum, project curriculum, implemented curriculum- 1 and implemented curriculum- 2 were used. These transformations were carried out by binds between educating text, experimental teaching, preparation for experimental teaching and placing of educational test to students of radiological branches to find out the results of experimental teaching in the sphere of physical bases of circular accelerators. In order to prove the hypotheses of the bachelor thesis, methods of mathematical statistics apart from methods of descriptive statistics were used: Nonparametric tests and two sample t-test. Nonparametric test was used to test the normality of knowledge acquired by experimental teaching. Two-sample t-test was used to compare the knowledge from the sphere of physical bases of circular accelerators in students of full-time and part-time study programme. The bachelor thesis was based on the verification of two hypotheses: a) an adequate educational text in the sphere of physical bases of circular accelerators can be created by application of curriculum process b) students´ knowledge in the sphere of physical bases of circular accelerators acquired on the base of worked out educational text will have normal distribution. Both of these hypotheses were confirmed by statistical processing of the results which were obtained by experimental teaching and by placing of educational test to students. Partial hypothesis was also confirmed that knowledge between full-time students and part-time students will not be statistically different on the level of statistical significance 0. 05. Based on the verified hypotheses and the survey of further results, the targets of the thesis can be considered fulfilled...|$|R

50|$|Later that year, he {{immigrated to}} the United States due to {{increasing}} antisemitic measures taking effect in Italy. His initial work in the U.S. was on bacteriophages and pioneering work {{in the study of}} <b>radiological</b> <b>physics,</b> specifically, the differences in the biological effects of X-rays and neutrons.|$|R
40|$|To {{accomplish}} the fundamental {{goal of the}} bachelor thesis was needed to create a structure of <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> model in education to radiological assistants. Creation of this model questionnaire was then used on respondents of the laic expert public. It was verified as a normal existence of knowledge at the laic public while {{the existence of the}} knowledge at expert public was Poisson?s separation. There was measured the difference between the laics? and the experts? knowledge. Essential condition for realization and description of the procedure was the analysis of radiological assistants? preparation in the Czech Republic and abroad. To reach the fundamental goal were set up three hypotheses: H 1. Theoretical division of knowledge at the laic public will be closer to normal division. H 2. Theoretical division of knowledge at the expert public will not have normal division [...] H 3. Compare of knowledge at both public with the help of parametrical tests will lead to acceptation of alternative hypothesis. The entire three hypotheses were checked and positively accepted. For their verification it was mainly used, testing non-parametrical and parametrical hypotheses. The finding that the <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> structure for <b>radiological</b> assistants complies with the <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> structure used abroad for preparation of experts like radiological technologists, diagnostic radiographers, the medical imaging technologists, the therapy radiographers or the radiation therapists, was a good solution. This discovery was primarily found out from the analysis of curriculum at universities in the USA, Great Britain and Australian universities. From this point the validity of this constructive questionnaire rose. It needs to be mentioned that this questionnaire was made in terms to prepare radiological assistants in which the <b>radiological</b> <b>physics</b> has an only supportive role...|$|R
