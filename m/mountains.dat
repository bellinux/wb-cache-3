5|$|Despite the {{extensive}} volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all its <b>mountains</b> are tectonic structures, {{and are not}} produced by volcanoes. Instead, most Ionian <b>mountains</b> form {{as the result of}} compressive stresses on the base of the lithosphere, which uplift and often tilt chunks of Io's crust through thrust faulting. The compressive stresses leading to mountain formation are the result of subsidence from the continuous burial of volcanic materials. The global distribution of <b>mountains</b> appears to be opposite that of volcanic structures; <b>mountains</b> dominate areas with fewer volcanoes and vice versa. This suggests large-scale regions in Io's lithosphere where compression (supportive of mountain formation) and extension (supportive of patera formation) dominate. Locally, however, <b>mountains</b> and paterae often abut one another, suggesting that magma often exploits faults formed during mountain formation to reach the surface.|$|E
