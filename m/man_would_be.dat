5|$|After the action, {{one of the}} English privateers quarrelled {{with one}} of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> hanged on his return to Port Royal. Morgan kept his word and the sailor was hanged. After {{dividing}} the spoils of the conquest of Puerto Principe, Morgan announced a plan to attack Porto Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main, and on one of the main routes of trade between the Spanish territories and Spain. Because {{of the value of the}} goods passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan's service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} ODIs {{have changed since}} the first Afro-Asia Cup. During the tournament, the ICC experimented with a rule called supersub – where the twelfth <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> allowed {{to take to the}} field in the place of one of the players and would be allowed to bat and/or bowl in his place, gaining a full cap in the process. As a result this meant there were {{generally}} 12 capped players per match instead of the regular 11, even though a player may have not participated in either batting or bowling in a match. For example, Muttiah Muralitharan bowled during the first innings of the first ODI, but was replaced by Mohammad Ashraful who batted in his place: both players are listed as having a full cap. These rules were not in place for the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal match or the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup.|$|E

25|$|With two others, Captain Haldane and Sergeant Brockie, Churchill {{devised a}} plan. The {{building}} {{where they were}} held {{was surrounded by a}} patrolled courtyard, and then a wall. The sentries moved about, and the conspirators determined that at a certain point the sentries would be briefly unable to see part of the wall, and a fit <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to climb it. On the first night they resolved to try to escape, the sentries changed their patrol pattern and escape was impossible. On the second an opportunity arose where two sentries stopped to talk to each other, and Churchill scaled the wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{theology}} of Ezekiel is notable for {{its contribution to}} the emerging notion of individual responsibility to God – each <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> held responsible only for his own sins. This is {{in marked contrast to}} the Deuteronomistic writers, who held that the sins of the nation would be held against all, without regard for an individual's personal guilt. Nonetheless, Ezekiel shared many ideas in common with the Deuteronomists, notably the notion that God works according to the principle of retributive justice and an ambivalence towards kingship (although the Deuteronomists reserved their scorn for individual kings rather than for the office itself). As a priest, Ezekiel praises the Zadokites over the Levites (lower level temple functionaries), whom he largely blames for the destruction and exile. He is clearly connected with the Holiness Code and its vision of a future dependent on keeping the Laws of God and maintaining ritual purity. Notably, Ezekiel blames the Babylonian exile not on the people's failure to keep the Law, but on their worship of gods other than Yahweh and their injustice: these, says Ezekiel in chapters 8–11, are the reasons God's Shekhinah left his city and his people.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from slaves {{is rarely}} viable {{in a court}} of law. As slaves are {{regarded}} as inferior in Islamic law, death {{at the hands of a}} free man does not require that the latter be killed in retaliation. The killer must pay the slave's master compensation equivalent to the slave's value, as opposed to blood-money. At the same time, slaves themselves possess a lessened responsibility for their actions, and receive half the penalty required upon a free man. For example: where a free <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> subject to a hundred lashes due to pre-marital relations, a slave would be subject to only fifty. Slaves are allowed to marry only with the owner's consent. Jurists differ over how many wives a slave may possess, with the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools allowing them two, and the Maliki school allowing four. Slaves are not permitted to possess or inherit property, or conduct independent business, and may conduct financial dealings only as a representative of the master. Offices of authority are generally not permitted for slaves, though a slave may act as the leader (Imam) in the congregational prayers, and he may also act as a subordinate officer in the governmental department of revenue. Masters may sell, bequeath, give away, pledge, hire out or compel them to earn money.|$|E

At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of… colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.|$|E
500|$|The gun-type and implosion-type {{designs were}} codenamed [...] "Thin Man" [...] and [...] "Fat Man" [...] respectively. These code names {{were created by}} Robert Serber, {{a former student of}} Oppenheimer's who worked on the Manhattan Project. He chose them based on their design shapes; the Thin <b>Man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a very long device, and the name came from the Dashiell Hammett detective novel The Thin Man and series of movies by the same name; the Fat <b>Man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> round and fat and was named after Sydney Greenstreet's {{character}} in The Maltese Falcon. Little Boy would come last, as a variation of Thin Man. The use of the term [...] "little boy" [...] for the uranium-235 gun-type device is not known to have had any connection to George L. Harrison's use of the same term on the morning of July 18, 1945, in his report to President Harry Truman, while he attended the Potsdam Conference, concerning the success of the Trinity test two days earlier.|$|E

[...] After around fifteen minutes of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, and Channell sentenced Williams to death.|$|E

[...] The guards beat inmates for the slightest provocation, and one particularly sadistic guard shoved prisoners down the stairs.

[...] Louise was less than happy with the arrangement, at least at first, stating [...] "Just to see the <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the worst form of torture". [...] Her great-aunt had been executed in France, while Napoleon had fought numerous campaigns against Austria all throughout his military career.

500|$|The wrecked Pargust {{was taken}} in tow by HMS Crocus, [...] and HMS Zinnia and reached Queenstown barely afloat nearly two days later. The port's admiral congratulated the crew {{personally}} on their arrival. As before, the crew were awarded £1,000 prize money and several awards were promised. Unusually, the Admiralty were unable to decide who among the ship's crew should receive the Victoria Cross as all were deemed to {{have participated in the}} action with equal valour. It was thus decided for the first time, under article 13 of the Victoria Cross's royal warrant, that one officer and one enlisted <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> granted the award following a ballot by the ship's company. After the vote, from which Campbell abstained, the Victoria Crosses were awarded to Stuart and William Williams. Fourteen other crew members were awarded medals, including DSOs for Campbell and Hereford. In addition, every sailor had his participation in the action and subsequent ballot noted on his service records.|$|E

She also supported him through his Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, and enlisting his support in illegally proving a patient's death through negligence. In the show's tenth series, Maddy also formed a fast respect for the new head of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit, Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow). Pow ruled out a romance between the two characters, however, stating: [...] "They're protective of each other, but they're more like brother and sister than anything else. I don't think he's ready for the relationship merry-go-round at Holby just yet". He added that: [...] "Any <b>man</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a fool to turn down Maddy, but Linden wants his wife back". Similarly, Lewington has assessed that neither Sam nor Linden are Maddy's ideal man, and instead she is [...] "waiting for a new hunk!" ...|$|E
