40|$|Scatter {{hoarding}} {{birds are}} known for their accurate spatial memory. In a previous experiment, we tested the retrieval accuracy in <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> in a typical laboratory set-up for this species. We also tested the performance of humans in this experimental set-up. Somewhat unexpectedly, humans performed much better than <b>marsh</b> <b>tits.</b> In the first five attempts, humans relocated almost 90 % of the caches they had hidden 5 h earlier. <b>Marsh</b> <b>tits</b> only relocated 25 % in the first five attempts and just above 40 % in the first ten attempts. Typically, in this type of experiment, the birds will be caching and retrieving many times in the same sites in the same experimental room. This {{is very different from the}} conditions in nature where hoarding parids only cache once in a caching site. Hence, it is possible that memories from previous sessions will disturb the formation of new memories. If there is such proactive interference, the prediction is that success should decay over sessions. Here, we have designed an experiment to investigate whether there is such memory interference in this type of experiment. We allowed <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> and humans to cache and retrieve in three repeated sessions without prior experience of the arena. The performance did not change over sessions, and on average, <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> correctly visited around 25 % of the caches in the first five attempts. The corresponding success in humans was constant across sessions, and it was around 90 % on average. We conclude that the somewhat poor performance of the <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> did not depend on proactive memory interference. We also discuss other possible reasons for why <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> in general do not perform better in laboratory experiments...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Marsh</b> <b>tits</b> breed {{mostly in}} lowland areas, but can reach altitudes {{of up to}} 1,300 m. They prefer large areas of moist, broadleaved woodland, often oak or beech, though they can occupy wet alder woodland, {{riverside}} trees, parks and gardens or orchards. A study at Monks Wood, Cambridgeshire, England, found that <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> required mature trees with a shrub layer below the canopy, but that they avoided parts of the wood with lots of young trees.

60|$|The Species of Tits as Illustrating Areas of Distribution.--In our own {{hemisphere}} {{the overlapping}} of allied species may be well {{illustrated by the}} various kinds of titmice, constituting the genus Parus, several of which are among our best known English birds. The great titmouse (Parus major) has the widest range of all, extending from the Arctic circle to Algeria, Palestine, and Persia, and from Ireland right across Siberia to the Ochotsk sea, probably following the great northern forest belt. It does not extend into China and Japan, where distinct species are found. Next in extent of range is the coal tit (Parus ater) which inhabits all Europe from the Mediterranean to about 64° N. latitude, in Asia Minor to the Lebanon and Caucasus, and across Siberia to Amoorland and Japan. The <b>marsh</b> <b>tit</b> (Parus palustris) inhabits temperate and south Europe from 61° N. latitude in Norway to Poland and South-west Russia, and in the south from Spain to Asia Minor. Closely allied to this--of which it is probably only a variety or sub-species--is the northern <b>marsh</b> <b>tit</b> (Parus borealis), which overlaps the last in Norway and Sweden, and also in South Russia and the Alps, but extends further north into Lapland and North Russia, and thence probably in a south-easterly direction across Central Asia to North China. Yet another closely-allied species (Parus camtschatkensis) ranges from North-eastern Russia across Northern Siberia to Lake Baikal and to Hakodadi in Japan, thus overlapping Parus borealis in the {20} western portion of its area. Our little favourite, the blue tit (Parus coeruleus) ranges over all Europe from the Arctic circle to the Mediterranean, and on to Asia Minor and Persia, but {{does not seem to}} pass beyond the Ural mountains. Its lovely eastern ally the azure tit (Parus cyaneus) overlaps the range of P. coeruleus in Western Europe as far as St. Petersburg and Austria, rarely straggling to Denmark, while it stretches all across Central Asia between the latitudes 35° and 56° N. as far as the Amoor valley. Besides these wide-ranging species there are several others which are more restricted. Parus teneriffæ, a beautiful dark blue form of our blue tit, inhabits North-west Africa and the Canaries; Parus ledouci, closely allied to our coal tit, is found only in Algeria; Parus lugubris, allied to the <b>marsh</b> <b>tit,</b> is confined to South-east Europe and Asia Minor, from Hungary and South Russia to Palestine; and Parus cinctus, another allied form, is confined to the extreme north in Lapland, Finland, and perhaps Northern Russia and Siberia. Another beautiful little bird, the crested titmouse (Parus cristatus) is sometimes placed in a separate genus. It inhabits nearly all Central and South Europe, wherever there are pine forests, from 64° N. latitude to Austria and North Italy, and in the west to Spain and Gibraltar, while in the east it does not pass the Urals and the Caucasus range. Its nearest allies are in the high Himalayas.|$|E

60|$|One of {{the curious}} {{results of the}} general action of this {{principle}} in nature is, that the most closely allied species--those whose differences though often real and important are hardly perceptible to any one but a naturalist--are usually {{not found in the}} same but in widely separated countries. Thus, the nearest allies to our European golden plover are found in North America and East Asia; the nearest ally of our European jay is found in Japan, although there are several other species of jays in Western Asia and North Africa; and though we have several species of titmice in England they are not very closely allied to each other. The form most akin to our blue tit is the azure tit of Central Asia (Parus azureus); the Parus ledouci of Algeria is very near our coal tit, and the Parus lugubris of South-Eastern Europe and Asia Minor is nearest to our <b>marsh</b> <b>tit.</b> So, our four species of wild pigeons--the ring-dove, stock-dove, rock-pigeon, and turtle-dove--are not closely allied to each other, but each of them belongs, according to some ornithologists, to a separate genus or subgenus, and has its nearest relatives in distant parts of Asia and Africa. In mammalia the same thing occurs. Each mountain region of Europe and Asia has usually its own species of wild sheep and goat, and sometimes of antelope and deer; so that in each region there is found the greatest diversity in this class of animals, while the closest allies inhabit quite distinct and often distant areas. In plants we find the same phenomenon prevalent. Distinct species of columbine are found in Central Europe (Aguilegia vulgaris), in Eastern Europe, and Siberia (A. glandulosa), in the Alps (A. Alpina), in the Pyrenees (A. pyrenaiea), in the Greek mountains (A. ottonis), and in Corsica (A. Bernardi), but rarely are two species found in the same area. So, each part of the world has its own peculiar forms of pines, firs, and cedars, but the closely allied species or varieties are in almost every case inhabitants of distinct areas. Examples are the deodar of the Himalayas, the cedar of Lebanon, and that of North Africa, all very closely allied but confined to distinct areas; and the numerous closely allied species of true pine (genus Pinus), which almost always inhabit different countries or occupy different stations. We will now consider some other modes in which natural selection will act, to adapt organisms to changed conditions.|$|E

Aims: To investigate winter habitat selection by <b>Marsh</b> <b>Tits</b> in a British wood, testing for preferences in tree species and woodland structure. Methods: Thirteen <b>Marsh</b> <b>Tits</b> were radio-tracked during the winter, and home-ranges were derived. Lidar and hyperspectral data {{were used to}} compare the vegetation structure and tree species composition of entire home-ranges and the core areas of intensive use within. Instantaneous sampling observations provided further information for tree species utilization. Results: The mean home-range was very large (39 ha, n= 13). There {{were no significant differences in}} mean tree height, canopy closure, understorey height, or shrub volume between full home-ranges and the core areas of use. Core areas contained a significantly greater proportion of English Oak relative to availability in the full home-ranges. Instantaneous sampling confirmed that English Oak was used significantly more than other trees. Conclusion: Selection for English Oak during winter contrasted with previous studies of breeding territories, indicating that habitat usage varies seasonally and demonstrating the need for habitat selection studies throughout the year.

40|$|Energetic {{reserves}} of <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> (Parus palustris) : food and fat storage {{in response to}} variable food supply During the winter, small birds face the threat of starvation {{during the day and}} overnight. The threat of starvation can be reduced by maintaining higher energetic reserves, either as internal fat stores or as external hoards. I present here empirical data concerning the management of energetic reserves in response to unpredictability in foraging success. Predictions of a model were tested using <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> (Parus palustris) experiencing conditions of low and high temporal variation in food supply. Under the high-variation treatment, birds increased external hoards but not internal fat reserves. In addition, birds decreased their mean hoard-recovery interval compared to conditions in which food was predictable. Detailed examination of body weight throughout the day indicates that <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> delayed the accumulation of overnight fat reserves until relatively late in the day. Overall, these results support the theory that fat reserves are costly to acquire and maintain and suggest that <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> actively manage both internal and external energetic reserves within and among days.

50|$|A {{measure of}} the {{difficulty}} in identification is given by the fact that, in the UK, the willow tit was not identified as distinct from <b>marsh</b> <b>tit</b> until 1897.

50|$|Globally, the <b>marsh</b> <b>tit</b> is {{classified}} as Least Concern, although {{there is evidence of}} a decline in numbers (in the UK, numbers have dropped by more than 50% since the 1970s, for example). It can be found throughout temperate Europe and northern Asia and, despite its name, it occurs in a range of habitats including dry woodland. The <b>marsh</b> <b>tit</b> is omnivorous; its food includes caterpillars, spiders and seeds. It nests in tree holes, choosing existing hollows to enlarge, rather than excavating its own. A clutch of 5-9 eggs is laid.|$|E

50|$|<b>Marsh</b> <b>tits</b> {{collect and}} store {{large numbers of}} seeds. For a study in Norway, birds were watched for two hours 15 minutes. They ate 43 and cached 83 seeds per hour. In Sweden, storing food is most {{frequent}} between September and late February, with the peak in this behaviour occurring from September to October. Hiding places for the seeds include on and in the ground, in leaf litter, in tree stumps, and under moss and lichen in trees. The hidden seeds are prone to being stolen, by other <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> or other species, so birds often fly from one site to another before deciding on a hiding place. They tend to retrieve the oldest items first, and memorise their location rather than searching randomly or checking systematically. The <b>marsh</b> <b>tit's</b> hippocampus is 31% bigger {{than that of the}} great tit, despite the great tit's larger overall size and larger forebrain; the relative volume of this part of the brain is greater in birds that cache food.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} sedentary, making short post-breeding {{movements}} {{in most of}} its range, but in northern Europe some move southward in winter. However, <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> seem not to perform the occasional irruptions that {{other members of the}} tit family do. Most <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> stay in their breeding territories year-round; presumably this is related to their food-storing strategy.

40|$|Confident {{separation}} of <b>Marsh</b> <b>Tits</b> and Willow Tits remains {{a challenge in}} Britain due to the similar appearance of the local races of both species. Several criteria are available to assist the identification of birds in the hand, but none is completely diagnostic and most are invalid for young juvenile birds. Due to the continued decline in abundance of both species, however, {{it is becoming increasingly}} difficult to trial new identification criteria in the field, as very few ringers are catching sufficient numbers of either species. This paper describes the results of an online survey that was used to test a proposed new identification feature for separating the two species, based on differences in the pattern of colour contrast on the greater covert feathers. The online survey was effective in recruiting a sufficient sample of ringers of varying experience, who were asked to identify images of <b>Marsh</b> <b>Tits</b> or Willow Tits based only on features of the greater coverts that were demonstrated using training images. On average, each ringer correctly identified 82 % of the 18 images, and each image was correctly identified by an average 84 % of the 140 ringers. The pattern of the greater coverts is therefore recommended as an additional, complementary criterion for separating <b>Marsh</b> <b>Tits</b> from Willow Tits. Online surveys are also recommended as an efficient platform for the trialling of identification features among the ringing community...|$|R
40|$|Divergent diet menus {{could cause}} {{sympatric}} divergence of risk sensitivity; however, evidence {{is not yet}} available for the functional link between diet menu and risk sensitivity.

Binary choice tests, offering rewards of differing amount and probability, were conducted in the laboratory. Great <b>tits</b> and <b>marsh</b> <b>tits</b> {{were found to be}} risk prone (and more insectivorous), whereas varied tits were risk averse (and more granivorous). Diet menus were examined in the laboratory using behavioural titration tests between sunflower seeds and mealworms. The results of these tests were similar to patterns of food exploitation determined using stable isotope analysis (δ 13 C and δ 15 N contents) of blood samples from birds collected in the wild. Possibly, the dominant varied tits drove the other two species of tits towards different diet menus and unusually high risk proneness. In future, we should examine whether different interspecies interactions cause different risk sensitivity in other geographical environments...|$|R
