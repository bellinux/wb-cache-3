Both these signals are detected from the magnetising yoke, which is contained in an aluminium head (55 mm in diameter as shown in the photo). The flux density is measured from a secondary winding wound on the yoke. For that reason there is a great influence on the measured values, hence great care should be taken that the <b>measuring</b> <b>head</b> is placed on a clean and even sample. The measurement is based on similar principle as employed in the standardised single sheet tester.|$|E
50|$|Usually a {{microwave}} power meter will consist of a <b>measuring</b> <b>head</b> which contains the actual power sensing element, connected via a cable to the meter proper, which displays the power reading. The head may {{be referred to as}} a power sensor or mount.Different power sensors can be used for different frequencies or power levels. Historically the means of operation in most power sensor and meter combinations was that the sensor would convert the microwave power into an analogue voltage which would be read by the meter and converted into a power reading. Several modern power sensor heads contain electronics to create a digital output and can be plugged via USB into a PC which acts as the power meter.|$|E

50|$|All {{physical}} principles {{which are}} capable {{to provide information}} about the position of an object are suitable to serve as the starting basis for a sensor function. The ambient conditions prevailing during arc welding and also the requirements which are made by fully mechanised equipments have, however, many restrictions as a consequence. Figure 1 depicts the system overview. The monitoring strategy of the sensor (process or geometry) has been chosen as the superordinate criterion, the further subdivision is orientated on the measuring principle.A further distinctive feature of sensor systems is their design. Leading sensors are, thus, marked by the fact that measuring point and joining point are not located in the same position. Here, the measuring and joining process are mainly running in sequence. For making position-relevant statements about the welding process, those systems require calibration of the relative position. If process-oriented sensors are used, the measuring point and the joining point are identical.What the measuring principles all have in common is the fact that through the evaluation of the sensor signal, geometrical information about the joint and its relative position to the <b>measuring</b> <b>head</b> is provided. The individual active principles allow different processing speed for acquiring the information.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the length of}} the calibration period and observation frequency on the predictive uncertainty in time series modeling of groundwater dynamics is investigated. Studied series are from deltaic regions with predominantly shallow groundwater tables in a temperate maritime climate where heads vary due to precipitation and evaporation. Response times vary over a wide range from ∼ 60 to ∼ 1200 days. A Transfer Function-Noise model is calibrated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to both synthetic series and <b>measured</b> series of <b>heads.</b> The model fit and uncertainty are evaluated for various calibration periods and observation frequencies. It is often assumed that the required length of the calibration period is related to the response time of the system. In this study, no strong relationship was observed. Results indicate, however, that the required length of the calibration period is related to the decay time of the noise. Furthermore, the length of the calibration period was much more important than the total number of observations. For the measured series, the credible intervals could commonly be reduced to ∼ 10 % of the <b>measured</b> <b>head</b> range and the prediction intervals to ∼ 50 % of the <b>measured</b> <b>head</b> range with calibration periods of 20 years with approximately two observations per month. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{connecting}} rod {{is a critical}} part inside the marine engine. The inspection of its important parameters {{is directly related to}} the assembly and quality of the marine engine. A coordinate measuring machine (CMM) is a conventional choice to measure the parameters of a {{connecting rod}}. However, CMM requires significant resources in time and cost, which leads researchers into in-situ measurement. This article presents a fast and in-situ measuring method by using a laser-based <b>measuring</b> <b>head.</b> Two measuring strategies are adopted in the inspection process. For positional measurements (such as the hole–center distance), whose accuracy requirement is generally low, the coordinate system of the numerical control (NC) machine is combined with the <b>measuring</b> <b>head</b> to acquire the positional parameters. For dimensional measurements (such as inner diameters), whose accuracy requirement is rather high, the NC machine is used just as transportation. Note that the <b>measuring</b> <b>head</b> has the ability to perform the dimension inspection independently. The accuracy of the <b>measuring</b> <b>head</b> is high enough to meet the dimensional accuracy requirements. Experiments are performed to validate the proposed method. The measuring error of the inner diameters is from 5 μm to 7 μm. The measuring error of hole–center distance is within 15 μm. The measurement of all these parameters can be done within 1 min...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{show that}} {{expressions}} like {{two glasses of}} wine are ambiguous between counting and measuring interpretations, and that each interpretation {{is associated with a}} different semantic representation. In each interpretation, glasses has a different function. In the counting interpretation, glasses is a relational noun, while in the measure interpretation, glasses is a <b>measure</b> <b>head</b> analogous to litre. This difference leads to a number of grammatical contrasts which can be explained by differences in the grammatical structure. I discuss whether these differences are only semantic or also expressed in the syntactic representation. The assumption that syntax directly reflects semantic interpretation leads to assigning counting NPs and measuring NPs two different syntactic structures: counting NPs are right-branching with two modifying glasses of wine, while in measure expressions the numeral and the <b>measure</b> <b>head</b> form a <b>measure</b> predicate two glasses which modifies the N. I show that in Modern Hebrew and Mandarin counting structures and measuring structures clearly do have different syntactic structures, reflecting the semantic differences between counting and measuring. While the evidence in the case of English is less strong, the assumption that syntax directly reflects compositional syntactic structure results in the same basic syntactic contrasts in English as well...|$|R

25|$|In optical radiometry, {{sheets of}} PTFE {{are used as}} <b>measuring</b> <b>heads</b> in spectroradiometers and {{broadband}} radiometers (e.g., illuminance meters and UV radiometers) due to PTFE's capability to diffuse a transmitting light nearly perfectly. Moreover, optical properties of PTFE stay constant {{over a wide range}} of wavelengths, from UV down to near infrared. In this region, the relation of its regular transmittance to diffuse transmittance is negligibly small, so light transmitted through a diffuser (PTFE sheet) radiates like Lambert's cosine law.
