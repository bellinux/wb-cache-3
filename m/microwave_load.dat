40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} generic proposal on the infl uence of various <b>microwave</b> <b>load</b> parameters based on results accumulated during an investigation using a specifi c microwave multimode heating cavity confi guration. The results have been obtained by numerical analysis using the Finite Element Method within a 3 D environment. The load parameters considered were dielectric constant, loss factor, load thickness and load position. Load material properties are typical of those used in industrial relevant applications. Of the four load parameters investigated, the confi guration with a high loss factor was seen to dominate the load impact regardless of load thickness, load position or dielectric constant. With decreasing loss factor or increasing load thickness, the infl uence of the dielectric constant increases. Minor adjustments in the load position (10 %) is generally seen to have minimal impact for all load properties considered. The paper also investigates the numerical impact of varying load properties. As the dielectric constant increases, which requires a higher number of mesh elements, so does the average iterations per numerical cycle. The number of numerical cycles and time to reach a convergence is also seen to be inversely proportional to the load loss factor...|$|E

Various contacts between West-European parties, headed by ESA, and the Russian parties, headed by ESA, led to the proposal for flying two H-masers on Meteor 3 M, a Russian meteorology satellite in low polar orbit. The experiment will include two masers, one provided by ON and the other by VNIIFTRI. T/F transfer and precise positioning will be performed by both a microwave link, using PRARE equipment, and an optical link, using LASSO-like equipment. The main objectives of the experiment are precise orbit determination and point positioning for geodetic/geophysical research, ultra-accurate time comparison and dissemination as well as in-orbit demonstration of operation and performance of H-masers.

Several commercial materials were characterized at X-band (8 - 12 GHz). Their dielectric properties were extracted {{through the use}} of a cavity-perturbation method and a transmission/reflection rectangular waveguide method. A lossy carbon-loaded Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) polymer was selected to realize a matched load between 8 and 12 GHz. Two different types of terminations were realized by fused deposition modeling: a hybrid 3 -D printed termination (metallic waveguide + pyramidal polymer absorber + metallic short circuit) and a full 3 -D printed termination (self-consistent matched load). Voltage standing wave ratio of less than 1. 075 and 1. 025 were measured over X-band for the hybrid and full 3 -D printed terminations, respectively. Power behavior of the full 3 -D printed termination was investigated. A very linear evolution of reflected power as a function of incident power amplitude was observed at 10 GHz up to 11. 5 W.

In concept number one, three different types of interconnections are analyzed for determining the unit length and frequency dependent characteristics, based on the perturbed direct and return current paths and electromagnetic (EM) simulations.

40|$|Silica aerogel and lyogel {{have been}} {{successfully}} sulfonated in one step by a simple post-synthesis method using microwaves as well as conventional heating. The use of <b>microwaves</b> allowed <b>loading</b> higher amounts of sulfonic acid groups in both silicas, according to the higher S/Si atomic ratio determined by XPS, and the higher sulfur content determined by TGA, also exhibiting lower surface area and higher acidity. Sulfonated aerogels showed higher conversion and selectivity to h-GTBE (glycerol di- and tri-ethers) than sulfonated lyogels for the acid-catalyzed etherification of glycerol with isobutene. This was attributed to the higher content of sulfonic acid groups incorporated in aerogel. Microwave-assisted sulfonated aerogel yielded 75 % of selectivity to h-GTBE, {{which can be used}} as fuel additive, for practically total conversion. Interestingly, larger porosity of aerogel avoided the partial blocking of pores by reaction products observed when other micro- and mesoporous catalysts were tested for this reaction.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityConsumption of ready-to-eat {{food has}} {{steadily}} {{increased over the}} last decade. This development {{can be attributed to}} the fast pace of the modern lifestyles. This trend along with recent recalls caused by outbreaks of microwavable convenience food has forced government regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) of the United States to pay closer attention and to provide strict regulatory standards to the production of safe ready-to-eat foods. Although major efforts have been made to develop alternative non-thermal processes, heat is still the most efficient and effective means for commercial production of shelf stable foods. In theory, application of heat destroys or inactivates pathogens and microorganisms. Conventional application of thermal energy from sources such as steam or hot water requires a prolonged time of exposure of the prepackaged food which subsequently results in the destruction of heat sensitive nutrients. Microwave sterilization is a new and emerging technology that provides faster heat penetration and can significantly reduce the degradation of heat sensitive nutrients. A four-cavity microwave assisted thermal sterilization (MATS) system was developed at Washington State University (WSU). The system combines traditional hot water heating in pressurized cavities with microwave heating in order to sterilize food packed in polymeric packages. The system is accepted by the FDA for commercial sterilization of homogeneous and heterogeneous foods. Being a novel technology, several aspects that might have an influence on the overall utilization of the technology still remain unresolved as far as research is concerned. They include: (1) sensitivity of the system on dielectric property of both food and circulating water inside the cavity, (2) overall heat transfer coefficient between food and circulating water inside the cavity, (3) the effect of frequency shift as a result of continuous use and aging microwave generators on stability of heating patterns, and (4) reduction of reflected power as a result of impedance mismatch between microwave generator (source) and <b>microwave</b> cavity (<b>load).</b> These aspects are the focus of this dissertation. The dissertation is arranged as follows: Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 discuss relevant concept of microwave propagation inside waveguide and cavities and how microwave energy penetrates food materials and is subsequently converted into heat. Fundamentals of Maxwell's equations, power conversion, and electromagnetic-heat transfer solution through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) are among the highlights of these two chapters. Chapter 3 outlines the steps and procedure for creating a computer simulation model that would theoretically describe the microwave system. Electromagnetic field distribution, power dissipation into heat, and the resulting heating patterns in foods were obtained from the computer simulation model. Results were validated experimentally through the chemical marker method. Chapter 4 centers on discussion of the operating frequency of the generators and how it affects the heating patterns in food. In Chapter 4, the computer simulation model created in Chapter 3 was fully utilized. Operating frequencies of the four generators powering the microwave system were evaluated considering the frequencies of generators manufactured by two different companies, repeatability of measured frequencies over time, and dependency of frequencies with power setting on generators over a period of one year. Heating patterns in foods were then simulated considering the Federal Communication Commissions (FCC) allocated frequency bandwidth for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) purposes. Chapter 5 discusses efforts to improve the efficiency of the microwave system through impedance matching using a 3 -probe tuner along waveguide. The strategy is Chapter 5 was to reduce power reflection by incorporating variable and controllable inductive elements (3 -probe tuner) that would balance the impedance mismatch between the generators and the cavities. Chapter 6 which supports Chapter 7 shows how dielectric properties of precooked salmon were established as affected by marinating condition, precooking temperature and precooking time. Chapter 7 discusses the influence of inherent variation in dielectric properties of salmon to heating pattern and location cold spot and its implication on sterilization value calculation. Finally Chapter 8 summarizes and provides an insightful overview of our overall conclusions and recommendations for future study. In theory, application of heat destroys or inactivates pathogen and other microorganism that can cause food spoilage. Conventional application of heat such as those from steam or hot water requires a prolong time of exposure which subsequently results in the destruction of heat sensitive nutrients. Microwave sterilization is a new and emerging technology that provides faster rate of heat penetration and can significantly reduce the degradation of heat sensitive nutrients. A four-cavity microwave assisted sterilization thermal sterilization (MATS) system was developed at Washington State University (WSU).

40|$|Semiconductor {{nanostructures}} show {{electrical and}} optical properties {{which can be}} very different from bulk semiconductors. The various effects that occur due to the spatial confinement of electrons in such structures are of scientific importance. In addition, semiconductor nanostructures are very promising for a number of applications in the opto-electronic industry. For example semiconductor components like transistors are made still smaller, essentially to make them faster and more efficient. In the first chapter of this thesis, we introduce the physical concepts of the energy levels in bulk semiconductors and semiconducting nanostructures. In chapter 2 we discuss an experimental method for the contactless measurement of the dielectric constant of a non-conductive sample at microwave frequencies (1010 Hz). The dielectric constant is obtained from the reflection spectrum of a <b>microwave</b> cavity <b>loaded</b> with the sample. This method is very suited to measure small changes in the complex dielectric constant (= 10 - 6), with a time resolution of 10 nanoseconds. In chapter 3, we use this method to determine the dielectric constant of porous n-doped GaP (structure sizes of about 150 nm) and their changes under constant illumination and illumination with a laser pulse. The results can be quantitatively understood from a model which describes the porous material as a collection of conductive spheres surrounded by a depletion layer. The polarizability of such a composed sphere with a total radius of 75 nm, is calculated with an accurate hydrodynamic model which also describes diffusion of the electrons due to a concentration gradient. The change in the dielectric constant under illumination can be described with this model as a change in the width of the depletion layer. We find that the electron mobility inside the conductive sphere is 40 times smaller than in bulk GaP, and up to five orders of magnitude larger than the long-range mobility in porous GaP. The transient changes in the dielectric constant upon excitation with a laser pulse and with constant illumination reflect the dynamics of electron-hole photogeneration and bulk and surface recombination in the porous GaP. In the last chapter, we report on the optical transitions between the discrete conduction levels in few-electron artificial atoms strongly confined in ZnO nanocrystals with diameter between 3 and 6 nm. The artificial atoms are prepared by two methods. The first method uses an assembly of weakly coupled ZnO nanocrystals in which electrons are injected electrochemically; the average electron number is obtained from the injected charge and the number of quantum dots in the assembly. In the second method acolloidal solution of ZnO nanocrystals is used; few-electron artificial atoms are obtained by photogeneration of electron-hole pairs and subsequent holescavenging. The charged ZnO nanocrystals show broad spectra in the near IR; the shape and total absorption intensity being determined only by the average electron number. The spectra can be explained by taking into account the allowed electric dipole transitions between the atom-like orbitals of the ZnO nanocrystals and the size distribution of the nanocrystals in the sample...|$|R

However, this method of slowing down the wave suffers from dielectric breakdown as it cannot support high electric field. In order to prevent the dielectric breakdown, periodically corrugated metallic hollow waveguides are now being used as SWSs in BWOs. The sinusoidally corrugated SWS (SCSWS) has received the greatest attention among different corrugation profile. However, the fabrication process of this profile is complex and requires sophisticated tools. In an attempt to mitigate the fabrication problem, SWSs with simpler geometry have been proposed by the researchers. In this work, an earlier work on rectangularly corrugated SWS (RCSWS), which was investigated for non-relativistic electron beam has been extended for relativistic BWO in the X-band frequency range. The dispersion properties and the temporal growth rate of the axisymmetric transverse magnetic (TM) modes of have been analyzed numerically. In order to avoid the complicated boundary condition at the discontinuous boundaries of the rectangular radial profile, Fourier series has been used to approximate the axial profile of the SWS and the linear Rayleigh-Fourier theory has been utilized to determine the dispersion properties. The study shows that the growth rate of microwave for the RCSWS is somewhat lower than that for the case of SCSWS; however, a design tradeoff can be made to obtain a comparable performance...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityMicrowave heating {{is a novel}} {{technology}} that has advantages in reducing heating time and improving food quality. A 915 MHz single-mode microwave assisted thermal sterilization (MATS) system was developed at Washington State University with ultimate goal of industrial applications. This research addresses several engineering issues in future scaling-up of the MATS technology. A major challenge in developing microwave thermal processing has been non-uniform heating patterns which can result in cold and hot spots. The non-uniform heating pattern {{is caused by the}} uneven electric field distribution. In this study, computer simulation method was used to analyze the electric field distribution and its components in each direction within a MATS system. The dominant electric field component was in y direction which could be reformed by adjusting the dimensions of Ultem window and horn applicator in y direction or placing metal/Ultem bars within the horn applicators. In developing a microwave assisted thermal process, time-temperature profile at the cold spot is recorded to establish the process schedule to control most heat resistant food pathogens. Compared with fragile fiber-optic sensor, a mobile metallic temperature sensor is more suitable for continuous moving packages. However, interaction might occur between the metallic temperature sensor and the electromagnetic field. Thus another main objective of this work was to study the performance of a mobile metallic sensor within microwave environment. Results showed that a mobile metallic temperature sensor could be used for temperature measurement in the MATS system with suitable probe orientation. Certain design features, such as round probe tip and thinner probe diameter, could improve the sensor accuracy used in <b>microwave</b> environment. Dummy <b>loads</b> provide consistent dielectric properties for power delivery and system stability tests of a microwave heating system in production. The low cost bentonite water paste with high thermal stability was used to develop reusable dummy <b>load</b> for industrial <b>microwave</b> heating systems. Dielectric properties of bentonite pastes of various compositions were measured over 300 to 3000 MHz and 20 to 120 ºC. Vegetable oil and salt were used to adjust the dielectric constant and loss factor of bentonite pastes to match dielectric properties of different food materials.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of mobile}} networks as {{the main source of}} internet connectivity is creating challenges in the infrastructure. Customer demand is a moving target and continuous hardware developments are necessary to supply higher data rates in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective way. This thesis reviews and advances the status of realizing wideband and high efficiency power amplifiers, which will facilitate improvements in network capacity and energy efficiency. Several demonstrator PAs are proposed, analyzed, designed, and characterized: First, resistive loading at higher harmonics in wideband power amplifier design suitable for envelope tracking (ET) is proposed. A 40 dBm decade bandwidth 0. 4 – 4. 1 GHz PA is designed, with 10 – 15 dB gain and 40 – 62 % drain efficiency. Its versatility is demonstrated by digital pre-distortion (DPD) linearized measurements resulting in adjacent channel leakage ratios (ACLR) lower than − 46 dBc for various downlink signals (WCDMA, LTE, WiMAX). Second, a theory for class-J <b>microwave</b> frequency dynamic <b>load</b> modulation (DLM) PAs is derived. This connects transistor technology and load network requirements to enable power-scalable and bandwidth conscious designs. A 38 dBm PA is designed at 2. 08 GHz, maintaining efficiencies > 45 % over 8 dB of output power back-off (OPBO) dynamic range. From this pre-study a fully packaged 86 -W peak power version at 2. 14 GHz is designed. ACLR after DPD is − 46 dBc at a drain efficiency of 34 %. For DLM PAs {{there is a need for}} varactors with large effective tuning range and high breakdown voltage. For this purpose, SiC Schottky diode varactors are developed with an effective tuning range of 6 : 1 and supporting a 3 : 1 tuning ratio at 36 V of RF swing. Nonlinear characterization to enable Q-factor extraction in the presence of distortion is proposed and demonstrated by multi-harmonic active source- and load-pull, offering insights to tunable network design. Third, a method to evaluate and optimize dual-RF input PAs, while catering to higher harmonic conditions and transistor parasitics, is proposed. The method is validated by a PA design having a peak power of 44 +/- 0. 9 dBm and 6 dB OPBO PAE exceeding 45 % over a 1 – 3 GHz bandwidth. The results in this thesis contribute with a novel device and analysis of high efficiency and wideband PAs, aiding in the design of key components for future energy efficient and high capacity wireless systems...|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed on a T-septum waveguide to investigate the possibility of heating a lossy dielectric film coated on a metal surface using microwaves. The results indicate that additional lossless dielectric loading is required above the septum to provide the necessary electric field to heat the lossy film. A parametric study reveals that significant power deposition can occur in the film provided the permittivity of the dielectric loading is high. Measurements on an applicator {{have shown that the}} temperature of a lossy film painted on a metal surface can be increased by more than 40 °C. The temperature is related to thickness of the film, septum height, and the position and permittivity of the low loss dielectric loading. It has been also been shown that the necessary electric field in the coated film can further be increased by using a nonlinear distribution of permittivity of the dielectric loading. The power loss in the film is again related to various distributions of permittivity of the loading as well as the height of the T-septum. Finite element method was used to compute the field structure inside the waveguide applicator. Two symmetrical portions are assumed for the applicator and analysis are done by considering one of the half sections formed by introducing a magnetic wall. A novel compact Y-septum waveguide applicator is proposed for the single mode <b>microwave</b> heating of <b>loads</b> of small dimensions (e. g. a printed circuit board or a film) and is compared to a T-septum waveguide applicator of the same dimensions by varying the septum height, septum width, septum thickness and septum angle. Power Frequency Characterisation of different types of paints such as Solar Acrylic, Polyester Resin, Wattyl Instant Estapol and Metal Gloss Polypropylene with three different thicknesses (1. 5 mm, 1. 0 mm and 0. 05 mm) was conducted using two different types of Variable Frequency Microwave (VFM) facilities. Temperature characterisation was also done in two different power outputs of 30 W, 60 W and 90 W and all the above studies were done in both the VW 1500 with frequency range of 6. 5 GHz to 18 GHz and Microcure 2100 facilities with frequency range of 2. 5 GHz to 8 GHz VFM facilities. After analysing the diagrams and data collected it was found that all different materials behaved in a different way to parameters like thickness, power input, bandwidth frequency and sweep time. Results also showed that special care should be taken when designing a microwave applicator with variable frequency for heating various materials and VFM facility is a very useful tool to identify these parameters and design an applicator for most favourable conditions so that hot spots and thermal run away can be avoided for specific materials. A simple fibre optic probe has been developed to measure temperature in microwave environment. The basic principle of operation of the probe is discussed together with its structure and construction. Temperature characteristics of the probe are analysed as well as the prediction of its temperature range and characteristics. The construction of a fibre optic thermal switch is presented. A new constant called the 'temperature bandwidth - sensitivity product' of the probe is defined which determines the temperature range and sensitivity of the fibre optic probe. Also stability studies were conducted by thermally cycling the temperature probe as well as the construction of a temperature probe is explained to carry out measurements near liquid nitrogen temperature...|$|R
