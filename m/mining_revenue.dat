40|$|Literature on the {{relationship}} between <b>mining</b> <b>revenues</b> and economic and social development can be roughly divided into two categories: theories that indicate that <b>mining</b> <b>revenues</b> are inherently unsuitable for securing indigenous development and theories that argue that the impact of <b>mining</b> <b>revenues</b> is influenced by contextual factors. Relevant contextual factors include the distinctive cultural and social features of various indigenous groups, the culture of mining companies, and the policy and institutional framework within which <b>mining</b> <b>revenues</b> are distributed. These theories provide guidance for empirical analyses of indigenous management of <b>mining</b> <b>revenues.</b> For example, a comparative analysis of indigenous communities in various policy environments may provide insight into effective institutional and policy frameworks for managing indigenous <b>mining</b> <b>revenues.</b> This should be coupled with research into the role of political leadership and policy making processes in developing these frameworks, matters generally ignored in the literature. Similarly, research into the impact of various indigenous cultures on fiscal management can inform consideration of indigenous governance mechanisms which can effectively manage <b>mining</b> <b>revenues.</b> It can also highlight the fact that what constitutes 'institutional quality' is subject to cultural interpretation. Importantly however, we may need to move beyond the current theoretical frameworks which posit <b>mining</b> <b>revenues</b> as either 'shaping' or being 'shaped by' indigenous culture, and instead recognise the dynamic interrelationship between these two variables.

40|$|AbstractThis study empirically {{investigates the}} dynamic {{relationships}} between <b>mining</b> <b>revenue,</b> government consumption, exchange rate {{and economic growth}} in Botswana. Quarterly data from 1994 to 2012 were analysed {{through the use of}} unrestricted vector autoregressive (VAR) modelling consisting of impulse response functions, variance decomposition and VAR Granger causality. The impulse response functions showed the positive and negative response to mining shocks while variance decomposition indicates that <b>mining</b> <b>revenue</b> defines the variability in economic growth and government consumption. The empirical results also suggest that <b>mining</b> <b>revenue</b> and exchange rate granger cause economic growth while government consumption is caused by <b>mining</b> <b>revenue</b> and economic growth.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>mining</b> <b>revenue</b> in Zimbabwe {{has attracted a}} lot of attention especially with the discovery of diamonds. The mining sector itself plays a very important {{role in the development of}} any country. In Zimbabwe it has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy since 2009. The overall objective of this paper is to investigate the {{distribution of}} <b>mining</b> <b>revenue</b> in Zimbabwe. The study was conducted through consultative workshops, focus groups and interviews of key informants from different provinces. Secondary document review was also done to support information gathered from the consultations. The study indicated that there should be specific laws and policies on how mining companies give corporate social responsibility (CSR); the operation of community trusts which were stipulated in the Indigenization and Empowerment Act (Chapter 14 : 33) should be clear and transparent; and the needs of small scale miners should be taken into consideration so that they can also effectively contribute to the revenue of the country and the communities they are operating in. Several recommendations came out of these discussions and some of the major recommendations included that corporate social responsibility (CSR) be regulated so that all mining companies are bound by law to plough back into the community. It was also recommended that there be a special fund for <b>mining</b> <b>revenue</b> like in other African countries (Botswana, Nigeria, and South Africa...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effects of}} a collection of policies that determine the mandatory distribution of mining, gas and oil revenues between national and subnational governments, and the greater involvement of mining companies in local development. I have labelled this set of policies, which aims to reduce social conflict and promote local development, the New Extractive Industry Strategy (NEIS). Chapter 1 describes the implementation of these policies in Peru and highlights their significance to the mining industry worldwide. Chapter 2 describes the methodology of the thesis and introduces the three field research regions. Chapter 3 outlines the national socio-political context for the implementation of the NEIS. Chapters 4 – 6 deal with the effects of the NEIS on social conflict. I argue that the implementation of the NEIS has not only failed to reduce conflict but has actually exacerbated it. After reviewing the debates linking extraction and conflict (Chapter 4), Chapter 5 demonstrates that conflict is strongly associated with the volume of <b>mining</b> <b>revenue</b> received by sub-national governments. Chapter 6 presents a typology of conflicts that helps to explain the correlation between <b>mining</b> <b>revenue</b> and unrest. In addition to well-known conflicts that are related to the adverse impact of mining on livelihoods and the environment, the study identifies two other types. In the first, peasant communities employ social conflict to increase their bargaining power with the mining companies for material compensation. In the second, the large volume of <b>mining</b> <b>revenue</b> generates disputes over access to or use of these financial transfers. Chapters 7 – 8 show that the NEIS has not delivered its development promises. Chapter 7 illustrates how regional and municipal governments in receipt of high per capita volumes of <b>mining</b> <b>revenue</b> transfers did not improve their economic and welfare indicators any more {{than the rest of the}} country. Chapter 8 proposes that a combination of obstructive political factors trapped regional and municipal authorities and local populations in a myopic political game that prioritised quick short-term spending over any long-term benefits to be gained from better planned expenditure. Finally, Chapter 9 draws some conclusions and makes some suggestions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
