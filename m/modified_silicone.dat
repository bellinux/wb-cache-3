In the present work, we describe the synthesis and characterization of covalently linked hyaluronic acid (HA) (35 kDa) to poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomer surfaces.

Silicone was modified with different bio-polymers and silanes, including heparin, hyaluronan, octa-decyltrichlorosilane (OTS), and fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) to provide a stable and biocompatible surface with different surface functional groups and degrees of hydrophobicity. The <b>modified</b> <b>silicone</b> surfaces were studied by using con-tact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

40|$|Earth’s biota {{produces}} {{vast quantities}} of polymerized silica at ambient temperatures and pressures by mechanisms that are not understood. Silica spicules constitute 75 % of the dry weight of the sponge Tethya aurantia, making this organism uniquely tractable for analyses of the proteins intimately associated with the biosilica. Each spicule contains a central protein filament, shown by x-ray diffraction to exhibit a highly regular, repeating structure. The protein filaments can be dissociated to yield three similar subunits, named silicatein α, β, and γ. The molecular weights and amino acid compositions of the three silicateins are similar, suggesting that they {{are members of a}} single protein family. The cDNA sequence of silicatein α, the most abundant of these subunits, reveals that this protein is highly similar to members of the cathepsin L and papain family of proteases. The cysteine at the active site in the proteases is replaced by serine in silicatein α, although the six cysteines that form disulfide bridges in the proteases are conserved. Silicatein α also contains unique tandem arrays of multiple hydroxyls.

40|$|Abstract Background Pseudofactin II is a {{recently}} identified biosurfactant secreted by Pseudomonas fluorescens BD 5, the strain obtained from freshwater from the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. Pseudofactin II {{is a novel}} compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth amino acid in peptide moiety. The C-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of Thr 3. Adhesion is {{the first stage of}} biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. Adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e. g. glass, polystyrene, <b>silicone</b> <b>modifies</b> its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. In this study the role and applications of pseudofactin II as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives. Results Pseudofactin II lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis and two Candida albicans strains. Pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0. 5 mg/ml pseudofactin II inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36 - 90 % and that of C. albicans by 92 - 99 %. The same concentration of pseudofactin II dislodged 26 - 70 % of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. Pseudofactin II also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of E. faecalis, E. coli, E. hirae and C. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. The highest concentration tested (0. 5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of S. epidermidis, partial (18 - 37 %) inhibition of other bacteria and 8 - 9 % inhibition of C. albicans growth. Conclusion Pseudofactin II showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. Up to 99 % prevention could be achieved by 0. 5 mg/ml pseudofactin II. In addition, pseudofactin II dispersed preformed biofilms. Pseudofactin II {{can be used as a}} disinfectant or surface coating agent against microbial colonization of different surfaces, e. g. implants or urethral catheters. </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{remarkable}} advances in modern healthcare, {{there are some}} drawbacks associated to the extended use of medical devices and biomaterial implants when microorganisms are able to reach their surface, forming biofilms and becoming the focus of biomaterial-associated infections (BAI) which are hardly to treat. The growing number of BAI {{has led to the}} need of developing novel antibacterial coatings for medical devices. The use of enzymes able to degrade biofilm matrix components, such as proteins and extracellular DNA, represents a promising approach to fight these infections. The first aim {{of this study was to}} apply a biologically inspired strategy for covalent immobilization of different enzymes (lysozyme, proteinase K and DNAse I) on clinically relevant substrata (silicone) to obtain mono-functional coatings able to prevent staphylococci adhesion or to kill the adhered bacteria, depending on the enzyme used. The coating developed with the best anti-adhesive properties was afterwards combined with an antimicrobial peptide (colistin), generating a bi-functional coating. Compounds immobilization was mediated by a polydopamine (pDA) coating and the anti-adhesive and antimicrobial performances of the generated surfaces were investigated for a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus using fluorescence microscopy. Results showed that unmodified silicone allowed the adhesion of bacteria without compromising their viability. <b>Silicone</b> <b>modified</b> with polydopamine coating had no significant effect on bacterial attachment and viability. Lysozyme immobilization was not able to reduce bacterial attachment or compromise their viability. On the other hand, proteinase K was able to reduce the percentage of bacterial attachment and a significant fraction of these adhered bacteria was found dead. Regarding the functionalization with DNAse I, these coatings presented the best anti-adhesive properties and since it is know that this enzyme is not cytotoxic, it was further combined with colistin and the bi-functional coating obtained proved to be more effective on reducing the fraction of bacterial attachment. The overall results suggest that the use of coatings functionalized with enzymes is able to degrade biofilm matrix components and their conjugation with antimicrobial peptides presents a promising strategy for creating antibacterial surfaces to be applied in biomaterials for medical devices and implants...|$|R
