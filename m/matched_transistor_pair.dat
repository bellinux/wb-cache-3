40|$|Matched bipolar {{transistor}} pairs {{are a very}} powerful design tool, yet have received less and less attention {{over the last few}} years. This is primarily due to the proliferation of high-performance monolithic circuits which are replacing many designs previously implemented with discrete components. State-of-the-art circuitry, however, is still the realm of the discrete component, especially because of recent improvements in the components themselves. It has become clear {{in the past few years}} that ultimate performance in monolithic transistor pairs was being limited by statistical fluctuations in the material itself and in the processing environment. This led to a <b>matched</b> <b>transistor</b> <b>pair</b> fabricated from many different individual transistors physically located in a manner which tended to average out any residual process or material gradients. At the same time...|$|E

A latch load at the first stage provides the second stage with large input difference voltage.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{evaluating}} differences between electrical properties of closely spaced, supposedly identical, <b>transistors</b> (<b>matched</b> <b>pairs)</b> in integrated circuits (IC's). Electrical properties of transistors in IC's generally exhibit relatively large spreads due to variations of production equipment. Such spreads limit the attainable performances of IC's and deteriorate the precision by which certain (analogue) signal processing algorithms can be realised. Closely spaced identical transistors in one IC however, are fabricated simultaneously and under practically identical conditions, which results is substantially smaller differences (mismatch) of electrical performances. This attribute, usually indicated {{with the term}} 'matching', is used in many IC's to realise better performances. The remaining mismatches between <b>transistors</b> of <b>matched</b> <b>pairs</b> are generally of a stochastic nature and are hence indicated with the term mismatch fluctuations. By measuring and characterising populations of matched pairs, mismatch fluctuations can be quantified and evaluated. The observed effects are generally attributable to fluctuations of microscopic transistor construction elements such as doping atoms, edge roughness and grain boundaries. Besides these stochastic effects, so-called systematic mismatch effects are frequently encountered in practice. These are caused {{by the fact that}} <b>transistors</b> of a <b>matched</b> <b>pair</b> cannot always be realised or used identically. This thesis discusses the required microelectronic test structures and measurement capabilities for correctly analysing and evaluating mismatch effects. The discussed examples demonstrate that mismatch studies can provide valuable insights into the, not always equally well chosen, microscopic architecture of transistors. The discussed techniques and insights are used to optimise IC technologies and lead to better electronic performances and higher product yields.

40|$|We {{investigated}} and optimized the low-frequency noise {{characteristics of a}} preamplifier used for readout of direct current superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). When the SQUID output was detected directly using a room-temperature low-voltage-noise preamplifier, the low-frequency noise of a SQUID system {{was found to be}} dominated by the input current noise of the preamplifiers in case of a large dynamic resistance of the SQUID. To reduce the current noise of the preamplifier in the low-frequency range, we investigated the dependence of total preamplifier noise on the collector current and source resistance. When the collector current was decreased from 8. 4 mA to 3 mA in the preamplifier made of 3 parallel SSM 2220 <b>transistor</b> <b>pairs,</b> the low-frequency total voltage noise of the preamplifier (at 0. 1 Hz) decreased by about 3 times for a source resistance of 30 Î© whereas the white noise level remained nearly unchanged. Since the relative contribution of preamplifier's input voltage and current noise is different depending on the dynamic resistance or flux-to-voltage transfer of the SQUID, the results showed that the total noise of a SQUID system at low-frequency range can be improved significantly by optimizing the preamplifier circuit parameters, mainly the collector current in case of low-noise bipolar <b>transistor</b> <b>pairs...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{write cycle}} begins by {{applying}} the value to be written to the bit lines. If we wish to write a 0, we would apply a 0 to the bit lines, i.e. setting BL to 1 and BL to 0. This is similar to applying a reset pulse to an SR-latch, which causes the flip flop to change state. A 1 is written by inverting {{the values of the}} bit lines. WL is then asserted and the value that is to be stored is latched in. This works because the bit line input-drivers are designed to be much stronger than the relatively weak transistors in the cell itself so they can easily override the previous state of the cross-coupled inverters. In practice, access NMOS transistors M5 and M6 have to be stronger than either bottom NMOS (M1, M3) or top PMOS (M2, M4) transistors. This is easily obtained as PMOS transistors are much weaker than NMOS when same sized. Consequently when one <b>transistor</b> <b>pair</b> (e.g. M3 and M4) is only slightly overridden by the write process, the opposite <b>transistors</b> <b>pair</b> (M1 and M2) gate voltage is also changed. This means that the M1 and M2 transistors can be easier overridden, and so on. Thus, cross-coupled inverters magnify the writing process.|$|R

This will result in a small reduction in the programmed current.|$|R
