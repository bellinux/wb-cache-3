I got on a plane to LA to do my music and was given one shot to write the song that would change my life and I did. I never went back. I left behind my boyfriend, my apartment. I still haven't been back. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> in and cleared it for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crabb {{has said}} that his early {{experiences}} informed his views on welfare: [...] "The most powerful thing to me, looking back, {{is the way that}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> through a crisis in her life and became welfare dependent. She started working just a few hours each week, increasing her hours and then moving to a position where with extra training she was able to move into full-time work, become a car owner, and reach full economic independence." [...] He also said: [...] "I was brought up in a home where a huge amount of emphasis was put on work...so work and education as routes out of poverty were drummed into us".|$|E

I {{had gone to the}} reformatory from the prison. I was put in the prison, because I was a thief. I was a thief, because <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> on the streets when I was quite a little girl. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> on the streets, because the gentleman who was my father deserted her. There is no need to tell such a common story as this, at any length. It is told quite often enough in the newspapers.|$|E

60|$|Shortly after, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> upstairs. Lettie came {{in rather}} late from Highclose; Leslie {{did not come}} in. In the morning they were going with a motor party into Matloch and Chatsworth, and she was excited, and did not observe anything.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} left the priesthood," [...] he told her simply. [...] "I had found out--knew {{certainly}} that I could not go on, even before I saw you. Your coming to me when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> but gave me hope, brought rescue. Before God I am now honest!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well do I {{remember}} how sore was my heart {{the day that}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> alone to the church with my fatherless child. So ill was I, that I cared not even to name my little daughter, entreating my mother to consult with the priest, who might choose for us.|$|E

60|$|My {{mother had}} left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in the corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly, began on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head in a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made a frown and a gesture to my mother, like one who was {{accustomed}} to be obeyed, to come and open the door. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went.</b>|$|E
60|$|For my own {{desires to}} possess a paltry Irish title I cared little. My son was now heir to an English earldom, and I made him assume {{forthwith}} the title of Lord Viscount Castle Lyndon, the third of the family titles. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> almost mad with joy at saluting her grandson as 'my Lord,' and I felt that all my sufferings and privations were repaid by seeing this darling child advanced to such a post of honour.|$|E
60|$|Soon after I {{had been}} sent to Winchester <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> to America, taking with her my brother Henry and my two sisters, who were then no more than children. This was, I think, in 1827. I have no clear {{knowledge}} of her object, or of my father's; but I believe that he had an idea that money might be made by sending goods,--little goods, such as pin-cushions, pepper-boxes, and pocket-knives,--out to the still unfurnished States; and that she conceived that an opening might be made for my brother Henry by erecting some bazaar or extended shop in one of the Western cities. Whence the money came I do not know, but the pocket-knives and the pepper-boxes were bought and the bazaar built. I have seen it since in the town of Cincinnati,--a sorry building! But I have been told that in those days it was an imposing edifice. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> first, with my sisters and second brother. Then my father followed them, taking my elder brother before he went to Oxford. But there was an interval of some year and a half during which he and I were in Winchester together.|$|E

5000|$|In {{response}} to her mother’s heart attack, Swartz created her Celestial Visitations series, consisting of fifteen paintings with the figure of an angel. In Kabbalah, the angel symbolizes the good deeds performed in one’s lifetime. Swartz created the angel figures {{with the hope that}} “their presence might help <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>go</b> to heaven." [...] Her mother Dorothy Ames passed away in March 1988, a day after Swartz completed Celestial Visitation, #5.|$|R

60|$|The {{other man}} saw us {{slipping}} through and ran {{at us with}} his stick. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> first and escaped him. Then came my sister, then I, then my brother.

Still we all managed to get through into the wood, except my father who was behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{four o'clock}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> up stairs with us, because the king then usually took a nap. At six o'clock my brother went down, {{and my father}} gave us lessons till supper at nine. After supper my mother soon went to bed. We then went up stairs, and the king went to bed at eleven. My mother worked much at {{tapestry}} and made me study, and frequently read alone. My aunt said prayers and read the service; she also read many religious books, usually aloud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We knew--my {{mother and}} I--that the braves {{would be home}} soon. We {{expected}} them every minute.

They were preparing to attack our village, for they knew the men were away, and they wanted the scalps of the women and children. But they did not know the exact spot where our wigwams were pitched, and were just going, after a feed, to look for it.|$|E

"Oh, {{that will}} be nice, I do so love travelling, {{especially}} to find Daddy, who I expect will have my proper clothes with him, not these which, although they are very comfortable and pretty, seem different to what I used to wear.

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> {{herself to}} hasten the {{preparation}} of his room, and after she had sent him to bed went again to satisfy herself that he was comfortable and not feverish.

In truth these two had seldom been so happy together since those days, though the dear mother, while thankful that he had not failed, was little aware of the conflict his resolution had cost him, and the hot journey and long walk came in for more blame for his exhaustion than they entirely deserved.|$|E

5000|$|The Hardest Part is {{the second}} album by singer/songwriter Allison Moorer. The album is a concept album about a doomed {{relationship}} produced and co-written by Moorer's then husband Doyle Lee Primm. The album is based on her parents' relationship which ended tragically in the mid 80s when Moorer's father murdered her mother before killing himself. She told No Depression magazine in 2000: [...] "This record {{was inspired by the}} things I saw <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>go</b> through. It’s not the true story, but it’s inspired by the true story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>my</b> old <b>mother's</b> <b>gone,</b> and I never {{there to}} speak to her! Ah! a good woman she was, and {{might have been a}} happy one, in her little school there in Vendale, if it hadn't been for me and my bad ways." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{supervisor}} {{stood up}} straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson; and {{you should have seen}} how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest. When they heard how <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went</b> back to the inn, Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried [...] "Bravo!" [...] and broke his long pipe against the grate. Long before it was done, Mr. Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire's name) had got up from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll.|$|E

But when misfortune came, she stood by her blood:—so did the dowager viscountess stand by her blood,—so did you. Well, sir, whilst my mother was petitioning the late Prince of Orange—for I will never call him king—and {{while you were in}} prison, we lived at my Lord Marlborough’s house, who was only a little there, being away with the army in Holland.

6000|$|He obeyed {{her like}} a child and listened through his mist of tears as she rambled on. [...] "I've had my share of trouble," [...] she explained. [...] "First <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>went,</b> then my oldest boy, then my husband took sick. Yes, a body has to face trouble about so often, anyway, and, besides, I don't suppose your mother was afraid of death, anyhow.

It's his greatest affliction that he can't hear The Voices any more. I want to say I believe in your mother. She was a mighty fine woman; but the docterin of spiritualism I never could swaller, notwithstanding I grew up 'longside of it." ...|$|E
