5|$|In the 19th century, as {{the young}} {{discipline}} of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify the active components of many medicines, including willow bark. After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Joseph Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals in 1828; the following year, Henri Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin. In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher discovered {{what he thought was}} a new pain-reducing substance, isolated from the common remedy of <b>meadowsweet</b> (Spiraea ulmaria). By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named salicylic acid. The German chemist who had been working to identify the Spiraea extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same salicylic acid that Piria had found.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid {{was also}} {{isolated}} from the herb <b>meadowsweet</b> (Filipendula ulmaria, formerly classified as Spiraea ulmaria) by German researchers in 1839. While their extract was somewhat effective, it also caused digestive problems such as gastric irritation, bleeding, diarrhea and even death when consumed in high doses.|$|E
25|$|Nova Meadow is damp area {{containing}} moisture loving plants including lady's smock, common tussock grass, <b>meadowsweet,</b> {{ragged robin}} and yellow flag iris. A pond {{was created in}} 2003 to attract wildlife and {{the southern part of}} the meadow has reverted to scrubland creating a habitat for yellowhammers and linnets. In autumn it attracts thrushes, fieldfares and redwings which feed on the hawthorn berries.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is flower-rich wet grassland. Flora include common spotted orchids, cuckooflowers, <b>meadowsweets,</b> marsh-marigolds and ragged-robins. There {{are also}} grass snakes and birds such as blackcaps.|$|R
50|$|Several {{economically}} important products {{come from}} the Rosaceae, including many edible fruits (such as apples, pears, quinces, apricots, plums, cherries, peaches, raspberries, loquats, and strawberries), almonds, and {{ornamental trees and shrubs}} (such as roses, <b>meadowsweets,</b> photinias, firethorns, rowans, and hawthorns).|$|R
50|$|The {{arboretum}} covers over 40 ha and {{is famous}} for rich collections of rhododendrons, azaleas, magnolias, conifers, lilacs, apple trees, cherries, <b>meadowsweets,</b> honeysuckles, poplars, birches, and other woody species {{from all over the}} world. Old specimens of native and alien trees and shrubs can be seen there, such as lindens, beeches, oaks, maidenhair trees, arborvitaes, spruces, and firs.|$|R
25|$|Sixteen {{different}} {{herbs are}} used to make Napue, including juniper, lemon peel, angelica and cardamom as well as locally foraged <b>meadowsweet,</b> cranberries, birch and sea buckthorn. The traditional Napue gin and tonic recipe that won at the IWSC is served with a Fever-Tree Indian Tonic Water, cranberries and rosemary. The rye gin is named after the Battle of Napue fought between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia close to the distillery's location in 1714 during the Great Northern War.|$|E
25|$|Further south towards Beverley and Hull {{the river}} becomes tidal and saline. In the lower reaches it is {{enclosed}} by flood banks with little associated natural habitat remaining. The {{majority of the}} formerly extensive wetlands {{have been subject to}} drainage schemes and agricultural improvement. However some small remnants remain along the Hull valley between Driffield and Wansford. Plants that are typical of these habitats including a variety of reeds, rushes and sedges as well as yellow flag, valerian and <b>meadowsweet</b> may be found.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the parks}} and {{environment-friendly}} policies, the Pavlovsk area has relatively low level of pollution. In 1978–1983 the Pavlovsk Park contained more than 360,000 trees of 54 species: 16 species of spruce, pine, larch and fir, two species of birch, two species of willow, two of basswood, oaks, elm, alder, aspen, European rowan, bird cherry, 88 shrub species, of which the dominant were yellow acacia, <b>meadowsweet</b> and dogwoods. In 1978, there were 71 species of birds belonging to 28 families and 9 orders. Mammals include squirrels, hares, weasels, stoats, moles, shrews, hedgehogs, red voles and muskrats. In winter, the parks are sometimes visited by fox, wild boar and moose. Amphibians and reptiles are mostly frogs, toads and lizards. There are 87 species of insects belonging to 46 families.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Hasbro {{released}} toys of the 7 Pony Friends to the European {{market to}} complement its first generation My Little Pony toy line. They {{did not produce}} models for the three male ponies or the teacher from the series, Miss Hackney. Although My Little Pony originated in the United States, the toys were not marketed there. The family ponies, the Barringtons (known as the Berrytowns in toy form), the Sunbrights, and the <b>Meadowsweets</b> were also made into toys, but were only marketed in select European countries.Several pieces of merchandise were also marketed in Europe with the Seven Characters on, such as comic books, an alarm clock, a backpack, an umbrella, and a money box.|$|R
25|$|Pine forests (with Pinus sylvestris) are {{the most}} {{widespread}} and occupy 51% of the forested area of the Karelian Isthmus, followed by spruce forests (with Picea abies, 29%) and birch forests (with Betula pendula and B. pubescens, 16%). Stands on more fertile soils and in more favorable locations are occasionally dominated by Norway maple, black alder, grey alder, common aspen, English oak, grey willow, dark-leaved willow, tea-leaved willow, small-leaved lime or European white elm. Common vegetation of various types of pine forests includes heather, crowberry, common juniper, eared willow, lingonberry, water horsetail, bracken, graminoids (i.e. grasses in the wider sense) Avenella flexuosa and Carex globularis, mosses Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium and S. russowii, and lichens Cladonia spp. Prominent in various spruce forests are wood horsetail, common wood sorrel, bilberry, lingonberry, graminoids Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis arundinacea, Carex globularis, and mosses Polytrichum commune and Sphagnum girgensohnii. Prominent vegetation of various birch forests include <b>meadowsweet,</b> common wood sorrel, bilberry and graminoids Calamagrostis arundinacea and C. canescens.|$|E
500|$|Central Marsh and Pool is {{a diverse}} {{area where the}} main flora is common reed, reed sweetgrass, sedges, bulrushes and teasel. Willow trees are {{particularly}} important in this habitat as they have over 250 species of insect associated with them. [...] Alder trees support birds such as redpoll, siskin and various tit species. [...] Beyond Central Marsh lies West Marsh Pool, a small area of water surrounded by reedbed, where a number of dragonfly pools have been dug. [...] Plants which thrive in damp areas, such as marsh marigold and <b>meadowsweet,</b> flourish here.|$|E
500|$|The name Aspirin {{was derived}} from the name of the {{chemical}} ASA—Acetylspirsäure in German. Spirsäure (salicylic acid) was named for the <b>meadowsweet</b> plant, Spirea ulmaria, from which it could be derived. Aspirin took a- for the acetylation, -spir- from Spirsäure, and added -in as a typical drug name ending to make it easy to say. In the final round of naming proposals that circulated through Bayer, it came down to Aspirin and Euspirin; Aspirin, they feared, might remind customers of aspiration, but Arthur Eichengrün argued that Eu- (meaning [...] "good") was inappropriate because it usually indicated an improvement over an earlier version of a similar drug. Since the substance itself was already known, Bayer intended to use the new name to establish their drug as something new; in January 1899 they settled on Aspirin.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of their wetland nature, the Moors and Levels contain a rich {{biodiversity}} of national and international importance. They support a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold, <b>meadowsweet,</b> and ragged robin. The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan, Eurasian curlew, common redshank, skylark, common snipe, common teal, wigeon, and whimbrel, as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon. [...] A wide range of insect species is also present, including rare invertebrates, particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle, Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni, and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important otter population. Water voles (Arvicola amphibius) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10years, by the capture of mink (Mustela vison).|$|E
500|$|Further {{investigation}} and research lead the brothers to Edward (Garrett) and Madge Carrigan (Gann), an apparently perfect couple whom Dean later {{refers to as}} [...] "Ozzie and Harriet"; the makers of the <b>meadowsweet</b> wreaths, the Carrigans lived in Seattle a year prior. Realizing that the couple are actually pagan gods, Sam and Dean break into their home, finding human remains in the basement. However, they are captured by the Carrigans and tied to chairs in the kitchen. The gods reveal {{that they have been}} attempting to blend into human society, reducing their annual sacrifices to only a few. They begin preparing Sam and Dean to be sacrificed, but are interrupted by a neighbor at the front door. When the Carrigans return, they find that the brothers have broken free. Knowing that the gods can be killed by evergreen wood, Sam and Dean stab them to death with branches of the Christmas tree. Later on, Dean is surprised to find that Sam has decorated their motel room with Christmas paraphernalia. They exchange gifts, all which were bought from the local gas station, and happily watch a football game on TV.|$|E
500|$|As {{the episode}} opens, a man visits his {{grandson}} for Christmas in Seattle, Washington. He dresses up as Santa Claus, but is {{pulled up the}} chimney and slaughtered by a mysterious figure. One year later, Sam (Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Ackles) pose as FBI agents to investigate a disappearance in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The discovery of a bloody tooth in the fireplace leads Sam to suspect that an evil version of Santamany world lores tell of those who punish the wicked during Christmasis at work. As the brothers search the town and debate about whether to celebrate Christmas that yearDean insists while Sam refusesanother man is taken by a Santa-dressed being. Upon investigation the following day, Sam notices that both families have the same wreath over their fireplaces. The wreath {{is found to be}} made of <b>meadowsweet,</b> an herb often used in pagan rituals to lure gods to a human sacrifice, which leads Sam to believe that they are dealing with Hold Nickar, the god of the winter solstice. Dean later admits that he wants to celebrate Christmas since it will be his last chance tohis demonic pact with a demon in [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part Two" [...] only left him with one year to live. Sam responds that he cannot sit around celebrating and pretending that everything is okay while knowing that Dean will not be alive the next Christmas.|$|E
500|$|The Parrett then {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), <b>meadowsweet</b> (Filipendula ulmaria) and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), common redshank (Tringa totanus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), common teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), as well as birds of prey including the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the hairy click beetle (Synaptus filiformis), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides), Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important European otter (Lutra lutra) population. 282 American mink (Mustela vison) have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging water voles (Arvicola amphibius) to recolonise areas of the Levels {{where they have been}} absent for 10years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also Special Protection Areas), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In addition, some [...] of the Levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area, while other portions are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential. Despite this, there is currently no single conservation designation covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors.|$|E

60|$|This bridge again! (Steps on the bridge.) How {{often have}} I stood With Eva here! The brook among its flowers! Forget-me-not, <b>meadowsweet,</b> willow-herb.

60|$|Then comes Tuberose and <b>Meadowsweet,</b> by Mr. Mark Andre Raffalovich. This {{is really}} a {{remarkable}} little volume, and contains many strange and beautiful poems. To say of these poems that they are unhealthy and bring with them the heavy odours of the hothouse is to point out neither their defect nor their merit, but their quality merely. And though Mr. Raffalovich is not a wonderful poet, still he is a subtle artist in poetry. Indeed, in his way he is a boyish master of curious music and of fantastic rhyme, and can strike on the lute of language so many lovely chords that it seems a pity {{he does not know}} how to pronounce the title of his book and the theme of his songs. For he insists on making 'tuberose' a trisyllable always, {{as if it were a}} potato blossom and not a flower shaped like a tiny trumpet of ivory. However, for the sake of his <b>meadowsweet</b> and his spring-green binding this must be forgiven him. And though he cannot pronounce 'tuberose' aright, at least he can sing of it exquisitely.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hoopdriver {{stroked his}} moustache. [...] "It IS so," [...] {{he said in}} a meditative tone. [...] "Things WILL go on," [...] he said. The faint breath of summer stirred the trees, and a bunch of {{dandelion}} puff lifted among the <b>meadowsweet</b> and struck and broke into a dozen separate threads against his knee. They flew on apart, and sank, as the breeze fell, among the grass: some to germinate, some to perish. His eye followed them until they had vanished.|$|E
6000|$|SIR,--I {{am sorry}} {{not to be}} able to accept the graceful {{etymology}} of your reviewer who calls me to task for not knowing how to pronounce the title of my book Tuberose and <b>Meadowsweet.</b> I insist, he fancifully says, 'on making [...] "tuberose" [...] a trisyllable always, as if it were a potato blossom and not a flower shaped like a tiny trumpet of ivory.' Alas! tuberose is a trisyllable if properly derived from the Latin tuberosus, the lumpy flower, having nothing to do with roses or with trumpets of ivory in name any more than in nature.

60|$|The Vicar {{opened the}} door half {{mechanically}} to let out Crump, and saw Mendham, his curate, coming up the pathway by the hedge of purple vetch and <b>meadowsweet.</b> At that his hand went up to his chin and his eyes grew perplexed. Suppose he was deceived. The Doctor passed the Curate with a sweep of his hand from his hat brim. Crump was an extraordinarily clever fellow, the Vicar thought, and knew far more of anyone's brain than one did oneself. The Vicar felt that so acutely. It made the coming explanation difficult. Suppose he were {{to go back into}} the drawing-room, and find just a tramp asleep on the hearthrug.|$|E
60|$|The churchyard {{was full}} of fine trees. On one side a {{magnificent}} cedar; on the other a great copper beech. Here and there among the tombs and headstones many beautiful blossoming trees rose from the long green grass. The laburnum glowed in the June afternoon sunlight; the lilac, the hawthorn and the clustering <b>meadowsweet</b> which fringed {{the edge of the}} lazy stream mingled their heavy sweetness in sleepy fragrance. The yellow-grey crumbling walls were green in places with wrinkled harts-tongues, and were topped with sweet-williams and spreading house- leek and stone-crop and wild-flowers whose delicious sweetness made for the drowsy repose of perfect summer.|$|E

60|$|And when I write thus of our selves I mean {{our bodies}} {{quite as much}} as our imaginations; {{the two sides of}} us are covered up alike and put alike into disguises and unnatural shapes, we are taught and forced to hide them for the same reasons, from a fear of {{ourselves}} and a fear of the people about us. The sense of beauty, the sense of one's body, the freedom of thought and of desire and the wonder of life, are all interwoven strands. I remember that in the Park of Burnmore one great craving I had was to take off my clothes there altogether, and bathe in a clear place among loosestrife and <b>meadowsweet,</b> and afterwards lie wet and naked upon the soft green turf with the sun shining upon me. But I thought also that that was a very wicked and shameful craving to have, and I never dared give way to it.|$|E

[...] Glide then from out their pitch-black lair [...] Beneath the dark's ensilvered arch, [...] Witches becowled into the air; [...] And iron pine and emerald larch, [...] Tents of delight for ravished bird, [...] Are by loud music thrilled and stirred. [...] Winging the light, with silver feet, [...] Beneath their bowers of fragrance met, [...] In dells of rose and <b>meadowsweet,</b> [...] In mazed dance the fairies flit; [...] While drives his share the Ploughman high [...] Athwart the daisy-powdered sky: [...] Till far away, in thickening dew, [...] Piercing the Eastern shadows through [...] Rilling in crystal clear and still, [...] Light 'gins to tremble on the hill. [...] And like a mist on faint winds borne, [...] Silent, forlorn, wells up the morn. [...] Then the broad sun with burning beams [...] Steeps slope and peak and gilded streams. [...] Then no foot stirs; the brake shakes not; [...] Soundless and wet in its green grot [...] As if asleep, the leaf hangs limp; [...] The white dews drip untrembling down, [...] From bough to bough, orblike, unblown; [...] And in strange quiet, shimmering and still, [...] Morning enshrines the empty hill.|$|E
60|$|At Northchapel Mr. Hoopdriver {{consulted}} his map {{and took}} counsel and weighed his course of action. Petworth seemed a possible resting-place, or Pullborough; Midhurst seemed too near, and any {{place over the}} Downs beyond, too far, and so he meandered towards Petworth, posing himself perpetually and loitering, gathering wild flowers and wondering why they had no names--for {{he had never heard}} of any--dropping them furtively {{at the sight of a}} stranger, and generally 'mucking about.' There were purple vetches in the hedges, <b>meadowsweet,</b> honeysuckle, belated brambles--but the dog-roses had already gone; there were green and red blackberries, stellarias, and dandelions, and in another place white dead nettles, traveller's-joy, clinging bedstraw, grasses flowering, white campions, and ragged robins. One cornfield was glorious with poppies, bright scarlet and purple white, and the blue corn-flowers were beginning. In the lanes the trees met overhead, and the wisps of hay still hung to the straggling hedges. Iri one of the main roads he steered a perilous passage through a dozen surly dun oxen. Here and there were little cottages, and picturesque beer-houses with the vivid brewers' boards of blue and scarlet, and once a broad green and a church, and an expanse of some hundred houses or so. Then he came to a pebbly rivulet that emerged between clumps of sedge loosestrife and forget-me-nots under an arch of trees, and rippled across the road, and there he dismounted, longing to take off shoes and stockings--those stylish chequered stockings were now all dimmed with dust--and paddle his lean legs in the chuckling cheerful water. But instead he sat in a manly attitude, smoking a cigarette, for fear lest the Young Lady in Grey should come glittering round the corner. For the flavour of the Young Lady in Grey was present through it all, mixing with the flowers and all the delight of it, a touch that made this second day quite different from the first, an undertone of expectation, anxiety, and something like regret that would not be ignored.|$|E
6000|$|And {{who that}} loves Italy, and knows England, too, does not echo Browning's wish when April comes round again on dusty Tuscan hilltops?

Milton's England, Shelley's England; the England of the skylark, the dog-rose, the honeysuckle! Not love England, forsooth! Why, I love every flower, every blade of grass in it. Devonshire lane, {{close-cropped}} down, rich water-meadow, bickering brooklet: ah me, how they tug at one's heartstrings in Africa! No son of the soil can love England as those love her very stones who have come from newer lands over sea to her ivy-clad church-towers, her mouldering castles, her immemorial elms, the berries on her holly, the may in her hedgerows. Are not all these bound up in our souls with each cherished line of Shakespeare and Wordsworth? do they not rouse faint echoes of Gray and Goldsmith? Even before I ever set foot in England, how I longed to behold my first cowslip, my first foxglove!
