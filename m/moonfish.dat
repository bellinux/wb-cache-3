500|$|During a {{hazardous}} struggle with an anglerfish in the trench, Dory sees the diving mask and reads the address located at 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. As Dory finishes reading {{the address on}} the mask, Marlin is able to trap the Anglerfish using the eyepiece of the mask. To her own disbelief, Dory remembers the address on her own despite her short-term memory loss. The pair swims on, receiving directions to Sydney from a school of <b>moonfish.</b> After receiving directions from the [...] <b>moonfish,</b> Marlin and Dory encounter a bloom of jellyfish that entraps them [...] and nearly kills them. As a result, Marlin loses consciousness and wakes up on a sea turtle named Crush, who takes Marlin and Dory on the East Australian Current. Marlin tells {{the details of his}} long journey with a group of sea turtles, and his story is spread across the ocean. He also sees how Crush gets along well with his son Squirt.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} game content, {{gameplay}} tweaks and additions {{were made to}} the game as well. The rate of random encounters is slightly lower in the GameCube version but experience points earned are higher per battle to make up for this. Many side quests and side-stories were added to the game as well. Twenty-four new hidden discoveries to be found, a subplot involving collecting <b>Moonfish</b> for a Doctor and a girl named Maria, and a subplot involving a new character named Piastol were all added the game.

2500|$|The Pacific {{blue marlin}} (kajiki) is barbecued or grilled, but {{should not be}} overcooked due to its very low fat content. [...] The broadbill {{swordfish}} (shutome), popular and shipped all over the mainland United States, is high in fat and its steaks may be grilled, broiled, or used in stir-fries. The groupers (hapuu) are most often steamed. The red snapper (onaga) is steamed, poached, or baked. The pink snapper (opakapaka) has a higher fat, and is steamed or baked, served with a light sauce. The Wahoo (ono) is grilled or sautéed, and the dolphin fish (mahimahi) is usually cut into steaks and fried or grilled. The <b>moonfish</b> (opah) is used for broiling, smoking, or making sashimi.|$|E

50|$|Sailfin <b>moonfishes</b> {{are a small}} family, Veliferidae, of lampriform fishes {{found in}} the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Unlike other lampriforms, they live in shallow, coastal waters, of less than 100 m depth, {{rather than in the}} deep ocean. They are also much smaller than most of their relatives, up to 30 cm in length, and have deep, rather than elongated, bodies. They are characterised by their ability to retract the {{anterior}} rays of their dorsal and anal fins into a sheath.|$|R
50|$|Neosilurus hyrtlii {{has been}} given many common names, {{including}} common eel-tail catfish, Glencoe tandan, Hyrtl's tandan, inland catfish, <b>moonfish,</b> moony, Morton's tandan, mottled tandan, salmon catfish, silver <b>moonfish,</b> straight-backed catfish, white tandan, yellow fin tandan and yellow-finned catfish.|$|E

5000|$|These oceanic fishes are pelagic feeders {{that stay}} {{well above the}} sea floor, and {{normally}} occur in waters 100-1000 m deep. They are typically brightly coloured as adults, often with brilliant crimson fins. Lampriforms have highly variable body forms, but they are generally laterally compressed. Some are rounded in lateral view, while others are very elongated. The former are termed bathysomes [...] - [...] "deep-bodies", from Ancient Greek bathýs (βᾶθύς) [...] "deep" [...] + sōma (σῶμα) [...] "body" [...] - [...] and the latter taeniosomes [...] - [...] "ribbon-bodies", Greek tainía (ταινία) [...] "ribbon". They vary greatly in size, too, ranging from less than 30 cm in the sailfin <b>moonfishes</b> (Veliferidae) to Regalecus glesne, the longest of all living bony fishes, which may reach 17 m in length.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conditions}} that restricted {{the establishment of}} human settlements on Montecristo have favoured the preservation of its flora and fauna. Animals and plants once found throughout the Mediterranean still live on the island. Of particular interest are the giant heather formations covering the valley floors and several thousand-year-old oaks that manage to survive at the highest altitudes. Also interesting are the Montecristo viper (Vipera aspis hugyi, a subspecies also present in southern Italy, and today considered introduced by humans) and Discoglossus sardus, an amphibian found only {{in a couple of}} islands in Tuscany and Sardinia. An endemic subspecies of lizard, Podarcis muralis calabresiae, thrives on the island. Montecristo is also a resting place for thousands of migratory birds and is home to large colonies of seabirds (particularly relevant the yelkouan shearwater, [...] critically endangered on the island). The island also hosts the only Italian population of wild goats. The sea environment is quite rich: there are seagrass meadows, sea anemones, sea fans, corals and <b>moonfishes.</b> Until the 1970s the Mediterranean monk seal was also to be found, a critically endangered species that has become extremely rare in Italian waters. Endemic species include the plant Limonium Montis-christi, the invertebrate Oxychilus oglasicola (snail of Monte Cristo), also present on the islet of Scola, near Pianosa, and the reptile Podarcis muralis calabresiae.|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{lookdown}} {{is similar}} to the Atlantic <b>moonfish,</b> it can be distinguished by its dorsal and anal fins, the second ray on each fin being many times longer than the surrounding rays. This gives the dorsal and anal fins a noticeably scythe-like shape. Also, the dorsal fin of the lookdown has 9 spines and 23 rays, while the anal fin has only 3 spines and 18 rays. Like the Atlantic <b>moonfish,</b> it has a deep, rhombus-shaped, laterally-compressed body. The head has the mouth set low and the eyes high.
