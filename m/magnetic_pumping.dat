40|$|Abstract: <b>Magnetic</b> drive <b>pump</b> {{has gotten}} great {{achievement}} {{and has been}} widely used in some special fields. Currently, the researches on <b>magnetic</b> drive <b>pump</b> have focused on hydraulic design, bearing, axial force in China, and a new <b>magnetic</b> drive <b>pump</b> with low flow and high head have been developed overseas. However, low efficiency and large size are the common disadvantages for the <b>magnetic</b> drive <b>pump.</b> In order to study the performance of high-speed <b>magnetic</b> drive <b>pump,</b> FLUENT is used to simulate the inner flow field of <b>magnetic</b> drive <b>pumps</b> with different rotate speeds, and get velocity and pressure distributions of inner flow field.

50|$|To {{heat the}} plasma to higher temperatures, a second heat source was added, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> system. This {{consisted}} of radio-frequency source fed through a coil spread along the vacuum chamber. The frequency is {{chosen to be}} similar to the natural frequency of the particles around the magnetic lines of force, the cyclotron frequency. This causes the particles in the area to gain energy, which causes them to orbit in a wider radius. Since other particles are orbiting their own lines nearby, at a macroscopic level, this change in energy appears as an increase in pressure. According to the ideal gas law, this results in an increase in temperature. Like the ohmic heating, this process also becomes less efficient as the temperature increases, but is still capable of creating very high temperatures. When the frequency is deliberately set close to that of the ion circulation, this is known as ion-cycloron resonance heating, although this name is not widely used.|$|E

We derive {{conditions}} under which <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> can {{be the cause of}} heating of loops rather than of particle acceleration. Candidate sources for such a process are coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Large loops are susceptible to heating primarily of protons by magnetic compressions with periods between 50 and 5000 s, the observed spectrum of the photospheric driver. Efficient heating by pumping occurs since in these large loops the density is low enough that the proton-proton collision time is comparable to the periods of the external compressions.

40|$|Compressional <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> is an {{interaction}} between cyclic magnetic compressions and pitch-angle scattering with the scattering acting as a catalyst to allow the cyclic compressions to energize particles. Compressional <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> of the outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit in the dayside magnetosphere is analyzed by means of computer simulations, wherein solar-wind compressions of the dayside magnetosphere energize electrons with electron pitch-angle scattering by chorus waves and by EMIC. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> is found to produce a weak bulk heating of the electron radiation belt, and it also produces an energetic tail on the electron energy distribution. The amount of energization depends on the robustness of the solar-wind compressions and on the amplitude of the chorus and/or EMIC waves. Chorus-catalyzed pumping is better at energizing medium-energy (50 - 200 keV) electrons than it is at energizing higher energy electrons; at high energies (500 keV - 2 MeV) EMIC-catalyzed pumping is a stronger energizer. The magnetic-pumping simulation results are compared with energy-diffusion calculations for chorus waves in the dayside magnetosphere; in general compressional <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> {{is found to be}} weaker at accelerating electrons than is chorus-driven energy diffusion. In circumstances when solar-wind compressions are robust and when EMIC waves are present in the dayside magnetosphere without the presence of chorus, EMIC-catalyzed <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> could be the dominant energization mechanism in the dayside magnetosphere, but at such times loss-cone losses will be strong...|$|E

40|$|We {{determine}} the nonlinear drift velocities {{of the mean}} magnetic field and nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion in a turbulent convection. We show that the nonlinear drift velocities are caused by the three kinds of the inhomogeneities, i. e., inhomogeneous turbulence; the nonuniform fluid density and the nonuniform turbulent heat flux. The inhomogeneous turbulence results in the well-known turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic velocities. The nonlinear drift velocities of the mean magnetic field cause the small-scale magnetic buoyancy and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> effects in the turbulent convection. These phenomena {{are different from the}} large-scale magnetic buoyancy and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> effects which are due to the effect of the mean magnetic field on the large-scale density stratified fluid flow. The small-scale magnetic buoyancy and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> can be stronger than these large-scale effects when the mean magnetic field is smaller than the equipartition field. We discuss the small-scale magnetic buoyancy and <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> effects {{in the context of the}} solar and stellar turbulent convection. We demonstrate also that the nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion in the turbulent convection is anisotropic even for a weak mean magnetic field. In particular, it is enhanced in the radial direction. The magnetic fluctuations due to the small-scale dynamo increase the turbulent magnetic diffusion of the toroidal component of the mean magnetic field, while they do not affect the turbulent magnetic diffusion of the poloidal field.

40|$|Based on {{the rate}} of {{expansion}} of the solar wind, the plasma should cool rapidly {{as a function of}} distance to the Sun. Observations show this is not the case. In this work, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> model is developed as a possible explanation for the heating and the generation of power-law distribution functions observed in the solar wind plasma. Most previous studies in this area focus on the role that the dissipation of turbulent energy on microscopic kinetic scales plays in the overall heating of the plasma. However, with <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> particles are energized by the largest scale turbulent fluctuations, thus bypassing the energy cascade. In contrast to other models, we include the pressure anisotropy term, providing a channel for the large scale fluctuations to heat the plasma directly. In this work a complete set of coupled differential equations describing the evolution, and energization, of the distribution function are derived, as well as an approximate closed form solution. Numerical simulations using the VPIC kinetic code are applied to verify the model's analytical predictions. The results of the model for realistic solar wind scenario are computed, where thermal streaming of particles are important for generating a phase shift between the magnetic perturbations and the pressure anisotropy. In turn, averaged over a pump cycle, the phase shift permits mechanical work to be converted directly to heat in the plasma. The results of this scenario show that <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> may account for {{a significant portion of the}} solar wind energization. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Coherent {{magnetic}} fields are often {{believed to be}} generated by the combination of stretching by differential rotation and turbulent amplification of magnetic field, via the so-called alpha effect. The latter is known to exist in helical turbulence, which is envisioned to arise due to both rotation and convection in solar-type stars. In this contribution, a turbulent flow driven by a nonhelical inhomogeneous forcing and its kinematic dynamo action are studied for a uniform magnetic field {{in the background of}} a linear shear flow. By using a quasilinear analysis and a nonperturbative method utilizing a time-dependent wave number, turbulence property and electromotive force are computed for arbitrary shear strength. Due to the large-scale shear flow, the turbulence is highly anisotropic, as a consequence, so is the electromotive force. The latter is found to exist even without rotation due to the combined effect of shear flow and inhomogeneous forcing, containing not only the alpha effect but also <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> (the gamma effect representing a transport of magnetic flux by turbulence). Specifically, without shear, only the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> exists, aligned with the direction of inhomogeneity. For a weak but nonzero shear, the combined effects of shear and inhomogeneous forcing modify the structure of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> when the inhomogeneity is in the plane of the shear flow, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pumping</b> becoming bidimensional in that plane. It also induces an alpha tensor which has nondiagonal components. When the inhomogeneity is perpendicular to the plane of the shear flow, the alpha effect has three nonzero diagonal components and one off-diagonal component. However, for a sufficiently strong shear, the gamma and alpha effects are suppressed due to shear stabilization which damps turbulence. A simplified dynamo model is then proposed where a large-scale dynamo arises due to the combined effect of shear flow and inhomogeneous forcing. In particular, the growth of a large-scale axisymmetric magnetic field is demonstrated in case of an inhomogeneity which is perpendicular to the plane of the shear flow. Interesting implications of these results for the structure of {{magnetic fields}} in star with slow rotation are discussed. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10. 1063 / 1. 3551700...|$|E

40|$|We perform {{idealised}} numerical {{simulations of}} magnetic buoyancy instabilities {{in a model}} of the solar tachocline. We introduce a simplified model of <b>magnetic</b> flux <b>pumping</b> in an upper layer (the convection zone), and study the effects of its inclusion on the evolution of buoyancy instabilities in a lower layer (the radiative interior). We study its effects on the instability of both a preconceived magnetic slab and of a shear-generated magnetic layer. In the former, we find that in the regime in which the downward pumping velocity is comparable with the Alfven speed of the <b>magnetic</b> layer, flux <b>pumping</b> is able to hold back the bulk of the magnetic field, with only small pockets of strong field able to rise into the upper layer. In simulations in which the magnetic layer is generated by shear, we find that the shear velocity is not necessarily required to exceed that of the pumping (therefore the kinetic energy of the shear is not required to exceed that of the overlying convection), for strong localised pockets of magnetic field to be produced which can rise into the upper layer. This is because <b>magnetic</b> flux <b>pumping</b> acts to store the field below the interface, allowing it to be amplified both by the shear, and by vortical fluid motions, until pockets of field can achieve sufficient strength to rise into the upper layer. In addition, we find that the interface between the two layers is a natural location for the production of strong vertical gradients in the magnetic field. If these gradients are sufficiently strong to allow the development of magnetic buoyancy instabilities, strong shear is not necessarily required to drive them (c. f. previous work by Vasil & Brummell).
