40|$|Paddy straw {{mushroom}} (Volvariella volvacea) is {{the most}} popular mushroom in the rural areas of the Philippines and was commonly known to Filipinos even before the generation of a technology for its artificial cultivation was launched in the country. This mushroom is called kabuteng dayami or kabuteng saging by Filipinos since it naturally grows on paddy straw and decomposing piles of banana leaves and pseudostems. Commercial <b>mushroom</b> <b>growers,</b> who were at the same time rice farmers used paddy straw and banana leaves. However, due to the intensification of rice production (i. e. from one cropping season to two) as a result of efficient irrigation practices and the availability of high-yielding but short duration rice varieties, most <b>mushroom</b> <b>growers</b> became full time rice growers. Unlike the commercial production of paddy straw mushroom in neighboring countries such as China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand, production in the Philippines is still a backyard undertaking. Attempts to upgrade its production were made {{in the early part of}} the 1990 ’s with financial assistance from international donors (Tharun, 1993; Ferchak and Croucher, 1993).

Mushroom workers {{may be at risk}} of these as a consequence. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in mushroom workers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study assessed 4 weeks of respiratory symptoms among mushroom workers divided into four categories of exposure, using a self-administered respiratory questionnaire and spirometry. RESULTS: The population of 191 subjects was predominantly (66 %) from Eastern Europe; 61 % were women and 39 % were under 30. It included 73 growers, 38 composters, 26 administrators and 52 packers. Among all workers, there was a high prevalence (67 %) of one or more respiratory symptoms which did not appear to vary by age, gender, pack-years of smoking or duration of employment. There was a significant improvement in respiratory symptoms in workers during absence from the workplace (P < 0. 001). Spirometry readings across all groups were within normal values. Symptom profiles suggest that as many as 22 workers had symptoms of airways disease; 18 (82 %) of these were <b>mushroom</b> <b>growers.</b> Growers {{were significantly more likely to}} have symptoms consistent with airways disease than all other workers, odds ratio 9. 2 (95 % CI 3. 0 - 28. 4).

50|$|Verticillium dry bubble, {{recently}} named Lecanicillium fungicola, is a mycoparasite that attacks white button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), among other hosts, during its generative period. L. fungicola infects the casing layer on the cap structure of several edible mushrooms.

Severity of disease depends on several factors, including timing of infection and environmental conditions.
