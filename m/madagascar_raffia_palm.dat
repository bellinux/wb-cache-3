40|$|The insects {{associated}} with <b>palm</b> wine from <b>raffia</b> <b>palm</b> (Raphia hookeri) were studied in three villages in Southeastern, Nigeria for four weeks. The insects were sieved out after 24 hours from each 10 litres of <b>raffia</b> <b>palm.</b> Gas chromatography {{was used to}} analyse the <b>raffia</b> <b>palm</b> wine after 24 hours. The daily collection of the insects lasted for 28 days between February and March, 2008.

A total of eight insect species made up of seven genera represented by seven families – Formicidea, Apidae, Drosophilidae, Sarcophagidae, Calliphoridae, Nitidulidae and Curculronidae were obtained. There was a preponderance in the collection of Camponotus maculatus, Maycodrosophylla sp. and Lepidoptera larvae in all the site with C. acvapimensis and Apis mellifera L. collected in fairly large numbers from all the sites (villages).

40|$|Abstract: This work {{studied the}} {{comparison}} {{of the effects of}} acetylation and alkali treatments on the physical and morphological properties of <b>raffia</b> <b>palm</b> fibre polyester composites. The clean <b>raffia</b> <b>palm</b> fibres obtained from <b>raffia</b> <b>palm</b> tree were pre-treated using acetylation and alkali (mercerization) methods. The treated fibres were dried, ground and incorporate into polyester resin at various fibre loads of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %. The treated fibre composite samples were subjected to tensile tests according to ASTM D 638 using Instron model 3369. The microhardness test was done using microhardness tester (LECO/M 700 AT). The scanning electron micrographs of the samples were taken using Scanning electron microscope (SEM) machine, model EVO/MA 10. The results of the analyses showed that the composites of the acetylated fibre improved the properties of the composites for ultimate tensile strength, better than the composites of alkali(mercerized) treated fibre, while the latter gave better modulus of elasticity and extension at break. Both the treatment methods showed increase in microhardness for the composites as fibre loads increases, but the acetylated fibre composites gave better results at each of the fibre loads of 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %, studied. The SEM of the acetylated fibre composites, especially the 5 % fibre load...|$|R
