5|$|Rhys tries {{unsuccessfully to}} get Robbie O'Brien (Shaun Goss) {{to quit the}} {{surgical}} program. He then turns his attention to Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and plots to take her spot on the program instead. He pursues Erin romantically and tries to distract her away from her work, so she will be kicked off the program and he can take her place. Barber said the scheme sees Rhys at his manipulative best, he realises Erin is vulnerable and he strikes. Jansen told a writer for TV Week that Erin is a bit reluctant to accept when Rhys asks her out. She thinks that someone like Rhys would not normally be interested in her, but she is flattered by the attention. Jansen added Erin is unaware it is all an act. Kate realises what Rhys is doing and interferes with his plan. Barber explained that Kate's feelings about the matter <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> to Rhys as his sole objective is {{to get into the}} program. He does not mind that Kate is appalled at Erin becoming a casualty of his scheme.|$|E
25|$|In {{modal logic}} (which studies {{theories}} of possibility and necessity), he has argued {{in favour of}} the non-normal system S7, rather than more traditional systems such as S4 or S5. Unlike other systems, S7 allows logicians to choose between competing logics, each of which, if true, would be necessarily true, but none of which are necessarily the correct system of necessary truths. As Irvine puts it, “just as being physically possible <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> more than being consistent with the laws of physics, being logically possible <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> more than being consistent with the laws of logic. However, this leaves open the question of which logic and which consistency relation are to be adopted. S7 gives us the language to discuss the possible denial of necessary truths. S7 gives us the language to assert not only that some propositions really are necessary; it gives us the language also to note that their denials, although impossible, remain possibly possible.” In other words, there is a mechanism in which even sets of necessary truths {{can be compared to}} their alternatives.|$|E

[...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed.

[...] 1UP.com explained why the series was not immensely popular at first in North America; American console gamers were not used to the idea of RPGs, and they said that it would take a decade for the genre to be [...] "flashy enough to distract from all of those words they made you read". GameCritics' Chi Kong Lui wrote that the game added realism to video games, and added, [...] "If a player perished in Dragon Warrior, he or she had to suffer the dire consequences of losing progress and precious gold. That element of death evoked a sense of instinctive fear and tension for survival." [...] This, he said, allowed players to identify with the main character on a much larger scale. IGN writer Mark Nix compared the game's seemingly archaic plot to more modern RPGs; he said: [...] "Noble blood <b>means</b> <b>nothing</b> when the society is capitalist, aristocratic, or militaristic.
