5|$|AML {{is treated}} {{initially}} with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission; people may {{go on to}} receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into the genetics of AML {{has resulted in the}} availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person, as well as how long that person is likely to survive. The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CML) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E

25|$|The American Cancer Society {{estimates}} that in 2014, about 5,980 {{new cases of}} chronic <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukemia</b> were diagnosed, and about 810 people died of the disease. This means that a little over 10% of all newly diagnosed leukemia cases will be chronic <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukemia.</b> The average risk of a person getting this disease is 1 in 588. The disease {{is more common in}} men than women, and more common in whites than African-Americans. The average age at diagnosis is 64 years, and this disease is rarely seen in children.|$|E
40|$|The Pax 5 gene encodes the B-cell-specific {{activator}} protein {{which is a}} key regulator in development and differentiation of B-cell. We studied the expression of Pax 5 in hematologic malignancies to evaluate the diagnostic utility as a B cell marker. Materials included 70 B cell lymphomas, 26 T cell lymphomas, 53 acute leukemias, and 6 multiple myelomas (MMs). Representative areas from the paraffin embedded tissues were selected for tissue microarray, and the expressions of Pax 5 was immunohistochemically evaluated. Pax 5 was strongly expressed {{in most of the}} B cell lymphomas; 44 of 47 diffuse large B cell lymphomas (93. 6 %), 15 of 16 marginal zone B cell lymphomas (93. 8 %), all 3 mantle cell lymphomas, 2 follicular lymphomas, and 2 Burkitt's lymphomas (100 %). However, Pax 5 was expressed in only one of 26 T cell lymphomas. Among leukemias, it was expressed in 10 of the 14 B acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALLs) (72. 4 %), but also in 3 of the 6 T ALLs (50 %), 13 of the 26 acute <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukemias</b> (AMLs) (50 %) and in all 3 ALL arising in chronic <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukemias</b> and 4 mixed B ALL and AML. In MMs, Pax 5 was negative in all cases. We concluded that Pax 5 is very useful B cell marker in classification of lymphomas, but not of acute leukemias...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLeukemia {{stem cells}} are defined as {{transformed}} hematopoietic stem cells or committed progenitor cells that have amplified or acquired the stem cell capacity for self-renewal, albeit in a poorly regulated fashion. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Huntly and colleagues report a striking difference {{in the ability of}} two leukemia-associated fusion proteins, MOZ-TIF 2 and BCR-ABL, to transform myeloid progenitor populations. This rigorous study supports the idea of a hierarchy among leukemia-associated protooncogenes for their ability to endow committed myeloid progenitors with the self-renewal capacity driving leukemic stem cell propagation, and sheds new light on the pathogenesis of chronic and acute <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukemias...</b>|$|R

No distinctive clinical findings were noted in either patient group; however, thrombo-cytopenia typically was more prominent in adults. Adult AML-M 0 also {{was associated with}} an immature myeloid profile (CD 34 +, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase positive, CD 13 +, and CD 33 +), in contrast with pediatric AML-M 0, which usually lacked terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase or CD 34 but expressed bright CD 33 with weak or negative CD 13...|$|R
25|$|Although {{some risk}} exists for {{developing}} acute <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukemia,</b> about 50% of deaths {{occur as a}} result of bleeding or infection. However, leukemia that occurs {{as a result of}} myelodysplasia is notoriously resistant to treatment.|$|E

The C 57 BL resistance to erythroblastosis appears {{to be controlled by}} a single dominant gene in first and second backcrosses to BALB/c. This resistance to erythroblastosis is distinct from other genes known to affect susceptibility to Friend virus including Fv- 1, Fv- 2, H- 2, Rfv- 3, Fv- 4, and Rmcf.

40|$|SummaryThe {{mammalian}} genome contains {{several hundred}} microRNAs that regulate gene expression through modulation of target mRNAs. Here, we report a fragile chromosomal region lost in specific hematopoietic malignancies. This 7 Mb region encodes about 12 % of all genomic microRNAs, including miR- 203. This microRNA is additionally hypermethylated in several hematopoietic tumors, including chronic <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukemias</b> and some acute lymphoblastic leukemias. A putative miR- 203 target, ABL 1, is specifically activated in these hematopoietic malignancies {{in some cases}} as a BCR-ABL 1 fusion protein (Philadelphia chromosome). Re-expression of miR- 203 reduces ABL 1 and BCR-ABL 1 fusion protein levels and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in an ABL 1 -dependent manner. Thus, miR- 203 functions as a tumor suppressor, and re-expression of this microRNA might have therapeutic benefits in specific hematopoietic malignancies...|$|R

40|$|Imatinib, {{which is}} an {{inhibitor}} of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, has been a remarkable success {{for the treatment of}} Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukemias</b> (CMLs). However, a significant proportion of patients chronically treated with imatinib develop resistance because of the acquisition of mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL. Mutations occur at residues directly implicated in imatinib binding or, more commonly, at residues important for the ability of the kinase to adopt the specific closed (inactive) conformation to which imatinib binds. In our quest to develop new BCR-ABL inhibitors, we chose to target regions outside the ATP-binding site of this enzyme because these compounds offer the potential to be unaffected by mutations that make CML cells resistant to imatinib. Here we describe the activity of one compound, ON 012380, that can specifically inhibit BCR-ABL and induce cell death of Ph+ CML cells at a concentration of 100 mg/kg concentration of this agent is well tolerated in rodents, without any hematotoxicity...|$|R

40|$|Acute <b>myelogenous</b> <b>leukemias</b> (AMLs) are {{characterized}} by medullary and extramedullary invasion. We hypothesized that a supramolecular complex, the leukemia-cell invadosome, which contains certain integrins, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and other as-yet unidentified proteins, is essential for tissue invasion and may be central to the phenotypic diversity observed in the clinic. Here we show that the specific binding of MMP- 9 to leukocyte surface β 2 integrin is required for pericellular proteolysis and migration of AML-derived cells. An efficient antileukemia effect was obtained by the hexapeptide HFDDDE, a motif of the MMP- 9 catalytic domain that mediates integrin binding: HFDDDE prevented proMMP- 9 binding, transmigration through a human endothelial cell layer, and extracellular matrix degradation. Notably, the functional protein anchorage between β 2 integrin and proMMP- 9 described in this study does not involve the enzymatic active sites targeted by known MMP inhibitors. Taken together, our results provide a biochemical working definition for the human leukemia invadosome.

Bcr-Abl inhibited caspase activation by cytochrome c added to cell-free lysates and prevented apoptosis when cytochrome c was microinjected into intact cells. Bcr-Abl acted posttranslationally to prevent the cytochrome c-induced binding of Apaf- 1 to procaspase 9. Although Bcr-Abl prevented interaction of endogenous Apaf- 1 with the recombinant prodomain of caspase 9, it did not affect the association of endogenous caspase 9 with the isolated Apaf- 1 caspase recruitment domain (CARD) or Apaf- 1 lacking WD- 40 repeats. These data suggest that Apaf- 1 recruitment of caspase 9 is faulty in the presence of Bcr-Abl and that cytochrome c/dATP-induced exposure of the Apaf- 1 CARD is likely defective. These data provide a novel locus of Bcr-Abl antiapoptotic action and suggest a distinct mechanism of apoptosomal inhibition...|$|R
