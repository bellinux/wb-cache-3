5|$|Aspleniummontanum is a small, {{evergreen}} fern which {{grows in}} tufts. The leaves are bluish-green and highly divided, proceeding {{from a long}} and often drooping stalk. A.montanum is <b>monomorphic,</b> with no difference in form between sterile and fertile fronds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is widely {{regarded}} as sexually <b>monomorphic,</b> males have been suggested to grow more quickly, and in some naturally occurring strains, males are noted to possess dark blotches on the base of their dorsal fins. The species reaches sexual maturity around one year of age, and continues to reproduce for 9–10 years. Frequency and timing of spawning {{may be related to the}} occurrence of rain. A. ocellatus fish are biparental substrate spawners, though detailed information regarding their reproduction in the wild is scarce.|$|E
5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} is {{considered}} overall sexually <b>monomorphic,</b> but seasonally fluctuating sexual dimorphism {{in terms of}} body mass has been recorded. While the body mass of both sexes fluctuates over the year {{as a function of}} food availability, being highest in the rainy season, the differing behavioral repertoires of the sexes lead to sex-specific patterns in this fluctuation. For example, male body mass increases prior to the mating season due to a substantial increase in testes volume that likely enhances the males' success in sperm competition.|$|E
5|$|Meat ant {{workers may}} be {{confused}} with those of I. lividus, as the two appear similar and are grouped in the same species complex. I. lividus and the much more localised I. spadius can be distinguished from {{other members of the}} I. purpureus group by the shape of the pronotum. Aside from colour differentiation that was a key morphological character to distinguish I. purpureus and the synonym I. greensladei from each other, some meat ant populations exhibit polymorphism despite being <b>monomorphic</b> (occurs in a particular form); specifically, body size among meat ants may vary geographically. For example, those that are found in very hot regions tend to be larger, whereas those found in regions of high humidity tend to be smaller than average. Examined workers once referred to as I. greensladei from southwestern Western Australia have erect setae on the genae (lateral sclerites), whereas those studied elsewhere have glabrous genae, meaning that these areas have no hairs. Such patterns are most likely clinal, where several characteristics may gradually differentiate over a geographical area. The colour of the setae throughout the body and the iridescence may vary geographically. For example, populations restricted to the coasts of Western Australia usually have pale setae, compared to most colonies throughout the country, which have the common blackish setae. In 1993, Shattuck could not separate populations with pale setae when other key diagnostic traits that would separate these populations were not considered. Meat ants from the Western Australian wheatbelt and goldfields show different iridescence; the iridescence in some collected specimens ranged from pale greenish-blue to yellowish-green, especially around the humeri (a structure which forms the basal corner of an insect's wing or wing case) and frons. The variation of the iridescence is, however, a consistent pattern found in other Iridomyrmex species with little distinction, making it a subtle character. The colour variation is less marked in all collected specimens of I. purpureus, as well as its close relative I. viridiaeneus, which is found in dry regions around the south-western regions. Shattuck further notes that populations found throughout the Northern Territory and South Australia have reduced pubescence on the first gastral tergite, but this is different elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Whether a {{population}} is evolutionarily stable does not relate to its genetic diversity: it can be genetically <b>monomorphic</b> or polymorphic.|$|E
25|$|To {{the west}} the female is <b>monomorphic,</b> {{mimicking}} {{species of the}} oriental and Australasian danaid genus Euploea. Eastwards H. bolina is frequently polymorphic and most forms are then non-mimetic. In areas where it resembles Euploea the butterfly has usually been designated a Batesian mimic.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium septentrionale {{is a small}} fern which {{grows in}} dense {{clusters}} superficially resembling tufts of grass. The long, dark stems support narrow, leathery leaf blades, which may appear slightly forked at the tip. The fronds are <b>monomorphic,</b> with no difference in shape or size between fertile and sterile fronds.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium ×trudellii {{is a small}} fern, with {{evergreen}} fronds {{growing in}} tufts. It is similar to A.pinnatifidum, with a triangular leaf blade, pinnatifid (lobed) in the upper part, with a long, drawn-out tip. The fronds are <b>monomorphic,</b> showing little or no difference between sterile and fertile fronds.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium pinnatifidum {{is a small}} fern {{with bright}} green, wrinkled, pinnatifid (lobed) fronds. These form evergreen, {{perennial}} tufts. Notable characteristics are the shiny stem, dark only at the base, and the long-tapering, variably lobed leaf blades. The fronds are <b>monomorphic,</b> the sterile and fertile fronds appearing {{the same size and}} shape.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} {{mutation rate}} {{used by the}} geneticists is more questionable. They often use different mutation rates and studies frequently arrive at vastly different conclusions. NRY and mtDNA may be so susceptible to drift that some ancient patterns may have become obscured. Another assumption is that population genealogies are approximated by allele genealogies. Guido Barbujani points out that this only holds if population groups develop from a genetically <b>monomorphic</b> set of founders. Barbujani argues {{that there is no}} reason to believe that Europe was colonised by <b>monomorphic</b> populations. This would result in an overestimation of haplogroup age, thus falsely extending the demographic history of Europe into the Late Paleolithic rather than the Neolithic era. Greater certainty about chronology may be obtained from studies of ancient DNA (see below), but so far these have been comparatively few.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium ×gravesii {{is a small}} fern, whose fronds grow in loosely bundled tufts. Its stem {{below the}} leaf blade is a shiny purplish-brown, while the green, {{narrowly}} triangular blades are cut into pinnae near the base, which diminish into lobes in the upper part. The fronds are <b>monomorphic,</b> showing little or no difference between sterile and fertile fronds.|$|E
25|$|The Banggai {{cardinalfish}} {{are sexually}} <b>monomorphic.</b> The pairs form {{up to two}} weeks prior to spawning. The female courts the male from pair formation until spawning. The female's size determines the fecundity and egg size, but the male's size determines the reproductive output, or {{the amount of the}} eggs that the pair produces. Therefore, pairing tends to occur among individuals of similar sizes, so the male is able to care for all the eggs that female produces.|$|E
25|$|A key fact, not {{realised}} initially, is {{the advantage}} of the heterozygotes, which survive better than either of the homozygotes. This affects the caterpillars as well as the moths, in spite of the caterpillars being <b>monomorphic</b> in appearance (they are twig mimics). In practice heterozygote advantage puts a limit to the effect of selection, since neither homozygote can reach 100% of the population. For this reason, {{it is likely that the}} carbonaria allele was in the population originally, pre-industrialisation, at a low level. With the recent reduction in pollution, the balance between the forms has already shifted back significantly.|$|E
25|$|Only certain subsets of swallowtails {{practice}} mimicry. Species {{differ in}} whether {{one or both}} sexes is mimetic, and whether the mimicry is <b>monomorphic</b> or polymorphic. A phenomenon which has received particular attention is female-limited polymorphism, in which only the females of a species are mimetic and polymorphic, often mimicking different, distantly-related aposematic butterflies. This polymorphism is seen in Papilo dardanus, the African swallowtail butterfly, whose females have three different morphs for wing color pattern: a black-and-white pattern for Batesian mimicry, a black-and-yellow pattern that resembles the males of the species, and a pattern with orange patches that resembles the elderly males of the species. Given that the males of the species, which do not have Batesian mimicry, are preyed upon much more frequently by predators than the females, an ongoing question is why females would exhibit the non-mimetic wing pattern, which would seemingly lower their fitness compared to the mimicry form.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} ants have been {{observed}} attacking queens and killing them. Predatory ants include: Ectatomma edentatum, Ephebomyrmex spp., Lasius neoniger, Pheidole spp., Pogonomyrmex badius, and Conomyrma insana, which {{is among the most}} significant. C. insana ants are known to be effective predators against founding queens in studied areas of Northern Florida. The pressure of attacks initiated by C. insana increase over time, causing queens to exhibit different reactions, including escaping, concealment, or defence. Most queens that are attacked by these ants are ultimately killed. Queens that are in groups have higher chances of survival than solitary queens if they are attacked by S. geminata. Ants can attack queens on the ground and invade nests by stinging and dismembering them. Other ants such as P. porcula try to take the head and gaster, and C. clara invade in groups. Also, certain ants try to drag queens out of their nests by pulling on the antennae or legs. Small, <b>monomorphic</b> ants rely on recruitment to kill queens and do not attack them until reinforcements arrive. Aside from killing the queen, some ants may steal the eggs for consumption or emit a repellent that is effective against red imported fire ants. Certain ant species may raid colonies and destroy them.|$|E
500|$|In general, green-head ants are <b>monomorphic</b> (occurs in {{a single}} form), {{measuring}} [...] in length and varying in colour, ranging from green-blue to green-purple. Their exoskeletons are hard and heavily armoured with a single-segmented waist.|$|E
500|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is a small}} fern {{with dark}} green, pinnate-pinnatifid to bipinnate fronds. These form evergreen, {{perennial}} tufts. Notable characteristics are the dark stem, whose color extends well up the axis of the leaf blade, a deeply cut [...] lobe or pinnule {{at the base of}} each pinna, and toothed pinna edges. However, some of these characteristics are variable, and may not be observed in all individuals of A.bradleyi. Some specimens have rounded, rather than toothed edges and others lack dark coloration throughout most of the stem. The fronds are <b>monomorphic,</b> the sterile and fertile fronds appearing the same size and shape.|$|E
500|$|The saffron crocus is {{a genetically}} <b>monomorphic</b> clone native to Southwest Asia; it was {{probably}} first cultivated in or near Persia. The wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus was likely Crocus cartwrightianus, which originated in Crete and Greece; C.thomasii and C.pallasii are other possible sources. The saffron crocus is now a triploid that is [...] "self-incompatible" [...] and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant meiosis and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproductionall propagation is by vegetative multiplication via manual [...] "divide-and-set" [...] of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation. If C.sativus is a mutant form of C.cartwrightianus, then it may have emerged via plant breeding, which would have selected for elongated stigmas, in late Bronze Age Crete.|$|E
500|$|Species of this genus {{are also}} characterised by their {{elongated}} mandibles and large compound eyes that provide excellent vision. They vary in colour and size, ranging from [...] Although workers and queens {{are hard to}} distinguish from each other due to their similar appearance, males are identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. Almost all Myrmecia species are <b>monomorphic,</b> with little variation among workers of a given species. Some queens are ergatoid and have no wings, while others have either stubby or completely developed wings. Nests are mostly found in soil, {{but they can be}} found in rotten wood and under rocks. One species does not nest in the ground at all; its colonies can only be found in trees.|$|E
500|$|The meat ant is <b>monomorphic</b> (occurs in a {{particular}} form), although {{there is evidence that}} certain populations can be polymorphic. It is characterised by its dark-bluish body and red head. It is a medium to large species, measuring [...] The workers and males are approximately the same sizes at [...] and , respectively. The queens are the largest and appear mostly black, measuring [...] The iridescence in workers ranges from green or blue to plain green and purple, varying in different body parts and castes. Meat ants inhabit open and warm areas in large, oval-shaped mounds that are accompanied by many entrance holes. The nest area is always cleared of vegetation and covered with materials including gravel, pebbles and dead vegetation. They are also polydomous, where a colony may be established in a series of satellite nests connected by well-defined paths and trails. Satellite nests are constructed away from the main nest and nearby areas with valuable food sources so workers can exploit them.|$|E
500|$|Myrmecia ants {{are easily}} noticeable, {{due to their}} large mandibles, and large {{compound}} eyes that provide excellent vision, and a powerful sting that they use to kill prey. Each of their eyes contains 3,000 facets, making them the second largest in the ant world. Size varies widely, ranging from [...] in length. The largest Myrmecia species is M. brevinoda, with workers measuring M. brevinoda workers are also {{the largest in the}} world. Almost all species are <b>monomorphic,</b> but M. brevinoda is the only known species where polymorphism exists. It is well known that two worker subcastes exist, but this does not distinguish them as two different polymorphic forms. This {{may be due to the}} lack of food during winter and they could be incipient colonies. The division of labour is based on the size of ant, rather than its age, with the larger workers foraging for food or keeping guard outside the nest, while the smaller workers tend to the brood.|$|E
500|$|The {{wild-type}} of {{the species}} has 8 or 9 black vertical bars on a blue-grey body, along with a dark blotch on the operculum. Juvenile convict cichlids are <b>monomorphic</b> until they reach sexual maturity. The male is mostly gray with light black stripes along the body. Males are larger than females, and they have more pointed ventral, dorsal and anal fins which often extend into filaments. In addition, older males frequently develop vestigial fatty lumps on their foreheads. Unusually for fish, the female is more highly coloured. She has more intense black bands across the body, and pink to orange colouration in the ventral region and on the dorsal fin. Mature males in the wild have a standard length of 6.3 to 6.6 centimeters, and breeding females are 4.2 to 5.5 centimeters long. The maximum standard length {{has been reported to}} be 10 centimeters, with total length near [...] The body weight of the fish is about [...] Selective breeding has resulted in a leucistic strain, which lacks the dark barring of the wild type. These are known commonly as white convicts, pink convicts, gold convicts, and A. nigrofasciata [...] "Kongo". The leucistic colouration is caused by a mutation in an autosomal gene and is recessively inherited.|$|E

2500|$|The domesticated saffron crocus, Crocus sativus, is an autumn-flowering {{perennial}} plant {{unknown in}} the wild. It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering Crocus cartwrightianus, which {{is also known as}} [...] "wild saffron" [...] and originated in Crete or mainland Greece. An origin in Southwest Asia, although often suspected, has been disapproved by botanical research. The saffron crocus probably resulted when C.cartwrightianus was subjected to extensive artificial selection by growers seeking longer stigmas. C.thomasii and C.pallasii are other possible sources. As a genetically <b>monomorphic</b> clone, it slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia.|$|E

2500|$|The pitcher lid or {{operculum}} is ovate-elliptic {{and measures}} around 5.2cm in length by 4cm in width. It has a rounded to [...] apex and a rounded base. No appendages are {{present on the}} underside of the lid. Though the describing authors noted the presence of a basal midline ridge on the lower lid surface of a herbarium specimen, they concluded that this was likely a preservation artefact. This ridge was flat-topped and around 10mm long by 1mm wide. The nectar glands of the lower surface of the lid number more than 100, at least 95% of which are of a single type that is quite uniform in size and shape. These <b>monomorphic</b> glands are [...] or slightly elliptic and measure 0.4–0.5mm by 0.6–0.75mm (rarely up to 0.9mm), with a narrow border of some 0.05mm. The area around the upper part of the basal ridge bears around 20 narrowly elliptic-oblong glands, each measuring roughly 0.75 by 0.25mm. The lid–peristome junction has deeply sunken, unbordered glands around 0.25mm in diameter. Sessile glands similar to those found on the stem are distributed only near the lid margin, though they are few and inconspicuous. An [...] (unbranched) spur is inserted near the base of the lid.|$|E
2500|$|The red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} is polymorphic with two different castes of workers: minor workers and major workers (soldiers). Like many ants that exhibit polymorphism, young, smaller ants do not forage {{and tend to}} the brood, instead, while the larger workers go out and forage. In incipient colonies, polymorphism does not exist, but instead they are occupied by <b>monomorphic</b> workers called [...] "minims" [...] or [...] "nanitics". The average head-width in tested colonies increases {{during the first six}} months of development. In five-year-old colonies, the head width of minor workers decreases, but for major workers, the head-width remains the same. The total weight of a major worker is twice that of a minor worker when they first arrive, and by six months, major workers are four times heavier than minor workers. Once major workers develop, they can make up a large portion of the workforce, with as many as 35% being major workers in a single colony. This does not affect colony performance, as polymorphic colonies and nests with small workers produce broods at roughly the same rate, and polymorphism is not an advantage or disadvantage when food sources are not limited. However, polymorphic colonies are more energetically efficient, and under conditions where food is limited, polymorphism may provide a small advantage in brood production, but this depends on the levels of food stress.|$|E
2500|$|There are now {{significant}} {{reports of}} ictal EEGs in 20 cases, which objectively document the seizures of Panayiotopoulos syndrome and their variable localisation at onset. [...] All these recorded seizures occurred while {{the children were}} asleep. The onset of the electrical ictal discharge was mainly occipital (7 cases) or frontal (7 cases)and consisted of rhythmic <b>monomorphic</b> decelerating theta or delta activity with small spikes. The ﬁrst clinical manifestation which appeared long (1–10 minutes) after the electrical onset, usually consisted of opening of the eyes as if the children were waking from sleep. At this stage, usually the children responded, often correctly, to simple questions. On many occasions, tachycardia was the first objective sign when ||ECG|| was recorded. Vomiting was a common ictal symptom occurring at any stage of the seizures but not as the ﬁrst clinical manifestation. Seizures associated with ictal vomiting {{did not have any}} particular localization or lateralization. Vomiting occurred mainly when the ictal discharges were more diffuse than localized. Sometimes only retching without vomiting occurred, and on a few occasions, vomiting did not occur. Other autonomic manifestations included mydriasis, pallor, cyanosis, tachypnea, hypersalivation, and perspiration at various stages of the ictus. Of non-autonomic manifestations, deviation of eyes to the right or left occurred before or after vomiting without any apparent EEG localisation; it was present in seizures starting from the occipital or frontal regions.|$|E
