5|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} stingrays inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs, the bluespotted ribbontail ray generally spends the day hidden alone inside caves or under coral ledges or other debris (including from shipwrecks), often with only its tail showing. At night, small groups assemble and swim onto shallow sandy flats with the rising tide to feed. Unlike many other stingrays, this species seldom buries itself in sand. The bluespotted ribbontail ray excavates sand pits in search of molluscs, polychaete worms, shrimps, crabs, and small benthic bony fishes; when prey is located, it is trapped by {{the body of the}} ray and maneuvered into the <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> disc. Other fishes, such as goatfish, frequently follow foraging rays, seeking food missed by the ray.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers {{worked for}} Philadelphia-based Pro Wrestling Unplugged (PWU) {{since at least}} September 17, 2005, when they {{defeated}} The S.A.T. and All Money is Legal to win the then-vacant PWU Tag Team Championship. They held that title until April 22, 2006, when they dropped it to the S.A.T. After further appearances in 2006, which were all matches they lost, the Briscoe Brothers entered PWU's Pitbull/Public Enemy Memorial Cup on October 20. They advanced past the first round match, winning over the Krash Krew, but {{in the course of}} this match, Mark was injured when Jay inadvertently struck him in the <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> backswing of a chairshot. Mark was taken to the hospital after the match and subsequently lost a number of teeth and sustained damage to his gums as well.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} has a diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc about a sixth wider than long, with broadly rounded outer corners. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are nearly straight and converge {{at the tip of}} the snout at up to a 130° angle; the anterior disc shape distinguishes this species from the similar Atlantic stingray (D.sabina), which has a longer, more acute snout. The mouth is curved, with a central projection on the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There is a row of five papillae across the floor of the <b>mouth,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 36–50 upper tooth rows; the teeth have quadrangular bases and are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces. The tooth crowns are rounded in females and juveniles, while those of males in breeding condition are triangular and pointed. The pelvic fins are triangular with rounded tips.|$|E

5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could take the bus to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had to come up with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E

25|$|Deuterostomes {{differ from}} protostomes in several ways. Animals from both groups possess a {{complete}} digestive tract. However, in protostomes, the first {{opening of the}} gut to appear in embryological development (the archenteron) develops into the <b>mouth,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anus forming secondarily. In deuterostomes the anus forms first, with the mouth developing secondarily. In most protostomes, cells simply fill {{in the interior of}} the gastrula to form the mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes, it forms through invagination of the endoderm, called enterocoelic pouching. Deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while protostomes undergo spiral cleavage.|$|E

50|$|They are filter feeders, {{gathering}} zooplankton, phytoplankton, and detritus {{particles from}} the water and transporting them to their <b>mouths</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cilia on their gill plumes. During their larval stage, they feed on phytoplankton. They reproduce sexually, releasing eggs and sperm into the water during spawning. They are iteroparous, able to produce more than one batch of offspring. They are also protandric hermaphrodites, changing sex from males to females. The older, larger worms in a colony are generally female. Their lifespan is 4 to 8 years.|$|R
25|$|For example, {{consider}} two clocks at both mouths both {{showing the}} date as 2000. After being {{taken on a}} trip at relativistic velocities, the accelerated mouth is {{brought back to the}} same region as the stationary <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> accelerated mouth's clock reading 2004 while the stationary mouth's clock read 2012. A traveler who entered the accelerated mouth at this moment would exit the stationary mouth when its clock also read 2004, in the same region but now eight years in the past. Such a configuration of wormholes would allow for a particle's world line to form a closed loop in spacetime, known as a closed timelike curve. An object traveling through a wormhole could carry energy or charge from one time to another, but this would not violate conservation of energy or charge in each time, because the energy/charge of the wormhole mouth itself would change to compensate for the object that fell into it or emerged from it.|$|E
25|$|In mandibulate mouthparts, the labium is a quadrupedal structure, {{although}} it is formed from two fused secondary maxillae. It {{can be described as}} the floor of the <b>mouth.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> maxillae, it assists with manipulation of food during mastication or chewing or, in the unusual case of the dragonfly nymph, extends out to snatch prey back to the head, where the mandibles can eat it. The labium is similar in structure to the maxilla, but with the appendages of the two sides fused by the midline, so they come to form a median plate. The basal part of the labium, equivalent to the maxillary cardines and possibly including a part of the sternum of the labial segment, is called the postmentum. This may be subdivided into a proximal submentum and a distal mentum. Distal to the postmentum, and equivalent to the fused maxillary stipites, is the prementum. The prementum closes the preoral cavity from behind. Terminally, it bears four lobes, two inner glossae, and two outer paraglossae, which are collectively known as the ligula. One or both pairs of lobes may be absent or they may be fused to form a single median process. A palp arises from each side of the prementum, often being three-segmented.|$|E

2500|$|The bassoon embouchure {{is a very}} {{important}} aspect of producing a full, round, and dark bassoon tone. The bassoon embouchure is made by opening one's mouth, rolling lips inward to cover the teeth, and then dropping the jaw down as in a yawning motion (without actually yawning or opening the mouth). Both upper and lower teeth should be covered by the lips {{in order to protect the}} reed and control applied pressure.

2500|$|Digestion {{begins in}} the <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{secretion}} of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage {{the walls of the}} stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. [...] The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine.|$|E

2500|$|Henry Rollins, in {{his journal}} {{collection}} Get in the Van, notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C.

In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt like the guy with his fists up every day of my life." [...] Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the [...] "Police Story" [...] single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in his <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> speech blurb [...] "Make me come, faggot!" [...] The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band.

2500|$|In his theatre of {{the late}} period, Beckett's characters—already few in number in the earlier plays—are whittled down to {{essential}} elements. The ironically titled Play (1962), for instance, consists of three characters immersed up to their necks in large funeral urns. The television drama Eh Joe (1963), which was written for the actor Jack MacGowran, is animated by a camera that steadily closes in to a tight focus upon {{the face of the}} title character. The play Not I (1972) consists almost solely of, in Beckett's words, [...] "a moving <b>mouth</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest of the stage in darkness". Following from Krapp's Last Tape, many of these later plays explore memory, often {{in the form of a}} forced recollection of haunting past events in a moment of stillness in the present. They also deal with the theme of the self confined and observed, with a voice that either comes from outside into the protagonist's head (as in Eh Joe) or else another character comments on the protagonist silently, by means of gesture (as in Not I). Beckett's most politically charged play, Catastrophe (1982), which was dedicated to Václav Havel, deals relatively explicitly with the idea of dictatorship. After a long period of inactivity, Beckett's poetry experienced a revival during this period in the ultra-terse French poems of mirlitonnades, with some as short as six words long. These defied Beckett's usual scrupulous concern to translate his work from its original into the other of his two languages; several writers, including Derek Mahon, have attempted translations, but no complete version of the sequence has been published in English.|$|E
