5|$|Despite their success, {{founding}} member Anthony Field almost left {{the group in}} 2004, shortly after his marriage {{and the birth of}} his first child, due to his serious medical issues, which were worsened by The Wiggles' demanding tour schedule. After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago, Field improved his health to the point {{that he was able to}} continue.

5|$|Despite their travails, Rejewski and Zygalski had {{fared better}} than some of their colleagues. Cadix's Polish {{military}} chiefs, Langer and Ciężki, had also been captured by the Germans, {{as they tried to}} escape from France into Spain on the night of March 10–11, 1943 along with three other Poles: Antoni Palluth, Edward Fokczyński and Kazimierz Gaca. The first two became prisoners of war; the other three were sent as slave labourers to Germany, where Palluth and Fokczyński perished.

5|$|In August 1915, Spinks {{was tapped}} {{to join a}} consultative panel of notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help develop a new handicapping system for balkline billiards, {{organized}} by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, {{at that time the}} organizers of the World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers.

5|$|In {{the case}} of Sunkist v. Sunkist and Quaker Oats Co. v. General Mills, the court created a long-standing {{precedent}} in their decision <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> different companies {{to use the same}} brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products. In another case, the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive. After Minton joined the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn. In another decision, Minton was in the majority that ruled under the Sherman Antitrust Act that the New York Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business. Minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board, usually to end worker strikes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
40|$|Intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) aim at {{detecting}} {{attacks against}} information systems. Most intrusiondetection systems currently rely on {{some type of}} centralized processing {{to analyze the data}} necessary to detect an intruder in real time. A centralized approach can be vulnerable to attack (e. g., Denial of Service). Additionally many of these systems depends on analyzing the log files and packet traces, which is potentially modified by the intruder before the IDS can obtain <b>it,</b> <b>making</b> <b>it's</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the intruder to hide his activities. Another problem, is that majority of IDSs detect attacks that have known signatures, which is not enough {{because of the nature of}} the always and ongoing changes in the methods of intruders to break-in systems. In this paper, a framework called Intrusion Detection System Using Distributed Agents (IDSUDA) was built avoiding the above-mentioned problems and adopting a different architecture. In this framework the software agent technology was employed to extend the capabilities of the classical IDSs. IDSUDA focuses on the attack behavior through monitoring the usage of system different resources to detect deviation from normal usage. So it detects many attacks; the known signatures attacks and also the new ones...|$|R
25|$|Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis, {{also known}} as the red-tailed flesh fly, is a fly in the Sarcophagidae family.

5|$|Unlike many Banksia species, B.telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B.telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency {{may be one reason}} why B.telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia. Unlike most serotinous Banksia species, the seeds of B.telmatiaea are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator. If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other animatronic {{shows of}} the early 1980s, the Rock-afire Explosion was {{designed}} to be life-sized, with most of the performers being about the size of an average adult human. Additionally, Fechter implemented the use of latex masks for the characters' faces, as opposed to the rubber and Styrofoam masks common in animatronics of the time. The latex masks were designed to fit over various movable parts on the characters' faces, permitting them a range of facial expressions, including smiling and the raising of eyebrows. Fechter also implemented computer programming that permitted some of the characters to move in rhythm with music, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> theoretically <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> them to play actual instruments.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that randomising the photon {{distribution}} over the frequency {{as well as}} orientation variables dramatically improves the efficiency of optical confinement in a weakly absorbing material such as crystalline silicon.

50|$|Opinions {{vary greatly}} {{on whether the}} early chansons were first written down and then read from manuscripts (although {{parchment}} was quite expensive) or memorized for performance, or whether portions were improvised, or whether they were entirely the product of spontaneous oral composition and later written down. Similarly, scholars differ greatly on the social condition and literacy of the poets themselves; were they cultured clerics or illiterate jongleurs working within an oral tradition? As {{an indication of the}} role played by orality {{in the tradition of the}} chanson de geste, lines and sometimes whole stanzas, especially in the earlier examples, are noticeably formulaic in nature, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> both <b>for</b> the poet to construct a poem in performance and for the audience to grasp a new theme with ease.|$|R
50|$|Apoica flavissima is {{observed}} to survive primarily on nectar {{brought back to}} the nest to feed young and queens during night foraging. Most of the materials {{brought back to the}} nest are given to a small collection of nest-mates who are tasked with distributing the food to feed both larvae and other adults. Recent studies have indicated that Apoica flavissima may also exhibit necrophagy, or the consumption of flesh, on larger vertebrates and invertebrate carcasses. Evidence of this behavior is a structural modification of the mandible of the species. A. flavissima has a dorsal tooth modification of the inner surface of its mandibles where the tooth is elongated and blade-like, <b>making</b> <b>it</b> potentially <b>possible</b> <b>for</b> the species to consume the flesh of bigger organisms.|$|R
