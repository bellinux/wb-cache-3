25|$|Cairns {{is located}} on the east coast of Cape York Peninsula on a coastal strip between the Coral Sea and the Great Dividing Range. The {{northern}} part of the city {{is located on}} Trinity Bay and the city centre is located on Trinity Inlet. To the south of the Trinity Inlet lies the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah. Some of the city's suburbs are located on flood plains. The Mulgrave River and Barron River flow within the greater Cairns area but not through the CBD. The city's centre foreshore is located on a <b>mud</b> <b>flat.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Ochoa Point Member is {{interpreted}} to have accumulated {{as the result}} of continued tidal-flat sedimentation. The lower part of this member appears to have accumulated in the higher <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> position of the tidal flat environment where periodic desiccation occurred. The upper part of this member is inferred to have accumulated in the deeper, or more seaward part of the tidal-flat environment. At the time that these tidal flats were covered by the initial eruption of the Cardenas Basalt, the eastern grand Canyon region was at or very near sea level. Features found in the lowermost part of the Cardenas Basalt indicate that the basaltic lavas outpoured over unconsolidated sandy and silty Dox sediments at the time they were wet. It is unknown whether these sediments were slightly above or slightly below water level at the time they were buried by lava. The high proportion of altered glass in and the pervasive fracturing (hyaloclastite) of the basal Cardenas Basalt support this interpretation. The high sodium content of the basal Cardenas Basalt indicates spilitization due to reaction with hypersaline water. Hematitic alteration of the sediment that resulted from baking by the lavas is minimal, amounting to a few centimeters or less.|$|E
500|$|Two {{isolated}} fossilized footprints {{have been}} tentatively assigned to Tyrannosaurus rex. The first was discovered at Philmont Scout Ranch, New Mexico, in 1983 by American geologist Charles Pillmore. Originally thought {{to belong to}} a hadrosaurid, examination of the footprint revealed a large 'heel' unknown in ornithopod dinosaur tracks, and traces of what may have been a hallux, the dewclaw-like fourth digit of the tyrannosaur foot. The footprint was published as the ichnogenus Tyrannosauripus pillmorei in 1994, by Martin Lockley and Adrian Hunt. Lockley and Hunt suggested that it was very likely the track was made by a Tyrannosaurus rex, which would make it the first known footprint from this species. The track was made in what was once a vegetated wetland <b>mud</b> <b>flat.</b> It measures [...] long by [...] wide.|$|E

2500|$|Four rivers drain into Poole harbour, {{the largest}} being the River Frome, which {{flows from the}} west through Dorchester and Wareham. [...] The harbour is very shallow in places and has {{extensive}} <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> and salt marsh habitats, as well as muddy and sandy shores and seagrass meadows. [...] The area is an extremely popular recreation and tourism area, and local authorities and organisations have to carefully manage the tourism to prevent damage to the habitats.|$|E

2500|$|An earlier Willamette steamer, the Lot Whitcomb {{had also}} {{recently}} {{been sent to}} the San Francisco area, on August 12, 1854, also in tow of the Peytonia. [...] Lot Whitcomb was to serve as opposition to the California Steam Navigation Company, then the dominant steamboat concern on the Sacramento river. [...] Rather than face the potential competition, C.S.N simply bought the Lot Whitcomb, and towed it off to a <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> near Oakland, California and left it there until it decayed away.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, twelve blue collar {{workers in the}} Miami Springs Power Boat Club {{purchased}} a sunken barge for $1, re-floated it and towed it to Stiltsville, where they grounded it on a <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> and built a structure and docks for use by their club. Hurricane Betsy did considerable damage to the barge in 1965, so club members invested in concrete pilings, which still remain in place. Thousands have visited the [...] "Springs House" [...] over the years, including Boy Scout troops and Optimist Clubs. Several television commercials have been filmed there, also. It {{was one of the}} seven remaining structures named in the Stiltsville Trust of 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Turnagain extends in an east-west direction, and {{is between}} [...] long. It forms {{part of the}} {{northern}} boundary of Kenai Peninsula, and reaches on the east to within [...] of Portage Bay, a western branch of Prince William Sound. Turnagain is characterized by remarkably large tides of up to 40 feet (12 meters) which are the largest tides in the United States. The flood tide often begins with a tidal bore especially on large tides with a strong east wind, which has a height of [...] at times, and runs in from the west at a speed of [...] an hour. At low tide, the arm becomes a broad <b>mud</b> <b>flat,</b> cut by the stream channels. Historically small steamers entered and left on high water though the practice is rare at best since {{most if not all}} the places that they went are now connected by road.|$|E
50|$|The cliffs {{formed by}} {{erosion of the}} local {{quaternary}} geology give views over the Thames Estuary towards the Kent coastline to the south. The coastline {{has been transformed into}} sandy beaches through the use of groynes and imported sand. The estuary at this point has extensive <b>mud</b> <b>flats.</b> At low tide, the water typically retreats some 600 m from the beach, leaving the <b>mud</b> <b>flats</b> exposed.|$|R

2500|$|Long (1993) {{recognises}} three lithofacies in the Burgsvik beds; {{a poorly}} exposed silty/sandy mudstone facies {{dominant in the}} lower beds, appearing as interbeds in the middle beds; a fine to very fine sandstone; and a [...] "biofacies" [...] consisting of ooids, oncolites and bioclasts. [...] He challenges three interpretations of the sub-aerial sandstone facies. Contrary to Gray et al.s (1974) tidal <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> interpretation, Long surmises that it may represent locally emergent offshore bars, near-shore sands or beach deposits. [...] Tides cannot be a dominant factor, as cross-stratification is abundant; storm beds, recognised by hummocky cross-stratification, are also common, suggesting that storms were important in shaping the landscape. Irregularly aligned prod and scour marks on the sea floor shows that waves also played a role. [...] The most favourable conclusion appears {{to be that the}} facies represents a shoaling sequence — the migration of sand wave complexes, detached offshore bars (Swift & Field 1981, Brenner et al. 1985) or isolated mid-shelf bars (La Fon 1981).|$|E
2500|$|Most often {{employed}} by colubroid snakes (colubrids, elapids, and vipers) when the snake must move {{in an environment}} that lacks irregularities to push against (rendering lateral undulation impossible), such as a slick <b>mud</b> <b>flat,</b> or a sand dune, sidewinding is a modified form of lateral undulation in which all of the body segments oriented in one direction remain in contact with the ground, while the other segments are lifted up, resulting in a peculiar [...] "rolling" [...] motion. This mode of locomotion overcomes the slippery nature of sand or mud by pushing off with only static portions on the body, thereby minimizing slipping. The static nature of the contact points can be shown from the tracks of a sidewinding snake, which show each belly scale imprint, without any smearing. This mode of locomotion has very low caloric cost, less than ⅓ of the cost for a lizard to move the same distance. Contrary to popular belief, {{there is no evidence that}} sidewinding is associated with the sand being hot.|$|E
2500|$|The San Francisco Bay Trail, which {{passes in}} a loop around {{both sides of}} the Palo Alto Flood Basin is known as the Adobe Creek Loop Trail and is easily {{accessed}} from a parking lot at the northern terminus of San Antonio Road, just north of U.S. Highway 101. A scenic, easy walking or mountain biking trail, it also provides outstanding birdwatching and in winter is known for its flock of American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos). The Adobe Creek Loop Trail begins by heading north along the levee between Adobe Creek and the Charleston Slough out to the confluence of Adobe Creek and Matadero Creek. [...] As one heads north on the levee, Charleston Slough is on the right and Adobe Creek is on the left. The Charleston Slough is a rich salt marsh and littoral zone, providing feeding areas for a variety of shorebirds and other estuarine wildlife. At low tide Charleston Slough looks like a salt pond, like the Cargill salt ponds to the east of it, but it is open to tidal flow. Pumps and gates regulate the flow through the slough. Water from the slough gets pumped into Shoreline Lake, which then drains into Permanente Creek. The slough was named after George Charleston, who came from Scotland in 1852 and purchased [...] of marshland in this area. Charleston Road and Charleston Court also bear his name. Continuing north, the wide, curving Loop Trail eventually touches San Francisco Bay itself and curves to the west, crossing over the tidal gate of Mayfield Slough and enters the Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve. The sailing station boat launching dock is visible on the opposite shore of the channel {{at the mouth of the}} former Palo Alto Yacht Harbor. Baylands Nature Preserve surrounds what used to be the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor, now a silted-in <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> and marsh which provides excellent birding. The Adobe Creek Loop Trail then heads back southwest with Matadero Creek on the left and Byxbee Park (former landfill) on the right, eventually connecting to the Bay Trail at East Bayshore Road. Heading east along East Bayshore Road, turn immediately left after crossing over Adobe Creek to return on the Bay Trail to the San Antonio Road parking lot.|$|E

60|$|As a {{preliminary}} canter I shall trot out first {{the valley of}} the Po, the existing <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> best known by personal experience to the feet and eyes of the tweed-clad English tourist. Everybody who has looked down upon the wide Lombard plain from the pinnacled roof of Milan Cathedral, or who has passed by rail through that monotonous level of poplars and vines between Verona and Venice, knows well what a <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> due to inundation and gradual silting up of a valley looks like. What I want to do now is to inquire into its origin, and to follow up in fancy the same process, still in action, till it has filled the Adriatic from end to end with one great cultivable lowland.|$|E

50|$|Most of Plymouth Bay's <b>mud</b> <b>flats</b> can {{be found}} in Kingston Bay and Duxbury Bay, which are prone to {{becoming}} totally exposed in times of low tide. The largest of these such flats is Ichabod's Flat in Kingston Bay. The <b>mud</b> <b>flats</b> of Kingston Bay are used for shellfishing and clamming and have flourished due to Plymouth Bay's ability to isolate itself from red tide, which occasionally impacts the Massachusetts coastline.|$|R

60|$|Perhaps {{it seems}} to you a rather large order {{to be asked to}} believe that Lombardy and Venetia are nothing more than an {{outspread}} sheet of deep Alpine mud. Well, there is nothing so good for incredulity, don't you know, as capping the climax. If a man will not swallow an inch of fact, the best remedy is to make him gulp down an ell of it. And, indeed, the Lombard plain is but an insignificant <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> compared with the vast alluvial plains of Asiatic and American rivers. The alluvium of the Euphrates, of the Mississippi, of the Hoang Ho, of the Amazons would take in many Lombardies and half-a-dozen Venetias without noticing the addition. But I will insist upon only one example--the rivers of India, which have formed the gigantic deep <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> of the Ganges and the Jumna, one of the very biggest on earth, and that because the Himalayas are the highest and newest mountain chain exposed to denudation. For, as we saw foreshadowed {{in the case of the}} Alps and Apennines, the bigger the mountains on which we can draw the greater the resulting mass of alluvium. The Rocky Mountains give rise to the Missouri (which is the real Mississippi); the Andes give rise to Amazons and the La Plata; the Himalayas give rise to the Ganges and the Indus. Great mountain, great river, great resulting mud sheet.|$|E
60|$|Comparatively few {{of those}} who {{nowadays}} run down to Southend for {{a breath of fresh}} air give a thought to the fact that the wide stretch of low country lying between the railroad and the Thames, from Pitsea to Leigh, was at one time, and that not so many centuries back, a <b>mud</b> <b>flat,</b> a continuation of the great line of sand that still, with but a short break here and there, stretches down beyond Yarmouth; still less that, were it not for the watchfulness of those who dwell upon it, it would in a short time revert to its original condition, the country lying below the level of higher water.|$|E
60|$|Turn mentally to {{the upper}} feeders of the Po itself, and you find the same causes equally in action. You have stopped at Pallanza--Garoni's is so comfortable. Well, then, you know how every Alpine stream, as it flows, full-gorged, into the Italian lakes, is busily engaged in filling them up as fast as ever it can with turbid mud from the uplands. The basins of Maggiore, Como, Lugano, and Garda are by origin deep hollows scooped out long since during the Great Ice Age by the {{pressure}} of huge glaciers that then spread far down into {{what is now the}} poplar-clad plain of Lombardy. But ever since the ice cleared away, and the torrents began to rush headlong down the deep gorges of the Val Leventina and the Val Maggia, the mud has been hard at work, doing its level best to fill those great ice-worn bowls up again. Near the mouth of each main stream it has already succeeded in spreading a fan-shaped delta. I will not insult you by asking you at the present time of day whether you have been over the St. Gothard. In this age of trains de luxe I know to my cost everybody has been everywhere. No chance of pretending to superior knowledge about Japan or Honolulu; the tourist knows them. Very well, then; you must remember as you go past Bellinzona--revolutionary little Bellinzona with its three castled crags--you look down upon a vast <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> by the mouth of the Ticino. Part of this <b>mud</b> <b>flat</b> is already solid land, but part is mere marsh or shifting quicksand. That is the first stage in the abolition of the lakes: the mud is annihilating them.|$|E
