5000|$|Roller-head machine: This {{machine is}} for shaping wares on a {{rotating}} mould, as in jiggering and jolleying, {{but with a}} rotary shaping tool replacing the fixed profile. The rotary shaping tool is a shallow cone having the same diameter as the ware being formed and shaped to the desired form {{of the back of}} the article being made. Wares may in this way be shaped, using relatively unskilled labour, in one operation at a rate of about twelve <b>pieces</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> though this varies with the size of the articles being produced. Developed in the UK just after World War II by the company Service Engineers, roller-heads were quickly adopted by manufacturers around the world; they remain the dominant method for producing flatware.|$|R
2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 <b>pieces</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> for a [...] long set screw.|$|R

Patterson wrote, [...] The performance of the press, in which the power of the lever is substituted for that of the screw, has answered all our expectations. Since that time, all the copper coins have been struck by this press, and it has been lately used with success for coining half dollars. The workmen are now engaged in making other steam presses; and as these are completed, the coining by human labor be abandoned, and the work that can be executed in ... the Mint will be greatly increased. Numismatist Roger Burdette notes, [...] "in most respects, Peale seems to have selected the best from European examples, and discarded all unnecessary complexity and ineffective motion." [...] Although minor improvements were made from time to time, these machines struck the nation's coinage for the remainder of Peale's life.|$|R

If these findings are true, one might expect to find a predominance of fast/major and slow/minor pairings in musical literature. This study looks for just such a trend in the canonical work of J. S. Bach’s Well Tempered Clavier. Books 1 and 2 together contain 24 Major Preludes, 24 Minor Preludes, 24 Major Fugues and 24 Minor Fugues. We use four different measurements of fast/slow tempo based both on elements within the musical notation as well as the interpretive markings of four different music editors: 1.

All this work is realized {{in collaboration with the}} company Fameccanica. Data S. p. A., located in Via Aterno 98, Sambuceto di Teatino, Italy. This unit in particular is a part of a production line of baby diapers. Till now this unit is used to apply patches of disposable tape at 500 ppm (<b>pieces</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute).</b> The tests goal is to reach a defined application speed of 1000 ppm. Is the first one of this kind of units in the world that it reaches that speed. In order to study the way to speed up the unit, we acquired all the relevant data for each process speed. We started doing an analysis without raw material of the vibration of the unit making short time acquirements (10 seconds each acquirement of data) for each velocity (from 100 ppm to 1000 ppm in intervals of 100 ppm) and then making a dry run long time analysis (6 hours to analyze the stationary behavior of all the relevant variables). During the tests we have observed the temperature trend of the critical components (Thermical analysis), the noise and the motor torque trend of the unit and its vibration behavior in each velocity in order to check if all it is ok to speed up the unit. The results that we obtained have shown us that the temperature, torque and noise trends are correct in the new velocity without problems. The vibration produced by the rotation cuts in the chosen position of the counter-weight is a little bit high, but it can be assumed by the unit in the production process without problems. We choose the position that minimizes the vibration effect analyzing the acquired data. When we have finished these analyses and we have chosen the right way to work with the unit at 1000 ppm, we started analyzing the product results with raw material with the unit assembled in the test bench (that we have assembled in 3 D CAD format first) in order to check if the real process is working correctly at the scope velocity in the real application and to design the improvement kit for the unit to reach our goals. The conclusion of all this study is that is very necessary to do an accurate study of viability of the relevant variables in any upgrade that you want to perform in a unit or machine in order to do it correctly before the real testing process, and test it correctly in a bench test to see it in its real application to check if any improvement kit is needed. I also noticed the importance of the R&D work in the technology growing of a company. It can be summed up as “nonstop innovation”, like the Fameccanica. Data slogan...|$|R
