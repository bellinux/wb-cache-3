25|$|The {{chisel plough}} {{is a common}} tool to get deep tillage (prepared land) with limited soil disruption.

This plough can be used to reduce the effects of compaction and to help break up ploughpan and hardpan. Unlike many other ploughs the chisel will not invert or turn the soil. This characteristic has made it a useful addition to no-till and low-till farming practices that attempt to maximise the erosion-prevention benefits of keeping organic matter and farming residues present on the soil surface through the year. Because of these attributes, the use of a chisel plough is considered by some to be more sustainable than other types of plough, such as the <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough.</b>|$|E

The carruca heavy plough improved on the earlier scratch plough, with the adoption of the Chinese <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> to turn over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe. This led to the clearing of northern European forests and an increase in agricultural production, which in turn led to an increase in population. At the same time, some farmers in Europe moved from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year. This resulted in increased productivity and nutrition, as the change in rotations permitted nitrogen-fixing legumes such as peas, lentils and beans.

In this field, different tillage experiments established in 1974. Five treatments were included in the experiment but this investigation considered only two treatments, shallow tillage and <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing.</b> In these two treatments, undisturbed soil samples were taken before sowing the seeds at the depth of 15 - 20, 25 - 30 and 35 - 40 cm for the determination of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), bulk density (Bd), and water retention in laboratory condition. Penetrometer resistance (PR) were measured in the field one month after sowing. Plant density of barley was also counted one month after sowing. Significantly higher Ks value was found for shallow tillage at the depth of 15 - 20 and 25 - 30 cm. Bd was significantly lower for <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> for the first two investigating depth and it was higher at 35 - 40 cm but the difference was not statistically significant.

Water content determined parallel with PR measurement was similar for the two treatments. Plant density and crop yield were significantly higher in shallow tilled treatment than in moulboard ploughing.

The background to the experiment was a 2005 study showing potentially higher yield, higher cleanness and higher sugar con tent when primary tillage was carried out to 35 cm depth with a rotary cultivator. On four field sites in Skåne (L:a Isie, Ädelholm, Stävie and Vragerup), five different treatments were compared: <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the autumn to 20 cm; <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the autumn to 20 cm + rotary cultivation in the spring to 35 cm; rotary cultivation in the autumn to 35 cm; rotary cultivation in the spring to 35 cm; and <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the spring to 20 cm. The rotary cultivator used in the treatments is manufactured by a Dutch company, Imants. The implement cultivates the soil with spade tines fitted on arms that are mounted on a horizontal rotating PTO-driven axle. Beet plants were inspected and yield determined in the experiment, and three soil parameters were examined: penetration resistance, water infiltration and infiltration of blue dye. Root shape was also examined. The site at Stävie was not harvested due to poor beet establishment. At the other sites, the highest yield was found when the soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn. Pooling of the results from the three harvested sites showed that the yield was significantly higher (+ 4 %) and the sugar content was also significantly higher (+ 0. 3 %) when the soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn compared with conventional <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the autumn. The penetration resistance tended to be lower and the water infiltration rate higher when soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn. The amount of blue colour covering the soil was also higher.

40|$|International audienceThe {{choice of}} {{cultivation}} system in arable agriculture exerts {{a strong influence}} not only on soil health and crop productivity {{but also on the}} wider environment. Conservation tillage using non-inversion methods conserves soil carbon, reduces erosion risk and enhances soil quality. In addition, conservation tillage has been shown to sequester more carbon within the soil than inversion tillage, reducing carbon dioxide losses to the atmosphere. Stable, well structured topsoils that develop following long-term conservation tillage lead to more energy efficient systems due to the reduced power requirements for cultivation. Long-term experiments, e. g. more than 20 years, that confirm the impact of conservation tillage over an extended period are not common. Here we evaluate the impact of different tillage methods and winter wheat straw management, either incorporated or removed, on organic matter turnover and soil quality indicators. No-till, chisel and <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> was carried out for 23 years on a silty clay loam soil in South West England that was not considered suitable for non-inversion tillage due to weak soil structure. In order to assess the effect of contrasting cultivation and straw disposal method on soil carbon dynamics, a range of assays were conducted, including water extractable organic carbon, hot water extractable carbohydrate, microbial biomass carbon, activity of β-glucosidase and acid phosphatase enzymes, C sequestration and the natural abundance of 13 C. Our results show that the soil organic carbon concentration in the topsoil was greater under no-till than <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing,</b> while a reverse trend was observed in the lower depths.

Draught requirements for the different types of implements should then be the basis for calculation of power requirement and fuel consumption in a computer program for guidance of machinery costs. This work aim to complement earlier draught measurements with values from tillage operations carried out in the spring 2004 and to develop a calculation program for machinery costs. The tillage operations that was studied in this work was harrowing, seeding with shoe coulter, seeding with discs and reduced tillage (carrier and disk harrow).

Values of vertical dust flux varied from 0. 52 to 5. 03 μg m− 2 s− 1 (for a range of wind shear velocity of 0. 46 – 0. 56 m s− 1) during the first experimental period (after chisel ploughing) and from 1. 45 to 11. 66 μg m− 2 s− 1 (for shear velocities between 0. 37 and 0. 72 m s− 1) in the second experiment (<b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing).</b> The wind-erodible fraction of soil surface (aggregates< 0. 84 mm diameter) was 41...|$|R
40|$|Reduced tillage {{can improve}} soil {{physical}} quality relative to <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> by lessening soil disturbance, leaving organic matter at the soil surface, and stimulating soil biological activity. In organic farming, continuous ploughing may negate benefits to soil {{structure and function}} from increased use of manures and more diverse crop rotations, which are particularly important components of organic farming. The current study examined soil physical quality (i. e., properties and functioning) of a 4 -year old reduced tillage system under organic and conventional farming with crop rotations that included root crops. Reduced tillage was compared to conventional <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> (MP) in 2 organic fields at different points of the same crop rotation (Org A and Org B) and 1 conventional field (Conv A). Reduced tillage consisted of non-inversion tillage (NIT) to 18 – 23 cm depth whereas MP was characterised by annual <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> to 23 – 25 cm depth. NIT improved soil water retention in Org B but had no effect in Org A. NIT increased soil aggregate stability at 10 – 20 cm depth compared to MP in all fields, and additionally at 0 – 10 cm in Conv A. Penetration resistance was higher in NIT in all fields. Furthermore, soil organic matter content was higher in NIT than MP at 0 – 10 cm depth in all fields and at 10 – 20 cm in Org B and Conv A. NIT increased carbon stocks in Org B but not in Org A. NIT statistically increased crop yields in spring wheat/faba bean mixture in Org A, {{and there was no}} yield penalty from NIT in Org B spring wheat nor Conv A sugar beet. In contrast, field-saturated hydraulic conductivity in all fields in autumn was lower in NIT. Differences in crop (i. e., phase of rotation) and associated organic inputs between Org A and B likely accounted for the differences in effects of tillage system. Overall, the NIT system improved or imposed no penalty on soil physical quality (except field-saturated hydraulic conductivity) and improved or imposed no penalty on crop yields and could therefore be considered as a viable alternative for farmers...|$|R
