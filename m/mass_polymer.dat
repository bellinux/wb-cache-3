This enzyme constituted the single evidence for this reaction and product specificity in the GH 70 family, mostly containing glucansucrases encoded by lactic acid bacteria ([URL] In this work, 4 additional GtfD-like proteins were identified in taxonomically diverse plant-associated bacteria forming a new GH 70 subfamily with intermediate characteristics between the evolutionary related GH 13 and GH 70 families.

Lauryl acrylate (LA) was polymerised via RAFT to high conversion (95 %), furnished polymers in good agreement with theoretical Mn with dispersity increasing with increasing Mn. LA polymerised via the Cu(0) -mediated method to full conversion (> 98 %), gave polymers in good agreement with theoretical Mn and low dispersity (Đ ≈ 1. 2) for lower molar <b>mass</b> <b>polymers.</b> Low molar <b>mass</b> tailing was also observed for P[LA] via Cu(0) -mediated polymerisation for higher molar <b>mass</b> <b>polymers.</b> Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of P[LA] via RAFT showed an onset of degradation occurred at ≈ 340 – 350 °C, however, this decreased to ≈ 250 – 260 °C for lower molar <b>mass</b> <b>polymers.</b> TGA of the RAFT agent revealed an onset of degradation of ≈ 200 – 250 °C. Free radicals generated from thermal degradation of end groups did not influence the thermal stability of the P[LA] backbone and ‘unzipping’ commonly seen with methacrylates was not observed. TGA analysis of P[LA] via the Cu(0) -mediated method revealed a similar degradation profile to that of P[LA] via RAFT. The thermal stability of P[LA] is sufficient to allow for melt processing with iPP. P[LA] via RAFT mixed with MWCNTs showed an adsorption of ≈ 10 – 25 wt% P[LA] on to the MWCNTs. The onset of thermal degradation of the P[LA] remained unchanged after adsorption on to the MWCNTs. P[LA] via the Cu(0) -mediated method adsorbed up to 85 wt% and an increase in thermal stability of ≈ 50 °C was recorded. Increasing P[LA] and MWCNT concentration independently also resulted in an increase in the level of adsorption, possibility due to increased CH–π interaction. The difference in thermal stability could possibly be due to heat transfer from the P[LA] to the MWCNTs, resulting in delayed pyrolysis of P[LA]. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) of P[LA] after heating to 200 °C for 30 min in air showed loss of end groups but, the P[LA] backbone remained preserved for both polymer types. Evidence from transmission electron micrographs (TEM) shows the P[LA] adsorbing onto the MWCNT surface.

Covalent cross-links were obtained in the glassy state on the basis of azide photochemistry of linear random copolymers of styrene and p-(azidomethyl) styrene, i. e., 106 and 2500 kg/mol with 7 % and 1 % azide functionality among the polymer backbone, respectively. Upon ultraviolet radiation, azides generate highly unstable nitrene radicals which react with the surrounding polymer backbone, yielding covalent cross-links. We determined the probability for film rupture, defined by the number of holes formed per unit area, and the relaxation time (τw) of residual stresses which resulted from the film preparation process. For the lower molar <b>mass</b> <b>polymer</b> studied and for azide conversion rates lower than 60 %, only partial cross-linking occurred. The effective molar mass of the polymer increased, and consequently, an increase in τw was observed. The increase in τw was accompanied by a decrease in hole density, indicating that the still present residual stresses in the films were not able anymore to rupture the films at the high probability of un-cross-linked polymers. For high conversion (> 60 %), cross-linking was significant enough to lead to the formation of a three-dimensional rubbery network which, in turn, generated an elastic force that counteracted the driving forces. This elastic force eventually inhibited dewetting and the relaxation of residual stresses. Thus, at high conversions, the relaxation time τw grew exponentially and the number of holes tended toward zero. For the higher molar <b>mass</b> <b>polymer,</b> no changes in the relaxation time τw were observed for low conversion (< 30 %). However, at a higher conversion rate, τw increased drastically, suggesting an almost infinitely long relaxation time at 100 % conversion.
