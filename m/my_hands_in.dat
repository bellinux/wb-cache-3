25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E
500|$|As many expected, {{the highly}} {{anticipated}} domestic clash was a savage brawl from round one. Gomez won the opening rounds {{and threatened to}} overpower Johanneson from the opening seconds. The Leeds fighter then gained the upper hand as the fight went on, flooring Gomez in the sixth round only for the [...] "Irish Mexican" [...] {{to rise from the}} canvas. Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight. Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, [...] "When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, and I only dropped <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't hurt me. But the referee simply got the wrong message. It was bad refereeing. I told him straight away I was fine, but he insisted on showing me to my corner." [...] The former champion was clear that he wanted another opportunity to fight for the British title.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings to the [...] "sexual teasing" [...] lyrics, which are {{addressed}} to the men looking at her: [...] "I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you [...] Oohhh you watchin me shake it, [...] Ya can't take it, it’s blazin ...". The chorus lines; [...] "Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight" [...] are sung in a very quick and breathless manner by Beyoncé. Bret McCabe noted that her pace could be {{compared to that of}} American singer Donna Summer. Slim Thug appears again after the second verse to perform another different verse rap: [...] "I’m checking on you boo, do what’chu do / And while you dance I’ma glance at this beautiful view / I’m keep <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> my pants, I need to glue ’em with glue ...". Before the song ends, Beyoncé repeats the chorus lines four times as additional vocals of hers are played in the background.|$|E

500|$|In a 2004 interview, Simpson {{said that}} when she began seeking a {{recording}} contract record labels would not meet with her because they thought she just wanted [...] "to be like her sister". Simpson also said {{that she did not}} want to meet with Jessica's record label (Columbia) because she wanted to be signed because of her music, rather than her sister. She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the whole concept of the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they really let me have <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> there. I got to write a lot." [...] Simpson said of making the album: [...] "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work." [...] In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album's liner notes, Simpson includes Benji and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, with whom she worked on the song [...] "Harder Everyday," [...] which was released as an international bonus track.|$|E

2500|$|Making {{a circuit}} around the bimah on Sukkot while each person holds the four species {{in his hands}} has its origin in the Temple service, as {{recorded}} in the Mishnah: [...] "It was customary to make one procession around the altar on each day of Sukkot, and seven on the seventh day" [...] (Sukkah 4:5). The priests carried the palm branches or willows in their hands. The entire ceremony is to demonstrate rejoicing and gratitude for a blessed and fruitful year. Moreover, it serves {{to tear down the}} iron wall that separates us from our Father in Heaven, as the wall of Jericho was encompassed [...] "and the wall fell down flat" [...] (Joshua 6:20). Furthermore, the seven circuits correspond to the seven words in the verse Erhatz benikayon kappay, va'asovevah et mizbahakha Hashem - [...] "I wash <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> purity and circle around Your altar, O Lord" [...] (Psalms 26:6).|$|E

2500|$|..[...] I {{have read}} some history, and I find that several {{countries}} have {{from time to}} time been afflicted with the same land disease as that under which Ireland is now labouring, and although the political doctors applied many remedies, the one that proved effectual was the tearing out, root and branch, of the class that caused the disease. All right-thinking men would deplore the necessity of having recourse in this country to scenes such as have been enacted in other lands, although I for one will not hold up <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> holy horror at a movement that gave liberty not only to France but to Europe. If excesses were at that time committed, they must be measured by the depth of slavery and ignorance in which the people had been kept, and I trust Irish landlords will in time recognise {{the fact that it is}} better for them at least to have this land question settled after the manner of a Stein or a Hardenberg than wait for the excesses of a Marat or a Robespierre.|$|E
