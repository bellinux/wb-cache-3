40|$|Studies of meteor trails {{have until}} now {{been limited to}} {{relatively}} simple models, with the trail often being treated as a conducting cylinder, and the head (if considered at all) treated as a ball of ionized gas. In this article, we bring the experience gleaned from other fields to the domain of meteor studies, and adapt this prior knowledge to give a much clearer view of the microscale physics and chemistry involved in meteor-trail formation, with particular emphasis on the first 100 or so milliseconds of the trail formation. We discuss and examine the combined physicochemical effects of meteor-generated and ablationally amplified cylindrical shock waves that appear in the ambient atmosphere immediately surrounding the <b>meteor</b> <b>train,</b> {{as well as the}} associated hyperthermal chemistry on the boundaries of the high temperature post-adiabatically expanding <b>meteor</b> <b>train.</b> We demonstrate that the cylindrical shock waves produced by overdense meteors are sufficiently strong to dissociate molecules in the ambient atmosphere when it is heated to temperatures in the vicinity of 6000 K, which substantially alters the considerations of the chemical processes in and around the <b>meteor</b> <b>train.</b> We demonstrate that some ambient O- 2, along with O- 2 that comes from the shock dissociation of O- 3, survives the passage of the cylindrical shock wave, and these constituents react thermally with meteor metal ions, thereby subsequently removing electrons from the overdense <b>meteor</b> <b>train</b> boundary through fast, temperature-independent, dissociative recombination governed by the second Damkohler number.

40|$|A {{solution}} to the problem of the diffusion of a <b>meteor</b> <b>train</b> in the geomagnetic field from an initial line density may be written in closed form in terms of effective diffusion coefficients depending on direction, enabling detailed calculations across the entire range of angle of train to field and relevant heights. While the effective diffusion coefficient in the plane of train and field then remains close to the zero field ambipolar value right up to 90 deg, the effective coefficient in the direction of the normal to plane of train and field drops steadily to its theta = 0 value at theta = 90 deg. At 95 km this corresponds to a change of almost 5 km, in 'diffusion height', that is, the height of an underdense meteor calculated on the basis of the exponential decay of its radar echo. We have estimated the consequent changes in the expected distribution of diffusion heights for various orientations of radar antenna and find the dependence on azimuth is very marked. The effect of the field is relatively minor for a south pointing beam but very strong if the beam is pointing north...|$|E

We employ this RBF Neural detector {{to detect the}} presence or absence of a known signal corrupted by different Gaussian, non-Gaussian and impulsive noise components. In case of non-Gaussian noise, experimental results show that RBF network signal detector has significant improvement in performance characteristics. Detection capability is better than to those obtained with multilayer perceptrons (BP) and optimum matched filter (MF) detector. This signal detector is also tested on the simulated signals impacted by impulsive noise produced by atmospheric events and short lived echoes from <b>meteor</b> <b>trains.</b> Tested Results show, improved detection capability to impulsive noise compare to BP signal detector.

40|$|The first {{infrared}} spectroscopy in the 3 - 13 micron region has been obtained of several persistent Leonid <b>meteor</b> <b>trains</b> with two different instrument types, {{one at a}} desert ground-based site and the other on-board a high-flying aircraft. The spectra exhibit common structures assigned to enhanced emissions of warm CH 4, CO 2, CO and H 2 O which may originate from heated trace air compounds or materials created {{in the wake of}} the meteor. This is the first time that any of these molecules has been observed in the spectra of persistent trains. Hence, the mid-IR observations offer a new perspective on the physical processes that occur in the path of the meteor at some time after the meteor itself has passed by. Continuum emission is observed also, but its origin has not yet been established. No 10 micron dust emission feature has been observed...|$|R
40|$|The rate {{of decay}} of a radar echo from an ionised <b>meteor</b> <b>train</b> will be governed by the {{diffusion}} coefficient of the plasma and this in turn {{will depend on the}} temperature. Very recently the temperature fluctuations near the mesopause have been monitored by this means, by the recording of the decay times of underdense trains. The usual derivation of the precise expression relating the underdense echo decay time to the temperature contains two important assumptions, (i) that the train is created with a Gaussian ionisation profile, and (ii) that kinetic theory may be applied to calculate the diffusion coefficient. We investigate the effect of these assumptions, showing that the first assumption is unnecessary, an underdense backscatter echo decaying exponentially with a decay time equal to &# 955; 2 /(32 &# 960; 2 D), where &# 955; is the wavelength and D the diffusion coefficient, independently of the initial distribution. However, the second assumption is shown to be incorrect, and whereas according to kinetic theory D &#x 221 D; T 1 / 2 /&# 961;, where T and &# 961; are the atmospheric temperature and density, the correct result is D &#x 221 D; T &# 961;.

40|$|A {{summary of}} the present {{understanding}} of the behaviour of meteoric ionization is given and cooling times for meteoric particles are calculated. While the cooling time for neutral atoms and positive ions is short compared to echo life-times, that for electrons is not and thermalization effects may be observed above 100 km. The effect of winds and sky noise on diffusion coefficient measurements has been investigated {{and it appears that}} the scatter in measurements predicted accounts for that observed in practice. A magnetic effect on <b>meteor</b> <b>train</b> diffusion has been observed in underdense meteors by using a backscatter radar, with a 40 kW pulsed transmitter operating at 26. 36 MHz. Echo heights were measured with a spaced interferometer. The observed magnetic effect is consistent with that expected from the formation of electron and ion ellipses of ionization. Other results recorded when anisotropic, ambipolar diffusion is more likely do not show this effect. Previous observations, limited to overdense meteors, are shown to be consistent with theoretical predictions and the expected magnetic effects on diffusion for general train orientations are discussed. Phase variations caused by Fresnel diffraction as meteor trains are formed have been studied and shown to be a cause of systematic decreases in echo heights (during the lifetime of an echo) measured with spaced antennas. An experiment to verify this is suggested. A chemical model developed to take into account ionization loss may account for anomalously high D values below 90 km observed in previous data. High D values measured in this work cannot be explained by this simple model...|$|E
40|$|We {{summarize}} {{the state of}} the art of a program of UV observations from space of meteor phenomena, a secondary objective of the JEM-EUSO international collaboration. Our preliminary analysis indicates that JEM-EUSO, taking advantage of its large FOV and good sensitivity, should be able to detect meteors down to absolute magnitude close to 7. This means that JEM-EUSO should be able to record a statistically significant flux of meteors, including both sporadic ones, and events produced by different meteor streams. Being unaffected by adverse weather conditions, JEM-EUSO can also be a very important facility for the detection of bright meteors and fireballs, as these events can be detected even in conditions of very high sky background. In the case of bright events, moreover, exhibiting some persistence of the <b>meteor</b> <b>train,</b> preliminary simulations show that it should be possible to exploit the motion of the ISS itself and derive at least a rough 3 D reconstruction of the meteor trajectory. Moreover, the observing strategy developed to detect meteors may also be applied to the detection of nuclearites, exotic particles whose existence has been suggested by some theoretical investigations. Nuclearites are expected to move at higher velocities than meteoroids, and to exhibit a wider range of possible trajectories, including particles moving upward after crossing the Earth. Some pilot studies, including the approved Mini-EUSO mission, a precursor of JEM-EUSO, are currently operational or in preparation. We are doing simulations to assess the performance of Mini-EUSO for meteor studies, while a few meteor events have been already detected using the ground-based facility EUSO-TA...|$|E

40|$|The {{equation}} for {{the diffusion}} velocity in the mesosphere {{and the lower}} thermosphere (MLT) includes the terms for molecular and eddy diffusion. These terms are very similar. For the first time, we show that, by using the similarity theory, the same formula can be obtained for the eddy diffusion coefficient as the commonly used formula derived by Weinstock (1981). The latter was obtained by taking, as a basis, the integral function for diffusion derived by Taylor (1921) and the three-dimensional Kolmogorov kinetic energy spectrum. The exact identity of both formulas means that the eddy diffusion and heat transport coefficients used in the equations, both for diffusion and thermal conductivity, must meet a criterion that restricts the outer eddy scale to being {{much less than the}} scale height of the atmosphere. This requirement {{is the same as the}} requirement that the free path of molecules must be much smaller than the scale height of the atmosphere. A further result of this criterion is that the eddy diffusion coefficients K ed, inferred from measurements of energy dissipation rates, cannot exceed the maximum value of 3. 2 × 10 6 cm 2 s − 1 for the maximum value of the energy dissipation rate of 2 W kg − 1 measured in the mesosphere and the lower thermosphere (MLT). This means that eddy diffusion coefficients larger than the maximum value correspond to eddies with outer scales so large that it is impossible to use these coefficients in eddy diffusion and eddy heat transport equations. The application of this criterion to the different experimental data shows that some reported eddy diffusion coefficients do not meet this criterion. For example, the large values of these coefficients (1 × 10 7 cm 2 s − 1) estimated in the Turbulent Oxygen Mixing Experiment (TOMEX) do not correspond to this criterion. The K ed values inferred at high latitudes by Lübken (1997) meet this criterion for summer and winter polar data, but the K ed values for summer at low latitudes are larger than the K ed maximum value corresponding to the criterion. Analysis of the experimental data on <b>meteor</b> <b>train</b> observations shows that energy dissipation with a small rate of about 0. 2 W kg − 1 sometimes can induce turbulence with eddy scales very close to the scale height of the atmosphere. Our results also explain the discrepancy between the large cooling rates calculated by Vlasov and Kelley (2014) and the temperatures given by the MSIS-E- 90 model because, in these cases, the measured eddy diffusion coefficients used in calculating the cooling rates are larger than the maximum value presented above...|$|E

Contrasting with TER’s good correlation with human judgments, we show that people tend to prefer BLEU and NIST trained models to those trained on edit distance based metrics like TER or WER. Human preferences for <b>METEOR</b> <b>trained</b> models varies depending on the source language.

The density scale height inferred by this analysis was found to be in reasonable agreement with recent previous results. The major part of the analysis done used the ambipolar diffusion coefficient as a measure of temperature change and investigated these changes over time. Three time scales were investigated; variations over a few hours, daily behaviour and long term change over months and years. All three scales showed evidence of time dependent structure. The short time scale analysis showed evidence of fluctuations consistent with gravity wave propagation. Mid time scales showed a diurnal oscillation, but the source of this is unclear.
