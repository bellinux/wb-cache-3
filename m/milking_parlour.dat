5000|$|He {{rented a}} farm in Kent, where he {{depended}} considerably on rabbiting to make a living. A move to the free-draining chalk downland of Hampshire enabled him to start milking cows using the system developed by Wiltshire dairy farmer Arthur Hosier.

Paterson started milking with a bail in 1928 (milking the cows himself) and built up a farming empire which came to include up to 10,000 acres (40 km²) (in 1943), and 4,000 dairy cows (in the early 1970s).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Dairy Management System (DMS) is an {{inalienable}} part {{of modern}} technology of milk production. There are many publications in scientific press about different aspects of computerized herd management and using of <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> equipment. At the same time, a problem of appropriate software tools development and using is discussed not enough. In this article described a mathematical model of dairy herd and milking and auxiliary technological device. This model {{is based on a}} lactation curve of every cow in a herd. This has a tuned head of livestock (up to more than 1000 head of cattle) and dedicated to the simulation of different kind technological advances on a dairy-farm. The variants of its application are milk production planning, veterinary measures planning, daily calculation of required food and other resources. Dairy management software is developing with this model. Needful properties of this software can be improved with a herd model, too...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{fluctuation}} {{was measured}} using three different vacuum control methods. Firstly, the use was made of a control valve delivered by the manufacturer; then, an additionally installed frequency converter was used. Lastly, a frequency converter fitted with the stabilisation device prototype was used. First, control sensitivity according to ISO was measured in all the three alternatives. Then, vacuum fluctuation during milking was measured. To conduct the measurements under objectively identified conditions, another measurement was conducted with air feed during milking being replaced with a precisely defined variable flow rate. The conducted measurement confirmed {{the fact that when}} the frequency converter is used, vacuum fluctuation in stabilised condition is at the same level as when the control valve is used. If there are sudden changes in flow rate and the frequency converter is used, vacuum fluctuation increases. The proposed stabilisation device prototype can reduce the fluctuation in small milking plant but it is not suitable in large <b>milking</b> <b>parlours...</b>|$|R
40|$|Machine milking, {{like a good}} marriage, is an {{exercise}} in compromise. Obsession with one goal {{at the expense of the}} others is seldom the optimal solution. The main goals of machine milking are to remove the available milk from each cow's udder quickly and completely, without slipping or falling, with minimum discomfort to the cow and minimum damage to her teats. Balancing these goals requires compromise because: Maximizing milking speed often results in less complete and/or less gentle milking. Maximizing completeness of milking generally results in slower and less gentle milking. Maximizing gentleness results in slower milking and may result in less complete milking. How quickly, how gently, and how completely should we aim to milk each cow and how should we balance these goals? Basic concepts and relevant research results are outlined in this paper to help managers of modern <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> achieve a balanced approach to milking and make the most of the machine-on time. How quickly can we expect to milk each cow? Milk flow-rate curves of individual cow milkings provide a good starting point for understanding the "machine-on " part of the milk harvesting process (eg, Bruckmaier & Hilger, 2001; Schukke...|$|R

50|$|<b>Milking</b> <b>parlour</b> wastes {{are often}} treated in {{admixture}} with human sewage {{in a local}} sewage treatment plant. This ensures that disinfectants and cleaning agents are sufficiently diluted and amenable to treatment. Running milking wastewaters into a farm slurry lagoon is a possible option although this tends to consume lagoon capacity very quickly. Land spreading is also a treatment option. See also Industrial wastewater treatment.|$|E
50|$|As herd sizes {{increased}} a {{door was}} {{set into the}} front of each bail {{so that when the}} milking was done for any cow the milker could, after undoing the leg-rope and with a remote link, open the door and allow her to exit to the pasture. The door was closed, the next cow walked into the bail and was secured. When milking machines were introduced bails were set in pairs so that a cow was being milked in one paired bail while the other could be prepared for milking. When one was finished the machine's cups are swapped to the other cow. This is the same as for Swingover <b>Milking</b> <b>Parlours</b> as described below except that the cups are loaded on the udder from the side. As herd numbers increased it was easier to double-up the cup-sets and milk both cows simultaneously than {{to increase the number of}} bails. About 50 cows an hour can be milked in a shed with 8 bails by one person. Using the same teat cups for successive cows has the danger of transmitting infection, mastitis, from one cow to another. Some farmers have devised their own ways to disinfect the clusters between cows.|$|R
30|$|The {{application}} of wastewater to organic soil system {{is an alternative}} method of treatment and disposal that is receiving increasing attention. Stratified and a Single-layer Laboratory Sand Filter was designed to treat dairy soiled water pretreated with a farm-scale woodchip filter (Ruane et al. 2014). The performance of a single-layer sand filter (SF) and a stratified SF, loaded at 20 L m− 2  day− 1, to polish effluent from a woodchip filter was investigated {{over a period of}} 82  days. Average influent unfiltered chemical oxygen demand (CODT), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium–N (NH 4 +–N), ortho-phosphorus (PO 4 3 −–P), and SS concentrations of 1, 991  ±  296, 163  ±  40, 42.3  ±  16.9, 27.2  ±  6.9, and 84  ±  30  mg L− 1 were recorded. The single-layer SF decreased the influent concentration of CODT, TN, NH 4 +–N, PO 4 –P, and SS by 39, 36, 34, 58, and 52 %, respectively. Influent concentrations of CODT, TNT, NH 4 –N, PO 4 –P, and SS were decreased by 56, 57, 41, 74, and 62 % in the stratified SF. The single-layer SF and the stratified SF were capable of reducing the influent concentration of total coliforms by 96 and 95 %, respectively. Both types of SFs produced final water quality in excess of the standards for re-use in the washing of <b>milking</b> <b>parlours.</b>|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{extensification}} measures {{within the}} agri-environmental {{policies of the}} 2000 reformed CAP, a process of livestock farming intensification has occurred {{in most of the}} sheep and goat farms in the whole country (Hadjigeorgiou and Zervas 2009). Intensification of the farm management in terms of animal feed inputs is reflected in higher consumption of external inputs (feedstuffs), reduction or cessation of using grazing resources or else reduction of the grazing time period. Intensification is also reflected in upgrading the breeding stock of local sheep (Karagouniko, Chios, Arta, Lesvos, Sfakia, Anogia, etc.), goat (indigenous, Skopelos, etc.) or cattle (Katerini, Brachyceros, etc.) breeds (Georgoudis et al. 20012011) by crossing with exotic higher productivity breeds (Lacaune, Awassi, Assaf for sheep; Zaanen, Alpine for goats; Holstein, Charolais, Limousin for cattle, etc.) which are kept in sheds. The introduction of modern technologies in housing and machinery used (<b>milking</b> <b>parlours,</b> automated feeders etc) are also elements of the present day. Furthermore, the limited labour force available, due to social devaluation of the profession and the hard working conditions, as well as the high opportunity cost of family labour, is hampering extensive pastoral management, as there are fewer experienced shepherds available (Vallerand et al. 20012007). As a consequence of all the above, monthly and annual stocking rates as well as grazing pressure on the local vegetation are considerably lowered nowadays.|$|R

40|$|Dairy {{soiled water}} (DSW) is a dilute, low {{nutrient}} effluent produced on Irish dairy farms through the regular washing down of <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> and holding areas. In Ireland, {{there is no}} closed period for the land application of DSW except where heavy rain is forecast within 48 h. Chemical amendments {{have the potential to}} decrease phosphorus (P) and suspended sediment (SS) loss from DSW applied to land. This study examined the impact of three time intervals (12, 24 and 48 h) between DSW application and rainfall and five treatments (control, unamended DSW, and DSW amended with lime, alum or ferric chloride (FeCl 2)) on P and sediment losses from an intact grassland soil in runoff boxes. Rainfall was simulated at 10. 5 +/- 1 mm h(- 1). Phosphorus concentrations (1 - 1. 6 mg L- 1) in runoff from DSW application, while not quantitative measures of P loss to surface waters in the field, indicated the importance of incidental P losses and that the current 48 h restriction in Ireland is prudent. Unamended DSW application increased P loss by, on average, 71 %, largely due to an increase in particulate phosphorus (PP) loss. All three amendments were effective in decreasing P and SS losses in runoff and, apart from the SS results for lime, were significantly different (...|$|R
40|$|To-date, {{the impact}} of modern milking parlors in dairy farming on {{physical}} strain {{has not been the}} subject of many studies. Therefore, this case study aims to record and evaluate the physical strain during the entire milking process, including the oxygen consumption (VO 2), heart rate (HR) and metabolic rate (WkJ, Watt) of milkers. The recording was conducted with a portable respiratory gas analysis system and an ECG and activity sensor on 4 dairy farms in Austria. Eight subjects aged from 45 – 52 years, with a mean age 50 ± 2. 4 SD, participated and the data were recorded during the milking process in 2 types of <b>milking</b> <b>parlours.</b> For assessment, the entire milking process was divided into preparation, milking and follow-up work. The entire milking process was performed with an average oxygen consumption of 46. 5  l/h and a heart rate of 98 bpm, which is below the anaerobic threshold; whereas in the preparation and follow-up work, this threshold was exceeded. Generally, during the milking process, a moderate physical strain (32. 4 %) and a balanced metabolic rate (143 watt/m 2) were determined. The physical strain in female milkers was 9. 2 % higher than in male milkers throughout the entire process. Reduction of physical strain can be achieved through additional breaks, reduced work speed, division of labour and technical devices...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to analyse {{problems}} with cold when working in dairyfarms with respect to prevalence, frequency and risk for injuries and to propose measures for improvements of thermal conditions. The project comprised two parts: a field study and a questionnaire survey. The field studies were performed at seven dairy-farms in the Uppsala region and six dairy-farms in the northern region of Sweden (Västerbotten). Four of the farms in the Uppsala region were non-insulated loose housing barns, one was an insulated loose housing barn and two had traditional barns with tie stall. In Västerbotten, five of the farms were non-insulated loose housing barns and one was an insulated loose housing barn. In total, 20 farmers were studied during milking and animal feeding and maintenance. The majority of the studied farmers were owners of the farm and family members. During the field study, both physiological and physical measurements were performed. In addition, a detailed observation of the work, which enabled linking of measured data and the work tasks that were carried out. The physiological measurements included skin temperature of different body parts and heart rate. All subjects and their clothes were weighed before and after work in order to estimate sweating and evaporation. Further, the energetic workload was measured at the farms in Västerbotten. The physical measurements concerned air and surface temperature and air velocity in the buildings where work was performed as well as outdoors. A questionnaire was sent to 140 dairy-farms {{in the northern part of}} Sweden. The questions concerned problems and discomfort that may be related to cold, for example, how cold affected the work, problems with clothing, gloves and footwear. As was expected, the study showed that cold might cause considerable stress for dairy-farmers during cold weather. However, problems with cold should be viewed in a larger context. Workers in dairy-farms are exposed to several physical and physiological stressors in the work environment, such as moisture, organic dust, musculoskeletal stress and mental stress. During winter, cold adds to these stressors, which increases the environmental load on the individual. The typical climate in the raised <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> was as follows: low air temperature, which was lowest at foot level, high humidity, moisture, frequent draught and low surface temperatures. Hands and fingers often became cold during milking. The hands were often 20 - 25 °C. Especially the finger temperatures dropped to low levels during milking. In many cases it was below 16 °C for almost the whole spell of work. Finger temperatures down to 6 °C were observed at the end of the milking period in <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> with a non-insulated holding area, and 9 °C in <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> with an insulated holding area. In many cases, foot and toe temperatures dropped to unacceptably low levels. The reasons for cold feet were reported to be the result of inadequate footwear. This problem was probably related to the fact that rubber boots without an insulation layer were very common among the farmers. The second most common problem was sweaty or wet feet. An important way to be protected from cold is to use adequate clothing. Cotton, which absorbs moisture and water well, was a very common material in the garments worn by the farmers. For the outer layer of the clothing, a water-repellent material is a better alternative in cold-wet environments. At heavy work, which results in sweating, cotton is not the most appropriate material to wear close to the skin. Sweat is absorbed by the cotton and thus stays at the skin. This leads to discomfort and feels cold when heavy work changes to light work, or when the worker moves outdoors. Many commercial non-absorbing materials, which may contribute to better thermal comfort, are available. When using underwear made of such materials, the moisture is transported away from the skin to other clothing layers. Both the survey results and the observations indicated that cold was experienced as a minor problem in farms with non-insulated loose housing barns even though most of the participating farms were situated in one of the coldest regions of Sweden. In non-insulated loose housing barns, the work and the protection from cold is most likely adjusted to the cold climate, and temperature changes may lead to less discomfort, at least, for that reason. Greater experience of work in cold conditions probably contributes to a work organisation that minimises cold problems. In traditional barns, temperature changes between buildings and outdoors are common and were considered a major cause for thermal discomfort. Based on the results from this study, recommendations have been worked out. They provide a long list of interventions to prevent cold hands and feet, advice about clothing and other measures for improvements of the thermal conditions...|$|R

40|$|Dairy {{soiled water}} (DSW) is {{produced}} on dairy farms through the washing-down of <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> and holding areas, and is generally applied to land. However, {{there is a}} risk of nutrient loss to surface and ground waters from land application. The aim {{of this study was to}} use aerobic woodchip filters to remove organic matter, suspended solids (SS) and nutrients from DSW. This novel treatment method would allow the re-use of the final effluent from the woodchip filters to wash down yards, thereby reducing water usage and environmental risks associated with land spreading. Three replicate 100 m(2) farm-scale woodchip filters, each 1 m deep, were constructed and operated to treat DSW from 300 cows over an 11 -month study duration. The filters were loaded at a hydraulic loading rate of 30 L m(- 2) d(- 1), applied in four doses through a network of pipes on the filter surface. Average influent concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), SS and total nitrogen (TN) of 5750 +/- 1441 mg L- 1, 602 +/- 303 mg L- 1 and 357 +/- 100 mg L- 1, respectively, were reduced by 66, 86 and 57 % in the filters. Effluent nutrient concentrations remained relatively stable over the study period, indicating the effectiveness of the filter despite increasing and/or fluctuating influent concentrations. Woodchip filters are a low cost, minimal maintenance treatment system, using a renewable resource that can be easily integrated into existing farm infrastructure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{heart rate}} {{variability}} (HRV) parameters of dairy cows were monitored during parlour (PARL) and the later installed automatic (AMS) milking on a small-scale commercial dairy farm in Hungary. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess stress in relation to the type of milking and the frequency of human interaction. <b>Parlour</b> <b>milking</b> involved regular moving and crowding of the animals with frequent human interaction, which were much less frequent in automatic milking. The first phase of the study was conducted prior to the changeover [n = 27] and the second two months afterwards [n = 19 (of the cows from the first phase) ]. Heart rate (HR) was recorded by the Polar RS 800 CX recording system. HRV parameters indicative of sympathovagal balance were calculated for periods of lying and standing in the barn, waiting before milking and milking, respectively. Morning and evening faecal glucocorticoid concentrations were also measured. Fear of humans was tested by an avoidance distance test. Baseline HRV parameters showed no difference (P > 0. 05) between the two systems. In the periods before, during and after milking a higher sympathetic tone was detected in cows in the PARL phase. Mean faecal glucocorticoid concentrations were higher at the time of <b>parlour</b> <b>milking.</b> The avoidance distance did not differ between the two phases. The results suggest that automatic milking might be less stressful for cows than <b>parlour</b> <b>milking,</b> possibly due to the shorter duration of restraint after milking and the less frequent human interaction...|$|R
40|$|Lameness {{has long}} {{been one of the}} three major {{economic}} disorders, particularly in dairy cattle. Thin soles, excessive wear of the soles, are only one reason for lameness. Their occurrence varies from farm to farm. Outbreaks may occur on intensively managed dairy farms, particularly on pasture-based systems. However, the disorder has been recognised in housed dairy and feed-lotted beef patients. Typically, thin soles are seen in dairy patients in early lactation exposed to wet conditions at claw level and long walking distances. Abrasive material/s on the walking surfaces and feeding platforms usually speed up the process of excessive wear. Excessive sole wear may be expected in new or re-concreted <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> and yards. The new concrete is very abrasive. In such situations, {{more than half of the}} herd may develop lameness within a few weeks from exposure to the new/re-concreted area (popularly referred to as ‘New concrete disease’). Early signs of thin soles include a slow, painful gait. The walking is often described as ‘walking on egg shells’. Milk production is lowered at individual patient and group level occurs. On clinical examination the dorsal wall of the claw is short and the sole is flexible on a thumb pressure. Haemorrhages in all claw zones may be present. The incidence of sole ulcers, white line disease, toe ulcers, subsolar abscess and osteitis of the third phalanx is often increased. The control should aim to prevent excessive wear, early detection of the affected patients and improve the claw horn quality.
