40|$|Cracking {{processes}} in rock specimens containing one, two or multiple artificial flaws under compression {{have been studied}} systematically and extensively in the laboratory for the past decades. To enhance {{our understanding of the}} role of en-echelon cracks in the formation of a shear rupture, specimens containing artificial en-echelon flaws are studied in this paper. Rock-like material Hydrocal-B 11 gypsum is used to <b>mould</b> <b>block</b> specimens, which contain en-echelon flaws cut by the Waterjet. The fracturing processes of the specimens under uniaxial loading are observed and recorded by a camcorder and a high speed video system. For the studied en-echelon flaws arrangement, three stages of fracture development are observed. The results show that tensile wing cracks (TWCs) are involved in coalescing the pre-existing flaws and fragmenting the bridge zones. The TWC development is strongly influenced by the stress field around adjacent flaw tips as indicated by the curvature of their crack paths. The development of a shear rupture across the entire specimen is attributed to the development of two short shear cracks emanating from the two outer flaw tips, which coalesce with two previously initiated steeply inclined tensile cracks.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{influence}} of the materials used in <b>moulding</b> <b>blocks</b> of hybrid <b>moulds</b> on the injection moulding setup and the properties of the mouldings. Design/methodology/approach – An instrumented (pressure and temperature) hybrid mould with exchangeable <b>moulding</b> <b>blocks,</b> produced by rapid prototyping and tooling techniques (RPT), was used to produce polypropylene tubular mouldings. The configuration of the mould was varied with combinations of <b>moulding</b> <b>block</b> materials, namely, an epoxy resin composite processed by vacuum casting and steel. The processing conditions were adjusted to obtained steady processing conditions. The mouldings were assessed in terms of the microstructure and the shrinkage. Findings – Due to the properties of the <b>moulding</b> <b>block</b> obtained by RPT being different from tool steel, the injection moulding processing conditions and the plastics parts properties are different when hybrid moulds are used. The cycle time depends on the <b>moulding</b> <b>block</b> properties and must be adjusted to the desired running temperature. The morphology of the mouldings is strongly affected by the thermal properties of the <b>moulding</b> <b>block</b> materials. When different materials are used in the core and the cavity asymmetric structures develop in the part. The shrinkage of the mouldings, when resin cores are used is also affected by the deformation of the core caused by the injection pressure. Originality/value – This paper makes a contribution to understanding the morphology of semi-crystalline mouldings obtained using hybrid moulds and enhances the importance of the core deformation on the shrinkage of the mouldings.

These results are implemented in the final mould design strategy for blow moulding, having in mind the effect on the final cooling time and related part quality. To achieve optimal integration of mould design issues such as conformal cooling and mould material selection, a modular and fast exchange design principle for blow moulding of hybrid moulds is developed at University College Ghent.

40|$|For {{conventional}} {{injection moulding}} of semi-crystalline plastic parts {{it is common}} to obtain a skin/core type of structure through the wall thickness. The cause of this structure is the thermo-mechanical environment during the process. The size of the skin and also its degree of orientation strongly influences the mechanical properties of the plastics part. They can be controlled by many technological variables such as injection rate, mould temperature, melt temperature, wall thickness, mould material, etc. Hybrid moulds may use different materials in the <b>moulding</b> <b>blocks</b> which affects the skin thickness symmetry {{on both sides of the}} parts. This work aims at understanding the influence of different materials used for the <b>moulding</b> <b>blocks</b> of hybrid <b>moulds</b> on the structural properties of polypropylene parts. The material combination of steel/steel, steel/(epoxy+aluminium), steel/(epoxy+short steel fibres) for the <b>moulding</b> <b>blocks</b> is used to induce asymmetric structure development in the part. Simultaneously the influence of the injection rate is analysed as it is one of the more relevant variables in the skin formation.

40|$|Hybrid moulds are a novel {{approach}} for rapid tooling of injection moulds that combines conventional machining for the mould structure and rapid prototyping techniques for the <b>moulding</b> <b>blocks</b> (core and cavity). In this study, two routes were used for producing the moulding blocks: selective laser sintering of stainless steel-based powder (hard tool) and epoxy resin vacuum casting (soft tool). The experimental work {{was based on a}} complex tridimensional commercial part. Themouldings were made in polypropylene, and the processing performance was monitored online in terms of pressure and temperature at the impression. The performance of the <b>moulding</b> <b>blocks</b> was analysed in terms of thermal and cycle performance and structural integrity. The epoxy tooling route is more adequate for fine detailing than selective laser sintering but is not adequate for parts with extensive ribs or deep bosses.

40|$|Prémio de melhor artigo com interesse para a indústria. Hybrid moulds are an {{increasingly}} considered alternative for prototype series or short production runs. In this solution of injection moulds the <b>moulding</b> elements (<b>blocks</b> or other inserts) are manufactured in alternative metallic materials or in synthetic materials.

For instance, in order to allow uniformity in the cooling of the moulded part, and a significant cooling time reduction, conformal channels are recommended as an efficient solution. The layout of the channels should contour the geometry of the impression, and has to be easily implemented during the production of the <b>moulding</b> <b>blocks.</b> This paper reports on a case study involving the use of conformal cooling channels obtained in wax by 3 D-impression.
