5|$|Not to be {{confused}} with Torpedo sinuspersici, also known as the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} shock delivered by a <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> can be severe {{but is not}} directly life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> as bycatch; captured rays are usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this ray under Data Deficient. In the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common electric ray and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|E
5|$|Known parasites of the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{include the}} {{tapeworms}} Anthocephalum gracile and Calyptrobothrium riggii, the leeches Pontobdella muricata and Trachelobdella lubrica, the monogeneans Amphibdella torpedinis, Amphibdelloides kechemiraen, A. maccallumi, A. vallei, Empruthotrema raiae, E. torpedinis, and Squalonchocotyle torpedinis, and the nematodes Ascaris torpedinis and Mawsonascaris pastinacae.|$|E
500|$|Small, benthic {{bony fishes}} {{constitute}} over 90% of the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray's</b> diet by weight; these include gobies, hake, sea bass, mullets, jack mackerel, sea breams, goatfish, damselfish, wrasses, conger eels, and flatfish. Cephalopods such as European squid (Loligo vulgaris) and elegant cuttlefish (Sepia elegans) are a minor secondary food source. There {{is a single}} record of an individual that had swallowed a penaeid prawn, Penaeus kerathurus, and a study of captive rays found that they reject live Macropodia crabs. Off southern France, {{by far the most}} important prey species is the leaping mullet (Liza saliens). Food items are swallowed whole; there is a record of a ray [...] long that had consumed a three-bearded rockling (Gaidropsarus vulgaris) [...] long.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} stomach {{contents}} of the <b>electric</b> <b>marbled</b> <b>ray</b> Torpedo marmorata Risso, 1810 {{has shown that the}} species is a rather active feeder, consuming mostly teleosts and, occasionally, cephalopods. This confirms the fact that T. marmorata is an ichthyophagous species, such as specimens from other areas and other species of the genus Torpedo...|$|R
50|$|The blackspotted {{numbfish}} (Narcine timlei), {{also known}} as the black-spotted <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> Indian <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> largespotted numbfish, and spotted numbfish, is a species of numbfish in the family Narcinidae.|$|R
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Torpedo, the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{belongs to the}} {{subgenus}} Torpedo, which differs from the other subgenus Tetronarce in having fringed margins on their spiracles and generally ornate dorsal coloration. Other common names for this species include common crampfish, marbled torpedo, numbfish, and spotted torpedo.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{may remain}} {{motionless}} {{for several days}} at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
5|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is {{an ambush}} {{predator}} that employs electricity to capture prey. Vision {{is of little}} importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom. Instead, it likely relies on the mechanoreceptors of its lateral line, as it only attacks moving prey. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini may also contribute to prey detection.|$|E
50|$|The Brazilian <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Narcine brasiliensis) is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the family Narcinidae. It inhabits reefs along the western coast of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico from North Carolina to {{northern}} Argentina.|$|R
5000|$|The giant <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> or Cortez <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> Narcine entemedor, is {{a species}} of numbfish, family Narcinidae, native to the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of California to Panama. It is found in shallow water on sandy bottoms and {{sometimes}} adjacent to reefs. This species {{is closely related to}} the lesser <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Narcine bancroftii) from the western Atlantic, and may represent the same species. The specific epithet entemedor seems to be the Spanish equivalent of [...] "intimidator".|$|R
50|$|The shortlip <b>electric</b> <b>ray,</b> Narcine brevilabiata is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the {{numbfish}} family, Narcinidae. It may be synonymous with the blackspotted numbfish, Narcine maculata. The shortlip <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is found in shallow continental shelf waters offshore of China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, {{at a depth of}} 41 to 70 meters. It is assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as it is caught as by-catch in large numbers by shrimp trawling fisheries operating throughout its range.|$|R
5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> inhabits rocky {{reefs and}} {{seagrass}} beds, {{as well as}} nearby areas with sandy or muddy bottoms. During warm summer months, pregnant females are known to migrate into Arcachon Bay in northwestern France, where they are commonly found in very shallow, muddy pools near oyster beds. This species may conduct a northward migration in summer and autumn, into {{the waters of the}} British Isles.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{delivered}} by the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> can be painful but is seldom life-threatening, {{although there is a}} danger of a shocked diver becoming disoriented underwater. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, leading it and other electric fishes to be used in medicine. The ancient Greeks and Romans applied live rays to those afflicted with conditions such as chronic headaches and gout, and recommended that its meat be eaten by epileptics.|$|E
5|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{exhibits}} aplacental viviparity, {{in which}} the developing embryos are nourished initially by yolk, which is later supplemented by nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses; the inner lining of the uterus bears a series of parallel lengthwise folds. The reproductive cycle for females is probably biennial, while males are capable of mating every year. Mating occurs from November to January, and the young are born the following year after a gestation period of 9–12 months. The litter size ranges from 3 to 32, increasing {{with the size of}} the female.|$|E
500|$|Relative to {{its small}} size, the onefin <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> can deliver an {{extremely}} powerful electric shock {{to defend itself}} against predators, which include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). It propels itself using its muscular tail rather than its pectoral fins. The diet of this species consists mainly of polychaete worms. The reproductive biology of the onefin <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> has not been documented; presumably it is viviparous like other <b>electric</b> <b>rays.</b> Males mature sexually at somewhere between [...] long, while females mature at around [...] long.|$|R

50|$|The blind torpedo, Benthobatis marcida, is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> most {{commonly}} found in the west-central area of the Atlantic Ocean. Like all <b>electric</b> <b>rays,</b> it can produce an electric shock that can be harmful to humans and other fish. It can grow up to 50 cm long.|$|R
5|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{is caught}} {{incidentally}} in bottom trawls, trammel nets, and bottom longlines; {{it has little}} economic value and is mostly discarded at sea when captured. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough population and fishery data to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. At least in the northern Mediterranean, surveys have found that it remains the most common electric ray, and is perhaps becoming more abundant in Italian waters. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in acetylcholine receptors, which {{play an important role}} in the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal and solitary, the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> {{can often}} be found lying the sea floor buried except for its eyes and spiracles. This slow-moving {{predator}} feeds almost exclusively on small bony fishes, which it ambushes from the bottom and subdues with strong electric bursts. It defends itself by turning towards the threat, swimming in a loop, or curling up with its underside facing outward, while emitting electric shocks to drive off the prospective predator. Its paired electric organs are capable of producing 70–80 volts of electricity. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by yolk and histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Mating takes place from November to January, and females bear litters of 3–32 pups every other year after a gestation period of 9–12 months. The newborn ray is immediately capable of using electricity to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its size}} and {{electrical}} defenses, the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> does not often fall prey to other animals such as sharks. This species exhibits different defensive behaviors depending on whether a prospective predator grasps it by the disc or the tail. A ray touched on the disc will quickly turn toward the threat while producing electric shocks; {{this is followed by}} it fleeing in a straight line, after which it may re-bury itself. A ray touched on the tail will propel itself upward into a loop; if it has not escaped after the maneuver, the ray will curl into a ring with the belly facing outward, so as to present the area of its body with the highest electric field gradient (the underside of the electric organs) towards the threat; these behaviors are accompanied by short, strong electric shocks. The ray tends to produce more electric bursts when protecting its tail than when protecting its disc.|$|E
50|$|Relative to {{its small}} size, the onefin <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> can deliver an {{extremely}} powerful electric shock {{to defend itself}} against predators, which include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). It propels itself using its muscular tail rather than its pectoral fins. The diet of this species consists mainly of polychaete worms. The reproductive biology of the onefin <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> has not been documented; presumably it is viviparous like other <b>electric</b> <b>rays.</b> Males mature sexually at somewhere between 11 and 17 cm long, while females mature at around 16 cm long.|$|R
500|$|The ocellated <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> or {{bullseye}} <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (Diplobatis ommata) is {{a species}} of <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> in the family Narcinidae, native to the shallow inshore waters of the eastern central Pacific from the Gulf of California to Ecuador. Reaching [...] in length, this species has a rounded pectoral fin disc and pelvic fins with convex margins. Its short and thick tail bears two dorsal fins and terminates in a triangular caudal fin. The ocellated <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is named for the distinctive large eyespot on the middle of its disc, consisting of a black or yellow center surrounded by concentric rings. Its dorsal coloration is otherwise highly variable, ranging from plain to ornately patterned on a light to dark brown background. The front part of its disc is darker brown.|$|R

5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific {{electric ray}}s for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E
500|$|Widely {{distributed}} in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is found from Scotland and the southern North Sea southward to the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, including all around the Mediterranean Sea.

It has been recorded from as deep as [...] The <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> tends to be found deeper than the common torpedo (T. torpedo), which shares the southern portion of its range.|$|E
500|$|The <b>marbled</b> <b>{{electric}}</b> <b>ray</b> (Torpedo marmorata) is {{a species}} of electric ray in the family Torpedinidae found in the coastal waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the North Sea to South Africa. This benthic fish inhabits rocky reefs, seagrass beds, and sandy and muddy flats in shallow to moderately deep waters. It can survive in environments with very little dissolved oxygen, such as tidal pools. The <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc and a muscular tail that bears two dorsal fins of nearly equal size and a large caudal fin. It can be identified by the long, finger-like projections on the rims of its spiracles, {{as well as by}} its dark brown mottled color pattern, though some individuals are plain-colored. Males and females typically reach [...] and [...] long respectively.|$|E

500|$|French naturalist Antoine Risso {{described}} the <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> as Torpedo marmorata in his 1810 Ichtyologie de Nice, ou histoire naturelle des poissons du département des Alpes maritimes (Ichthyology of Nice, or {{natural history of}} fishes in the Alpes-Maritimes). The specific epithet marmorata means [...] "marbled" [...] in Latin, and refers to the ray's color pattern. Because no type specimens are known, in 1999 Ronald Fricke designated Risso's original illustration as the species lectotype.|$|E
500|$|The {{body of the}} <b>marbled</b> <b>electric</b> <b>ray</b> is {{soft and}} flabby, and entirely lacks dermal denticles. The thick {{pectoral}} fin disc is nearly circular and comprises about 59–67% of the total length; the paired kidney-shaped electric organs are visible beneath the skin, outside of the small eyes. Immediately posterior to each eye is a large, oval spiracle, which bears 6–8 long, finger-like projections on the rim that almost meet at the center. On the [...] "nape" [...] behind the spiracles, there are 5–7 prominent mucous pores. Between the nostrils, there is a quadrangular curtain of skin much broader than long, that almost reaches the small, arched mouth. The teeth are small with a single pointed cusp, and are arranged with a quincunx pattern into a pavement-like band in either jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are small and located beneath the disc.|$|E
500|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the <b>marbled</b> <b>{{electric}}</b> <b>ray</b> can produce a strong electric shock for attack and defense, produced {{by a pair of}} electric organs derived from muscle tissue. Each electric organ consists of 400–600 vertical columns, with each column composed of a stack of roughly 400 jelly-filled [...] "electroplates" [...] that essentially act like a battery. This ray has been measured producing up to 70–80 volts, and the maximum potential of the electric discharge has been estimated to be as high as 200 volts. The strength of the electric shock declines progressively as the ray becomes fatigued. Experiments in vitro have found that the nerves innervating the electric organ essentially stop functioning at temperatures below [...] As the water temperature in the wild regularly drops below this threshold in winter, {{it is possible that the}} ray does not use its electric organ for part of the year. Alternately, the ray may have a yet-unknown physiological mechanism to adapt electric organ function to the cold.|$|E
