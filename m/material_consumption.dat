25|$|Bourgois, {{writing about}} life in East Harlem, New York, United States, {{described}} how young men felt pressured by models of successful masculinity and family structure passed down from their parents' and grandparents' generations, together with modern-day ideals of manhood that also place an emphasis on <b>material</b> <b>consumption.</b> Trapped in their slums, {{with little or no}} available employment, they are unlikely to attain either of these models or expectations of masculine success. In these circumstances, ideals of masculinity are reshaped to emphasize misogyny, substance abuse and participation in crime and often also xenophobia and racism. Gang rape and sexual conquest are normalized, as men turn their aggression against women they can no longer control patriarchally or support economically.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{movements}} in raw <b>materials</b> <b>consumption</b> {{over the past}} 30 years. Included in this review are all base metals and steel, and important agricultural raw materials. These primary commodities share the common characteristic that they are used as inputs in manufacturing and construction. Some metals and minerals, energy commodities, and timber products {{are not included in}} this review for various reasons. The period reviewed is from 1961 to 1988. A prominent characteristic of the metals market during the past 15 years has been its very slow growth. In some years consumption of several raw materials has even declined. Explaining the causes of this slowdown, in the face of moderate economic growth, has become a topical issue. The slowdown has important implications for a number of developing countries that rely heavily on exports of these materials. The severity and persistence of post- 1973 declines in metals intensity per unit of GNP, prompted the conjecture that it may have been structural. This paper reviews the debate on this issue, including results of statistical tests. It also summarizes the trends in raw <b>materials</b> <b>consumption</b> and reviews the technological developments relating to raw <b>materials</b> <b>consumption.</b> Mining&Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Montreal Protocol,Sanitation and Sewerage,Primary Metals,Environmental Economics&Policies...|$|R

40|$|Steel beams with {{perforated}} {{steel web}} {{is a type}} of flexural members, which is characterized by the decreased <b>materials</b> <b>consumption.</b> Existence of holes in the web enables to simplify placement of communications from other hand. The using of beams with perforated web with hot-rolled double-T cross-section as a girder of transversal frame of trees hothouse is analysed in the paper. The beams are considered under the action of design vertical load, consisting from dead weight of the roof and snow load. The value of design vertical load is equal to 28 kN/m. The grade of steel was S 235. The dependence between diameters of holes, distances between holes, height of the beams cross-sections and <b>materials</b> <b>consumption</b> was obtained on the base of numerical experiment. The Numerical experiment was conducted for the simple beam with the span equal to 12 m. The obtained dependence allows to determine rational {{from the point of view}} of <b>materials</b> <b>consumption</b> diameters of holes, distances between holes and height of the beam, which were equal to 0. 25 m, 1. 03 m and 0. 55 m, correspondingly.

50|$|There are {{two ways}} to reduce the <b>{{material}}</b> <b>consumption</b> per unit of service, the material input (MI) of the product can be reduced or amount of service units (S) can be increased. Material input in the production phase can be reduced by using less energy or raw materials. Also transport chains can be rationalized. In the use phase the material input per unit of service can be reduced when amount of service produced is increased. For instance in case of a newspaper the material input can be reduced by using recycled paper instead of primary. Material input per reader decreases when the same paper is shared with several persons. High quality products and availability of spares potentially increase the service life of the product. When the service life of a product is increased, the <b>material</b> <b>consumption</b> per unit of time decreases. Usually services like car sharing also help to reduce MIPS values since fewer products are needed to produce the service for greater number of people.|$|E
