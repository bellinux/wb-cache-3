40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{and tobacco}} use are two <b>major</b> <b>alarming</b> global health issues posing immense threats to human populations. Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (MTB) by activation of macrophages could induce the sequences of cells activation and releases of inflammatory cytokines such as CXCL- 8, Il- 12 and TNF-α {{which in turn}} induces the immune system network. However no information is available on other activity of cells by MTB and smoking. In the current study we aimed to investigate the serum levels TNF-a, CXCL- 8 and phagocytosis capacity in tuberculosis patients with and without smoking. 103 subjects entered the study including 61 new diagnosed pulmonary TB patients (23 smokers and 38 nonsmokers) and 42 control healthy subjects. The phagocytosis of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-dextran) in blood monocytes/macrophages through flowcytometry was assessed. Serum levels of TNF-a and CXCL- 8 were analyzed by ELISA methods. A lower percentage of cells from TB patients who smoked [50. 29 % (43. 4 - 57. 2), p< 0. 01] took up FITC-dextran after 2 h compared to non-smoking TB subjects [71. 62 % (69. 2 - 74. 1) ] and healthy cases [97. 45 % (95. 9 - 99. 1). Phagocytic capacity was inversely correlated with cigarette smoking as measured by pack years (r=- 0. 73, p< 0. 001). The serum levels of TNF-a and CXCL- 8 were significantly higher in the TB patients who smoked compared to the TB non-smoker group (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 01 respectively). Blood monocytes/macrophages from TB patients have reduced phagocytic capacity which is further reduced in TB patients who smoke.

40|$|Interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) is a <b>major</b> <b>alarm</b> {{upstream}} pro-inflammatory cytokine {{that also}} affects immunity and hematopoiesis by inducing cytokine cascades. In the tumor arena, IL- 1 {{is produced by}} malignant or microenvironment cells. As a pleiotropic cytokine, IL- 1 is involved in tumorigenesis and tumor invasiveness, {{but also in the}} control of anti-tumor immunity. IL- 1 α and IL- 1 β are the major agonists of IL- 1, while IL- 1 Ra is a physiological inhibitor of pre-formed IL- 1. In their secreted form, IL- 1 α and IL- 1 β bind to the same receptors and induce the same biological functions, but IL- 1 α and IL- 1 β differ in their compartmentalization within the producing cell or the microenvironment. IL- 1 β is only active in its processed secreted form and mediates inflammation, which promotes carcinogenesis, tumor invasiveness and immunosuppression, whereas IL- 1 α is mainly cell-associated and in the tumor contest, when expressed on the cell membrane, it stimulates anti-tumor cell immunity manifested by tumor regression. It the tumor milieu, extracellular level of IL- 1 α is usually low and do not stimulate broad inflammation that promotes progression. Immunosuppression induced by IL- 1 β in the tumor microenvironment, mainly through MDSC induction, usually inhibits or masks anti-tumor cell immunity induced by cell-associated IL- 1 α. However, in different tumor systems, redundant or unique patterns of IL- 1 α and IL- 1 β expression and function have been observed. Recent breakthroughs in inflammasome biology and IL- 1 β processing/secretion have spurred the development of novel anti-IL- 1 agents, which are being used in clinical trials in patients with diverse inflammatory diseases. Better understanding of the integrative role of IL- 1 α and IL- 1 β in distinct malignancies, will enable the application of novel IL- 1 modulation approaches at the bedside, in cancer patients with minimal residual disease (MRD), as an adjunct to conventional approaches to reduce the tumor burden...|$|R

40|$|The {{cytokine}} interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) {{has emerged}} as a <b>major</b> systemic <b>alarm</b> signal which appears to be produced by essentially every injured tissue. Recent evidence points to the skin, particularly the injured skin, as one of the major sites of IL- 6 production. The hallmark of IL- 6 gene regulation is its induction by inflammation-associated cytokines, bacterial products, virus infection, and activation of any of the three major signal transduction pathways (diacylglycerol-, cAMP-, and Ca++-activated). Many of these inducers act largely through a 23 -bp “multiple-response element” in the IL- 6 promoter. Different cell types, including keratinocytes, secrete multiple post-translationally modified forms of IL- 6. This cytokine, in turn, {{plays a key role in}} activating a variety of local and systemic host defense mechanisms that are aimed at limiting tissue injury. Thus, IL- 6 elicits major changes in the biochemical, physiologic, and immunologic status of the host (e. g., the “acute phase” plasma protein response; activation of B, T, and NK-cell function). IL- 6 enhances the proliferation of human keratinocytes and of many B-cell lines but inhibits that of certain carcinoma cell lines; nevertheless, IL- 6 can enhance the motility of these carcinoma cells. Elevated levels of IL- 6 are observed in human body fluids during acute and chronic infections, neoplasia, autoimmune diseases, and psoriasis and following third-degree burns. It is likely that IL- 6 produced by cellular elements in the skin represents an important means of communication between the external environment and the millieu interieur...|$|R

Given the broad array of acute and chronic harms that arise from this trend, it is a <b>major</b> cause for <b>alarm</b> and {{it is imperative that}} we improve our knowledge of key drivers of youth drinking. Changes wrought by the neoliberal political climate of deregulation that characterised the last two decades in many countries including Aotearoa (Aotearoa is a Maori name for New Zealand) New Zealand have transformed the availability of alcohol to young people. Commercial development of youth alcohol markets has seen the emergence of new environments, cultures and practices around drinking and intoxication but the ways in which these changes are interpreted and taken up are not well understood. This paper reports findings from a qualitative research project investigating the meaning-making practices of young people in New Zealand in response to alcohol marketing. Research data included group interviews with a range of Maori and Pakeha young people at three time periods. Thematic analyses of the youth data on usages of marketing materials indicate naturalisation of tropes of alcohol intoxication. We show how marketing is used and enjoyed in youth discourses creating and maintaining what we refer to as intoxigenic social environments. The implications are considered in light of the growing exposure of young people to alcohol marketing in a discussion of strategies to manage and mitigate its impacts on behaviour and consumption.

40|$|Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) is a <b>major</b> {{systemic}} <b>alarm</b> {{signal that}} indicates {{the occurrence of}} tissue damage. The IL- 6 gene is induced in various cell types by serum, inflammation-associated cytokines, viruses, and second-messenger agonists. There is an overall functional similarity between IL- 6 and c-fos promoters, since transfection of excess amounts of either promoter DNA into intact HeLa cells modulates {{the function of the}} heterologous promoter construct. Furthermore, the transcription regulatory factor Fos transrepresses both the IL- 6 and c-fos promoters. The 115 -base pair (bp) region from - 225 to - 111 in the IL- 6 5 '-flanking region, which shares nucleotide sequence similarity with the c-fos serum response (SRE) and adjacent AP- 1 -like (the CGTCA motif) elements, confers responsiveness to several reagents, including serum, forskolin, and phorbol ester, upon the heterologous herpesvirus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. In gel shift assays using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells, the 115 -bp IL- 6 enhancer formed several complexes that (i) were increased when extracts from induced HeLa cells were used and (ii) were inhibited most efficiently by the fos E DNA fragment (- 700 to - 100) and by c-fos oligonucleotides containing an intact AP- 1 -like site (the CGTCA motif). The 23 -bp oligonucleotide designated AR 1 from within the IL- 6 enhancer region (- 173 to - 151) contains a CGTCA motif and bound nuclear proteins that also associated with c-fos oligonucleotides containing either an intact SRE or AP- 1 -like site. A single copy of AR 1 inserted upstream of the herpesvirus TK promoter rendered this heterologous promoter inducible by IL- 1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor, and serum as well as by activators of the protein kinase A (forskolin) and protein kinase C (phorbol ester) signal transduction pathways. Mutations in the AP- 1 -like site within AR 1 (CGTCA [...] GTTCA) decreased inducibility of the chimeric IL- 6 /TK/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene by phorbol ester and by forskolin but not by serum, IL- 1 alpha, or tumor necrosis factor. These data not only show that the AR 1 segment from within the IL- 6 enhancer binds nuclear proteins that also bind to c-fos regulatory elements but also demonstrate that a single copy of this 23 -bp element is functionally sufficient to confer responsiveness to a variety of inducers and thus define a multiple-response element...|$|R
40|$|A <b>major</b> {{problem with}} <b>alarm</b> {{processing}} and fault diagnosis in power systems is {{the reliance on}} the circuit alarm status. If {{there is too much}} information available and the time of arrival of the information is random due to weather conditions etc., the alarm activity is not easily interpreted by system operators. In respect of these problems, this thesis sets out the work that has been carried out to design and evaluate a diagnostic tool which assists power system operators during a heavy period of alarm activity in condition monitoring. The aim of employing this diagnostic tool is to monitor and raise uncertain alarm information for the system operators, which serves a proposed solution for restoring such faults. The diagnostic system uses elements of AI namely expert systems, and fuzzy logic that incorporate abductive reasoning. The objective of employing abductive reasoning is to optimise an interpretation of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) based uncertain messages when the SCADA based messages are not satisfied with simple logic alone. The method consists of object-oriented programming, which demonstrates reusability, polymorphism, and readability. The principle behind employing objectoriented techniques is to provide better insights and solutions compared to conventional artificial intelligence (Al) programming languages. The characteristics of this work involve the development and evaluation of a fuzzy-expert system which tries to optimise the uncertainty in the 16 -lines 12 -bus sample power system. The performance of employing this diagnostic tool is assessed based on consistent data acquisition, readability, adaptability, and maintainability on a PC. This diagnostic tool enables operators to control and present more appropriate interpretations effectively rather than a mathematical based precise fault identification when the mathematical modelling fails and the period of alarm activity is high. This research contributes to the field of power system control, in particular Scottish Hydro-Electric PLC has shown interest and supplied all the necessary information and data. The AI based power system is presented as a sample application of Scottish Hydro-Electric and KEPCO (Korea Electric Power Corporation) ...|$|R
40|$|Nigerias socio-political and {{economic}} landscape has been blighted by the endemic twin evil {{of crime and}} violence. Social responsibility media, framing, and attribution theories provide the theoretical anchor for this paper. Nigerian consumers of media products, like their counterparts in other cultures, are insatiably interested in, and are at times shocked and fascinated by, crime and violence, as covered in the media. The Nigerian mass media, acting both as mirrors of society and business enterprises, provide a daily diet of these crimes, howbeit deficiently. This deficiency is traceable to their episodic rather than thematic approach, their individual, instead of societal blame, and cause, rather than solution. Nigerian media, in many instances, fail to turn their searchlight on the undercurrents of crime and violence: the Nigerian system of justice and the issues and grievances {{that give rise to}} crime and violence in the society. The paper, as matters arising, critically examines the often ignored, and at best-perfunctorily handled, aspects of coverage of crime and violence in Nigerian media. Nigeria’s socio-political {{and economic}} landscape has been blighted by the endemic twin evil of crime and violence of <b>major,</b> tragic and <b>alarming</b> proportions. The widespread frustration and deep sense of insecurity to life and property, occasioned by this epidemic, has become a matter of grave concern to government, security agencies and the Nigerian citizenry at large (Nwosu, 2003). The situation has become most critical, consequent upon the apparent helplessness of the law-enforcement agencies to stem the tide of the epidemic (Otudor, 2005, Adebayo, 2006, Adeyemi, 2006, Adeyemi, 2007, Iziguzo, 2007) The state of insecurity in Nigeria today is such that it is not an overstatement to conclude that the Nigerian nation is under siege. And while the urban centres are more prone to crimes, neither the urban, the sub-urban nor the rural is immune to civil, ethnic, political and religious violence which, in the last decade or so, have plagued Nigeria and currently threaten to tear communities and ethnic groups apart. The current spate of crime and violence in Nigeria dates back {{to the end of the}} Nigerian civil war in 1970 when arms began to filter through into unauthorised hands. The situation was exacerbated by prolonged military interregnum, its brute force and the violence that characterised it. The sacredness with which human life used to be held until the early 1970 s, was soon thrown to the winds by miscreants and other criminals. The situation was further compounded by Nigerian media’s romance with foreign films which were generously laced with crime, violence and sex. The Nigerian home video, currently in vogue, is not better in that it thrives on similar themes – crimes, violence and sex. Apart from the widespread availability of untracked arms, as well as crime and violence in the media, other possible causes of crime and violence include non-compulsory Universal Basic Education (UBE is made compulsory only on paper because of lack of political will and commitment to free education), widespread poverty (with Nigeria ranking 13 th last poorest of the poor nations on earth), lack of social security for the aged and the unemployed, child abuse, incidents of violence in neighbourhoods and communities, (Azuatalam, O’neil &amp; Okafor, 2007, Adeyemi, 2007, Azuatalam, 2007) disintegration of the nuclear and kinship family networks, gender insensitivity, availability of drugs and unprecedented widespread availability of alcohol which either comes raw as locally-brewed gin, popularly referred to in the local language as “ogogoro”, or disguised in herbs, and fondly called “sungbalaja”, or “opa eyin”, literally translated as “lie flat, face-up” and “for the spinal cord” respectively, offered cure for all ailments under the sun!
