5|$|Benjamin {{became a}} {{specialist}} in commercial law, of which {{there was a great}} deal in New Orleans' busy river port—a center of international commerce and the domestic slave trade. By 1840, the city had become the fourth largest in the United States and among the wealthiest. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> lawyers in the country practiced commercial law there, and Benjamin successfully competed with them. In one case, he successfully represented the seller of a slave against allegations that the seller knew the slave had incurable tuberculosis. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.|$|E
5|$|Enormous crowds {{could be}} {{accommodated}} at Spring Gardens, Vauxhall. In 1749 a rehearsal of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks attracted {{an audience of}} 12,000, and in 1786 a fancy-dress jubilee to celebrate the proprietor's long ownership was thronged with 61,000 revellers. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> known musicians and singers of the day performed at the Gardens, for example Sophia Baddeley. In 1732, their fashionable status was confirmed by a fancy dress ball attended by Frederick, Prince of Wales. At that time access from the West End was by water, but the opening of Westminster Bridge in the 1740s made access easier though less charming.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{vulnerability}} to blockade was studied. Using information {{supplied by the}} Board of Trade and the naval attaché in Tokyo, the planners estimated that the British Empire accounted for around 27 per cent of Japan's imports. In most cases these imports could be replaced from sources in China and the United States. However, certain critical materials for which Japan relied heavily on imports were identified, including metals, machinery, chemicals, oil and rubber, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> sources of these were under British control. Japan's access to neutral shipping could be restricted by refusing insurance to ships trading with Japan, and chartering ships {{to reduce the number}} available.|$|E

5|$|Having {{crossed the}} Niemen river with his Corps, Nansouty would {{continuously}} march {{under the command}} of Joachim Murat during this campaign, preceding the advance of the army and taking Wilna as they advanced. Despite marching constantly alongside Murat and Emperor Napoleon, Nansouty's Ist Corps of cavalry reserve saw little action, combating brilliantly in a vanguard action at Ostrovno and then briefly at Vitebsk. An incident involving some of Nansouty's light cavalry occurred during the combat at Vitebsk, when the 8th Hussars and 16th Chasseurs à cheval turned and fled before the Russian light horse. This was evidence that the division of Bruyères, of which they were a part, had been much used by always being placed at the vanguard of the army, resulting in the loss <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> and bravest troopers. Despite Nansouty's best efforts, the extremely long and exhausting marches, the torrential rains and the absence of proper fodder took their toll on the Ist Cavalry Corps, with numbers reduced to half by this time. Additionally, just like the other Cavalry Corps commanders, Nansouty rarely had all his troops under direct control, which led to cavalry being used improperly at times.|$|E
5|$|There is a race {{prejudice}} {{that exists}} between the white and Negro races wherever the Negroes are found in large numbers.... Just this week the announcement comes {{as a shock to}} the people of Oklahoma that the Secretary of the Interior... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them... If your organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time...|$|E
