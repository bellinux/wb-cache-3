The base case trajectory shows that carbon-dioxide emission from India will reach 6. 6 Billion tCO 2 in 2050, around five times of 2005 number. In India, 90 % of the energy demand for the transportation sector is for oil.

The International Energy Outlook has projected that by 2030, India will require at least five <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> of oil <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> The three major benefits of bio-fuels are- reduced greenhouse gas emissions, push to the rural economy, and reduction in energy dependence.
