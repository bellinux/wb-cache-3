A thin stream of liquid is then dripped onto the wheel and cooled, causing rapid solidification. This technique is used to develop materials that require extremely high cooling rates in order to form, such as metallic glasses.

5000|$|Synthetic fibers {{are made}} from {{synthesized}} polymers of small molecules. The compounds {{that are used to}} make these fibers come from raw materials such as petroleum based chemicals or petrochemicals. These materials are polymerized into a long, linear chemical that bond two adjacent carbon atoms. Differing chemical compounds will be used to produce different types of synthetic fibers. Synthetic fibers account for about half of all fiber usage, with applications in every field of fiber and textile technology. Although many classes of fiber based on synthetic polymers have been evaluated as potentially valuable commercial products, four of them - nylon, polyester, acrylic and polyolefin - dominate the market. These four account for approximately 98 percent by volume of synthetic fiber production, with polyester alone accounting for around 60 per cent. There are several methods of manufacturing synthetic fibers but the most common is the <b>Melt-Spinning</b> Process. It involves heating the fiber until it begins to melt, then you must draw out the melt with tweezers as quickly as possible. The next step would be to draw the molecules by aligning them in a parallel arrangement. This brings the fibers closer together and allows them to crystallize and orient. Lastly, is Heat-Setting. This utilizes heat to permeate the shape/dimensions of the fabrics made from heat-sensitive fibers.|$|E

40|$|Besides welding, high {{temperature}} vacuum repair-brazing is already established for nickel-based alloy turbine blades in the aerospace and power plant industries. After the worn turbine blade has been decoated to its substrate material, the filler metal is deposited as a paste, (<b>melt-spin)</b> foil or tape which also {{consists of a}} nickel-based alloy.

Carbon fiber composites provide an attractive route to this goal. Significant automotive use of carbon fiber technology will require substantial increases in fiber production coupled with decreases in fiber price to ~$ 7 /kg. Based on low-cost, high-volume, carbon yield, and melt-spinnability, Kraft lignin blends were selected as an alternative carbon fiber feedstock.

MRE{sub 2 }Fe{sub 14 }B exhibits reduced temperature dependent magnetic properties; remanence and coercivity. The desired form of MRE{sub 2 }Fe{sub 14 }B is a powder that can be blended with a polymer binder and compression or injection molded to form an isotropic polymer bonded permanent magnet (PBM). Commercially, Nd{sub 2 }Fe{sub 14 }B is the alloy of choice for PBMs. Powders of Nd{sub 2 }Fe{sub 14 }B are made via <b>melt-spinning</b> as can be MRE{sub 2 }Fe{sub 14 }B which allows for direct comparisons. MRE{sub 2 }Fe{sub 14 }B made using <b>melt-spinning</b> at high wheel speeds is overquenched and must be annealed to an optimal hard magnetic state. Due to the rare earth content in the MRE{sub 2 }Fe{sub 14 }B powders, they must be protected from {{the environment in which}} they operate.
