40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} {{that uses the}} autocorrelation of the spectrum of a star to measure the line broadening caused by the modulus of its average surface magnetic field. The advantage of the autocorrelation {{comes from the fact}} that it can detect very small spectral line broadening effects because it averages over many spectral lines and therefore gives an average with a very high signal to noise ratio. We validate the technique with the spectra of known <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> and obtain autocorrelation curves that are in full agreement with published magnetic curves obtained with Zeeman splitting. The autocorrelation also gives less noisy curves so that it can be used to obtain very accurate curves. We degrade the resolution of spectra of these <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> to lower spectral resolutions where the Zeeman splitting is undetectable. At these resolutions, the autocorrelation still gives good quality curves, thereby showing that it can be used to measure magnetic fields in spectra where the Zeeman splitting is significantly smaller than the width of the spectral line. This would therefore allow observing magnetic fields in very faint Ap stars with low-resolution spectrographs, thereby greatly increasing the number of known <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars.</b> It also demonstrates that the autocorrelation can measure magnetic fields in rapidly rotating stars as well as weak magnetic fields that give a Zeeman splitting smaller than the intrinsic width of the spectral lines. Finally, it shows that the autocorrelation can be used to find unknown <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> in low resolution spectroscopic surveys.

40|$|Approximately 10 {{per cent}} of massive OBA main-sequence (MS) and pre-MS stars harbour strong, {{large-scale}} magnetic fields. At the same time, {{there is a}} dearth of <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> in close binaries. A process generating strong magnetic fields only in some stars must be responsible with the merging of pre-MS and MS stars being suggested as one such channel. Stars emerging from the coalescence of two MS stars are rejuvenated, appearing younger than they are. They can therefore be identified by comparison with reference clocks. Here, we predict the rejuvenation of MS merger products {{over a wide range}} of masses and binary configurations calibrated to smoothed-particle-hydrodynamical merger models. We find that the rejuvenation is of the order of the nuclear time-scale and is strongest in the lowest mass mergers and the most evolved binary progenitors with the largest mass ratios. These predictions allow us to put constraints on the binary progenitors of merger products. We show that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> HR 2949 and τ Sco are younger than the potential binary companion HR 2948 and the Upper-Sco association, respectively, making them promising merger candidates. We find that the age discrepancies and the potential binary progenitors of both are consistent with them being rejuvenated merger products, implying that their magnetic fields may originate from this channel. Searching for age discrepancies in <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> is therefore a powerful way to explore which fraction of <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> may have obtained their strong magnetic field in MS mergers and to improve our understanding of magnetism in massive stars and their remnants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Stellar {{magnetic}} fields are usually studied by spectropolarimetric {{analysis of the}} Zeeman effect across spectral lines. Such studies are often limited by the net detectable polarization after averaging the small scale magnetic structures over the photospheric disk of the star. In this paper we examine the possibility to use optical long baseline interferometry to overcome this limitation for a partially or fully resolved star which, {{in the case of}} the brightest Ap and Bp stars, demands milliarcsecond resolutions achievable at 50 m baselines at least in the visible. We develop a simple geometrical model of <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> from which we derive the intensity maps and their corresponding interferometric observables across Zeeman-split lines. The accuracy of the interferometric signal phase must be better than 0. 5 ◦ (hence a relative accuracy of 0. 1 %), which limits the technique to brightest <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> (mV ≤ 2) for operating interferometers. Nevertheless, this limiting magnitude can reach mK ≤ 8 - 10 for 8 -m class planned interferometers.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} massive main-sequence stars show strong, large-scale magnetic fields. The origin of these fields, their lifetimes, {{and their role}} in shaping the characteristics and evolution of massive stars are currently not well understood. We compile a catalogue of 389 massive main-sequence stars, 61 of which are magnetic, and derive their fundamental parameters and ages. The two samples contain stars brighter than magnitude 9 in the V band and range in mass between 5 and 100 Msun. We find that the fractional main-sequence age distribution of all considered stars follows what is expected for a magnitude limited sample, while that of <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> shows a clear decrease {{towards the end of the}} main sequence. This dearth of old <b>magnetic</b> <b>stars</b> is independent of the choice of adopted stellar evolution tracks, and appears to become more prominent when considering only the most massive stars. We show that the decreasing trend in the distribution is significantly stronger than expected from magnetic flux conservation. We also find that binary rejuvenation and magnetic suppression of core convection are unlikely to be responsible for the observed lack of older <b>magnetic</b> massive <b>stars,</b> and conclude that its most probable cause is the decay of the magnetic field, over a time span longer than the stellar lifetime for the lowest considered masses, and shorter for the highest masses. We then investigate the spin-down ages of the slowly rotating <b>magnetic</b> massive <b>stars</b> and find them to exceed the stellar ages by far in many cases.

Observations of <b>magnetic</b> {{fields of}} <b>stars</b> at the pre-main {{sequence}} phase can provide important {{new insights into}} the complex physics of the late stages of star formation.

To date, 9 <b>magnetic</b> HAeBe <b>stars</b> have been detected, and those detections confirmed by repeated observations. The morphology and variability of their Stokes V signatures indicates that their magnetic fields have important dipole components of ∼kG strength, and that the dipole is stable on timescales ofat least years.
