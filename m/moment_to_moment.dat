In some cases, the musical score is used to take away focus from the scenes that did not {{work as well as}} planned. If the episode on the other side is well-scripted and features strong performances from the voice cast, then the music becomes a distraction. Ledesma thought that the [...] "episode offers a nice balance of dialogue and music." [...] Of the music that was used, the theme from the 1965 film <b>Moment</b> <b>to</b> <b>Moment,</b> which was scored by Henry Mancini, was featured during the montage of Homer working at his new job. The episode ends with a piece of music, which is the music composer Alf Clausen's version of the Mancini theme. In total five minutes of music was used for the episode.|$|E

500|$|To put {{it another}} way, a thing or person is often seen as having a [...] "defining essence" [...] or a [...] "core identity" [...] that is unchanging, and {{describes}} what the thing or person really is. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. [...] "Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, {{but he is still}} the same person"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete [...] "occasions of experience" [...] that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as [...] "the essence of a thing" [...] or [...] "the identity/core of a person" [...] is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time. [...] Identities do not define people, people define identities. [...] Everything changes from <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> <b>moment,</b> and to think of anything as having an [...] "enduring essence" [...] misses the fact that [...] "all things flow", though it is often a useful way of speaking.|$|E

500|$|William James {{is usually}} {{credited}} with popularizing {{the idea that}} human consciousness flows like a stream, in his Principles of Psychology of 1890. [...] According to James, the [...] "stream of thought" [...] is governed by five characteristics: [...] "(1) Every thought tends {{to be part of}} a personal consciousness. (2) Within each personal consciousness thought is always changing. (3) Within each personal consciousness thought is sensibly continuous. (4) It always appears to deal with objects independent of itself. (5) It is interested in some parts of these objects to the exclusion of others". [...] A similar concept appears in Buddhist philosophy, expressed by the Sanskrit term Citta-saṃtāna, which is usually translated as mindstream or [...] "mental continuum". Buddhist teachings describe that consciousness manifests <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> <b>moment</b> as sense impressions and mental phenomena that are continuously changing. The teachings list six triggers that can result in the generation of different mental events. These triggers are input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations), or a thought (relating to the past, present or the future) that happen to arise in the mind. The mental events generated as a result of these triggers are: feelings, perceptions and intentions/behaviour. [...] The moment-by-moment manifestation of the mind-stream is said to happen in every person all the time. It even happens in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, or analyses the material body including the organ brain. The manifestation of the mindstream is also described as being influenced by physical laws, biological laws, psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws. The purpose of the Buddhist practice of mindfulness is to understand the inherent nature of the consciousness and its characteristics.|$|E

40|$|We derive {{expressions}} for the zeroth and {{the first}} three spectral moment sum rules for the retarded Green's function and for the zeroth {{and the first}} spectral moment sum rules for the retarded self-energy of the inhomogeneous Bose-Hubbard model in nonequilibrium, when the local on-site repulsion and the chemical potential are time-dependent, and {{in the presence of}} an external time-dependent electromagnetic field. We also evaluate these moments for equilibrium, where all time dependence and external fields vanish. Unlike similar sum rules for the Fermi-Hubbard model, in the Bose-Hubbard model case, the sum rules often depend on expectation values that cannot be determined simply from parameters in the Hamiltonian like the interaction strength and chemical potential, but require knowledge of equal time many-body expectation values from some other source. We show how one can approximately evaluate these expectation values for the Mott-insulating phase in a systematic strong-coupling expansion in powers of the hopping divided by the interaction. We compare the exact <b>moments</b> <b>to</b> <b>moments</b> of spectral functions calculated from a variety of different approximations and use them to benchmark their accuracy.
