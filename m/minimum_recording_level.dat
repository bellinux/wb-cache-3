40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{documents}} noise pollution levels measured {{for the most}} common cars used by people in Saudi Arabia. The noise levels were measured following standard procedure by using calibrated sound pressure level meter at {{all sides of the}} car front, rear, right and left sides. This investigation has been conducted to measure the noise pollution level from Toyota car Model 2002 because it used for most Saudi people. Measurements of the noise level from this car at stationary and motion situation have been carried out. The noise levels produced by variable engine speed ranged from 750 to 4000 rpm were <b>recorded.</b> The sound <b>level</b> found to be 59. 45 dBA when the vehicle in motion at normal speed. When the vehicle at idle speed 750 rpm the maximum noise level measured at the back exhaust 50. 4 dBA where the <b>minimum</b> <b>level</b> <b>recorded</b> at the right side 40. 8 dBA. When the car parked or at stationary state and the engine at 2500 rpm the maximum noise level at the back exhaust is 53 dB A whereas the minimum level showed from the left side. For maximum engine speed 4000 rpm the back exhaust area has a maximum noise level 58. 2 dBA where as the right side at 51. 2 dBA. The maximum sound <b>level</b> <b>recorded</b> near the engine at speed of 4000 rpm was 57 dBA but the <b>minimum</b> <b>level</b> <b>recorded</b> at 1000 rpm. From the recorded results it can be seen these measured noise level are under the acceptable ranges due to the progress and development of vehicles emission reduction and the environment protection issues. Based on the study findings it can be inferred that there is an urgent need to set up noise standards in the country to control the noise pollution level from vehicles as well as to keep clean environment...|$|R
30|$|The third {{predictive}} simulation {{consisted of}} reducing groundwater levels throughout the model by 32  cm to simulate groundwater flow during low water table conditions. This {{was accomplished by}} reducing all of the model’s constant-head boundary values. Groundwater levels were reduced by 32  cm because this was the average fluctuation between the maximum and <b>minimum</b> water <b>levels</b> <b>recorded</b> in the monitor wells from mid-July 2006 to 31 August 2006, which {{is the time of}} year when summer-run chum salmon spawning typically occurs (Heinl et al. 2004). Like the second predictive simulation, upper Marx Creek stream cells 1 – 14 were removed from the model prior to running the third predictive simulation.|$|R
40|$|Devasthal, {{located in}} the Kumaun region of Himalayas is {{emerging}} {{as one of the}} best optical astronomy site in the continent. The <b>minimum</b> <b>recorded</b> ground <b>level</b> atmospheric seeing at the site is 0. 6 arcsec with median value at 1. 1 arcsec. Currently, a 1. 3 -m fast (f/ 4) wide field-of-view (66 arcmin) optical telescope is operating at the site. In near future, a 4 -m liquid mirror telescope in collaboration with Belgium and Canada, and a 3. 6 -m optical telescope in collaboration with Belgium are expected to be installed in 2013. The telescopes will be operated by Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences. The first instruments on the 3. 6 -m telescope will be in-house designed and assembled faint object spectrograph and camera. The second generation instruments will be including a large field-of-view optical imager, high resolution optical spectrograph, integral field unit and an optical near-infrared spectrograph. The 1. 3 -m telescope is primarily used for wide field photometry imaging while the liquid mirror telescope will see a time bound operation to image half a degree wide strip in the galactic plane. There will be an aluminizing plant at the site to coat mirrors of sizes up to 3. 7 m. The Devasthal Observatory and its geographical importance in between major astronomical observatories makes it important for time critical observations requiring continuous monitoring of variable and transient objects from ground based observatories. The site characteristics, its expansions plans and first results from the existing telescope are presented. Comment: Invited paper, 12 pages, SPIE Conference, July 201...|$|R
40|$|Because of its {{position}} on the northern margin of the tropics (22 ° 17 [prime prime or minute]N) and the southern coast of a huge continent, Hong Kong has {{a climate in which}} both temperature and rainfall are highly seasonal. Although summer temperatures are equatorial, the January mean is only 15. 8 °C,and the absolute <b>minimum</b> <b>recorded</b> at sea <b>level</b> is 0 °C (Dudgeon & Corlett 1994). As a result, all aspects of the ecology of Hong Kong show seasonal changes. The most dramatic changes occur in the bird fauna, with the majority of species migratory (Carey et al. 2001). The winter fruiting peak in secondary shrublands and the forest understorey coincides with the arrival of partially frugivorous migrant robins and thrushes (Corlett 1993). However, while resident insectivore-frugivores consume almost entirely fruit during this period (Corlett 1998), all the winter visitors continue to eat insects and some (e. g. Phylloscopus warblers) are entirely insectivorous. The study of insect seasonality reported here formed part of a 30 -mo study of the seasonality of a forest bird community in Hong Kong (Kwok & Corlett 1999, 2000). Plant names follow Corlett et al. (2000). published_or_final_versio...|$|R
