When an intercept is included, then r2 is simply {{the square of the}} sample correlation coefficient (i.e., r) between the observed outcomes and the observed predictor values. If additional regressors are included, R2 is the square of the coefficient of <b>multiple</b> <b>correlation.</b> In both such cases, the coefficient of determination ranges from 0 to 1.|$|E
25|$|The {{lengths of}} the neumes were given values by adding up the {{duration}} {{values for the}} separate neume elements, each time following a particular hypothesis concerning the rhythm of Gregoriant chant. Both the syllable lengths and the neume lengths were also expressed {{in relation to the}} total duration of the syllables, resp. neumes for a word (contextual variables). Correlating the various word and neume variables, substantial correlations were found for the word variables 'accented syllable' and 'contextual syllable duration'. Moreover, it could be established that the <b>multiple</b> <b>correlation</b> (R) between the two types of variables reaches its maximum (R is about 0.80) if the neumatic elements are evaluated according to the following rules of duration: (a) neume elements that represent short notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 1 time; (b) neume elements that represent long notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 2 times; (c) neumes consisting of only one note are characterized by flexible duration values (with an average value of 2 times), which take over the duration values of the syllables to match.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to keep in mind that low squared <b>multiple</b> <b>correlations</b> do not necessarily indicate a poor model, rather, an incomplete one. When considering any latent variable, it is possible that the selected indicators are necessary but not sufficient to fully explain the variance of that construct. In the case of Achievement for instance, it is reasonable to assume that any or all of the following—prior knowledge, past experience, instructor actions, demographic factors—would influence course grades and that student participatory behaviors alone would only represent a partial explanation. Identifying and measuring the missing indicators is a topic for future research and beyond the scope of the present study. Another possible explanation for low squared <b>multiple</b> <b>correlations</b> is not a lack of factors like in the previous example, but rather a lack of high-quality items per factor (or simply a lack of items); the use of extant data in this study certainly lends credibility for this explanation.|$|R

No single predictor consistently predicted any rate measure. <b>Multiple</b> <b>correlations</b> showed that lack of rate measure comprehensiveness did not cause poor rate predictability. <b>Multiple</b> <b>correlations</b> and regression analysis showed the relative importance of various predictors as a function of specific units studied.
