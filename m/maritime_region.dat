There is widespread fear that the Chinese are coming into Nanyang through the Indian Ocean giving them access to the Straits of Malacca – a major waterway for sea-borne trade and a very politically sensitive <b>maritime</b> <b>region</b> – which would allow Beijing a better basis for power projection, spreading its political views and expanding the communist ideas through the Nanyang.|$|E
25|$|In 1299, {{according}} to the Malay Annals, the Kingdom of Singapura was founded on the island by Sang Nila Utama. Although the historicity of the accounts as given in the Malay Annals {{is the subject of}} academic debates, it is nevertheless known from various documents that Singapore in the 14th century, then known as Temasek, was a trading port under the influence of both the Majapahit Empire and the Siamese kingdoms inside Indosphere of Greater India. These Indianized Kingdoms, a term coined by George Cœdès were characterized by surprising resilience, political integrity and administrative stability. Historical sources also indicate that around the end of the 14th century, its ruler Parameswara was attacked by either the Majapahit or the Siamese, forcing him to move on to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca. Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on Fort Canning was abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards. In 1613, Portuguese raiders burned down the settlement, and the island faded into obscurity for the next two centuries. By then Singapore was nominally part of the Johor Sultanate. The wider <b>maritime</b> <b>region</b> and much trade was under Dutch control for the following period.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} why Somerled launched his attack upon the Scots. The early 1160s saw {{a period of}} Scottish consolidation in the <b>maritime</b> <b>region</b> between the Lennox and Cowal, and along the eastern coast of the Firth of Clyde towards Galloway. David may well have begun the infeftment and settlement of this coastal district decades earlier, to counter the seaborne threat that the rulers of Argyll posed during the dynastic challenges of the 1130s. By the 1160s, {{some of the greatest}} Scottish magnates had taken root in the region, and some of them may have begun to extend their influence into southern Argyll and the Islands of the Clyde. The catalyst for Somerled's invasion, therefore, may have been the encroachment of Scottish influence into his own sphere of hegemony. The target of his invasion appears to have been Renfrew, the centre of the family of Walter FitzAlan, Steward of Scotland, and Somerled's forces may well have engaged those of Walterpossibly even led by the steward himself. The precise chronology of Walter's westward expansion is not known for certain, but he and Somerled likely had conflicting ambitions in the region. Although Somerled may have sought to eliminate or reduce this perceived threat, the massive scale of his seaborne assault suggests that he may have nursed even greater ambitions. With an increasingly ill and possibly incapacitated king upon the Scottish throne, the real motivation behind Somerled's last operation may well have been sheer opportunism.|$|E

2500|$|During the French and Indian War (the North American {{theater of}} the Seven Years' War), British colonial {{officers}} suspected Acadians were aligned with France after finding some Acadians fighting alongside French troops at Fort Beausejour. Though most Acadians remained neutral during the French and Indian War, the British, together with New England legislators and militia, carried out the Great Expulsion (Le Grand Dérangement) of the Acadians during the 1755–1764 period. They deported approximately 11,500 Acadians from the <b>maritime</b> <b>region.</b> Approximately one-third perished from disease and drowning.

2500|$|In Italy, {{broad beans}} are {{traditionally}} sown on November 2, All Souls Day. Small cakes {{made in the}} shape of broad beans (though not out of them) are known as fave dei morti or [...] "beans of the dead". According to tradition, Sicily once experienced a failure of all crops other than the beans; the beans kept the population from starvation, and thanks were given to Saint Joseph. Broad beans subsequently became traditional on Saint Joseph's Day altars in many Italian communities. Some people carry a broad bean for good luck; some believe that if one carries a broad bean, one will never be without the essentials of life. In Rome, on the first of May, Roman families traditionally eat fresh fava beans with Pecorino Romano cheese during a daily excursion in the Campagna. In northern Italy, on the contrary, fava beans are traditionally fed to animals and some people, especially the elderly, might frown on human consumption. But in Liguria, a <b>maritime</b> <b>region</b> near northern Italy, fava beans are loved raw, and consumed fresh in early spring as the first product of the garden, alone or with fresh Pecorino Sardo or with local salami from Sant'Olcese. In some Central Italian regions, a once-popular and recently rediscovered fancy food is the bagiana, a soup of fresh or dried fava beans seasoned with onions and beet leaves stir-fried, before being added to the soup, in olive oil and lard (or bacon or cured ham fat).|$|E

We are, doubtless, far better acquainted with the outlines of the African coast, and the immediately <b>maritime</b> <b>region,</b> than the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Romans, and the Arabs. But it is still doubtful whether their information respecting the interior did not surpass ours. Eratosthenes, librarian of Alexandria (B.

Suffice it to say that the site is mentioned in the Wanderings (Deut. ii. 8), which must not be confounded with the Exodus. It is subsequently connected with the gold-fleet (I Kings ix. 26, etc.); and, conquered by Rezin, king of Syria (B.C. 740), it was permanently lost to the Jews (2 Kings xvi. 6). Under the Romans, this great station upon the [...] "Overland" [...] between the southernmost Nabathæan port, Leukè Kóme, and Petra, the western capital, was a Præsidium held by the Tenth Legion; and a highway connected it with Gaza (Ghazzah), measuring one hundred and twenty direct miles, when the Isthmus of Suez numbers only ninety-five. In Christian times it had a prince and a bishop; and, under Mohammed and the early Moslems, it preserved an importance which lasted till the days of the Crusaders.

60|$|I {{believe my}} husband hurried it a little, {{though he did}} not shorten it, and we got back to the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Region</b> almost a week sooner than we had first intended. I found my dear mother well, and still serenely happy in her Altrurian surroundings. She had begun to learn the language, and she had a larger {{acquaintance}} in the capital, I believe, than any other one person. She said everybody had called on her, and they were the kindest people she had ever dreamed of. She had exchanged cooking-lessons with one lady who, they told her, was a distinguished scientist, and she had taught another, who was a great painter, a peculiar embroidery stitch which she had learned from my grandmother, and which everybody admired. These two ladies had given her most of her grammatical instruction in Altrurian, but there was a bright little girl who had enlarged her vocabulary more than either, in helping her about her housework, the mother having lent her for the purpose. My mother said she was not ashamed to make blunders before a child, and the little witch had taken the greatest delight in telling her the names of things {{in the house and the}} streets and the fields outside the town, where they went long walks together.|$|E
60|$|You may be {{sure that}} I got out of my things as soon as I could borrow an Altrurian costume, and now my Paris {{confections}} are already hung up for monuments, as Richard III. says, in the Capitalistic Museum, where people from the outlying Regions may come and study them as object-lessons in what not to wear. (You remember what you said Aristides told you, when he spoke that day at the mountains, about the Regions that Altruria is divided into? This is the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Region,</b> and the city where we are living for the present is the capital.) You may think this was rather hard on me, and at first it did seem pretty intimate, having my things in a long glass case, and {{it gave me a}} shock to see them, {{as if it had been}} my ghost, whenever I passed them. But the fact is I was more ashamed than hurt--they were so ugly and stupid and useless. I could have borne my Paris dress and my picture-hat if it had not been for those ridiculous high-heeled, pointed-toe shoes, which the Curatress had stood at the bottom of the skirts. They looked the most frantic things you can imagine, and the mere sight of them made my poor feet ache in the beautiful sandals I am wearing now; when once you have put on sandals you say good-bye and good-riddance to shoes. In a single month my feet have grown almost a tenth as large again as they were, and my friends here encourage me to believe that they will yet measure nearly the classic size, though, as you know, I am not in my first youth and can't expect them to do miracles.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is still}} {{interesting}} {{to consider the}} circumstances which gave rise to Captain Tuckey's disastrous expedition. As any map of Africa during the early quarter of the present century, Bowdich or Dupuis for instance, may prove, {{the course of the}} Niger was laid down, now according to the ancients, then after Arab information. The Dark Continent, of which D'Anville justly said that writers abused, [...] "pour ainsi dire, de la vaste carrière que l'intérieur y laissait prendre" [...] ("Mém. de l'Acad. des Inscriptions," [...] xxvi. 61), had not been subjected to scientific analysis; this was reserved for the Presidential Address to the Royal Geographical Society by the late Sir R. I. Murchison, 1852. Geographers did not see how to pass the Niger through the" [...] Kong Mountains, which, uniting with the Jebel Komri, are supposed to run in one unbroken chain across the continent;" [...] and these Lunar Mountains of the Moslems, which were [...] "stretched like a chaplet of beads from east to west," [...] undoubtedly express, as M. du Chaillu contends, a real feature, the double versant, probably a mere wave of ground between the great hydrographic basins of the Niger and the Congo, of North Africa and of Central Africa. Men still wasted their vigour upon the Nigritis Palus, the Chelonídes waters, the Mount Caphas, and the lakes of Wangara, variously written Vancara and Vongara, not to mention other ways. Maps place [...] "Wangara"to the north-west of Dahome, where the natives utterly ignore the name. Dupuis ("Ashantee," [...] 1824) suggests that, like [...] "Takrúr," [...] it is an obsolete Moslem term for the 660 miles of <b>maritime</b> <b>region</b> between Cape Lahu and the Rio Formoso or the Old Calabar River. This would include the three despotisms, Ashanti, Dahome, and Benin, with the tribes who, from a distance of twenty-five days, bring gold to Tinbuktu (the Tungubutu of De Barros, i. 220). Thus the lakes of Wangara would be the lagoons of the Slave-coast, in which the Niger may truly be said to lose itself.|$|E
