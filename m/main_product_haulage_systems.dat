40|$|The {{objective}} of flexible allocation of trucks {{is to increase}} the productivity of <b>haulage</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, a comprehensive model is produced for the <b>haulage</b> <b>system</b> in open pit mines, which can optimize the allocation process of trucks by goal programming. This model provides a comprehensive solution for solving haulage problems in open pit mines. The objective function of the model is maximization of productivity and control of the quality of ore sent to crushers. It is also possible for the mine design engineer to add other objectives to the model. One of the advantages of the model is its applicability in mines whose processing plants have more than one production line and each one accepts feed with different quality. The model can also be used in especial circumstances where the <b>haulage</b> <b>system</b> of the mine is composed of trucks with different capacities. The case study of this paper is Sarcheshmeh copper mine of Iran. The results obtained from the model, modifies the allocation system in a way that productivity of the mine would increase by 10 - 15 %...|$|R

Simulation modeling and analysis, long the specialized province of mathematicians and computer science specialists, has entered the mainstream of methods available to help organizations (whether business, governmental, educational, or mining) increase their efficiency and effectiveness. The proved abilities of simulation to attack a wide range of problems and investigations rest on its abilities to accommodate stochastic variation, analyze discrete or continuous variables, or both, and provide visualization via animation.

40|$|This work {{analysed}} shovel-truck <b>haulage</b> <b>system</b> in surface mine using {{computer simulation}} method. Queueing models {{were used to}} approximate the real queueing situation, and the queueing behaviour analysed mathematically. Performance measures (average number in the queue, average {{time spent in the}} queue, probability that the queue is full or empty and probability of finding the system in a particular state) were determined. The queueing models developed were used to test the operation in a typical granite quarry for variation in the factors that affect production output. A spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) was programmed to take in time measurements from the field and the data analysed. The various components (mean arrival rate, mean service rate and waiting times) that make up the total cycle time were established. It was discovered that the simulated values for the total cycle time were only slightly different from the actual values observed on the field. This confirmed the validity of the models. A program (LoadHaulPro 1. 0) was also developed for use in calculations related to shovel-truck <b>haulage</b> <b>systems</b> in surface mines...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimisation}} of {{loading and}} haulage {{is one of}} the most important issues for the yield of quarrying activities. Many external factors may affect loading and <b>haulage</b> <b>system</b> selection: amongst them a very important role is played by local topography, stability conditions, size of the excavated material and capacity of the crusher. Of course, loading and haulage equipments affect one another and should be matched in order to get an efficient system, considering both production and economical aspects; selection criteria should be mainly based on: optimisation of loading system (sometimes working as excavation equipment too); optimisation of <b>haulage</b> <b>system</b> (in terms of both single equipment and fleet); optimisation of maintenance programs and organisation (in terms of availability of the system). In particular, the paper deals with the hydraulic excavator - dumper (or truck) system, focusing on the relations between the technical characteristics of the equipments. Many loading and haulage operations have been analysed in different Italian open cast mines and quarries, in order to identify the best working relations and to derive a simple procedure for a proper selection...|$|R

Monitoring of the strength reduction of these ropes must be possible throughout the whole rope life.
