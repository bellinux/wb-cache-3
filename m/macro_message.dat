5000|$|A {{developer}} specifies {{one or more}} tracing macros that WPP should handle, via a configuration file, special annotations in comments, {{command line}} parameters, {{or some combination of}} these methods. Each time WPP encounters one of the macros that it is supposed to handle, it generates a trace <b>message</b> <b>macro.</b> In other words, if for example [...] is a tracing macro, WPP will generate a separate macro for each occurrence of [...] The generated trace <b>message</b> <b>macros</b> are disambiguated by file name and line number, and, using various preprocessor tricks, WPP in turn defines the original tracing macro so that it will expand the appropriate trace <b>message</b> <b>macro</b> at each occurrence.|$|R

These strings are not included in the compiled code, but are included in the debugger symbol file in a format that tools included with WPP can understand. The trace <b>message</b> <b>macros</b> also include the logic for enabling or disabling tracing via flags and the calls to WMI event tracing APIs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} data on single {{pregnant women}} 2 ̆ 7 s encounters in public in an Irish context. Data were collected using in-depth interviews, which were analysed using a grounded theory strategy. The {{study was conducted}} in Dublin City and 51 unmarried women whose ages ranged from 16 - 36 participated. Findings suggested that while dominant public discourses on non-marital childbearing within the culture were negative (albeit challenged) at the time data were being collected, responses from others whom participants interacted with in verbal face-toface encounters in public were generally (though certainly not exclusively) experienced as positive in tone. An attempt is made to explain the discrepancy between the mainly negative <b>macro</b> <b>messages</b> and mainly positive micro messages by drawing on Erving Goffman 2 ̆ 7 s theory of dramaturgy; it would seem that at the micro-level of interaction, a 2 ̆ 7 performance 2 ̆ 7 was being acted out that may be at variance with definitions of non-marital pregnancy expressed by those beyond the encounter...|$|R

40|$|Everyday life {{is filled}} with social relation-al {{contexts}} in which individuals coordinate and shape their behavior in relation to oth-ers, whether in person, through the Internet, on paper, or with a cell phone. Throughout my career, I have been concerned {{with the power of}} these ubiquitous contexts not only to influence individuals, but also to link those individuals to the larger social structure in which they are embedded. I have been fasci-nated by the way these contexts bring the larger social structure home to the person’s own experience. Gender and racial inequali-ty, for instance, are dimensions of social strat-ification, but it is in relational contexts that these <b>macro</b> structural <b>messages</b> of inequality are delivered powerfully to individuals in ways that shape their future behavior. I also have become convinced that social relational contexts are a considerable force in understanding the persistence or change of larger structural patterns themselves (Ridgeway 1997; Ridgeway and Correll 2004). Logic suggests that these contexts must continually enact structural patterns such as gender or racial inequality if those patterns are to persist. In the main, this is exactly what happens. Yet the contingent nature of interaction in social relational con-texts is not entirely predictable. As a result, these contexts have a dynamic potential to introduce change into the larger structural patterns that they enact (Chase 1980, Fararo and Skvoretz 1986). How then can we explain how social rela-tional contexts mainly reproduce but also modify macro-level social patterns such as dimensions of stratification, social institu-tions, or widely held cultural beliefs? My goal here is to outline a theoretical perspective that represents my own best answer to this question. This perspective is not itself a theo-ry, but rather an orienting conceptual frame-work within which to place existing theories and develop new ones. My intention is to sug-gest productive avenues for future work on the relationship between social structure and individual action...|$|R

The first of these, the B 2 scenario, {{is a successful}} attempt to provide an internally consistent quantification [...] checked by the computer models Scenario Generator (SG), <b>MESSAGE,</b> <b>MACRO,</b> and MAGICC [...] of key variables describing a plausible but unremarkable "storyline" that complements the other storylines discussed in this special issue of Technological Forecasting and Social Change. In the B 2 scenario global carbon emissions from energy use and industrial sources rise from 6. 5 gigatons of carbon (GtC) in 1990 to 14. 2 GtC in 2100. Primary energy use climbs from 350 exajoules (EJ) to 1, 360 EJ. The global primary energy structure shifts away from gas and oil (28 % in 2100 compared to 55 % in 1990) and toward non-fossil energy sources (50 % in 2100 compared to 18 % in 1990). The share of coal is 22 % in 2100, only four percentage points lower than in 1990. Among regions there are significant variations in the primary energy structure. Synthetic liquid production grows to 330 EJ in 2100, driven largely by assumptions about the long-term decline of oil and a continuation in current trends towards increasingly flexible, convenient, and cleaner forms of final energy...|$|R
40|$|Designated as an {{exemplary}} master's project for 2015 - 16 * This paper examines how contemporary literature {{contributes to the}} discussion of punitory justice. It uses close analysis of three contemporary novels, Margaret Atwood’s The Heart Goes Last, Hillary Jordan’s When She Woke, and Joyce Carol Oates’s Carthage, to deconstruct different conceptions of punitory justice. This analysis is framed and supported by relevant social science research {{on the concept of}} punitivity within criminal justice. Each section examines punitory justice at three levels: <b>macro,</b> where media <b>messages</b> and the predominant social conversation reside; meso, which involves penal policy and judicial process; and micro, which encompasses personal attitudes towards criminal justice. The first two chapters evaluate works by Atwood and Jordan, examining how their dystopian schemas of justice shed light on top-down and bottom-up processes of punitory justice in the real world. The third chapter uses a more realistic novel, Oates’s Carthage, to examine the ontological nature of punitory justice. It explores a variety of factors that give rise to and legitimize punitory justice, both at the personal level and within a broader cultural consensus. This chapter also discusses how both victim and perpetrator can come to stand in as metaphors to both represent and distract from broader social issues. As a whole, analysis of these three novels illuminate how current and common conceptualizations of justice {{have little to do with}} the actual act of transgression itself. Instead, justice emerges as a set of specific, conditioned responses to perceived threats, mediated by complex social, cultural, and emotive forces...|$|R
