5|$|Its royal {{occupant}} <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> made York House {{the pinnacle}} of Brettingham's career. Built during the 1760s, {{it was one of}} his last grand houses. His last country-house commission was at Packington Hall, Warwickshire. In 1761, he published his plans of Holkham Hall, calling himself the architect, which led critics, including Horace Walpole, to decry him as a purloiner of Kent's designs. Brettingham died in 1769 at his house outside St. Augustine's Gate, Norwich, and was buried in the aisle of the parish church. Throughout his long career, Brettingham did much to popularise the Palladian movement. His clients included a Royal Duke and at least twenty-one assorted peers and peeresses. He is not a household name today largely because his provincial work was heavily influenced by Kent and Burlington, and unlike his contemporary Giacomo Leoni he did not develop, or was not given the opportunity to develop, a strong personal stamp to his work on country houses. Ultimately, he and many of his contemporary architects were eclipsed by the designs of Robert Adam. Adam remodelled Brettingham's York House in 1780 and, in addition to Kedleston Hall, went on to replace James Paine as architect at Nostell Priory, Alnwick Castle, and Syon House. In spite of this, Adam and Paine remained great friends; Brettingham's relationships with his fellow architects are unrecorded.|$|E
5|$|Natives {{incorporated}} the natural {{features of the}} ridgeline and surrounding geography into their spiritual belief systems. Many Native American stories were in turn incorporated into regional colonial folklore. The giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent figure in many stories, was credited with diverting {{the course of the}} Connecticut River where it suddenly swings east in Middletown, Connecticut, after several hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is also credited with slaying a giant human-eating beaver who lived in a great lake that existed in the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts. According to native beliefs as retold by European settlers, the corpse of the beaver remains visible as the Pocumtuck Ridge portion of the Metacomet Ridge. Later, after Hobbomuck diverted the course of the Connecticut River, he was punished to sleep forever as the prominent man-like form of the Sleeping Giant, part of the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut. There seems to be an element of scientific truth in some of these tales. For instance, the great lake that the giant beaver was said to have inhabited <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been the post-glacial Lake Hitchcock, extant 10,000 years ago; the giant beaver may have been an actual prehistoric species of bear–sized beaver, Castoroides ohioensis, that lived at that time. Many features of the Metacomet Ridge region still bear names with Native American origins: Besek, Pistapaug, Coginchaug, Mattabesett, Metacomet, Totoket, Norwottuck, Hockanum, Nonotuck, Pocumtuck, and others.|$|E

Dickinson suggested that based upon a reading of Ehrenfels's private letters, that his concerns about psychological [...] "splitting" [...] within men were based upon his own visits to prostitutes, where he saw johns abusing the prostitutes, and that he may himself had badly treated the prostitutes he had sex with (his letters are somewhat ambiguous on this point). The frequently which Ehrenfels brought up the example of how psychological [...] "splitting" [...] was causing men to abuse prostitutes <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>had</b> reflected a guilty conscience on his part about past abuse that he had inflicted on the prostitutes whose services he had used. In a 1908 essay entitled [...] "The Yellow Peril", Ehrenfels wrote that 13 years earlier in 1895, he [...] "arrived, on the basis of personal experience, which it would be superfluous to recount here, at the following two alternatives: 'Either I am an individual of totally corrupt sex instincts, or our monogamous sexual order is an institution with completely corrupting tendencies.'" ...|$|R

Bisset then appears to have died in February the next year (1316), the cause and exact date now unknown.|$|E
25|$|The Ultimate Universe {{version of}} Blob, real name Franklin Dukes, {{is a member}} of the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy. His powers are similar to that of his Earth-616 counterpart, {{although}} he has been moved by a helicopter during the Weapon X saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly, and is often seen browsing the internet or chatting to people via instant messaging. One such incident sees the Blob pretend to be a female model/physicist named Naomi who cyber-seduces the X-Man Beast—leading to the discovery of Magneto's survival and to the Ultimate War saga. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, the Blob <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> additional superhuman-eating powers as part of his mutation, as not only has he threatened to actually eat his enemies alive, but it was expressly stated that he had personally consumed all of the Weapon X computers in a matter of moments when the Brotherhood invaded the Weapon X compound to rescue the X-Men. In Ultimatum, the Blob is seen eating the Wasp, proving the cannibalistic claims are true. However, Hank Pym grows to a gigantic size and bites the Blob's head off in return.|$|E

The translator of the Liber Proverbiorum <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> also <b>have</b> been responsible for an English translation of Couldrette’s French romance Mélusine or Le Roman de Parthenay. Both translations are notable for their poetic diction and for the comments on verse-form in their prologues and epilogues. The article also considers other texts of the 1440 s and 1450 s which are the products of patronage of English writing by noblewomen. The prologue and epilogue of the Liber Proverbiorum are edited in an Appendix for ease of reference...|$|R
5000|$|English {{composer}} William Shield {{seems to}} quote the [...] "Auld Lang Syne" [...] melody briefly {{at the end of}} the overture to his opera Rosina, which may be its first recorded use. The contention that Burns borrowed the melody from Shield is for various reasons highly unlikely, although they <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> both <b>have</b> taken it from a common source, possibly a strathspey called The Miller's Wedding or The Miller's Daughter. The problem is that tunes based on the same set of dance steps necessarily have a similar rhythm, and even a superficial resemblance in melodic shape <b>may</b> cause a <b>very</b> strong apparent similarity in the tune as a whole. For instance, Burns' poem Coming Through the Rye is sung to a tune that might also be based on the Miller's Wedding. The origin of the tune of God Save the Queen presents a very similar problem and for just the same reason, as it is also based on a dance measure.

25|$|She {{was from}} the outset {{considered}} to have great promise, but it was nevertheless {{difficult for her to}} win the leading roles from more established actors such as Zelma Hedin, Charlotta Almlöf, and Fanny Westerdahl, the stars of the 1850s. She had a brief affair with the Crown Prince, the future Charles XV of Sweden, who advised her to marry Daniel Hwasser, the secretary of the royal theatres direction, which oversaw the royal theatre. She took the Crown Prince's advice and married Hwasser in 1858, after which he was made director of the theatre. The fact that Elise Hwasser was suddenly awarded leading roles did not go unnoticed in the press: during her husband's short period as director of the theatre, she played all the leading female parts. Although this <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been the result of nepotism, it is equally clear that she did have talent as an actress – a talent that she was now able to demonstrate. Proof of this is provided by the fact that, after her husband had been dismissed as a director and her royal lover had acquired a new mistress, she nevertheless continued to play the leading female parts. Whatever means she had employed, she had now proven herself and, for the next thirty years, she played the leading female role in well over one hundred and fifty performances.|$|E

[...] His election was assisted by the influence of his mother, who campaigned on behalf of her son while he was away at war, and <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been undertaken because service in Parliament {{was seen as a}} common way to improve one's prospects for advancement in the military. In 1764 he was promoted to colonel of the 46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot, and in 1768 he was appointed lieutenant governor of the Isle of Wight. As tensions rose between Britain and the colonies in the 1770s, Howe continued to rise through the ranks, and came to be widely {{regarded as one of the}} best officers in the army. He was promoted to major general in 1772, and in 1774 introduced new training drills for light infantry companies.|$|E
500|$|The {{bones of}} a total of 179 people were found during the {{excavations}} of the Mary Rose, including 92 [...] "fairly complete skeletons", more or less complete collections of bones associated with specific individuals. Analysis of these has shown that crew members were all male, most of them young adults. Some were no more than 11–13 years old, and the majority (81%) under 30. They were mainly of English origin and, according to archaeologist Julie Gardiner, they most likely came from the West Country; many following their aristocratic masters into maritime service. There were also a few people from continental Europe. An eyewitness testimony right after the sinking refers to a survivor who was a Fleming, and the pilot <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been French. Analysis of oxygen isotopes in teeth indicates that some were also of southern European origin. In general they were strong, well-fed men, but many of the bones also reveal tell-tale signs of childhood diseases and a life of grinding toil. The bones also showed traces of numerous healed fractures, probably the result of on-board accidents.|$|E

5000|$|Born (according to Forrer) in Breglia near Como or (according {{to older}} records) in Lugano, his {{date of death}} is unknown. He was first active in Milan, then in Mantua, from 1608 in Florence, from which latter period we possess his first signed medal. Here he was maestro delle stampe della monete. In 1609 he became well known by his medals commemorating the {{marriage}} and the accession of Cosimo II. In 1609 and 1610 he cut the dies for the thalers and the [...] "medals of merit" [...] conferred by the grand duke. According to Kenner, {{it is not necessary}} to suppose that he gave up his connexion with the Florentine court at this time, because, in the following years, he struck medals for the court in Mantua, as well as coins for Guastalla and Castiglione, especially as he was again working in Florence in 1614 (certainly in 1615). The medals, which he made after 1620 for Prince Vincenzo II of Mantua, <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> also <b>have</b> been struck at Florence.|$|R
40|$|Although {{children}} left at {{home without}} adult supervision <b>may</b> function <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> studies <b>have</b> shown potential problems with self-care and latchkey children. This {{study investigated the}} attitudes of 30 employed parents in New York whose first or third grade children were regularly left home alone after school. The 20 -question survey covered such areas as parents' perceptions of their children's ability {{to take care of}} themselves, use of older siblings as caregivers, activities the child was allowed to engage in while home alone (such as television viewing or playing outside), availability of outside help in case of emergency, satisfaction with the latchkey arrangement, and opinions on after-school programs. Results indicated that while most parents perceived child self-care as a positive experience for their children, most felt guilty, concerned, or ambivalent about leaving their children home alone. Respondents were also dissatisfied with the local school-based after-school program. In terms of common activities while home alone, most children were not allowed outside but were allowed to watch television for entertainment. (The report concludes with a discussion of important aspects of a positive after-school program. Contains 8 references.)

500|$|At the {{negotiations}} with the French, Warwick had intimated that King Edward was interested in a marriage arrangement with the French crown, the intended bride being Louis XI's sister-in-law, Bona, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy. This marriage was not to be, however, because in September 1464, Edward revealed that he was already married, to Elizabeth Woodville. The marriage caused great offence to Warwick: not only {{due to the fact}} that his plans had been sabotaged, but also the secrecy with which the king had acted. The marriage – contracted on 1May of the same year – was not made public before Warwick pressed Edward on the issue at a council meeting, and in the meanwhile Warwick had been unknowingly deceiving the French into believing the king was serious about the marriage proposal. For Edward the marriage <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been a love match, but in the long run he sought to build the Woodville family into a powerhouse independent of Warwick's influence. The marriage of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville caused Warwick to lose his power and influence. He accused Elizabeth and, her mother Jacquetta, of witchcraft to try and restore the power that he had lost.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{and historians}} hold various {{opinions}} {{as to how}} deep Anne's commitment to the Reformation was, how much she was perhaps only personally ambitious, and how much {{she had to do}} with Henry's defiance of papal power. There is anecdotal evidence, related to biographer George Wyatt by her former lady-in-waiting Anne Gainsford, that Anne brought to Henry's attention a heretical pamphlet, perhaps Tyndale's [...] "The Obedience of a Christian Man" [...] or one by Simon Fish called [...] "Supplication for Beggars," [...] which cried out to monarchs to rein in the evil excesses of the Catholic Church. She was sympathetic to those seeking further reformation of the Church, and actively protected scholars working on English translations of the scriptures. According to Maria Dowling, [...] "Anne tried to educate her waiting-women in scriptural piety” and is believed to have reproved her cousin, Mary Shelton, for “having 'idle poesies' written in her prayer book.” If Cavendish is to be believed, Anne's outrage at Wolsey may have personalised whatever philosophical defiance she brought with her from France. Further, the most recent edition of Ives's biography admits that Anne <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> had a personal spiritual awakening in her youth which spurred her on, not just as catalyst but expediter for Henry's Reformation, though the process took a number of years.|$|E

Remember, it's as easy to marry a rich woman as a poor woman: and a devilish deal pleasanter to sit down to a good dinner, than to a scrag of mutton in lodgings. Make up your mind to that. A woman with a good jointure is a doosid deal easier a profession than the law, let me tell you that. Look out; I shall be on the watch for you: and I shall die content, my boy, if I can see you with a good ladylike wife, and a good carriage, and a good pair of horses, living in society, and seeing your friends, like a gentleman.

2500|$|Regardless {{of his own}} {{membership}} status, Newton was a known {{associate of}} many individuals who themselves have often been labeled as members of various esoteric groups. [...] It is unclear if these associations were {{a result of his}} being a well established and prominently publicized scholar, an early member and sitting President of The Royal Society (1703–1727), a prominent figure of State and Master of the Mint, a recognized Knight, or if Newton actually sought active membership within these esoteric organizations himself. [...] Considering the nature and legality of alchemical practices during his lifetime, as well as his possession of various materials and manuscripts pertaining to alchemical research, Newton <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been a member of a group of like minded thinkers and colleagues.

All sorts of legal objections were raised: all laws {{would have to be}} renewed and all treaties renegotiated. For James, whose experience of parliaments was limited to the stage-managed and semi-feudal Scottish variety, the self-assurance — and obduracy — of the English version, which had long experience of upsetting monarchs, was an obvious shock. He decided to side-step the whole issue by unilaterally assuming the title of King of Great Britain by a Proclamation concerning the Kings Majesties Stile on 20 October 1604 announcing that he did [...] "assume to Our selfe by the cleerenesse of our Right, The Name and Stile of KING OF GREAT BRITTAINE, FRANCE AND IRELAND, DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, [...] " [...] This only deepened the offence. Even in Scotland there was little real enthusiasm for the project, though the two parliaments were eventually prodded into taking the whole matter 'under consideration'.
