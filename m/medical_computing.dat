40|$|This article traces past {{trends and}} current {{developments}} in <b>medical</b> <b>computing</b> in the United States.

The development of <b>medical</b> <b>computing</b> was not driven solely by the internal imperatives of science and technology, but by dreams and visions of how computers could revolutionize medicine. Such dreams and visions constitute a mythical charter similar to ideologies and rhetoric used to mobilize support by other computerization movements. This mythical charter influenced development of <b>medical</b> <b>computing</b> by tying computing in medicine to policy goals. This charter also affected historical accounts in <b>medical</b> <b>computing,</b> which are characterized by technological determinism and evidence of cognitive dissonance due to failure to achieve policy goals...|$|E
40|$|Computers are {{currently}} obtaining {{an increasingly important}} role in medical research, {{as well as in}} primary and secondary care, a process driven for the most part by the health−care community itself. Given the advantages linked with using computers in health−care in terms of health−care management, patient surveillance and monitoring, clinical research, medical imaging, medical decision−support and protocol−based care, it seems inevitable that the role of the computer will increase within the next five years. Currently, only a few centres in the UK possess expertise in <b>medical</b> <b>computing,</b> and there are at present no undergraduate courses offered in the UK that focus on <b>medical</b> <b>computing.</b> The University of Aberdeen could, therefore, be a major player in this field when initiatives in this direction are commenced at an appropriate time. One initiative is to offer a course in <b>medical</b> <b>computing</b> science at the undergraduate level. The course, called <b>Medical</b> <b>Computing</b> Science (computing science with a biomedical science focus), will be a variant of computing science and includes biomedical science and health−care topics. The aim is to attract good, scientifically oriented students. At a later stage...|$|E

The analysis indicates that a fear of physician resistance may be counter-productive, and itself contribute to the lag in <b>medical</b> <b>computing.</b> Then, a discussion of the differential adoption of medical computer applications suggests some ways of overcoming the lag due to physician resistance...|$|E
30|$|The {{application}} of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in dentistry has rapidly developed in recent years, especially in implantology, because CBCT {{has been shown}} to overcome many disadvantages of conventional <b>medical</b> <b>computed</b> tomography (CT), such as the high dose of radiation, long radiation exposure time, and low resolution ratio. It has been reported that the radiation dose of CBCT is just 25 % of the radiation dose of a panoramic radiograph and 1.6 to 2.5 % of that of a conventional medical CT [10, 11]. One of the most remarkable advantages of CBCT is its high resolution ratio; a voxel size as small as 0.125  mm can be achieved with CBCT, which translates into a powerful ability to obtain accurate 3 -dimensional (3 D) reconstructions [12 – 15].|$|R
40|$|Distribution UnliuLt:ýJ A revolutionary {{technique}} for snapshot imaging spectropolarimetry {{has been developed}} because of the recent availability of large focal plane arrays and fast computers. The technique involves the combination of spectropolarimetry with computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS). This spectropolarimeter uses a modulation to encode the spectral dependence of all four Stokes parameters in a single spectrum. CTIS is a snapshot imaging spectrometry method in which both spatial and spectral information is reconstructed using the inverse mathematical technique of <b>medical</b> <b>computed</b> tomography. The combination of these techniques provides {{the basis for a}} snapshot imaging complete Stokes spectropolarimeter that can be implemented with no moving parts.
