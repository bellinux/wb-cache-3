5000|$|The {{creation}} of an equipotential zone will protect a worker standing within it from hazardous step and touch potentials. Such a zone can be produced {{through the use of}} a <b>metal</b> <b>mat</b> connected to the grounded object. Usually this <b>metal</b> <b>mat</b> (or ground mesh) is connected to buried ground rods to increase contact with the earth and effectively reduce grid impedance. In some cases, a grounding grid can be used to equalize the voltage within the grid. Equipotential zones will not, however, protect employees who are either wholly or partially outside the protected area. Bonding conductive objects in the immediate work area can also be used to minimize the potential between the objects and between each object and ground. (Bonding an object outside the work area can increase the touch potential to that object in some cases, however.) ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{antistatic}} {{floor mat}} or ground mat {{is one of}} a number of antistatic devices designed to help eliminate static electricity. It does this by having a controlled low resistance: a <b>metal</b> <b>mat</b> would keep parts grounded but would short out exposed parts; an insulating mat would provide no ground reference and so would not provide grounding. Typical resistance is on the order of 105 to 108 ohms between points on the mat and to ground. [...] The mat would need to be grounded (earthed). This is usually accomplished by plugging into the grounded line in an electrical outlet. It's important to discharge at a slow rate, therefore a resistor should be used in earthing the mat. The resistor, as well as allowing high-voltage charges to leak through to earth, also prevents a shock hazard when working with low-voltage parts. Some ground mats allow you to connect an antistatic wrist strap to them. Versions are designed for placement on both the floor and desk.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{hundreds}} of tools which can be used. They are generally made by the jeweller/crafts person. They are typically made from bars of tool steel, which is forged and tempered at the tip. These hardened steel punches may be purchased by a supplier, but the specialized punches are made by the jeweler or special ordered to suit a particular design. [...] A saw {{can be used to}} cut designs into the tip for making patterns, or the tool can be hammered onto a patterned surface, which will indent the tip. The end of the tool which is to be hammered should be bevelled to allow for expansion of the metal from repeated hammering. Some of the main styles of tool include: Liners, planishers, matting, and doming. Liners have thin tips, which are slightly rounded. If they are too thin they will cut the metal. They are used in the initial marking out of the design, and in the finishing stages to refine any thin outlines. Planishers have smooth, flat tips which are used for pushing out large, flat areas of <b>metal.</b> <b>Matting</b> tools have patterns cut into them, and provide detail to areas of the design. Matting tools can also be made by filing a thin line around a steel bar, hardening it, then snapping it. This will result in a fine grain pattern. Doming tools push out rounded areas of metal, and can either be round or oval, quite pointed or almost flat. An oxyacetylene torch, coal forge or propane forge is required for heating the steel sufficiently for forging. The more tools available, the easier it is to create a detailed, accurate piece.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide the USDA-Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and other {{agencies}} or industries that may deal with temporary and intermittent use roads with the necessary background information for the identification, economic evaluation, and selection of the alternate surfacing systems and to determine the applicability and cost effectiveness of each system compared with crushed aggregate roads. Alternate systems considered include those which: 1) are capable of being moved as the hauling or mining activity moves, 2) degrade after use, and 3) significantly reduce the amount of rock required. A comprehensive market and literature search was performed. Potential surfacing types identified in this study are biodegradable materials, chemical stabilization, geotextile or geogrid separation, marginal aggregates, sand-sealed subgrade, <b>metal</b> <b>mats,</b> reusable aggregate with or without geotextile separation, membrane-encapsulated soil layer (MESL), and Geoweb stabilization. Numerous properties of these materials are evaluated, including size, weight, cost, expected performance, mechanical properties, and availability. A two-step evaluation procedure is developed. First is the preliminary evaluation step, which screens various alternate materials based on their characteristics, limitations, and availability. The second step is economic evaluation, which determines the most feasible economical alternatives. Two examples are analyzed to describe the evaluation procedure. The results of this analysis indicate that alternate surfacings can be economical compared to aggregate in most situations. A probabilistic approach using the Beta estimation procedure is recommended for the analysis and evaluation of the uncertainty associated with various elements of the alternate surfacings. Furthermore, a detailed sensitivity analysis is performed for crushed aggregate and soil stabilization surfaces. The results of this research indicate that the feasible alternatives for surfacing temporary and intermittent use roads are biodegradable materials, soil stabilization, marginal aggregates, conventional geotextile and extruded plastic mats, steel mats (M 8 A 1), and sand-sealed native subgrade...|$|R
25|$|There {{was a lack}} of airfields in the Western sectors, and {{authorities}} drafted contingency plans to deal with such a blockade.

The Potsdam Agreement included written rights of land access to the western sectors, whereas no such written guarantees had covered the western sectors of Berlin. During the 10 years of the four-power occupation, Vienna became a hot-bed for international espionage between the Western and Eastern blocs. In the wake of the Berlin Blockade, the Cold War in Vienna took on a different dynamic. While accepting that Germany and Berlin would be divided, the Soviets had decided against allowing the same state of affairs to arise in Austria and Vienna.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades a real {{revolution}} happened in the type, perception and use of art work: objects to be shown, subjects to be celebrated or more simply the demands of artists don't need large and introvert spaces; the events can happen outside the big cities and the small cities {{have an important role}} in the structure of the cultural world. The improvement of the historical, financial and cultural origins increased very much the demand of various and more or less large spaces, where to give the right shelter to all signs of human activity and therefore not only to those canonically classified as artistical. The various expositive offer and demand, doesn't necessarily involve monumental buildings made by rich materials. No more (or better not only) blind and heavy walls, stones and precious metals covering, but also the use of light and ethereal walls that were considered poor materials (like wood, adobe, sheet <b>metal,</b> <b>mats,</b> paper and bamboo). New contents, and most recently, subjects linked to the respect for the environment, caused the concept of volumes, sometimes on a small scale, that find, the confirmation of their own language and the technical constructive solutions in local references, and in the observance of energy saving. In this general description, the envelope project my be one of the most interesting and innovating aspects that come out during the last years, with results that appear in many cases every thing but mere solutions. From this point of view Hilton Judin and Nina Cohen's designs for Mandela Museum in Mvezo (South Africa), the Weald and Downland Museum by Edward H. Cullinan in West Sussex, and the most recent Shigeru Ban's Nomadic Museum in New York are all very significant examples. This research, through the study of these works, shows how it is possible to recognise, in places very far among themselves both physically and culturally, at the same time common objectives and variety of materials and design solutions. These very important both technical and formal plans, allow to assign to these sphere selections a right qualitative and ethical degree, that it well symbolises a new way to see and to do the culture and the architecture. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Catalytic {{palladium}} (Pd) nanoparticles on electrospun copolymers of acrylonitrile and {{acrylic acid}} (PAN-AA) mats were produced via reduction of PdCl 2 with hydrazine. Fiber mats were electrospun from homogeneous solutions of PAN-AA and PdCl 2 in dimethylformamide (DMF). Pd cations {{were reduced to}} Pd <b>metals</b> when fiber <b>mats</b> were treated in an aqueous hydrazine solution at room temperature. Pd atoms nucleate and form small crystallites whose sizes were estimated from the peak broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. Two to four crystallites adhere together and form agglomerates. Agglomerate sizes and fiber diameters were determined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Spherical Pd nanoparticles were dispersed homogeneously on the electrospun nanofibers. The effects of copolymer composition and amount of PdCl 2 on particle size were investigated. Pd particle size mainly depends {{on the amount of}} acrylic acid functional groups and PdCl 2 concentration in the spinning solution. Increasing acrylic acid concentration on polymer chains leads to larger Pd nanoparticles. In addition, Pd particle size becomes larger with increasing PdCl 2 concentration in the spinning solution. Hence, it is possible to tune the number density and the size of metal nanoparticles. The catalytic activity of the Pd nanoparticles in electrospun mats was determined by selective hydrogenation of dehydrolinalool (3, 7 -dimethyloct- 6 ene- 1 -yne- 3 -ol, DHL) in toluene at 90 °C. Electrospun fibers with Pd particles have 4. 5 times higher catalytic activity than the current Pd/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. 1...|$|R
40|$|Two {{microbial}} mats {{found inside}} two old (gold and uranium) mines in Zloty Stok and Kowary located in SW Poland seem {{to form a}} natural barrier that traps heavy metals leaking from dewatering systems. We performed complex physiological and metagenomic analyses to determine which microorganisms are the main driving agents responsible for self-purification of the mine waters and identify metabolic processes responsible for the observed features. SEM and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis showed accumulation of heavy <b>metals</b> on the <b>mat</b> surface, whereas, sorption experiments showed that neither microbial mats were completely saturated with heavy metals present in the mine waters, indicating {{that they have a}} large potential to absorb significant quantities of metal. The metagenomic analysis revealed that Methylococcaceae and Methylophilaceae families were the most abundant in both communities, moreover, it strongly suggest that backbones of both mats were formed by filamentous bacteria, such as Leptothrix, Thiothrix, and Beggiatoa. The Kowary bacterial community was enriched with the Helicobacteraceae family, whereas the Zloty Stok community consist mainly of Sphingomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Caulobacteraceae families. Functional (culture-based) and metagenome (sequence-based) analyses showed that bacteria involved in immobilization of heavy metals, rather than those engaged in mobilization, were the main driving force within the analyzed communities. In turn, a comparison of functional genes revealed that the biofilm formation and heavy metal resistance (HMR) functions are more desirable in microorganisms engaged in water purification than the ability to utilize heavy metals in the respiratory process (oxidation-reduction). These findings provide insight on the activity of bacteria leading, from biofilm formation to self-purification, of mine waters contaminated with heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|Current {{research}} in the field of nano-electronics is directed towards device miniaturization in order to find ways to increase the speed of electronic devices. The work presented in this dissertation is on the electronic transport properties of single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) ropes synthesized by laser ablation. The measurements were performed on devices with different geometries; namely SWNT <b>mats,</b> <b>metal</b> incorporated (aligned individual and bundled) SWNTs and lastly on aligned pure SWNTs from low temperatures up to room temperature. The work was performed so as to gain an understanding on how best to utilize SWNTs in the semiconductor industry towards miniaturization. Such an understanding would ultimately highlight if SWNTs can be considered as a viable alternative to the current silicon-based technology, which seems to be approaching its physical limit. For a mat of SWNTs, 3 D-Variable range hopping is the principal conduction mechanism from 2 K – 300 K. The magneto-resistance was found to be predominantly negative with a parabolic nature which converts to a linear nature as the temperature is increased. The negative MR is a consequence of quantum interference and the positive upturn is attributed to wave function shrinkage at low temperatures as described by the Efros-Shklovskii model. The hopping ranges of the electrons for a SWNT mat increases as the temperature decreases due to manifestation of quantum effects and reduced scattering. It was also found that metal incorporation does not alter the properties of the SWNT significantly. SWNT ropes aligned by di-electrophoresis across a 1 micron gap between gold micro-electrodes, exhibit Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) like behaviour, within the 80 K – 300 K temperature range. The effects of confinement and electron-electron interaction unique to one dimension were identified in electronic transport as a non-universal power law dependence of the differential conductance on temperature and source-drain voltage. Ballistic conductance at room temperature was confirmed from the high frequency transport of the SWNT devices. The complex impedance showed some oscillatory behaviour in the frequency range 6 to 30 GHz, as has been predicted theoretically in the Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid model. The observation of Luttinger Liquid behaviour demonstrates the outstanding nature of these one-dimensional molecular systems. In these devices the charging Coulomb energy of a single particle {{played a critical role in}} the overall device performance. This study can be used to understand the nature of dynamics of plasmons which are the charge carriers in a TLL system and how Coulomb interactions can be used to design highly tuneable systems for fabrication of single molecule devices. The incorporation of metal onto individual SWNT ropes does not alter its electronic properties significantly but the properties of the bundled metal incorporated SWNT ropes are altered. This study has found that under optimized conditions SWNTs might be a viable option for incorporation in nano electronics devices. Individual SWNT ropes promise better devices compared to SWNT mats and further work should be done on individual SWNTs...|$|R
