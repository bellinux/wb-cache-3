At the meeting, Camara discussed his plans to renegotiate mining contracts and fight corruption. He said that all gold mining had already been halted for the time being. Camara also told the opposition and union leaders that they could propose a Prime Minister. Condé said on that occasion that <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CNDD</b> junta were [...] "patriots", and his party, <b>the</b> Rally <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guinean People (RPG), subsequently expressed its willingness {{to participate in a}} government under <b>the</b> <b>CNDD.</b> Sidya Touré gave a positive assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation and said that [...] "we will discuss the program and timetable for the transition and we will ensure that the military keep their promises." ...|$|R

Also on 24 December, Camara said in a radio broadcast that <b>the</b> <b>CNDD</b> did not want to stay in power indefinitely and that it intended to lead the country for two years, promising [...] "credible and transparent presidential elections by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> December 2010".

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>CNDD</b> was {{established}} in Zaire on 24 September 1994 and was initially led by Léonard Nyangoma. The party also established an armed wing, the Forces for <b>the</b> Defence <b>of</b> Democracy, which {{was involved in the}} country's ethnic conflict. In the early 2000s the party split, with a faction led by Pierre Nkurunziza becoming the National Council for <b>the</b> Defense <b>of</b> Democracy - Forces for <b>the</b> Defense <b>of</b> Democracy (CNDD-FDD). <b>The</b> <b>CNDD</b> held two ministerial posts in a unity government formed in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|Six {{hours after}} Somparé {{announced}} Conté's death, a statement was read on television announcing {{a military coup}} d'état. This statement, read by Captain Camara on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CNDD,</b> said that [...] "the government and <b>the</b> institutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic have been dissolved". The statement also announced <b>the</b> suspension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitution [...] "as well as political and union activity". Guinean national radio began playing the song [...] "Armée Guinéenne" [...] repeatedly. According to Camara, the coup was necessary because of Guinea's [...] "deep despair" [...] amidst rampant poverty and corruption, {{and he said that}} the existing institutions were [...] "incapable <b>of</b> resolving <b>the</b> crises which have been confronting the country." [...] Furthermore, Camara said that someone from the military would become President, while a civilian would be appointed as prime minister at <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> a new government that would be ethnically balanced. The National Council for Democracy and Development would, according to Camara, include 26 officers as well as six civilians.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>CNDD</b> {{ordered all}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} and army officers {{to go to}} the Alpha Yaya Diallo military camp within 24 hours, with <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> [...] "a sweep <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire national territory" [...] if they did not. Prime Minister Souaré went to the camp and turned himself in on 25 December, together with all <b>the</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> his government except for two ministers who were, according to Souaré, on official missions abroad. Camara met with Souaré and stressed that <b>the</b> <b>CNDD</b> was now in power, but he said that Souaré and his government could [...] "go back to business". During the meeting, Souaré lamented <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> Conté and expressed his government's willingness to serve under <b>the</b> <b>CNDD,</b> pointing out that his government was composed of technocrats, not politicians. He also addressed Camara as [...] "President".|$|R
