5|$|Autoimmune {{thyroiditis}} {{is associated}} with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, pernicious anemia, <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may occur as part of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).|$|E
5|$|LEMS usually {{occurs in}} people over 40 years of age, but may occur at any age. The {{diagnosis}} is usually confirmed with electromyography and blood tests; these also {{distinguish it from}} <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
5|$|LEMS {{may also}} be {{associated}} with autoimmune diseases, such as hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) or diabetes mellitus type 1. <b>Myasthenia</b> gravis, too, may happen {{in the presence of}} tumors (thymoma, a tumor of the thymus in the chest); people with MG without a tumor and people with LEMS without a tumor have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases. HLA-DR3-B8 (an HLA subtype), in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.|$|E
5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if used {{in children and}} in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals. Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E
5|$|CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and {{conduction}} velocities. If repeated impulses {{are administered}} (2 per second or 2Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the {{motor end plate}} is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all {{can be attributed to}} insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in <b>myasthenia</b> gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease <b>myasthenia</b> gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myasthenia</b> gravis is an {{autoimmune}} disease which results from antibodies that block or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors {{at the junction}} between the nerve and muscle. This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions. Rarely, an inherited genetic defect in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital <b>myasthenia.</b> Babies of mothers with <b>myasthenia</b> may have symptoms during their {{first few months of}} life, known as neonatal <b>myasthenia.</b> Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or a nerve conduction study.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile <b>myasthenia</b> gravis is {{most common}} in females.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myasthenia</b> gravis is a {{neuromuscular disease}} leading to {{fluctuating}} muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative {{effect of the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine. <b>Myasthenia</b> is treated with immunosuppressants, cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected cases, thymectomy.|$|E
25|$|A thymoma is a tumor {{originating}} from the epithelial {{cells of the}} thymus that may be benign or malignant. Thymomas are frequently associated with the neuromuscular disorder <b>myasthenia</b> gravis; thymoma is found in 20% of patients with <b>myasthenia</b> gravis. Once diagnosed, thymomas may be removed surgically. In the rare case of a malignant tumor, chemotherapy may be used.|$|E
25|$|HLA DR3 is {{correlated}} strongly with Sjögren's syndrome, <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, SLE, and DM Type 1.|$|E
25|$|DQA1*0104:DQB1*0503 {{is part of}} a multigene {{haplotype}} DR14-DQ5 that {{is associated}} with MuSK positive <b>Myasthenia</b> gravis.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with the}} {{autoimmune}} disease <b>myasthenia</b> gravis commonly (70%) {{are found to}} have thymic hyperplasia or malignancy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myasthenia</b> gravis* {{results from}} the {{presence}} of antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor. Signs include megaesophagus and muscle weakness.|$|E
25|$|Oxazepam is {{contraindicated}} in <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, {{and limited}} pulmonary reserve, {{as well as}} severe hepatic disease.|$|E
25|$|Transient {{neonatal}} <b>myasthenia</b> {{occurs in}} 10 to 15% of babies born to mothers afflicted with the disorder, and disappears {{after a few}} weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{signs of}} {{congenital}} <b>myasthenia</b> usually {{are present in}} the first years of childhood, although they may not be recognized until adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{acetylcholine}} receptor antibody level which is typically seen in <b>myasthenia</b> gravis {{has been seen}} in certain patients of mitochondrial associated ophthalmoplegia.|$|E
25|$|One test is for {{antibodies}} {{against the}} acetylcholine receptor; the test has a reasonable sensitivity of 80–96%, but in ocular <b>myasthenia,</b> the sensitivity falls to 50%.|$|E
25|$|Differentiating {{psychogenic}} (perceived) asthenia {{and true}} asthenia from <b>myasthenia</b> is often difficult, {{and in time}} apparent psychogenic asthenia accompanying many chronic disorders is seen to progress into a primary weakness.|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{weakness}} {{may be due}} {{to problems}} with the nerve supply, neuromuscular disease (such as <b>myasthenia</b> gravis) or problems with muscle itself. The latter category includes polymyositis and other muscle disorders.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the FDA {{added two}} box {{warnings}} for this drug {{in reference to}} spontaneous tendon ruptures {{and the fact that}} moxifloxacin may cause worsening of <b>myasthenia</b> gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and life-threatening breathing problems.|$|E
25|$|More rare manifestations are acute confusional state, Guillain–Barré syndrome, aseptic meningitis, {{autonomic}} disorder, demyelinating syndrome, mononeuropathy (which might manifest as mononeuritis multiplex), {{movement disorder}} (more specifically, chorea), <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, myelopathy, cranial neuropathy and plexopathy.|$|E
25|$|Selected {{laboratory}} tests {{can be used}} to look for associated problems or possible tumor spread. These include: full blood count, protein electrophoresis, antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (indicative of <b>myasthenia),</b> electrolytes, liver enzymes and renal function.|$|E
25|$|Mega{{esophagus}} is {{a disease}} of the esophagus characterized by low motility and dilation. Most cases in adult dogs are idiopathic. It {{is the most common}} cause of regurgitation in dogs. Other causes of megaesophagus include <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, lead poisoning, and Addison's disease.|$|E
25|$|The thymus gland cells {{form part}} of the body's immune system. In those with <b>myasthenia</b> gravis, the thymus gland is large and abnormal. It {{sometimes}} contains clusters of immune cells which indicate lymphoid hyperplasia, and the thymus gland may give wrong instructions to immune cells.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{who suffer}} from muscle {{weakness}} due to <b>myasthenia</b> gravis or have poor respiratory reserves due to severe chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or other lung disease, or have sleep apnoea cannot safely take zopiclone, nor can a patient with any untreated abnormality of the thyroid gland.|$|E
25|$|Diseases that impair {{signaling}} between α-MNs and extrafusal muscle fibers, namely {{diseases of}} the neuromuscular junction have similar signs to those that occur with α-MN disease. For example, <b>myasthenia</b> gravis is an autoimmune disease that prevents signaling across the neuromuscular junction, which results in functional denervation of muscle.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Suzanne Rogers was {{diagnosed}} with a rare muscle disorder called <b>Myasthenia</b> Gravis. This disease affected her facial muscles and the medication she needed made her feel ill, with her face appearing swollen while also suffering hair loss. Rogers was forced to quit the show after 11 years when the effects of the disease became increasingly worse. Her entire appearance changed, and she did not return to the show for a year. Rogers, wanting to educate viewers about the disease, approached executive producer Betty Corday about her character being diagnosed with the disease. Corday agreed, and a storyline played out with Maggie learning she has <b>myasthenia</b> gravis. The actress went into remission in 1995, and has remained in remission since. In 2010, Maggie began to notice some symptoms of the disease returning.|$|E
25|$|A dozen {{inflammatory}} {{diseases of}} the immune system can attribute some risk to the haplotype. Some disease like coeliac disease primarily associate with certain genes. While other diseases, like type 1 diabetes may have several, highly different, genes that attribute risk. Still other diseases, like <b>myasthenia</b> gravis have undetermined linkage to the haplotype.|$|E
25|$|Weakness or {{asthenia}} is {{a symptom}} of a number of different conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as <b>myasthenia</b> gravis.|$|E
25|$|In some conditions, such as <b>myasthenia</b> gravis muscle {{strength}} is normal when resting, but true weakness occurs after the muscle {{has been subjected}} to exercise. This is also true for some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome, where objective post-exertion muscle weakness with delayed recovery time has been measured and is a feature of some of the published definitions.|$|E
