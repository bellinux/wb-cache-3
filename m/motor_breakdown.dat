A good understanding of these costs is important so that plant staff can quantify them and justify the adoption of preventive maintenance and other proactive strategies in their motor procurement, repair, and maintenance policies. In a typical scenario, the company requires a separate itemized capital budget in their annual planning cycle, while granting the maintenance department discretionary spending authority on their repair budget.

40|$|Stator inter-turn faults {{are among}} the most {{important}} electric motor failures as they progress fast and lead to catastrophic <b>motor</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Inter-turn faults are caused due to the windings’ insulation degradation. The main stress which deteriorates the insulation is the thermal one. Proper understanding of how this stress influences the electrical properties of insulation over time may lead to reliable prognosis and estimation of the motor’s remaining useful life. In transport applications where reliability and safety come first it is a critical issue. In this paper, extensive experimental testing and statistical analysis of thin film insulation for traction motor windings has been performed under fixed thermal stress. The results indicate that for high thermal stress the electrical properties of the insulation material present a non-monotonic behavior thus proving the well-known and established Arrhenius law inadequate for modelling this type of problems and estimating the remaining useful life of thin film insulation materials...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether {{young children who}} stutter have a basic motor timing and/or a coordination deficit. Method: Between-hands coordination and variability of rhythmic motor timing were assessed in 17 children who stutter (4 – 6 years of age) and 13 age-matched controls. Children clapped in rhythm with a metronome with a 600 -ms interbeat interval and then attempted to continue to match this target rate for 32 unpaced claps. Results: Children who stutter did not significantly differ from children who were typically developing on mean clapping rate or number of usable trials produced; however, they produced remarkably higher variability levels of interclap interval. Of particular interest was the bimodal distribution of the stuttering children on clapping variability. One subgroup of children who stutter clustered within the normal range, but 60 % {{of the children who}} stutter exhibited timing variability that was greater than the poorest performing nonstuttering child. Children who stutter were not more variable in measures of coordination between the 2 hands (mean and median phase difference between hands). Conclusion:We infer that there is a subgroup of young stuttering children who exhibit a nonspeech motor timing deficit, and we discuss this result as it pertains to recovery or persistence of stuttering.

Key to this design was the selection of thirty multisyllabic targets: 15 treatment and 15 control that were matched based on semantic category and phonetic complexity. Overall, results indicated positive gains in two of the three children that could be attributed directly to the applied treatment.

Abnormal movements have been reported during interpersonal interactions of patients suffering from schizophrenia and a <b>motor</b> coordination <b>breakdown</b> could explain this social interaction deficit, which is one of the main and earliest features of the illness. Using the dynamical systems framework, the goal of the current study was (i) to investigate whether social motor coordination is impaired in schizophrenia and (ii) to determine the underlying perceptual or cognitive processes that may be affected. We examined intentional and unintentional social motor coordination in participants oscillating hand-held pendulums from the wrist. The control group consisted of twenty healthy participant pairs while the experimental group consisted of twenty participant pairs that included one participant suffering from schizophrenia. The results showed that unintentional social motor coordination was preserved while intentional social motor coordination was impaired. In intentional coordination, the schizophrenia group displayed coordination patterns that had lower stability and in which the patient never led the coordination. A coupled oscillator model suggests that the schizophrenia group coordination pattern was due to a decrease in the amount of available information together with a delay in information transmission.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{reason for a}} {{low-voltage}} induction <b>motor</b> <b>breakdown</b> is a bearing failure. Along with the increasing popularity of modern frequency converters, bearing failures have {{become the most important}} motor fault type. Conditions in which bearing currents are likely to occur are generated as a side effect of fast du/dt switching transients. Once present, different types of bearing currents can accelerate the mechanical wear of bearings by causing deformation of metal parts in the bearing and degradation of the lubricating oil properties. The bearing current phenomena are well known, and several bearing current measurement and mitigation methods have been proposed. Nevertheless, in order to develop more feasible methods to measure and mitigate bearing currents, better knowledge of the phenomena is required. When mechanical wear is caused by bearing currents, the resulting aging impact has to be monitored and dealt with. Moreover, because of the stepwise aging mechanism, periodically executed condition monitoring measurements have been found ineffective. Thus, {{there is a need for}} feasible bearing current measurement methods that can be applied in parallel with the normal operation of series production drive systems. In order to reach the objectives of feasibility and applicability, nonintrusive measurement methods are preferred. In this doctoral dissertation, the characteristics and conditions of bearings that are related to the occurrence of different kinds of bearing currents are studied. Further, the study introduces some nonintrusive radio-frequency-signal-based approaches to detect and measure parameters that are associated with the accelerated bearing wear caused by bearing currents...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of an online method for the early detection of a stator turn insulation deterioration is {{the objective of the}} research at hand. A high percentage of <b>motor</b> <b>breakdowns</b> is related to the failure of the stator insulation system. Since most of the stator insulation failures originate in the breakdown of the turn-to-turn insulation, the research in this realm is of great significance. Despite the progress that has been made in the field of stator turn fault detection methods, the most popular and the best known ones are still limited to the detection of solid turn faults. The time span between a solid turn fault and the breakdown of the primary insulation system can be as short as a few seconds. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a method capable of detecting the deterioration of the turn insulation as early as possible and prior to the {{development of}} a solid turn fault. The different stresses that cause the aging of the insulation and eventually lead to failure are described as well as the various patterns of an insulation failure. A comprehensive literature survey shows the methods presently used for the monitoring of the turn insulation. Up to now no well-tested and reliable online method that can find the deterioration of the turn insulation is available. The most commonly used turn insulation test is the surge test, which, however, is performed only when the motor is out of service and disconnected from the supply. So far no research at all has been conducted on the application of an online surge test. The research at hand examines the applicability of the surge test to an operating machine. Various topologies of online surge testing are examined with regard to their practicability and their limitations. The most practical configuration is chosen for further analysis, implementation and development. Moreover, practical challenges are presented by the non-idealities of the induction machine like the eccentricity of the rotor and the rotor slotting, and have to be taken into account. Two solutions to eliminate the influence of the rotor position on the surge waveform are presented. Even though the basic concepts of online surge testing can be validated experimentally by a machine with a solid turn fault, it is preferable to use a machine with a deteriorated turn insulation. Therefore, a method, which does not require complex and expensive hardware, to experimentally emulate the turn insulation breakdown is implemented. The concepts at any stage of the work are supported by simulations and experimental results. In addition, the theory of surge testing is further developed by giving new definitions of the test's sensitivity, i. e., the frequency sensitivity and the error area ratio (EAR) sensitivity. Ph. D.

This study addresses the question regarding whether this <b>motor</b> <b>breakdown</b> is specific to the speech-motor system, or more generalized across motor systems. As an expansion of Olander, Smith, and Zelaznik (2010), we measured bimanual motor timing performance in 115 children: 70 children who stutter (CWS) and 45 children who do not stutter (CWNS). The children were followed for five years of the study by completing a clapping task using a synchronization-continuation paradigm. Two analyses were completed. The first was a cross-sectional {{analysis of the data}} from the children in the initial year of the study (ages 4; 0 - 5; 11) comparing clapping performance between CWS and CWNS. In the second longitudinal analysis, the data were organized by the children 2 ̆ 7 s age to compare clapping performance across the developmental continuum, and compared by eventual persistence or recovery status of stuttering. The results of these analyses reveal that preschool CWS do not differ from their nonstuttering peers on rates of clapping, and are not more variable than typically developing peers in performance of a bimanual rhythmic timing task. Additionally, bimanual motor timing differences are not a likely candidate as a contributing factor to the eventual persistence or recovery from stuttering. From these findings, we conclude that a bimanual motor timing deficit is not a core feature of persistent developmental stuttering. ...|$|E
40|$|Induction motors {{are widely}} used in {{industrial}} processes. The malfunction of a motor may not only lead to high repair costs, but also cause immense financial losses due to unexpected process downtime. Since thermal overload {{is one of the}} major root causes of stator winding insulation failure, an accurate and reliable monitoring of the stator winding temperature is crucial to increase the mean time to catastrophic <b>motor</b> <b>breakdown,</b> and to reduce the extraordinary financial losses due to unexpected process downtime. To provide a reliable thermal protection for induction motors fed by motor control devices, a dc signal-injection method is proposed for in-service induction motors fed by soft-starter and variable-frequency drives. The stator winding temperature can be monitored based on the estimated stator winding resistance using the dc model of induction motors. In addition, a cooling capability monitoring technique is proposed to monitor the cooling capability of induction motors and to warn the user for proactive inspection and maintenance in the case of cooling capability deterioration. The proposed cooling capability monitoring technique, combined with the proposed stator winding temperature monitoring technique, can provide a complete thermal protection for in-service induction motors fed by motor control devices. Aside from online thermal protection during a motor's normal operation, the thermal protection of de-energized motors is also essential to prolong a motor's lifetime. Moisture condensation {{is one of the major}} causes to motor degradation especially in high-humidity environments. To prevent moisture condensation, a non-intrusive motor heating technique is proposed by injecting currents into the motor stator winding using soft-starters. A motor's temperature can be kept above the ambient temperature due to the heat dissipation, so that the moisture condensation can be avoided. To sum up, active stator winding temperature estimation techniques for induction motors under both operating and de-energization conditions are proposed in this dissertation for both thermal protection and optimizing the operation of a motor system. The importance of these proposed techniques lies in their non-intrusive nature: only the existing hardware in a motor control device is required for implementation; a motor's normal operation is not interrupted.

Through practice, individuals develop a set of rules, or speech motor schema, which allows coordination of these multiple structures. Once the rules and the speech goal are known, speakers modify parameters such as rate, amplitude, and duration of a movement to achieve the desired speech outcomes. Manipulation of these parameters has been used clinically to improve speech intelligibility for speakers with dysarthria. However, little is known regarding the impact of reduced speaking rate on maintaining the stability of motor performance. In this study, fifteen individuals with no known history of neurological disorder attempted speaking tasks under four controlled speaking rate conditions.
