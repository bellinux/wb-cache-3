40|$|Orientation imaging {{microscopy}} (OIM) {{was performed}} on hot twisted polycrystalline 304 stainless steel specimens in order to study the characteristics of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in low stacking fault energy FCC metals. Microtexture analyses were carried out and the misorientation statistics of the recrystallized areas were derived. The results revealed that multiple twinning controls the formation of new orientations. DRX <b>macrotextures</b> were also measured in torsion and compression. These textures are highly sensitive to the deformation (Zener-Hollomon) parameter Z. High Z values lead to overall textures controlled by nucleation, whereas, at low Z values, selective growth is more predominant. A deformation and recrystallization model based on the OIM measurements and the steady state properties is proposed. The observed strong brass-type deformation textures were simulated by introducing self hardening coefficients. The transition from single to multiple-peak flow during DRX was investigated, together with {{the evolution of the}} grain size distribution. In particular, the effect of twinning on the evolution of the latter was simulated. Finally, it is shown that the model simulates texture development during DRX very well...|$|R
40|$|The Bonikowo Reef {{occurs in}} {{the central part of}} the Zechstein Limestone Basin in western Poland and was growing on the topmost edges of tilted blocks and/or on the top of uplifted horsts of the Brandenburg–Wolsztyn–Pogorzela High. Its size is ca. 1. 6  km 2. The Bonikowo Reef shows the {{thickest}} reef section (90. 5  m) recorded in the High. The Zechstein Limestone unit is represented mostly by limestones, often thoroughly recrystallized, although the <b>macrotextures</b> and biota of the boundstone are identifiable in most cases. The drillcore section is a mixture of boundstones (microbial and bryozoan), wackestones, packstones and grainstones, which often co-occur. The δ 13 C and δ 18 O values for both calcite (avg. 3. 8  ±  0. 8 ‰ and − 3. 4  ±  1. 7 ‰, respectively) and dolomite (avg. 3. 5  ±  0. 7 ‰ and − 5. 2  ±  1. 3 ‰, respectively) are transitional between the values previously reported for condensed sequences of the basinal facies and larger reef complexes. The biofacies of the Bonikowo Reef are very similar to those recognized in other reefs of the Brandenburg–Wolsztyn–Pogorzela High, which owe their origin to the destruction of bryozoan boundstones. The biota composition is typical and characteristic of other Zechstein Limestone reefs. However, the Bonikowo Reef demonstrates the importance of microbialites, laminar and nodose encrustations, in the growth and cohesion of the Zechstein Limestone reefs. Such encrustations abound within the Zechstein Limestone although, in many cases, the real nature of the encrustations is difficult to ascertain. These laminated encrustations show great similarity to Archaeolithoporella that is one of the most important Permian reef-building organisms. The encrustations considered to represent Archaeolithoporella were also previously recorded in the Zechstein Limestone of western Poland and in its stratigraphic equivalent, the Middle Magnesian Limestone of Northeast England. The lower part of the sequence shows great biofacies variability that reflects common environmental changes. The major part of the section is represented by slope deposits grading upward into the reef, which reflects the prograding nature of reef margin.

Pavement texture is divided into three categories; megatexture, <b>macrotexture,</b> and microtexture. Microtexture cannot currently be measured directly, except in a laboratory. Megatexture is measured using a similar profiling method as when obtaining IRI values, while <b>macrotexture</b> is the measurement of the individual variations of the road within a small interval of a few centimeters. For example, a road which has gravel spread on top followed by an asphalt seal coat will have a high <b>macrotexture,</b> and a road built with concrete slabs will have low <b>macrotexture.</b> For this reason, concrete is often grooved or roughed up immediately after it is laid on the road bed to increase the friction between the tire and road.|$|E

40|$|The Cambro-Ordovician {{period has}} yielded the major {{development}} of volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits in Australia, resulting in about 12 {{million metric tons}} of contained metal (copper, lead, and zinc), concentrated in the Mount Read Volcanics (Tasmania) and the Mount Windsor Volcanics (Queensland), The Archean (4 million metric tons of metal) and the Silurian (3. 5 million metric tons of metal) constitute the next important episodes while the Devonian and Permian have produced isolated deposits. The deposits range from Cu type to Zn-Cu type to Zn-Pb-Cu type. The Zn-Cu-type deposits are restricted to the Archean and Silurian, whereas the Cu type and Zn-Pb-Cu type occur sporadically throughout the time span from early Archean to Permian. In general terms, the major VHMS-bearing districts are calc-alkaline in character and display a thick basal pile of rhyolitic volcanics (1 - 3 km thick) including lavas, epiclastics, and subvolcanic intrusions which is overlain by a polymodal sequence containing various proportions of rhyolite,dacite, andesite, basalt, and sediments. The major deposits are commonly located at the top contact of the rhyolite pile or within {{the lower part of}} the overlying polymodal sequence. There is a wide range in variability of styles of Australian VHMS deposits including mounds, pipes, sheets, layered deposits, stacked deposits, stockwork and disseminated deposits, distal reworked deposits, and cyclic layered deposits. Although these various styles show a range of features, there is a consistent theme across the spectrum of metal zonation, alteration mineralogy, alteration chemistry, sulfur isotopes, <b>macrotextures,</b> microtextures, and host volcanic relationships which strongly suggests that they all belong to the one genetic group of ore deposit. The classic mound-style deposits, such as Hellyer, have a series of key features, subsets of which are represented in the other deposit styles. The mound deposits are considered to form from deposition of metal sulfides on the sea floor immediately around the hydrothermal vent. Growth of the mound occurs by upward replacement of sulfide assemblages stable at higher fluid temperatures, leading to zone refining and lead-zinc-silver-gold enrichment in the outer and upper parts of the mound, Departure from the classic mound style of deposit is related principally to three key factors: the chemistry of the ore fluid (salinity, temperature,f 02, and aH 2 S), the nature (permeability and chemistry) of the volcanic pile, and the sea-Hoor environment (sea-Hoor topography and [...] seawater depth). These factors control the aspect ratio of the deposit, the extent of stringer zone development, the degree of subsea-floor replacement mineralization, the nature and spatial development of footwall alteration, and the development and style of related distal mineralization. Sulfur isotope studies of Australian VHMS deposits indicate that reduced seawater sulfate is a major source of sulfur in the deposit, whereas lead and strontium isotope results are compatible with the metals being derived by seawater convection and leaching from the volcanic pile and basement rocks. This conclusion is supported by the application of various leaching models which demonstrate the availability of an adequate source of both base and precious metals in the footwall volcanic sequences. The input of metals directly from volcanic magma chambers is not precluded by the available data, and one likely scenario involves the contribution of gold and copper from a magmatic vapor plume, rising to mix with convective seawater fluids which contribute lead, zinc, silver, and gold leached from the footwall volcanics and basement rocks. The relative importance of the magmatic input compared with the seawater convective input may help to explain the spectrum of deposit styles arid their spatial relationship to volcanic centers or adjacent sedimentary basins...|$|R

40|$|The Indiana Department of Transportation has {{conducted}} annual network inventory friction testing using the locked wheel trailer to reduce wet pavement crashes. However, issues have arisen concerning the data credibility and field operation safety on high-speed highway facilities. Some researchers {{have investigated the}} evaluation of pavement friction using <b>macrotexture</b> measurements and found the relationship between friction and <b>macrotexture</b> is extremely weak. Currently, <b>macrotexture</b> can be readily measured at highway speeds, but microtexture is evaluated using friction at low speeds from a surrogate device. Microtexture {{plays an important role}} in friction force. The evaluation of pavement friction from texture measurements will be undermined without considering microtexture. This pilot study was conducted by the authors to examine the use of laser-based sensors in measuring pavement texture, in particular microtexture. The requirement for laser sampling frequency was established for choosing lasers during testing at highway speeds. Microtexture testing was conducted on cores taken from pavements. It was found that the Microtexture MPD, RMS and SV increased as the baseline length increased, regardless of the type of pavement, but tended to remain constant after the baseline length exceeded 12. 75 mm. It was recommended that the microtexture MPD, RMS and SV should be computed in terms of a baseline length used for computing <b>macrotexture.</b> When estimating friction from microtexture measurements, the use of SV was as effective as the use of RMS. It is not necessary to include both SV and RMS when estimating friction from microtexture. Correlation analysis indicated that wet pavement friction had a positive relationship with <b>macrotexture</b> MPD, microtexture MPD, and microtexture SV. The microtexture SV may play a more important role in wet pavement friction than the microtexture MPD. Dry pavement friction is not as sensitive to <b>macrotexture</b> as to microtexture. Regression analysis indicated that pavement friction is related to both macrotextrue and microtexture, not to <b>macrotexture</b> only. In addition, when pavement is wet, its surface friction is more sensitive to the slope variance than to the mean profile depth of the microtexture profile. It was recommended that more research effort is needed to investigate the characterization of microtexture and examine the effect of <b>macrotexture</b> slope variance.
