50|$|<b>Meredith</b> Louise <b>Vieira</b> (born December 30, 1953) is an American journalist, {{talk show}} and game show host.

500|$|In November 2008, it was {{reported}} that television talk show host Larry King had [...] "quietly filmed an appearance" [...] as himself on 30 Rock. This episode was actress Salma Hayek's fifth appearance as Elisa on the show. She first appeared in the episode [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] as a nurse for Jack Donaghy's mother and love interest for Jack. She made appearances in the episodes [...] "Flu Shot", [...] "Generalissimo", and [...] "St. Valentine's Day". Her last guest spot was in the episode [...] "The Ones" [...] in which Elisa and Jack end their relationship. Actor Rip Torn made his seventh appearance on the series as GE CEO Don Geiss. [...] "Larry King" [...] would become Torn's final appearance on the show, as it is revealed in the fourth season episode [...] "Future Husband" [...] that his character has died. Comedian actor Brian Stack made his third appearance as Howard Jorgensen, a GE executive and associate of Jack's. Stack previously appeared in the episodes [...] "Jack Meets Dennis" [...] and [...] "Succession". Actor Ajay Naidu played Asif, the taxi driver holding Liz's phone for ransom in [...] "Larry King". [...] "Larry King" [...] was Today show co-host <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira's</b> second guest appearance as herself, having appeared in the November 8, 2007, episode [...] "Greenzo" [...] that aired during the show's second season. In the episode, the night after the economic crisis unfolded, Tracy appears on The Today Show. There, Vieira tells him that he is to blame for the panic that ensued around the city. She asks Tracy's opinion on the matter, only for Tracy to advertise TGS, the show he stars in, when and what time it airs.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} network {{version of}} the U.S. Millionaire and the subsequent primetime specials were hosted by Regis Philbin. When the syndicated version was being developed, the production team {{felt that it was}} not feasible for Philbin to continue hosting, as the show recorded four episodes in a single day, and that the team was looking for qualities in a new host: it had to be somebody who would love the contestants and be willing to root for them. Rosie O'Donnell was initially offered a hosting position on this new edition, but declined the opportunity almost immediately. Eventually <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira,</b> who had previously competed in a celebrity charity event on the original network version, was named host of the new syndicated edition.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at TGS, {{it is time}} {{to renew}} Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) contract, and Jack decides to {{approach}} the matter carefully as Tracy does not need the money he makes on the show. While negotiating Tracy's new contract, Jack mentions this fact, which comes as a shock to Tracy, who had never realized that he could survive financially without the income. After realizing that Tracy has quit the show, Jack {{must find a way to}} bring him back, after Tracy's son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), complains to Jack about how unbearable his father is to have around the house. Meanwhile, in order to get attention for herself, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) decides to cut her hair for charity as a publicity stunt. Jenna makes an appearance on NBC's Today Show, where her haircut will be broadcast. <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> asks Jenna's opinion on the news that Tracy has left TGS. At learning this, Jenna bails out on her haircut.|$|E
25|$|Cameo {{appearances}} {{have been}} made by Bob Dylan, Jeremy McKinnon, <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira,</b> the Oak Ridge Boys, George Stephanopoulos, Matt Kenseth, Steve Carell, Kip Winger, Roger Daltrey, Katie Couric and Butch Harmon.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Lobert {{appeared}} on news programs and talk shows {{in support of}} an Investigation Discovery documentary show, Hookers: Saved on the Strip, including on NBC's Today Show with <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira,</b> and HLN's The Joy Behar Show.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} Couric's announcement, <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira,</b> then {{a host of}} ABC's The View {{announced}} on that show that she would take over as Lauer's co-anchor in September. Lauer and Vieira began co-hosting together on September 13, 2006.|$|E
25|$|After announcing her resignation, <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> {{departed}} {{the program}} on June 8, 2011. Vieira's spot was filled by the program's longtime news anchor Ann Curry, appearing alongside Matt Lauer as co-host. Correspondent Natalie Morales replaced Curry as news anchor in turn, with Al Roker remaining as the weather anchor. Savannah Guthrie joined Morales and Roker as co-host of the third (9:00a.m.) hour.|$|E
25|$|To {{promote the}} 2001 movie Moulin Rouge!, he {{appeared}} on a celebrity edition of the US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? with Kelly Ripa, Kevin Sorbo, Alfre Woodard, Martin Short and Chevy Chase. Appearing as the first celebrity {{to sit in the}} hot seat, he eventually tried for $125,000, but got the answer wrong. Later in 2002, on the syndicated version, a question about the movie featured his character and <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> mentioned that Leguizamo had played Lautrec and had been on the show.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{version of}} Millionaire premiered in primetime on ABC on 16 August 1999, and was {{originally}} hosted by Regis Philbin. The original network version was the highest-rated of all television {{shows in the}} 1999–2000 season, reaching an average audience of approximately 29 million viewers, but before long, ABC overexposed the primetime series and the audience tired of the show, which ultimately grilled it to cancellation, with its final episode airing on 27 June 2002. A daily syndicated version of the programme debuted on 16 September 2002, and was launched by <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira,</b> who remained host for eleven seasons, with her final first-run episodes airing in May 2013. Later hosts after Vieira's departure included Cedric the Entertainer and Terry Crews, who each held one-season tenures as host in 2013 and 2014 respectively; and Chris Harrison, who became host {{in the fall of}} 2015.|$|E
25|$|In August 1999, ABC premiered {{a special}} series event, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, {{a game show}} based on the British program of the same title. Hosted {{throughout}} its ABC tenure by Regis Philbin, the program became a major ratings success throughout its initial summer run, which led ABC to renew Millionaire as a regular series, returning on January 18, 2000. At its peak, the program aired as much as six nights a week. Buoyed by Millionaire, during the 1999–2000 season, ABC became the first network to move from third to {{first place in the}} ratings during a single television season. Millionaire ended its run on the network's primetime lineup after three years in 2002, with Buena Vista Television relaunching the show as a syndicated program (under that incarnation's original host <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira)</b> in September of that year.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to storylines on the show, ABC released limited-edition commemorative prints depicting various iconic {{scenes from the}} series including a group photo of present and past cast members {{as well as individual}} character prints. Only 1,963 prints of the cast photo have been made, signifying the year General Hospital premiered. Members of the cast, Valentini, and Carlivati, rung the opening bell for the New York Stock Exchange on April 1 to celebrate the anniversary. Finola Hughes and Jason Thompson, who portray Anna Devane and Patrick Drake respectively, made an appearance on the April 1 and April 2 airings of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? where they performed a mock soap opera scene with host <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira.</b> Together they competed for money that would be donated to The Art of Elysium, a non-profit that encourages people in the entertainment industry to work with children suffering from serious illnesses, and managed to win $500,000.|$|E
25|$|On October 2, 2000, NBC {{expanded}} Today {{to three}} hours, {{with the addition}} of an hour from 9:00 to 10:00a.m. For its first twelve years, the format of the third hour was originally structured similarly to Todays first two hours, using the same anchors as that portion of the broadcast; separate anchors began to be used for the third hour over time, with only the news anchor (Ann Curry until 2011, then Natalie Morales) and the weather anchor (Al Roker) being shared with the main 7:00 to 9:00a.m. block – this was particularly the case during instances where Matt Lauer and/or his co-host (Katie Couric, then <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> from 2006 to 2011, Ann Curry from 2011 to 2012 and finally Savannah Guthrie during the final months of the original format) could not be present for the entire hour due to reporting assignments or personal commitments. Vieira, outside of breaking news situations, was specifically disallowed by contract from any duties in the third hour due to her hosting commitments to the syndicated version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? by Buena Vista/Disney–ABC Domestic Television.|$|E
25|$|Ann Curry's final show as co-anchor was subdued {{compared}} to the earlier departures of Katie Couric and <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira,</b> as it did not include retrospectives of Curry's 15-year run on the program or goodbye messages from colleagues and celebrities, although Curry – seated alongside Lauer, Natalie Morales and Al Roker in the couch area of the Studio 1A set – gave a tear-filled farewell message to viewers. Rumors of Curry's departure from Today began weeks before NBC formally announced that she {{would no longer be}} co-host, spurring negative press similar to that resulting from the departure of Jane Pauley and her replacement by Deborah Norville 23 years earlier, as since disproven reports suggested that Matt Lauer had a hand in the program's decision to let Curry go. Viewership declines for the program that began in the months following Curry becoming co-host precipitated in part due to public criticism over Lauer's alleged involvement in Curry's departure; loyal viewers once again began turning to the competing Good Morning America, which toppled Todays 16-year consecutive run as the top-rated morning news program during the week of April 9, 2012. The public relations problems for Lauer that resulted from the accusations, led then-executive producer Jim Bell to admit responsibility for the negative press, in defense of Lauer, in a series of interviews with The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter and the Associated Press.|$|E

However, a scene from [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] was delayed and shot on 11 July 2011, making that the last day of filming for the series. American {{television}} hostess <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> recorded her report of Churchill's return to the Buckingham Senate in front of a green screen while filming a segment for The Today Shows [...] "Anchors Abroad" [...] segment in May 2011.|$|E
500|$|... "Floyd" [...] {{featured}} cameo appearances from The Today Show correspondents <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira,</b> Lester Holt, Kathie Lee Gifford, and Hoda Kotb. In the episode, Vieira introduces Floyd and his fiancée, Kaitlin, as finalists competing to {{have their}} wedding featured on The Today Show. In one scene, Danny runs into the writers' room where Frank, Toofer, and Lutz are. He turns on the television to see Holt who reports, [...] "We're now getting reports that the toxic leaks have created a Cloverfield type monster in the building. The monster cannot detect the smell of human skin. Anyone still inside should disrobe immediately." [...] Jack calls Liz {{into his office and}} shows her that Floyd, drunk from his dinner with her, is still in the 30 Rock building, where he is shown interrupting a segment featuring Gifford and Kotb.|$|E
500|$|Don Geiss, the {{chairman}} of General Electric (GE), challenges Jack and his rivals {{to come up with}} an idea to make money [...] "from this environmentalism trend." [...] This leads to him casting an actor called Jared to play Greenzo, NBC's environmental mascot. Initially, Greenzo is a success, making a well received appearance on The Today Show with <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira.</b> Eventually, he becomes more and more self-absorbed and starts insulting the TGS staff and criticizing the staff's environmentally unfriendly habits. [...] This is until he conducts a second interview, when he begins ranting negatively about [...] "big companies and their two-faced, fat cat executives," [...] referring to GE and Jack. Angered, Jack fires Jared and tries tricking Al Gore into replacing him to no avail. Also, a drunken Greenzo shows up and tries to continue only to mess things up even more.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Butters {{appears on}} Today, a morning talk show on NBC (referred to as HBC in the episode, but with NBC's peacock logo), {{to promote his}} book. Television hosts Matt Lauer and <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> are {{featured}} in the scene, during which both vomit for a particularly long time in response {{to some of the}} more vulgar passages in The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs. Morgan Freeman, an actor known for his narration work, conducts a reading in the episode of Butters' second book, The Poop That Took a Pee. Trey Parker provided the voice of Freeman in [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs". During one scene, Butters' father can be seen reading a newspaper with a front page story about a historic health care bill passing, a reference to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was passed and signed the same week the South Park episode first aired.|$|E
500|$|... "Jackie Jormp-Jomp" [...] {{was filmed}} on February 11, 2009. This {{was the last}} time the show {{referenced}} Jenna trying to play singer Janis Joplin in a feature film. This plot first began in the January 8, 2009, episode [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] in which Jenna auditions to play the singer in a biographical movie. This was actor Todd Buonopane's third appearance as the character Jeffrey Weinerslav, an NBC Human Resource mediator. Buonopane previously appeared in the season three episodes [...] "Believe in the Stars" [...] and [...] "Cutbacks". In this episode, Today show co-host <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> is referenced, in which Kenneth reveals that Vieira made him eat an unripe banana in front of her, which Kenneth believes was sexual harassment. Vieira has played herself in the series numerous times. During the on air tribute for Jenna in [...] "Jackie Jormp-Jomp", a 1980s Cling Free commercial featuring Jane Krakowski aired as part of Jenna's youth as a child star.|$|E
500|$|... "You and I", {{written by}} Lady Gaga and {{produced}} by Gaga and Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, {{was one of}} the first songs previewed from the album. Gaga said she wrote the song in New York, while she was busy playing her old piano. The singer first played [...] "You and I" [...] at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball in June 2010. She said that the song was a bit of a [...] "rock-and-roll tune" [...] and, as such, was unlikely to be released as a single from Born This Way. She said [...] that it [...] " [...] is very dear" [...] to her heart. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet soon after, and positive response encouraged Lady Gaga to perform the song during the first concert of the North American leg of The Monster Ball Tour in Montreal. Gaga told MSNBC's <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> and Ann Curry that [...] "'You and I' was written about the most important person that I ever met", allegedly Lüc Carl, her ex-boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|Nearly 41 million US viewers watched NBC's {{coverage}} of the event. Criticism was levelled at its decision to tape-delay this broadcast, and not make a live version available even to cable and web users. [...] There were frequent interruptions by commercial breaks. Many US viewers looked for other ways to watch (such as the live BBC feed), despite both NBC and the IOC vowing {{to crack down on}} unauthorised streams. More significant criticism was levelled at NBC for cutting to a Ryan Seacrest interview with Michael Phelps during the 'memorial wall' tribute including commemoration of the victims of the 7/7 London bombings, which was seen as disrespectful and insensitive. An NBC spokesman said the network had left out that segment because its programming was [...] "tailored for the US audience". There was also criticism of commentators Matt Lauer and <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> for suggesting that the Queen had actually jumped out of a helicopter. Vieira and Lauer admitted to not knowing that Tim Berners-Lee was the inventor of the World Wide Web, as she commented [...] "If you haven't heard of him, we haven't either", before Lauer told the audience to Google him. These failings were picked up on Twitter during the broadcast with the hashtag #nbcfail. Commentary by Bob Costas and Lauer during the Parade of Nations was also criticised for their negative opinions about some countries' political environments and for leaving out information about the athletes, which was seen as [...] "smug American elitism". [...] It was noted that they spoke about some countries with [...] "outright condescension".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Greg Hernandez, Mills explained: [...] "I {{knew that she was}} going to be a trouble maker but actually knowing the writers and the producers, I knew that the character would be rounded and have dimension and that was really fun for me to play. It wasn’t one-note all the time, it was a lot of different colors." [...] Television personality Julie Chen said, [...] "The women of Knots, Michele Lee, Joan Van Ark, and Donna Mills have been compared to earth, wind, and fire, with Donna Mills bringing the heat as Abby, the conniving vixen that everybody loved to hate." [...] According to Mills, many people were wary of meeting her in person because they assumed she would be like Abby. She said, [...] "They were very trepedacious about what I was going to do." [...] Mike Celizic of NBC said that her character was [...] "the archetypal predatory female", while <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> said [...] "even the bad girl could show a tender side every once in a while", in reference to her daughter's on-screen drug addiction. It was this very storyline that showed Abby at her most vulnerable and human, a story which audiences recall as perhaps one of her most desperate and motherly of moments. In addition to that, Abby also helped Val get her kidnapped babies back, even though she was blamed she said she [...] "could never do a thing like that to anyone". When Karen and Mack began to have some problems in their marriage and Karen distanced herself from Mack, Abby confronted Karen aggressively and told her she was wrong for doing so to him.|$|E

2500|$|Philbin was the {{original}} host of the U.S. version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, an ABC game show that had its roots in Britain. Millionaire was a big ratings success in its 1999 debut, when it was intended as an occasional special series. ABC aired Millionaire as a regular series with frequent episodes, but its viewership slowly declined. After Millionaire was canceled, it was retooled in 2002 as a syndicated series hosted by <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira,</b> which continues today. ABC brought back Millionaire in 2004 with Philbin, retitled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire, a related series that was aired on a more limited basis. Philbin had appeared in 11 episodes of {{a special edition of}} Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, which started on August 9, 2009, 10th anniversary of the show. He also was a celebrity contestant in this version. [...] Millionaire, in its syndicated format, uses guest hosts for selected weeks during the season and Philbin hosted a week of episodes that aired in November 2009, coinciding with his 2009 surgery.|$|E
2500|$|The visit {{appeared}} {{to be part of}} an attempt at getting Spears and her parents to take part in an [...] "intervention" [...] on the Dr. Phil television show. [...] Immediately after the visit, McGraw issued public statements about Spears' situation that Spears' family spokeswoman Lou Taylor said violated their family trust in McGraw. [...] "This is another example of a trust being betrayed", Taylor told Today co-host <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira.</b> [...] "Rather than helping the family’s situation, the celebrity psychologist caused additional damage", she said. [...] Several mental health care professionals criticized McGraw for his actions; however, fellow TV psychologist [...] Joyce Brothers defended McGraw. [...] It was reported that a psychologist {{filed a complaint with the}} California Board of Psychology (BOP), alleging that McGraw had practiced psychology without a license and had violated doctor-patient privilege by discussing Spears' case with the media. [...] A copy of the complaint appeared in the media, but there is no way to verify whether or not it was actually submitted to the BOP. The BOP does not disclose that information unless an investigation is opened. [...] Martin Greenberg, a former BOP President, said on the Today Show that this incident was not a matter that the law covers or would be concerned about.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, O'Donnell {{replaced}} <b>Meredith</b> <b>Vieira</b> as a co-host and moderator of The View, {{a daytime}} women-oriented talk show. Star Jones, a co-host on the show, quit, with some speculating Jones's conservative views {{would be in}} constant tension with O'Donnell's more liberal counterpoint. O'Donnell had also disputed Jones's route of rapid weight loss, alluding {{that it must have}} been through gastric bypass surgery, rather than dieting and exercise alone as Jones had insisted, which also fed speculation about certain tension between the two. (Jones later confirmed that surgery was involved.) O'Donnell is credited with keeping the show's [...] "buzz factor up". She is also credited with making it more news-focused, though it still embraced the [...] "fluff" [...] of daytime TV talk shows (celebrities, fashion, and food). Despite an overall downward trend for most daytime broadcast shows, ratings rose by 27% during O'Donnell's first year on The View. The show was the fourth-most-watched in all of daytime in the key demographic of women ages 18–49 and scored record ratings in the total viewer category with an average of 3.4 million viewers—up 15% versus the same time in 2005. O'Donnell moderated the opening [...] "Hot Topics" [...] portion of the show, where news items were discussed. O'Donnell gave the show a more political slant, and she and fellow comic Joy Behar often gave strong opinions against former President Bush's domestic and foreign policies, including the Iraq War. As a conservative counterpoint, Elisabeth Hasselbeck would usually support the Bush administration's policies and the two would get into an adversarial give-and-take.|$|E
