In orthodox neoclassical synthesis economics, {{there are two}} main kinds of recognized economic thinking - <b>micro-economics,</b> which focuses on the action of individual buyers and sellers responding to signals sent by price to set production and distribution of effort, and macroeconomics, which focuses on how whole economies go through cycles of activity, and how different large aggregate sectors relate to each other.|$|E

Clark: [...] "The science adapted … is economic Darwinism. … Though {{the process was}} savage, the outlook which it afforded was not wholly evil.

This was the fundament to develop the theory which made him famous: Given competition and homogeneous factors of production labor and capital, the repartition of the social product will be according to the productivity of the last physical input of units of labor and capital. This theorem is a cornerstone of neoclassical <b>micro-economics.</b> Clark stated it in 1891 and more elaborated 1899 in The Distribution of Wealth. The same theorem was formulated later independently by John Atkinson Hobson (1891) and Philip Wicksteed (1894).

40|$|AbstractThis paper applies {{equilibrium}} {{analysis in}} <b>micro-economics</b> to analyze a stable structure {{in a model}} of human society. The structure is observed {{in the study of}} the distribution of information. It forms a three-layered hierarchy. These layers are called brains, gatekeepers and end users. The three-layer structure is widely observed in a variety of research fields. For example, in computer networks, core gateways correspond to brains, stub gateways behave like gatekeepers, and local networks are end users. The three-layer model is considered to be an essential extension of the popular “client-server” concept in computer science. This paper calculates the supply and demand curves in <b>micro-economics</b> to show how the equilibrium is established. The law of diminishing utility is utilized to represent the distribution of information or knowledge. The calculations are straightforward if the dependence of the end users on the other layers is taken into account. The results can explain many properties of the three-layer model...|$|E

In this report some basic theory from <b>micro-economics</b> is outlined. It is then shown how that economic theory can be mapped onto a distributed system. As a concrete example of the mapping in action an instance of the load balancing problem is solved. The layout of the report is as follows. Firstly a more detailed ration [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Compares Stackelberg’s Grundlagen der theoretischen Volkswirtschaftslehre with a {{standard}} modern micro-economic textbook. Reveals some confusing shortcomings in the English translation. Focuses on unique peculiarities of Stackelberg’s analysis of the price formation on imperfect markets. Suggests {{that it might be}} an effective approach in a course on <b>micro-economics</b> to combine a modern textbook with Grundlagen since they would complement each other in a number of aspects: at least, but very important, in the different emphasis of the time aspect. Finds that in general the English translation of Grundlagen by A. T. Peacock is of an outstanding quality. Mistakes are rare and hardly ever confusing, with the exceptions related to the perfect market and pure competition concepts. So, if one uses the English translation of Grundlagen as a supplement in a course on <b>micro-economics</b> one may devote some attention to these concepts. It is quite possible that Stackelberg, at least in Grundlagen, is not convinced of the potential compatibility of Chamberlin’s theory of monopolistic competition and the Edgeworth-Bertrand oligopoly theory with the method he proposes to derive at “peculiarities of price formation in the imperfect market”. Hence the absence of any reference in Grundlagen to these theories may not be at all accidental. Economic theory, Foreign languages, Literature, Microeconomics...|$|E
