5000|$|The {{experiment}} {{contends that}} there is no way of aggregating utility which can circumvent the conclusion that all units should be given to a utility monster, because every different system has a monster and defeating one utility monster creates another. For example, in Rawls' <b>maximin</b> or difference <b>principle,</b> <b>maximin</b> sets a group's aggregate utility as that of the being with least utility. Thus, giving units to the utility monster fails to change the group's utility unless the utility monster has the least utility. Even if the utility monster has the least utility, maximin would only prefer allocating units to the monster until it catches up with the member that has next-to-least utility. This would defeat the [...] "happy" [...] utility monster of average utility. But if the person who has the least utility gains only a tiny amount of utility from each unit of resources, they may never catch up with the next person, so they can similarly consume all of the resources in the world. It can be shown that all consequentialist systems based on maximizing a global function are subject to utility monsters.|$|R

50|$|Rawls posits {{two basic}} {{capacities}} that the individuals would know themselves to possess. First, each individual {{knows that he}} has the capacity to form, pursue, and revise a conception of the good, or life plan. Exactly what sort of conception of the good this is, however, the individual does not yet know. It may be, for example, religious or secular, but at the start, the individual in the original position does not know which. Second, each individual understands him or herself to have the capacity to develop a sense of justice and a generally effective desire to abide by it. Knowing only these two features of themselves, the group will deliberate in order to design a social structure, during which each person will seek his or her maximal advantage. The idea is that proposals that we would ordinarily think of as unjust - such as that blacks or women {{should not be allowed to}} hold public office - will not be proposed, in this Rawls' original position, because it would be irrational to propose them, the reason is simple, one does not know whether he himself would be a woman or a black person.

40|$|Rank-ordering of {{individuals}} or objects on multiple criteria has many important practical applications. A reasonably representative composite rank ordering of multi-attribute objects/individuals or multi-dimensional points is often {{obtained by the}} Principal Component Analysis, although much inferior but computationally convenient methods also are frequently used. However, such rank ordering – even the one based on the Principal Component Analysis – may not be optimal. This has been demonstrated by several numerical examples. To solve this problem, the Ordinal Principal Component Analysis was suggested some time back. However, this approach cannot deal with various types of alternative schemes of rank ordering, mainly due to its dependence on the method of solution by the constrained integer programming. In this paper we propose an alternative method of solution, namely by the Particle Swarm Optimization. A computer program in FORTRAN {{to solve the problem}} has also been provided. The suggested method is notably versatile and can take care of various schemes of rank ordering, norms and types or measures of correlation. The versatility of the method and its capability to obtain the most representative composite rank ordering of multi-attribute objects or multi-dimensional points have been demonstrated by several numerical examples. It has also been found that rank ordering based on maximization of the sum of absolute values of the correlation coefficients of composite rank scores with its constituent variables has robustness, but it may have multiple optimal solutions. Thus, while it solves the one problem, it gives rise to the other problem. The overall ranking of objects by <b>maximin</b> correlation <b>principle</b> performs better if the composite rank scores are obtained by direct optimization with respect to the individual ranking scores. ...|$|R

It is meant to unify evaluations and comparisons of social states with populations of possibly different sizes with various characteristics. The universal social ordering not only evaluates policy options for a given population but also compares social welfare across populations, as in international or intertemporal comparisons of living standards. It also makes it possible to evaluate policy options which affect the size of the population or the preferences of its members. We study how to extend the theory of social choice in order to select such orderings on a rigorous axiomatic basis.

This is the central issue underlying current discussions of sustainability. There is no denying that human activity remains completely dependent on natural resources and on the larger environment in which we function, so sustainable human systems require careful management of natural resources over the long term. This dissertation contributes {{to the understanding of}} sustainable economic development. To be specific, it focuses on certain renewable natural resources that are thought to be a key element of sustainability. The dissertation consists of three separate studies: two empirical case studies and one theoretical modeling study.

40|$|Distributional analysis, a key input {{in policy}} {{formulation}} and evaluation, involves {{a comparison of}} alternative distributions of the living standard associated with different social arrangements. There is an intimate relation between development and evaluation {{to the extent that}} the domain of development hinges on the conception of the dimensions of the living standard that are worth promoting. The purpose of this paper therefore is to fit distributional impact analysis within the logic of social evaluation, and to illustrate its implementation in EViews using data from the 1994 Integrated Household Survey in Guinea. Any evaluative framework is characterized by a criterion which consists essentially of the specification of objects of value and the aggregation rule underpinning the formulation of overall judgments.

Accordingly, this paper emphasizes a poverty-focused approach to social evaluation.

40|$|This Article 2 ̆ 7 s {{normative}} claim - that a rule allowing subsequent {{challenges to}} class action settlements is compelled by our basic intuitions {{of fairness and}} justice when class members could not conceivably have agreed to the arrangement had they been present but not known their precise position in the class - builds on the Rawlsian construct of fairness {{as the product of}} (hypothetical) decision-making in an 2 ̆ 2 original position, 2 ̆ 2 behind a 2 ̆ 2 veil of ignorance, 2 ̆ 2 and the economics of human decision-making under conditions of uncertainty. This approach suggests that certain types of settlements in both high-individual-stakes/toxic torts/personal injury class actions and small-individual-stakes/consumer fraud class actions should be subject to subsequent challenge. First, this combined Rawlsian/economics analysis strongly suggests that all class settlements that provide for the possibility that any class members will receive negative relief, as in the Bank Boston litigation, are unfair and should be subject to challenge on adequacy of representation grounds. Second, with regard to high-individual-stakes class actions, the approach also suggests that settlements that create the possibility that some class members will receive no relief always should be subject to subsequent challenges. Third, again in high-individual-stakes class actions, subsequent challenges should be permitted with respect to settlements that provided all class members some relief, but that grossly deviated from a principle of equal payment for equal harms without investing administrative cost savings in the improvement of the position of the most severely-injured such that the most-severely injured receive more than they would have under an equal- compensation-for-equal-injuries formula. Fourth, even in small individual stakes litigation, subsequent challenges should be permitted to settlements that provided for the possibility of providing zero compensation to any class members or that deviated from an equal-compensation-for-equal-injuries approach compensating without thereby reaping significant administrative cost savings that are dedicated to increasing the overall compensation pool for class members. The essence of the Rawlsian approach is a thought experiment regarding the ordering of society as a whole. In the thought experiment, Rawls postulates the presence of human beings under certain conditions - 2 ̆ 2 original position 2 ̆ 2 conditions - and then reflects on what arrangements or rules those individuals would agree to as fair for the distribution of goods and entitlements in the society as a whole. The conditions Rawls sets for his thought experiment - individual decision-making, ignorance on the part of each individual as to their morally irrelevant or contingent characteristics beyond the veil, very high stakes for individual welfare and life prospects for the decision-makers, a generally shared moral sense of the fundamental equality of human beings - readily translate from original position (persons deciding on the rules for social ordering as a whole) to the toxic tort/products liability class action original position, in which class members must choose a distribution regime for compensation for possible current and future cases of disabling or even fatal diseases, conditions, or injuries. Thus, if persons in Rawls 2 ̆ 7 original position adhere to a <b>maximin</b> <b>principle</b> of avoiding worst possible outcomes, and that adherence deserves normative weight, we should expect that class members in toxic tort/products liability cases behind a veil of ignorance will adhere to a maximin approach, and we should accord normative weight to that adherence. The Article does not rely solely on the extension of the Rawlsian original position thought experiment to the class action context, however. One of the predictions of neoclassical economic theory, as well as a basic finding of behavioral/experimental/empirical economics is risk aversion in human decision-making {{in the absence of an}} ability to self- or third-party-insure against bad outcomes. Other findings are an aversion to unequal distributions of wealth and other goods absent some objective justification for inequality, and an aversion to prospective losses (as opposed to gains or foregone gains). These well-established findings, in and of themselves, suggest that settlements of the sort at issue in Stephenson and Homeside could not have garnered the agreement of class members had they been able to give or deny their consent. In addition, surveys I conducted of first-year law students demonstrate a strong hostility to settlements that entail the risk that a class member might be left without any relief for severe injuries, and a strong predisposition toward settlements that ensure equal outcomes for equally harmed class members...|$|E
