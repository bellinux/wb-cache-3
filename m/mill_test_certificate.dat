40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the {{diagnostic}} accuracy of the commonly used provocative tests in the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis (LE). Cozen’s <b>test,</b> <b>Mills</b> <b>test</b> and Maudsley test are most widely used. Till date no studies have been reported on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography serves as a gold standard tool in the diagnosis of LE. Thirty subjects participated in the study. Baseline measurements of pain severity, elbow joint mobility, hand grip strength and three provocative tests were recorded by the principal investigator. A second investigator accompanied the subjects for musculoskeletal ultrasonography who was blinded of the test results. The thickness of common extensor tendon, echo texture and lateral epicondyle bony contour was measured. The test results of the three provocative tests with ultrasonographic findings were analyzed. The sensitivity for Cozen’s test, Maudsley <b>test</b> and <b>Mills</b> <b>test</b> was found to be 84 %, 88 % and 53 % respectively. The specificity for Cozen’s Maudsley and <b>Mills</b> <b>test</b> was found to be 0 %, 0 % and 100 % respectively. <b>Mills</b> <b>test</b> showed significant area under receiver operator curve (ROC) i. e.

The size of coal lumps can be reduced in ball <b>mill</b> <b>tests</b> by two mechanisms (a) volume breakage and/or (b) surface breakage. The degradation characteristics of both types of coal were the same but the rate of degradation was higher in South Blackwater coal than Ensham coal. There was a distinct difference for degradation rate between the three different sizes of South Blackwater coal in the partially-cushioned coal but the rate of degradation increased with tumbling time. The degradation rate was higher in ball <b>mill</b> <b>tests</b> with “partially-cushioned coal” than tests with “cushioned coal”. The percentage of fines (- 16. 0 mm) generation also increased with the tumbling time. The fines (- 16. 0 mm) generation was higher in the ball <b>mill</b> <b>tests</b> with “partially-cushioned coal” than tests with “cushioned coal”.

40|$|The {{influence}} of strain hardening on elastic-plastic frame instability {{has become more}} critical since the introduction of modern design codes (e. g. Eurocode 3 : part 1. 1), which require a much more rigorous treatment of frame instability than {{was the case with}} earlier codes. At the same time, it has become apparent that portal frames are much more sensitive to second-order effects than was previously believed. Both the simplicity and economy of plastic design are endangered and there is renewed interest in defining the extent to which advantage can be taken of strain hardening with modem steel qualities and section shapes. This paper provides an up to date assessment of the strain hardening factor that may be incorporated into computer programs for second-order elastic-plastic analysis. A survey of tensile <b>tests</b> (<b>mill</b> <b>tests)</b> is presented which shows that the strain hardening behaviour is independent of material thickness and steel grade. This allows a generalisation of the stress-strain relationship for hot rolled steel to be defined. A modelling technique is presented that allows the non-linear moment-deformation behaviour of beams to be accurately predicted using <b>mill</b> <b>test</b> data. Finally, results from the survey of <b>mill</b> <b>tests</b> are combined with the moment-deformation model to estimate values of the strain hardening factor to be used during elastic-plastic design...|$|R
