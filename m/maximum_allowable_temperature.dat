Heat transfer {{of a single}} plain receiver pipe exposed to concentrated solar energy was modelled along the flow path of the heat transfer fluid. Three different working fluids, molten salt, sodium, and supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2) were considered in the case studies with different design conditions. The optimized ideal heat transfer condition was identified through fast iterative heat transfer calculations solving for all relevant radiation, conduction and convection heat transfers throughout the entire discretized tubular receiver. The ideal condition giving the best performance was obtained by finding the highest acceptable solar energy flux optimally distributed to meet different constraint(s), such as <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> material <b>temperature</b> of receiver, <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> film <b>temperature</b> of heat transfer fluid, and <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> stress of receiver pipe material.

40|$|Gas turbine {{cooling system}} design is {{constrained}} by a <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> wall <b>temperature</b> (dictated by {{the material and}} the life requirements of the component), minimum coolant mass flow rate (the requirement to minimize cycle-efficiency cost), and uniform wall temperature (to reduce thermal stresses). These three design requirements {{form the basis of}} an iterative design process. The relationship between the requirements has received little discussion in the literature, despite being of interest from both a theoretical and a practical viewpoint. In this paper, we consider the optimum cooling system for parts with both internal and film cooling. We show analytically that the coolant mass flow rate is minimized when the wall temperature is uniform and equal to the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> wall <b>temperature.</b> Thus, we show that achieving uniform wall temperature achieves minimum coolant flow rate, and vice versa. The purpose is to clarify the interplay between two design requirements that are often discussed separately in the literature. The penalty (in terms of coolant mass flow) associated with cooling nonisothermal components is quantified. We show that a typical high pressure nozzle guide vane (HPNGV) operating isothermally at the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> wall <b>temperature</b> requires two-thirds the coolant of a typical nonisothermal vane. The optimum coolant exit temperature is also considered. It is shown analytically that the optimum coolant exit temperature depends on the balance between the mean adiabatic film cooling effectiveness, the nondimensional mass flow rate, and the Biot number of the thermal barrier coating (TBC). For the large majority of gas turbine cooling systems (e. g., a typical HPNGV) it is shown that the optimum coolant exit temperature is equal to the local wall temperature at the point of injection. For a small minority of systems (e. g., long effusion cooling systems operating at low mass flow rates), it is shown that the coolant exit temperature should be minimized. An approximation relating the wall/film properties, the nondimensional mass flow, and the overall cooling effectiveness is derived. It is used to estimate the effect of Biot number (TBC and metal), heat transfer coefficient (HTC) ratio, and film properties on the performance of a typical HPNGV and effusion cooling system.

40|$|The {{operation}} of an indirectly cooled semibatch reactor {{in which an}} exothermic reaction occurs is usually considered safe if the characteristic time of the coreactant dosing {{is much higher than}} the characteristic times of all the other phenomena involved (chemical reaction and mass transfer), so that the conversion rate is controlled by the coreactant supply itself. Such operating conditions imply a small accumulation of the coreactant in the system and are characterized by a temperature evolution which quickly approaches a target temperature and remains close to it throughout the dosing period, {{at the end of which}} the conversion is almost complete. The so-called boundary diagrams are useful tools for identifying safe operating conditions without solving the mathematical model of the reactor. However, avoiding accumulation phenomena can be not sufficient for classifying a set of operating conditions as thermally safe when the maximum temperature reached by the system under normal operation exceeds a <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>temperature</b> (which can be related either to safety problems, when dangerous decomposition reactions can be triggered, or to productivity problems, when side reactions can significantly lower the product yield above a given threshold temperature).

These new diagrams, involving the same dimensionless parameters used for the representation of the boundary diagrams, allow determining—for a given set of operating conditions—the maximum temperature increase with respect to the initial reactor temperature which can be expected to occur during normal operation. This information can be compared with the <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>temperature</b> for the reacting mixture.
