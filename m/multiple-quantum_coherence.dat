40|$|Spin-locking of spin I = 3 / 2 and I = 5 / 2 nuclei in the {{presence}} of small resonance offset and second-order quadrupolar interactions has been investigated using both exact and approximate theoretical and experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approaches. In {{the presence}} of second-order quadrupolar interactions, we show that the initial rapid dephasing that arises from the noncommutation of the state prepared by the first pulse and the spin-locking Hamiltonian gives rise to tensor components of the spin density matrix that are antisymmetric with respect to inversion, in addition to those symmetric with respect to inversion that are found when only a first-order quadrupolar interaction is considered. We also find that spin-locking of <b>multiple-quantum</b> <b>coherence</b> in a static solid is much more sensitive to resonance offset than that of single-quantum coherence and show that good spin-locking of <b>multiple-quantum</b> <b>coherence</b> can still be achieved if the resonance offset matches the second-order shift of the <b>multiple-quantum</b> <b>coherence</b> in the appropriate reference frame. Under magic angle spinning (MAS) conditions, and in the "adiabatic" limit, we demonstrate that rotor-driven interconversion of central-transition single- and three-quantum coherences for a spin I = 3 / 2 nucleus can be best achieved by performing the spin-locking on resonance with the three-quantum coherence in the three-quantum frame. Finally, in the "sudden" MAS limit, we show that spin I = 3 / 2 spin-locking behavior is generally similar to that found in static solids, except when the central-transition nutation rate matches a multiple of the MAS rate and a variety of rotary resonance phenomena are observed depending on the internal spin interactions present.

The approach is based on closely analogous methods in nuclear magnetic resonance, in which multiple phase-coherent fields are used to drive successive transitions such that <b>multiple-quantum</b> <b>coherences</b> can be accessed and probed. A spatiotemporal femtosecond pulse shaping technique has been used to overcome the challenge of control over multiple, noncollinear phase-coherent optical Fields in the experimental geometries that are used to isolate selected signal contributions through wavevector matching.
