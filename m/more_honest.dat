While there, Michael and Jan make their relationship public, Karen makes Jim uncomfortable by pointing out all of her ex-boyfriends in attendance, and Dwight inspects the home. Meanwhile, {{the rest of the}} office goes to a bar and Pam tries to be <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> with Roy.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the {{character}} she fantasized about the most, the last book in the series, Beebo Brinker, published in 1962, was Bannon's prequel to Odd Girl Out. It follows Beebo around Greenwich Village ten years before she meets Laura in I Am a Woman. Beebo gets off the bus from her rural hometown into New York City to find a waiting friend in Jack, and to discover herself. She begins {{an affair with a}} famous and fading movie star, and follows her to California, only to return to be <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> about what she wants in her life.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, the {{municipal}} government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating {{to share the}} spoils of political office. In 1881 the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians; the Democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> candidate. The party leaders approached Cleveland, and he agreed to run for Mayor of Buffalo, provided {{that the rest of}} the ticket was to his liking. When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket, Cleveland accepted the nomination. Cleveland was elected mayor with 15,120 votes, as against 11,528 for Milton C. Beebe, his opponent. He took office January 2, 1882.|$|E

5|$|The Actor's Children was {{released}} with enthusiasm and positive reviews in trade publications. The Moving Picture World reviews would be favorable and without much criticism, even calling the acting convincing. A <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> review in The New York Dramatic Mirror {{was written by}} a reviewer who {{was pleased with the}} production, but offered criticism about the production's weaker aspects. The reviewer found there to be too much emphasis on the unimportant parts and a lack of emotion from the actors, and the child actors performance was faulted by repeatedly looking at the camera. Critical reception of the film may not have been entirely neutral for a number of reasons. Edwin Thanhouser was a well-liked gentleman who had many friends in the Patents Company that likely wanted him to succeed. Furthermore, writers in the magazines hoped that Independents would succeed and challenge the Patents Company's stranglehold on the industry. Also, film critics and reviewers of the era would balance the negativity of even the worst films with some favorable aspects. Even without any ulterior motives, the film may have been worthy of a favorable review.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} manner Friends avoid haggling over prices. They simply set a fixed price that they {{considered}} fair, which went against the custom of earlier times, but was felt by them to be simpler and <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> (this practice is generally considered more {{a part of the}} Testimony of Integrity than a part of the Testimony of Simplicity).|$|E
25|$|According to Rouse Ball, the {{contempt}} that his <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> colleagues felt for his conduct {{in the matter}} may be read {{in the pages of}} Paul Louis Courier. His knowledge was useful on the numerous scientific commissions on which he served, and, says Rouse Ball, probably accounts for the manner in which his political insincerity was overlooked.|$|E

25|$|Divorce is one {{response}} to marital infidelity. Another {{would be to}} seek couple's therapy or counseling. With time to heal and the mutual goal of rebuilding the relationship, some couples emerge from infidelity with a stronger and <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> relationship than before. Relationship counseling can help put an affair into perspective, explore underlying relationship problems, teach how to rebuild and strengthen a relationship, and avoid divorce – {{if that is the}} mutual goal.|$|E
25|$|The CAGE is {{designed}} as a self-report questionnaire. It is obvious to the person what the questions are about.

Responses also may be <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> when the form is completed online, on a computer, or in other anonymous formats.|$|E

25|$|Johnson's {{vision of}} a <b>more</b> <b>honest,</b> {{efficient}} and humane city government inspired Cleveland politics for decades to come. The years that followed his death were perhaps the most creative period in the city's history, in which it perfected excellent library and school systems, while completing the Group Plan's public buildings on the Mall and the ensemble of educational and cultural institutions at University Circle. The city was frequently cited as a model in many fields of government efficiency and social reform.|$|E
500|$|In early 1965, {{while they}} were his guests for dinner, Lennon and Harrison's dentist {{secretly}} added LSD to their coffee. Lennon described the experience: [...] "It was just terrifying, but it was fantastic. I was pretty stunned {{for a month or}} two." [...] He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966. He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly, declaring in a magazine interview that [...] "it opened my eyes" [...] and [...] "made me a better, <b>more</b> <b>honest,</b> more tolerant member of society".|$|E
500|$|Initially {{reluctant}} to try LSD, McCartney eventually {{did so in}} late 1966, and took his second [...] "acid trip" [...] in March 1967, with Lennon, after a Sgt. Pepper studio session. He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, [...] "It opened my eyes... made me a better, <b>more</b> <b>honest,</b> more tolerant member of society." [...] He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, {{along with the other}} Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in The Times, which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.|$|E

500|$|Rodman {{admitted}} {{his frequent}} transgressions, but asserted {{that he lived}} his own life and thus a <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> life than most other people: [...] "I just took {{the chance to be}} my own man... I just said: 'If you don't like it, kiss my ass.' ...Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves. They look at me and see someone trying to do that... I'm the guy who's showing people, hey, it's all right to be different. And I think they feel: 'Let's go and see this guy entertain us.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{often have}} {{difficulty}} defining the Church. Most commentators have placed the Church {{in the category}} of [...] "joke religions", which is usually seen as a pejorative description. Kirby sees this categorization as partially accurate because irony is an essential aspect of their faith. Other terms used to describe the Church include [...] "faux cult", [...] " [...] cult", [...] "satirical pseudoreligion", [...] "sophisticated joke religion", [...] "anti-religion religion", and [...] "high parody of cultdom". Members of the Church, however, have consistently maintained that they practice a religion. Stang has described the group as both [...] "satire and a real stupid religion", and he contends that it is <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> about its nature than are other religions.|$|E
500|$|While some of {{the members}} lacked {{conventional}} musical skills, they were [...] "politically very right" [...] and quickly adapted to improvising. Because of the nature of free improvisation, the women were able to perform together without concerns about competency. Georgie Born said that FIG functioned very differently from a mixed group: [...] "when you are playing with men, {{there is an element of}} competition; they tend to feel that there is a threat from women. In an all-women band we are released from that kind of pressure." [...] Born added that without men, women are <b>more</b> <b>honest</b> and open with each other, and are more receptive to what each member of the group is doing.|$|E

50|$|Produced with Alan Rankine, {{it was a}} <b>more</b> involving, <b>honest</b> set {{than its}} predecessor, {{offering}} warmer songs and arrangements (and live drums) in place of programmed rhythm tracks, though without entirely abandoning club appeal.

500|$|The band began {{receiving}} {{offers from}} various record labels, including Universal, Triple Crown Records, and Drive-Thru Records, and performed at industry showcases. Meanwhile, Brett Gurewitz, founder of Epitaph Records, {{learned of the}} band {{from members of the}} group Matchbook Romance. He attended four of their shows in Los Angeles that Pierre later regarded as among his worst, as his voice was poor from constant touring. While they were interested in Universal, they chose to sign to Epitaph as they felt the contract was less restrictive and <b>more</b> <b>honest.</b> Eli Janney from Girls Against Boys helped the band secure management and a lawyer. Motion City became part of a slew of Epitaph signings, including Matchbook Romance, Scatter the Ashes and From First to Last, amid concerns the Southern California label had strayed too far from its roots, and seemed [...] "a little too emo." ...|$|E
500|$|The Persona 3 protagonist was {{the first}} {{character}} Shigenori Soejima designed for the game. Early designs of the character made him look mature and collected since the artist viewed him as a [...] "cliche cool guy." [...] Soejima took longer to design the protagonist than any other character as the game's other characters would be made to complement his design. In Art of Persona 3, Soejima remarked that [...] "Initially, he looked <b>more</b> <b>honest,</b> like an ordinary, handsome young man. But, I worked to achieve greater ambiguity in his expression." [...] He further noted that the character managed to have a [...] "hidden coolness." [...] In retrospect, {{he found that the}} character was not ambiguous enough and thus when creating the [...] protagonist, Soejima made Yu Narukami with the idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions.|$|E
500|$|The album's songs placed {{emphasis}} on vocals and melody over the heavy guitar riffs {{that were found}} on the band's earlier LPs. It also features a rawer sound than Soundgarden's previous album Superunknown, as the band members produced the record themselves. Cornell summed up the changes with [...] "What we've lost in sonic precision we've gained so much in terms of feeling." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that Soundgarden [...] "retained their ambitious song structures, neo-psychedelic guitar textures, and winding melodies but haven't dressed them up with detailed production." [...] The songs vary in tempo throughout the course of the album, with Thayil describing the album as having a [...] "dual nature". He stated, [...] "It keeps listeners on their toes and lets them know they're not getting the same album over and over." [...] Shepherd called the album [...] "the most accurate picture of what Soundgarden actually sounds like", stating, [...] "It's way more raw. It's way <b>more</b> <b>honest.</b> It's way more 'responsible.'" ...|$|E
