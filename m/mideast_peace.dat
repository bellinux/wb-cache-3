2500|$|In June 2009, {{reacting}} to [...] President Obama Barack's Cairo Address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared {{for the first}} time conditional support for a future Palestinian state but insisted that the Palestinians would need to make reciprocal gestures and accept several principles: recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people;demilitarization of a future Palestinian state, along with additional security guarantees, including defensible borders for Israel; Palestinian would also have to accept that Jerusalem [...] would remain the united capital of Israel, and [...] renounce their claim to a right of return. He also claimed that Israeli settlements retain a right to growth and expansion in the West Bank. Palestinians rejected the proposals immediately. Later that year, the White House announced that it would host a three-way meeting between President Obama, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and President Mahmoud Abbas, in an effort {{to lay the groundwork for}} renewed negotiations on <b>Mideast</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, President George H. W. Bush began preparations for a <b>mideast</b> war. <b>Peace</b> activists {{were starting to}} find their groove just before the Gulf War was launched in February 1991, with well-attended rallies, especially on the west coast. However, the ground war was over {{in less than a}} week. A lopsided Allied victory and a media-incited wave of patriotic sentiment washed over the protest movement before it could develop traction.|$|R

5000|$|North Korea's Foreign Ministry {{condemned}} Israel {{for having}} [...] "mercilessly {{killed or wounded}} dozens of civilians aboard the boats". It went on to call the attack a [...] "crime against humanity perpetrated at the U.S. connivance and under its patronage and a blatant challenge to the Arabs including Palestinians and the <b>Mideast</b> <b>peace</b> process". The statement also [...] "expresses full support and solidarity with {{the cause of the}} Palestinians and other Arab peoples".|$|E
50|$|Joe Comartin was the MP for Windsor—St. Clair and the {{environment}} critic {{at the time of}} the election. His election in 2000 had been the first federal win for the NDP in Ontario in ten years, and he helped add a second Ontario seat with Brian Masse's win in the neighbouring Windsor West in 2002. His emphases included <b>Mideast</b> <b>peace</b> and support for UN resolutions on Palestine, and his campaign reached out prominently to the Muslim Canadian community.|$|E
5000|$|The {{position}} {{is a difficult}} one to hold. [...] The liaison must be in contact with Jewish organization leaders who believe {{that they should be}} able to interact with White House policymakers as the need arises. [...] The liaison must also gather consensus from, and represent the Administration to, an American Jewish community that is deeply divided on many major issues, including foreign policy, such as the method of achieving <b>Mideast</b> <b>peace,</b> and domestic policy, like school vouchers and aid to parochial schools.|$|E
50|$|Local news, editorial, {{advertising}} and design is generated mainly in-house, with additional news and feature contributions from syndicated columnists, news services and occasionally freelance writers. The editorial {{position has been}} independent; politically, its stance has changed on some issues. Following {{the signing of the}} Oslo Accords in Washington in 1993, for example, the paper remained cautiously optimistic about <b>Mideast</b> <b>peace</b> {{even in the face of}} Palestinian violence against Israel. But by 2007, it was in the camp of those who question the two-state solution.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} in Kabul {{with a reporter}} from the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronoth, Afghan President Hamid Karzai hinted at a desire to establish formal ties with Israel.

He revealed that he had met Shimon Peres several times, and called him a [...] "dear man, a real warrior for peace." ...|$|E

Spector appeared as a witness in early 2008 at the Canadian House of Commons Ethics Committee's hearings on relations between Mulroney and German-Canadian lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber, which is formally known as {{the review of the}} Airbus settlement.

5000|$|USA Today said [...] "In {{practical}} terms, {{the argument}} hardly matters. By opting for {{an assault on}} the six-ship convoy trying to break a 3-year-old blockade of Gaza, Israel handed its opponents a victory they could not have achieved by other means and simultaneously left itself, the United States and the struggling <b>Mideast</b> <b>peace</b> process with a huge problem.... Israel, however, remained adamant, implausibly casting the flotilla organizers as a mortal threat." [...] They drew parallels saying [...] "The pity is that the Israelis so lacked the same prescience, remarkable in light of their own history. No event was more important to the formation of Israel than the confrontation 63 years ago between the ship Exodus...." [...] They believed that as a [...] "smart solution to the current impasse.... Israel should allow humanitarian aid into Gaza on the condition that cargo first be inspected for weapons. Palestinians should accept that restriction. The United States and United Nations should try to ensure its enforcement." ...|$|E

40|$|I am {{not here}} this evening {{to go through the}} entire history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That would require an entire course. But I do {{want to talk about the}} current {{situation}} with 260 Palestinians shot down dead like dogs in the street by the Israeli army with weapons provided by the United States government and the United States taxpayers [...] that means you and me. It appeared this summer that, if you listened to the news media, we were on the verge of peace; and now, there is a horrible war. What happened? And why? We have to go back to the peace negotiations that were initiated by President Bush in 1991 starting in Madrid and then continuing in Washington, D. C. It was my great honor to have served as the Legal Adviser to the Palestinian Delegation to the <b>Mideast</b> <b>Peace</b> Negotiations. And in the Fall of 1992, they asked me to analyze the first Israeli Peace Proposal that was given to them in the negotiations. When negotiations started in the Fall of 1991, nothing happened. They were under Shamir of the Likhud party, then Prime Minister of Israel. There were no reasonable good-faith negotiations at all. Indeed, he admitted that his whole objective was to stall for the next te...|$|E
