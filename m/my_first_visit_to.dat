25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all know {{something}} about my trip and {{the condition of the}} country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> <b>to</b> a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E

40|$|My {{interest}} in the subject of this thesis dates back ten years to the time when as a College and Theological Seminary Graduate I began <b>to</b> make <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> the sick in the congregation of which I had become pastor. Questions began to present themselves because the average sick calling seemed so perfunctory. Was I calling just to bring greetings from the church and to show my own interest? If I had prayer with the person who was sick, what answer should I expect to my prayer? Would or should there be immediate improvement and if not, why not? Would prayer help at all in the recovery? Was prayer merely a subjective spiritual exercise and if so did it have value alike for functional and organic sickness...|$|R

It is a small mean-looking edifice of wood and plaster, a true nestling-place of genius, which seems to delight in hatching its offspring in by-corners. The walls of its squalid chambers are covered with names and inscriptions in every language by pilgrims of all nations, ranks, and conditions, from the prince to the peasant, and present a simple but striking instance of the spontaneous and universal homage of mankind to the great poet of Nature.|$|R

40|$|Broadband {{will soon}} reach small {{communities}} in remote Australia, writes Ellie Rennie in Inside Story. But a few details {{need to be}} sorted out first… • ON one of <b>my</b> <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> Mungalawurru, a small Aboriginal community ninety kilometres northwest of Tennant Creek, a senior man {{asked if he could}} use our Toyota LandCruiser’s high-frequency radio. His relative was in hospital and he wanted to know how the man was faring. The extended family gathered around the car as Alyson Wright, a researcher from the Central Land Council, made contact. The doctor informed everyone that the patient was awake and recovering, but his leg had been amputated. Although I didn’t ask the cause, nearly all major amputations among Indigenous Australians (98 per cent, according to one study) are associated with diabetes. That day our radio was the only means by which the residents of Mungalawurru could contact the outside world. The one payphone in the community was out of order – a regular occurrence – and there are no home phones. A few people own mobile phones, but they must drive halfway back to Tennant Creek to make the call, along an unsealed road, to the old Warrego gold mine where you can pick up a bar or two of reception on some handsets. There was only one laptop among the twenty-two permanent residents of Mungalawurru, but it wasn’t connected to the internet… Read the full article Above: Clinton Walker (left) and Miles Lauder at Mungalawurru.

I confess that I had rather dreaded this meeting, but {{now that it is}} over I am very glad that I made it. It is so pleasant to think of Polly in her happy home, for it is a very happy one. Charley is such a capital fellow, so thoroughly good and hearty, and I am sure he would cut off his little finger if he thought it would give Polly pleasure. I tell her that I think she has her own way too much, more than it is good that a wife should, but Polly only laughs, and says, [...] "That her dear old bear is quite contented with his chain, but that if he were to take it into his head to growl, and pull his own way, that he would find the chain only a flimsy pretence after all." ...|$|R

Our journey led us up a winding hill through beautiful country. I sat in front with the chauffeur, but behind me my three comrades {{seemed to me to be}} all talking together. Lord John was still struggling with his buffalo story, so far as I could make out, while once again I heard, as of old, the deep rumble of Challenger and the insistent accents of Summerlee as their brains locked in high and fierce scientific debate. Suddenly Austin slanted his mahogany face toward me without taking his eyes from his steering-wheel.|$|R
