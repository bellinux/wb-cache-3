The green wastes were biologically degraded during 3 months. Longer the destructuration time; higher the yield into oil is. Biological pretreatment of green wastes promotes the liquefaction process. Among the components of degraded biomass, Humin, the major fraction (60 - 80 wt. %) that was favored by the biological treatment, yields to a bio oil extremely energetic with a HHV close to biopetroleum (40 MJ kg− 1), contrariwise, Fulvic acids (2 - 12 wt. %), the minor fraction is refractory to liquefaction reaction...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe direct {{liquefaction}} of a biomass {{composed of}} a <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> (straw, wood and grass) was studied using Nickel Raney as catalyst and tetralin as a solvent. Tetralin allows to solubilize green waste from 330 °C at relatively low hydrogen pressure, and avoids the recondensation of the intermediate products. The green waste deoxygenation results mainly from a decarboxylation reaction. The addition of Raney Ni in the feed, increases the gas yield due to methane formation, without diminishing the yield in solvolysis oil. The catalyst hydrogenolyses the small molecules present in the light fraction. Moreover, it improves {{the quality of the}} oil by increasing the hydrogen transfer between the solvent and the solvolysis oil. As a consequence, the oxygen content decreases and the yield of oil soluble in hexane strongly increases. The catalyst allows to obtain straight long chain alkanes (C 13 -C 26), which result from the hydrogenation of the extractives compounds of the green waste...|$|E

The optimal mix feeds of C/N balanced <b>mixture</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> found suitable for enhancing gas production. The optimal mix was densified into multinutrient briquettes by adding Mg metal nutrient/catalyst. The density, water solubility of the briquettes and volatile fatty acid content of the supernatant were the parameters used to evaluate performance of briquettes after addition of binder in different proportions. All the proportions formed good quality briquettes. The water solubility was almost same for all the ratios of mix feed and starch and was highest for cow dung to starch ratio of 3 : 1. The volatile fatty acids were also highest for feed to starch ratio of 3 : 1, concluding the ratio of 3 : 1 to be optimum for forming good quality briquette and providing environment for maximal bacterial growth for ultimate enhanced biogas production. The economic analysis of the whole process concludes it is a beneficial activity which can be popularized and commercialized for extension and demonstration for mass adoption and for upliftment of the poor in rural areas...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Studying {{alternative}} {{raw materials}} for biodiesel production is of major importance. The use <b>of</b> <b>mixtures</b> with incorporation <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> is an environmental friendly alternative and might reduce biodiesel production costs. The objective of the present work was: (i) to study biodiesel production using waste frying oil mixed with pork lard and (ii) to understand how mixture composition influences biodiesel quality. Biodiesel was produced by transesterification and quality was evaluated through determination of several parameters according to EN 14214. The weight fraction of lard in the mixture varied from 0 to 1 in 0. 2 intervals. Biodiesel production yields varied from 81. 7 to 88. 0 (wt%), the lowest yields being the ones obtained using waste frying oil and lard alone as raw materials. The obtained products fulfilled most of the determined quality specifications according to European biodiesel quality standard EN 14214. Minimum purity (96. 5 wt%) was closely obtained when waste frying oil was used alone and when 0. 2 % of lard was incorporated in the raw material (96. 3 wt%); however, it ranged from 93. 9 to 96. 3 (wt%) being always close to the limit.
