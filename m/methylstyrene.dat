40|$|Anaerobic {{microbial}} degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons and {{the occurrence of}} metabolites were studied in detail in the groundwater of the former manufactured gasplant site at Düsseldorf-Flingern especially with respect to changes due to remediation of soil and groundwater. Physico-chemical effects such as variations in ground-water table, processes of transport and sorption as well as {{microbial degradation}} cause a specific distribution and composition of the aromatics in the contaminant plume. The microbial degradation of the monoaromatics under sulfate-reducing conditions was classified as follows: Strongly reactive: Toluene, benzene, 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene, styrene. Medium reactive: Xylenes, 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene, m-ethyltoluene. Hardly reactive: Ethylbenzene, <b>methylstyrenes,</b> 1, 2, 3 -trimethylbenzene. Under nitrate-reducing conditions, benzene appeares to be resistant and ethylbenzene more reactive. Degradation of the aromatics coupled to sulfate-reduction is significantly disturbed probably by diffusion of athmospheric oxygen. Short term addition of nitrate to the groundwater only enhances the transformation of toluene and 1, 2, 4 -trimethylbenzene. Several aromatic acids {{were found in the}} groundwater as intermediates of the microbial degradation and could be attributed to the corresponding aromatic compounds in most cases. The concentration ratio of aryl succinic acids such as benzylsuccinic acid and naphthylsuccinic acids to the corresponding monoaromatic acids such as benzoic acid and naphthoic acids may be used to indicate the intensity of the microbial degradation...|$|R

The theory presented here accounts for the essential features of the experimental STM data including {{the nature of the}} corrugation observed along the molecular chains and the pronounced changes in the contrast between the styrene and <b>methylstyrene</b> parts of the molecular chains that are observed as the applied bias is varied. The observed evolution with applied bias of the STM profiles near the ends of the molecular chains is also explained. Calculations are also presented of electron transport along styrene linear chains adsorbed on the silicon surface at energies {{in the vicinity of the}} molecular highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels. For short styrene chains this lateral transport is found to be due primarily to direct electron transmission from molecule to molecule rather than through the silicon substrate, especially in the molecular LUMO band. Differences between the calculated position dependences of the STM current around a junction of styrene and <b>methylstyrene</b> molecular chains under positive and negative tip bias are related to the nature of lateral electron transmission along the molecular chains and to the formation in the LUMO band of an electronic state localized around the heterojunction.

40|$|AbstractA low {{molecular}} weight predominantly polyolefin copolymer of isobutylene and para <b>methylstyrene</b> (IMS) was studied using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Average composition information derived from the spectra was skewed to higher para <b>methylstyrene</b> (pMS) content as compared to that obtained using multiple NMR techniques, and drifted towards lower pMS incorporation at higher oligomer lengths. Although both observations were initially attributed in total to an inability to ionize the isobutylene component, comparison with subsequent field desorption (FD) mass spectrometry results gave similar values to that obtained via MALDI, even though FD ionizes oligomers not detected by MALDI. Instead, the compositional drift observed with MALDI roughly mirrored the mass distribution, and was determined to arise from a mass bias effect in oligomer ionization and detection. Composition with respect to oligomer mass {{was found to be}} relatively constant, although similarly higher in pMS content. Comparison of experimental peaks with a Bernoullian statistical model revealed severe overrepresentation of higher pMS composition oligomers with regard to the calculated distribution. This discrepancy is attributed to preferential ionization of oligomers with greater pMS content, and likely results in the observed difference between MALDI and NMR compositions...|$|E

One {{of these is the}} same radical mechanism that would operate within the homopolymers of the constituent comonomers. The other mechanism is characteristic of the systems being copolymers and arises from intramolecular excited-state charge-transfer interactions between adjacent chlorine-containing and non-chlorine-containing units of the polymer chains. Pulse radiolysis studies demonstrate the formation of a transient intermediate in poly(p-methylstyrene-stat-p-chlorostyrene), the spectrum of which is consistent with that of a methylstyryl radical-cation.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{progress}} since January, 1998, in preparing polymer mandrels by microencapsulation for NIF scale ICF capsules that meet the required symmetry and surface finish requirements. During that time we successfully completed our FY 98 DOE TDF 4. 1 milestone of improving the mandrel low mode to meet NIF requirements. A number of batches of 2 mm microencapsulated poly(a- <b>methylstyrene)</b> shells have been produced with mode 2 out-of-rounds of less than 2 {micro}m. Detailed characterization for these and other batches is presented. We {{have found that the}} key to reducing mode 2 out-of-round is the density matching of the composite oil/inner core water microencapsulated shell preform to the supporting bath. Density matching of the inner core water to the oil phase seems to be less important, perhaps because core centering is accomplished by other physical means. Shell roughness over the very important mode 10 to 100 region is still too high by at least a decade in power, and work aimed at improving this is the task for FY 99. In addition to basic sphericity results we also report on a number of experiments designed to elucidate the fundamental scientific issues. In most cases the experiments reported are but starting points that will be followed up during FY 99. Lastly we note that no effort has been placed on optimizing the overcoating and thermal decomposition steps, which must follow the successful microencapsulation step. Based upon GA� s experience with smaller scale shells we are hopeful that these steps will not degrade capsule symmetry and surface finish. This question should be answered at least in part during FY 99 as GA begins to supply finished 2 mm CH mandrels for the polyimide and Be ablator development work...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of in-situ optical and fluorescence microspectroscopy has been employed {{to investigate the}} oligomerization of styrene derivatives occurring in the micropores of coffin-shaped H-ZSM- 5 zeolite crystals in a space- and time-resolved manner. The carbocationic intermediates in this reaction act as reporter molecules for catalytic activity, since they exhibit strong optical absorption and fluorescence. In this way, reactant selectivity and restricted transition-state selectivity for 14 substituted styrene molecules can be visualized and quantified. Based on a thorough analysis of the time- and space-resolved UV/Vis spectra, it has been revealed that two main parameters affect the reaction rates, namely, the carbocation stabilization effect and the diffusion hindrance. The stabilization effect was tested by comparison of the reaction rates for 4 -methoxystyrene versus 4 -methylstyrene and in the series 4 -bromo-, 4 -chloro and 4 -fluorostyrene; in both cases less electronegative substituents were found to accelerate the reaction. As to the steric effect, bulkier chemical groups bring down the reaction rate, as evident from the observation that 4 -methoxystyrene is more reactive than 4 -ethoxystyrene {{due to differences in}} their diffusivity, while heavily substituted styrenes, such as 3, 4 -dichlorostyrene and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorostyrene, cannot enter the zeolite pore system and therefore do not display any reactivity. Furthermore, -methoxystyrene and trans [...] <b>methylstyrene</b> show limited reactivity as well as restricted reaction-product formation due to steric constraints imposed by the H-ZSM- 5 channel system. Finally, polarized-light optical microspectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy demonstrate that dimeric styrene compounds are predominantly formed and aligned within the straight channels {{at the edges of the}} crystals, whereas a large fraction of trimeric carbocations along with dimeric compounds are present in the straight channels of the main body of the H-ZSM- 5 crystals. Our results reinforce the observation of a non-uniform catalytic behavior within zeolite crystals, with specific parts of the zeolite grains being less accessible and reactive towards reactant molecules. The prospects and potential of this combined in-situ approach for studying large zeolite crystals in the act will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Polyethylene {{is used in}} the {{manufacturing}} of cables. Because of the amount of high voltages which is transmitted through the cables at elevated temperatures, crosslinking of PE is necessary for stabilizing the insulation. This is done chemically by the addition of crosslinking agents such as dicumyl peroxide. This agent starts an autonomic process when subjected to heat after extrusion. However, crosslinking generates by-products which for dielectric, mechanical and electrical test and performance considerations need to be removed from the cables, thus the process of degassing. Degassing or thermal treatment is an important process with cable manufacturing. After thermal treatments on the material XLPE different analytical techniques can be applied to measure the progress of degassing. Analysis of XLPE cables is essential {{in order to determine the}} contents of by-products after crosslinking and degassing. Many analytical methods such as TGA, DSC, GC-MS, HPLC, FT-IR, TL and EL are used to conduct these measurements. In this project, after looking at the chemical and the physical characteristics of the interesting components of XLPE, HPLC with a UV detector was found to be best suited to carry out quantitative and qualitative analysis. This required an analytical method to be developed. An ideal wavelength of 250 nm, a buffer solution of pH 2. 3 made of nano pure water and formic acid, a C 18 column and a gradient mobile phase were found to be good instrumentation settings. Reproducibility was obtained with regards to how standard analytes appear in the chromatogram singularly and in mixed solutions. In the quantitative analysis, calibration curves were derived from data produced by standard samples. The same calibration curves were used to determine the concentrations of acetophenone, alpha cumylalcohol, alpha <b>methylstyrene</b> and dicumyl peroxide in both degassed and not-degassed XLPE samples. Degassing has also been carried out in the lab, in a chamber, at a fixed temperature of 70 ºC and varying times.

In dichloromethane containing pyrazole, they reacted with alkenes or alkanes to give tosylamidoruthenium(IV) porphyrins, [Ru(IV) (Por) (NHTs) (pz) ], in about 75 % yields. The reactions of [Ru(VI) (TPP) (NTs) 2] and [Ru(VI) (OEP) (NTs) 2] with styrene, para-substituted styrenes, norbornene, cyclooctene, and β- <b>methylstyrene</b> afforded the corresponding N-tosylaziridines in 66 - 85 % yields. The aziridination of cis-stilbene and cis-β-methylstyrene by [Ru(VI) (Por) (NTs) 2] is nonstereospecific with a partial {{loss of the}} alkene stereochemistry. Kinetic studies on the reactions between [Ru(VI) (TPP) (NTs) 2] and 16 alkenes (cyclooctene, norbornene, 2, 3 -dimethyl- 2 - butene, styrene, para-substituted styrenes, α and β-methylstyrene, and α- and β-deuteriostyrene) gave the second-order rate constants (k 2) ranging from (1. 60 ± 0. 06) x 10 - 3 to (90 ± 4) x 10 - 3 dm 3 mo 1 - 1 s- 1 at 298 K. The slope of the linear plot of log k 2 vs E(l/ 2) for eight representative alkenes {{was found to be}} - 1. 7 V- 1. In the case of para-substituted styrenes, linear correlation between log k(R) (k(R) = relative rate) and σ+ gives a ρ+ value as small as - 1. 1. However, the effect of para substituents on k(R) can be best accounted for by considering both the polar and spin delocalization effect. Measurements on the secondary deuterium isotope effect revealed that only the β-carbon atom of styrene experienced a significant change in its hybridization in reaching the transition state. All these are consistent with rate-determining formation of a carboradical intermediate. The reactions of [Ru(VI) (TPP) (NTs) 2] and [Ru(VI-) (OEP) (NTs) 2] with adamantane, cyclohexene, ethylbenzene, and cumene resulted in tosylamidation of these hydrocarbons and afforded the corresponding amides in 52 - 88 % yields. For cyclohexane and toluene, the tosylamidation products were formed in poor yields (ca. 10 %). Kinetic studies on the reactions between [Ru(VI-) (TPP) (NTs) 2] and nine hydrocarbons (cumene, ethylbenzene, cyclohexene, and para-substituted ethylbenzenes) gave the second-order rate constants (k 2) in the range of (0. 330 ± 0. 008) x 10 - 3 to (16. 5 ± 0. 3) x 10 - 3 dm 3 mol- 1 s- 1. These reactions exhibit a large primary deuterium isotope effect, with a k(H) /k(D) ratio of 11 for the tosylamidation of ethylbenzene. In the case of para-substituted ethylbenzenes, both electron-donating and -withdrawing substituents moderately promote the reaction. There is an excellent linear correlation between log k(R) and a related carboradical parameter. On the basis of these observations, a mechanism involving the rate-limiting formation of a carboradical intermediate is postulated. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{examination}} of polycrystalline organic based {{devices such as}} the Schottky diode and MOS capacitor is carried out. The data is interpreted {{in terms of a}} polycrystalline model based mainly on a conventional polysilicon model with slight modifications to fit the organic properties. A brief introduction to the existing charge transport models for organic materials is presented. The most dominant being the variable range hopping model for disordered materials. The disorder analysis is appropriate in the grain boundaries of a polycrystalline material. The distribution of the traps of density of states (DOS) is commonly described by the Gaussian distribution and the associated exponential approximate at low energies. This is a valid assumption for organic semiconductors with low carrier mobility values [N. Sedghi et al., J. Non Crys. Solids 352, 1641, 2006]. Detailed investigation on the temperature effects of the polycrystalline Schottky diode leads to determination of important electrical parameters. Such studies are essential in understanding the conduction processes of the organic device, particularly in terms of trapping effects, which is essential in the development of device models for organic circuitry. Several parameters such as dopant (ND) and carrier concentrations (p), effective mobility (μeff), depletion width (Wdep), effective Debye length (LDe), Meyer Neldel energy (MNE) and the characteristic temperature of the carriers (T 0) are extracted from the current-voltage characteristics of the diode. For a soluble derivative of pentacene, 6, 13 -triisopropylsilyethynyl pentacene (TIPS) blended with Polytriarylamine (PTAA), the respective values extracted at room temperature are found to be approximately 1017 cm- 3, 1. 8 x 10 - 2 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, 185 nm, 11 nm, 31. 5 meV and 780 K, respectively. As the temperature falls, the values of most parameters remain constant until a critical temperature. The activation energy also remains constant at approximately 0. 3 eV for various applied voltages in saturation. Below this critical temperature, Wdep, LDe and T 0 increase whilst μeff, ND/p and characteristic temperature of the states (TC) decrease. Similar analysis is carried out on doped layers of TIPS with a different insulating binder Poly-alpha <b>methylstyrene</b> (PAMS). The value of Wdep, LDe, T 0, μeff, ND/p, MNE and TC obtained from such doped Schottky diode are approximately 100 nm, 5 nm, 1200 K, 1 x 10 - 2 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, 2 x 1017 cm- 3, 35 meV and 400 K, respectively. The Capacitance-Voltage (C-V) analysis on polycrystalline Schottky diodes provides ND of approximately 7. 6 x 1016 cm- 3, 5. 2 x 1014 cm- 3 and 2. 98 x 1014 cm- 3 at 500 Hz, 1 kHz and 2 kHz respectively. These ND values are lower than those extracted from current-voltage characteristics and decrease with increasing frequency. This is thought to be due to the low mobility of holes, unable to respond to the signal at higher frequencies. The conduction in polycrystalline organic Schottky diode is proposed using a 2 -dimensional (2 D) model, which focuses on both the lateral and vertical conduction paths. The organic semiconductor layer is assumed to be relatively thin so that only a single layer of the grain exists between adjacent grain boundaries for the vertical conduction. A two dimensional situation is treated as two separate one dimensional problems that are positioned at right angles to each other. The grain and grain boundaries in the polycrystalline material are explained in terms of two boundary conditions. The variation of potential in grain boundary is the basis in defining the variation of potential in the grains. Conduction under forward bias in the grain and grain boundary is thus established assuming two distributions for the DOS, namely the Gaussian and Laplace. In comparison, Laplace DOS is believed to be a better representation of the distribution of states, where a large number of energy levels are being scanned with applied voltage. The ac properties of a polycrystalline based MOS capacitor are investigated. The frequency and temperature effects on the C-V characteristics of MOS capacitor based on another soluble derivative of pentacene, refered here as S 1150, are studied. Equivalent circuits which include the effects of bulk and series resistance due to contact effects are analysed. The bulk resistance (Rb), bulk capacitance (Cb) and series resistance (RS) are found to be approximately 13 kΩ, 760 pF and less than 309 Ω respectively, for an organic film thickness (tOSC) of 27 nm. For ND ≈ 3. 6 x 1017 cm- 3 at 1 kHz, the hole mobility is found to be approximately 4. 6 x 10 - 7 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1. As expected the mobility decreases with increase in frequency. Furthermore, the temperature study of inverse square space charge capacitance (1 /CS 2) against absolute temperature (T) provides an intercept close to T (~ 330 K) instead of TC. A low intercept value indicates a decrease in disorder which suggests that the large grains may be dominating the capacitance...|$|E
