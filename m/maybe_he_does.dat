I want to be charitable, because the man swears he loves me, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> but he is making me nervous. I don't sleep. I'm afraid to be in my room at night. I've gone to mother's room. He's always hanging round. Bold! Why, that isn't the thing to call Mr. Chase. He's absolutely without a sense of decency. He bribes our servants. He comes into our patio. Think of that! He makes the most ridiculous excuses. He bothers mother to death. I feel like a poor little rabbit holed by a hound. And I daren't peep out." ...|$|E

He insists that he loves her but Sofia says it's just hormones and sex. If this is real, he should see other women while she's gone. If he doesn't get sweaty palms with them, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> love her. He says that this is crazy but she tells him that this will convince her that he really feels this only for her.|$|E
50|$|When {{the group}} of cats are ready to leave, Ravenpaw was very sad and is {{reluctant}} to let them leave, but Barley was relieved. He then cleans the barn while Ravenpaw is sleeping. Later, Ravenpaw and Barley discuss the cats, Ravenpaw accuses Barley of treating the cats like they were intruders. Barley tells him that since his background was with the Clan, it made a difference. He also questions Ravenpaw's belonging in the barn which shocks and offends Ravenpaw. It also makes him think that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> belong in the clans.|$|E

5000|$|O'Shaughnessy admits all this, but pleads {{that she}} {{is in love with}} Spade and he loves her. Spade refuses to protect her, listing several reasons. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> care for her; but he says [...] "I won't play the sap for you." [...] If she (a pretty young woman) can get off with a long prison term, he'll wait for her. But if she hangs, so be it. She kisses him one last time, just before the police arrive. He turns her in. The police tell him Wilmer has shot Gutman dead. At the office the next day, Effie is shocked that O'Shaughnessy was a {{ruthless}} killer, but also that Spade could so coldbloodedly turn her in. Then Iva Archer comes in, and the story ends.|$|E
5000|$|Horacio then sits in {{the dark}} on the {{opposite}} side of the room, near the window, waiting to see what will happen. The hours pass slowly and painfully, but finally Traveler does try to come in, and the tumult that results brings Dr. Ovejero and the others out into the garden, where they find Oliveira leaning out the window of his room as if intending to let himself fall. Traveler tries to talk Horacio out of doing what he, for his part, insists he doesn't intend to do, though at the conclusion of this part of the book, he suddenly muses that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> mean to do such a thing after all, that maybe it is for the best, and the end of the passage is wholly open to this interpretation. Only by proceeding to read the [...] "Expendable Chapters" [...] will the reader be able to place Horacio firmly back inside mental institution, where, after being sedated by Ovejero, he succumbs to a lengthy delirium.|$|E

[...] "What if he had treated the arts of femininity with the same attention he gives to the arts of photography? <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> but his prose does not reflect it: instead, he comes off, by the end, as an anxious mansplainer, uneasy about the feminine subject he has chosen." ...|$|R
50|$|The sole {{remaining}} McLaren of Lewis Hamilton {{posted the}} fastest time with over five minutes remaining. Not much happened {{for the entire}} session as only 'banker' laps were set as a benchmark for the final two frantic minutes of action. Vettel went out on track for another lap with under two minutes left, but later decided to pit without a lap time as he thought of saving tyres for the race and that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have {{the pace of the}} top five cars.|$|R

5|$|In {{his second}} {{meeting of the}} day with Scully and Doggett, Wells {{explains}} that he cannot remember the last few days. Scully suggests that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> do it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|R

6000|$|... "Dead" [...] came to Uncle John, {{as perhaps}} Susan had contrived; and shrugging up his shoulders, {{he went off}} to hide, and his whoop was {{presently}} heard. He was not VERY good game; <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not wish to be very long sought, for he was no further than in the tall French beans, generally considered as a stupid place to hide in. The children had been in hopes that he would catch Papa, which was always a very difficult matter, for the sailor was lighter of foot, as well as, of course, longer in limb, than any of the children; but they saw that Uncle John had not the slightest chance with him, and it was Bessie who was caught in her homeward race.|$|R
60|$|He was a {{nice young}} man of prepossessing {{appearance}} and amiable manners. They could not call to mind his name, but remembered having met him, somewhere, and {{on more than one}} occasion. The American girl is always sociable: they bowed and smiled, and said it was a fine day. He replied with volubility, and helped them down on to the ice. He was really most attentive. They saw their friend, the officer of noble family, and, {{with the assistance of the}} German gentleman, skated towards him. He glided past them. They thought that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know enough to stop, so they turned and skated after him. They chased him three times round the pond and then, feeling tired, eased up and took counsel together.|$|R
50|$|Pabo {{was present}} at the Battle of Arfderydd (Arthuret) in 573, which may have been fought for control of the Solway. Peredur and Gwrgi were also there, and these two were {{supposedly}} descendents of the Coeling family (Coel Hen) as well as being first cousins of Urien Rheged, (c. 550 - c. 590) so may have been associated with the Rheged area. The sources that mention the battle, however, (the Annales Cambriae and Aneirin's poem Y Gododdin) mention neither Rheged nor Urien, (casting doubt in the minds of some on the existence of both). It may be that Urien took advantage of the confusion and weakness {{as a result of this}} savage battle to make his move to take over Rheged, or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> this after the deaths of Peredur and Gwrgi some years later (the brothers were killed fighting the Angles in 580 or 584).|$|R
50|$|The collection’s {{destination}} after Vicksburg {{remains a}} little uncertain. California newspaper announcements from 1957 indicate that Richards intended {{to reopen the}} museum in Santa Cruz. A brochure exists for The National Civil War Museum of Santa Cruz that lists Richards as the owner. However, a 1961 Florida newspaper article about Richards states that he moved the collection to that state in 1957. Perhaps Richards intended to open the museum in Santa Cruz, but never quite made the move. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> go to California only to immediately turn around and take the collection to Florida. Either way, by 1960 the National Civil War Museum sat along the Suwannee River in Old Town, Florida. As the years advanced, Richards and his wife took less and less interest in the collection. Richard {{suffered a heart attack}} and he and his wife contemplated the future of the museum and its contents. A waning interest in the artifacts, coupled with ailing health, the Richards decided to sell the collection.|$|R
5000|$|... "That's Why God Made the Radio" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Joe Thomas, Brian Wilson, Jim Peterik, and Larry Millas for the American rock band The Beach Boys. It was the first new single from the band in 20 years and was {{included}} on the band's 29th studio album, That's Why God Made the Radio. The album was recorded {{to coincide with the}} band's 50th anniversary, which featured a reunion tour of the surviving co-founders. According to the song's co-writer Peterik: and I were at an Italian restaurant and we were talking about radio and how great songs used to sound through the AM radio coming through your oval speaker on your Plymouth Valiant and I said, [...] "Man, that was the best sound of all," [...] and Brian said, [...] "Yeah, that's why God made the radio." [...] Of course, I wrote that down. He didn't realize how brilliant it was, or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> but that's when we wrote that song.|$|R

We are ready for him, as you perceive. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not suppose us equipped with cannon; but there they stand. Those guns are trained upon his camp, and the first shot he fires upon us shall be a signal for such a reply as he little dreams of. Tell him, too, that we expect no quarter, and will yield none. We are unwilling for bloodshed, but if he drives us to it and executes his purpose of employing cannon, then the consequences be upon his own head. Bear him that answer, and tell him to send you no more with empty threats." ...|$|R
60|$|One of the {{new friends}} who went out there with me was a large man, and I had been admiring his size all the way. I was still admiring it as he stood by the {{governor}} on the veranda, talking; then the Fijian butler stepped out there to announce tea, and dwarfed him. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not quite dwarf him, but at any rate the contrast was quite striking. Perhaps that dark giant was a king in a condition of political suspension. I {{think that in the}} talk there on the veranda it was said that in Fiji, as in the Sandwich Islands, native kings and chiefs are of much grander size and build than the commoners. This man was clothed in flowing white vestments, and they were just the thing for him; they comported well with his great stature and his kingly port and dignity. European clothes would have degraded him and made him commonplace. I know that, because they do that with everybody that wears them.|$|R
50|$|In fact, George, always pontificating loudly {{against the}} use and {{possession}} {{of any kind of}} drug, became a victim of a serious addiction himself, first using cocaine, and soon after, almost by joke and without realizing, got a slave of much worse heroine. So dependent upon success as he was, {{in order to get the}} attention he always declared he had lacked when he was a little child, the third of five children, and so eager to find a lover who understood him, someone he thought he had found in bisexual drummer Moss, when he realized that he was losing both, man and hits, during the sad in-between year that was 1985, he fell and found no-one to catch him. But <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to himself. The songs from this period reflect this negative state of mind, his train of thoughts always conveying desperate lyrics of hate and rejection (let us not forget that Boy George actually wrote all lyrics for the band's songs, which, he finally revealed, or rather confirmed, in 1995, were most of them for Jon and about their relationship).|$|R
50|$|Everett {{interviews}} {{a prosecution}} witness, Dale Porterhouse (Michael Jeter), who saw Beechum {{at the store}} where the shooting took place and said in his statement to the police that he saw him carrying a gun. Everett questions Porterhouse's account, saying that, because of {{the layout of the}} store, he could not have seen a gun in Beechum's hand and that <b>he</b> <b>maybe</b> said what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in order to impress his co-workers.|$|R
60|$|The simple, logical {{interpretation}} of Wilson's words opened Columbine's mind to a disturbing possibility {{of which she}} had never dreamed. That he might love her! If <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> why had <b>he</b> not said so? Jealous, <b>maybe,</b> but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not love her! The next throb of thought was like a knock at a door of her heart--a door never yet opened, inside which seemed a mystery of feeling, of hope, despair, unknown longing, and clamorous voices. The woman just born in her, instinctive and self-preservative, shut that door before she {{had more than a}} glimpse inside. But then she felt her heart swell with its nameless burdens.|$|R
40|$|When I was young, I {{asked my}} grandpa, “Did you kill anyone during the war?” He said, “Hmmm….

He never told me. ” Th en I asked my dad and he said, “Perhaps <b>he</b> <b>did</b> … Because that’s what war is … So <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> ” I was puzzled and greatly unsatisfi ed that no one seemed to know. Th rough education, media, books and family, I received incoherent messages about the war. No matter which one I tried to believe, I hit a wall of contradiction. Behind the wall was the silence of Japan, and the silence of my grandpa. In 2003, my drama therapist instructor Armand Volkas produced a playback theatre titled, “Speaking with the Enemy, ” as part of the Healing the Wounds of His-tory. In the event, I was asked to contribute a story as a granddaughter of an atomic bomb survivor, alongside others from Israel, Lebanon, and Korea. I was used to telling a story about my grandmother’s experience, but in this event, I was asked to tell a story of “my experience ” as I grew up listening to her story. Actors on the stag...|$|R
5000|$|Performance wise, Slydini never verbalized a magic word; {{there was}} no [...] "abracadabra" [...] or [...] "hocus pocus". His subtle magical {{gestures}} {{made it clear that}} he knew something not known, and probably unknowable, to his audience. Audiences saw an elfin quality in him that was unlikely to be duplicated. He created an ambiguous persona which allowed one to believe that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was an elf and that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> really <b>did</b> have magical powers. As a close-up performer, he was considered nonpareil by his peers. His almost casual manner of performing made the magical effects he offered those of true magic. His style of close-up was something that had never been seen before. He was one of the first to show close-up magic as an art in itself, rather than as a lead-in to bigger and grander illusions. Slydini's magic was impromptu and rather than follow a set sequence of tricks as most magicians <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> allowed his audience and the situation to dictate his show.|$|R
5000|$|Zarkandar {{began the}} new season by {{returning}} to France for the Grade 1 Grand Prix d'Automne over 4800 metres at Auteuil on 1 November. Ridden by the French jockey Vincent Cheminaud he started the 16/5 second favourite behind Gemix, with the other runners including Reve de Sivola, winner of the race in 2013. He won the race by five lengths from Gemix, with Dulce Leo three lengths back in third. On his return to England, Zarkandar started odds-on favourite for the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot. He tracked the pace-setting Reve de Sivola before taking the lead at the second last and going into a two length lead. On the run-in, however, he faltered when challenged by the resurgent Reve de Sivola and was beaten a head. After the race owner Chris Giles commented [...] "I don't blame the jockey, but <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> would <b>do</b> it differently if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it again and wait a bit longer".|$|R
