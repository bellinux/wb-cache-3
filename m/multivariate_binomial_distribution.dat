40|$|The rapid {{development}} {{of the next generation}} sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized how genomic research is conducted. An important application of the NGS technologies, named RNA-Seq, is to study the RNA transcripts. Despite the increasing popularity of RNA-Seq, statistical challenges still exist for analyzing RNA-Seq data. This thesis focuses on three specific problems in gene expression quantification and differential gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq data. ^ Microarray technology {{has been used as a}} main platform for gene expression quantification for the last few decades, and RNA-Seq emerged as a promising alternative to microarrays. Unfortunately, both microarray and RNA-seq data are subject to various measurement errors. Using a third platform, called qRT-PCR, which has low throughput capacity but high measurement accuracy, we propose a system of functional measurement error models to model gene expression measurements and calibrate the microarray and RNA-Seq platforms. ^ As new RNA-Seq normalization methods continue to appear, it is important to systematically compare different methods. Currently, different normalization methods are compared and validated by their correlations with a certain gold standard. Although the current approach is intuitive and easy to implement, it becomes statistically inadequate when the gold standard is also subject to measurement error. We utilize the system of measurement error models based on qRT-PCR, Microarray and RNA-Seq gene expression data to compare and validate RNA-Seq normalization methods. ^ Differential gene expression analysis is complicated in eukaryotes due to the prevalence of alternative splicing events and the incompleteness of transcript annotations. We propose to use the <b>multivariate</b> negative <b>binomial</b> <b>distributions</b> with certain covariance structures to model exon-level RNA-Seq data and perform differential expression analysis. Two specific models, referred to as the first-order adjacent model and the common covariance model, are discussed. The major barrier that hurdles the use of <b>multivariate</b> negative <b>binomial</b> <b>distribution</b> is the computational burden. We generalized a recursive relation in the bivariate negative <b>binomial</b> <b>distribution</b> to the two proposed models. An application of the first order adjacent model is presented and discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} new class of dynamic multivariate Poisson count models that allow for fast online {{updating}} and we refer to these models as multivariate Poisson-scaled beta (MPSB). The MPSB model allows for serial dependence in the counts as well as dependence across multiple series with a random common environment. Other notable features include analytic forms for state propagation and predictive likelihood densities.

30|$|The {{change point}} is {{simulated}} to occur at τ = 100. Thus, the first 100 subgroups are randomly generated from an in-control <b>multivariate</b> <b>binomial</b> <b>distribution</b> with parameter vector [N',[*]P 0 '], using the normal to anything (NORTA) method (Cario and Nelson 1997; Niaki and Abbasi 2008). The in-control subgroup averages exceeding the UCL {{of the proposed}} control chart are false alarms. Consequently, these subgroups are discarded and are replaced with other in-control subgroups. This is replicated until all of the in-control subgroups are below UCL. Following subgroup 100, the parameter vector is changed based on a step-change disturbance given in Equation  5 where the subgroups are randomly generated from an out-of-control process with parameter vector [N',[*]P 1 ']. The subgroup averages are plotted on the proposed control chart until a signal is generated, and at this time, the accuracy and the precision measures of the change-point estimators are computed.|$|E
3000|$|A {{binomial}} distribution with parameters n and p {{is used to}} model the number of non-conforming items in a sequence of n trials for an attribute quality characteristic, in which p denotes the process fraction non-conforming. In the case of multi-attribute processes, the <b>multivariate</b> <b>binomial</b> <b>distribution</b> with parameters n and p k [...] (k = 1, 2,…, q) {{can be used to}} model the number of non-conforming items in a sequence of n trials for each attribute quality characteristic, in which p k [...] denotes the process fraction non-conforming of the k th quality characteristic. The problem of estimating the time of a change in a univariate {{binomial distribution}} for different change types of step change, linear-trend disturbance (drift), multiple-step changes, monotonic change, and other change types defined as a combination of the above has been addressed in the literature. In a step-change disturbance, the parameter of the process shifts to an out-of-control level and remains in that level until corrective measures are taken. Although a step change can occur because of tool breakage, the parameter of a process may gradually drift. In other words, linear-trend disturbances can occur as a result of tool wear or equipment depreciation. Moreover, a process parameter may change due to multiple-step changes. A change in several parameters at different times or a change in one parameter at different times can be the results of this type of change. In monotonic changes, however, the only assumption is that the change type can be described as belonging to a family of monotonic change types.|$|E
40|$|A {{modification}} to the pairwise likelihood {{method is}} proposed, {{which aims to}} improve the estimation of the marginal distribution parameters. This is achieved by replacing the pairwise likelihood score equations, for estimating such parameters, by the optimal linear combinations of the marginal score functions. A further advantage of the proposed estimator of marginal parameters, over pairwise likelihood, {{is that it is}} robust to misspecification of the bivariate distributions as long as the univariate marginal distributions are correctly specified. While alternating logistic regression {{can be seen as a}} special case of the proposed method, it is shown that an existing generalization of alternating logistic regression applicable to ordinal data is not the same as and is inferior to the proposed method because it replaces certain conditional densities by pseudodensities that assume working independence. The fitting of the <b>multivariate</b> negative <b>binomial</b> <b>distribution</b> is another scenario involving intractable likelihood that calls for the use of pairwise likelihood methods, and the superiority of the modified method is demonstrated in a simulation study. Two examples, based on the analyses of salamander mating and patient-controlled analgesia data, demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. The possibility of combining optimally the pairwise, rather than marginal, scores is also considered and its difficulty and potential are discussed. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Geographic {{variation}} in consumer use of Internet retailers is partly explained by {{variation in}} offline shop-ping costs. Explanations for geographic {{variation in the}} efficacy of different customer acquisition methods including traditional methods of offline word-of-mouth (WOM) and magazine advertising and information sys-tems (IS) -enabled methods of online WOM and online search remain unexplored. We estimate a <b>multivariate</b> negative <b>binomial</b> <b>distribution</b> (NBD) model on zip code–level customer counts from a leading Internet retailer and provide new insights into factors explaining geographic variation {{in the success of}} these methods. First, we show that target customer density explains geographic variation over and above the impact due to the number of potential customers. Moreover, the effect of density is greatest for offline and online WOM acquisitions; this suggests that density contributes to contagion, connectivity, and a hypothesized “social multiplier. ” Second, when senders and recipients of WOM share consumption benefits, WOM is more powerful and compelling. We find that location-based convenience benefits have stronger effects on location-dependent offline WOM acquisi-tions than on location-independent online WOM acquisitions. Third, acquisition channels contribute differently to the total customer pool—offline WOM acquisitions are clustered, whereas magazine acquisitions are dis-persed. Finally, separate click-to-conversion data from Coremetrics. com indicates that using the model-based predictions to target specific markets delivers a twofold improvement in actual click-to-order rates...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} portfolios whose returns {{depend on}} at least three variables and show {{the effect of the}} correlation structure on the probabilities of the extreme outcomes of the portfolio return, using a <b>multivariate</b> <b>binomial</b> approximation. The portfolio risk is then managed by using derivatives. We illustrate this risk management both with simple options, whose payoff depends upon only one of the underlying variables, and with more complex instruments whose payoffs (and values) depend upon the correlation structure. The question of benchmarking portfolio performance is complicated by the use of derivatives, especially complex derivatives, since these instruments fundamentally alter the distribution of returns. We use the <b>multivariate</b> <b>binomial</b> model to set performance benchmarks for multicurrency, international, portfolios. Our model is illustrated using a simple example where a German institution invests a proportion of its funds in German equities, and the remainder in UK equities. Portfolio performance is measured in Deutsche Marks and depends upon (1) the Dax index, (2) the FTSE index, and (3) the Deutsche Mark-Sterling exchange rate. The output of the model is a simulation of possible outcomes from the portfolio hedging strategy. The difference in our methodology is that we are able to retain the simplicity of the <b>binomial</b> <b>distribution,</b> used extensively in the analysis of options, in a multivariate context.
