30|$|A recent {{analysis}} of livelihoods {{in the northern}} Kenya rangelands plots the position of households on the two axes of <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> and cash income (McPeak et al. 2012). According to which quadrant they fall in, households are seen as ‘left behind’ (with below average holdings and cash income), ‘staying’ (as pastoralists, with above average <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> but below average cash income), ‘moving out’ (from pastoralism, with below average <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> and above average cash income) or as successfully ‘combining’ (pastoralism with other activities, above average for both <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> and cash income). The present analysis seeks to go beyond this by looking in more detail at the relative contributions of individual activities to livelihoods, at the ways these combine to produce livelihood strategies, and at the role of wildlife-based revenues within these strategies.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} household asset {{dynamics and}} gender-differentiated asset inequality over a 20 -year period (1988 – 2008) in northern Nigeria. We {{show that the}} initial endowments of both household capital and <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> are inconsistent with the poverty trap hypothesis but that tracking rules for households in panel surveys may lead to differences in empirical results on poverty traps. We also investigate whether initial household endowments contributed to gender-differentiated future asset levels and asset inequality. Initial <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> {{have an effect on}} women's future <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> but not on their livestock shares within the household, as the effect of initial <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> on men's future livestock levels was much greater than its effect on women's levels. The mechanism through which asset levels differed was related to the relative prices of the assets in gender-differentiated asset portfolios. Men, who primarily held larger livestock with larger unit values, benefited from large price increases in high-value livestock, while women held lower-value livestock. These price fluctuations reinforced gender asset inequality within households for both types of assets considered. asset dynamics, poverty traps, Gender, Household resource allocation,...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are twofold: (a) to estimate demand for formal drought insurance using farm household data in Burkina Faso and (b) to find what determines insurance demand. The following findings are salient. First, effective demand is found in all zones, which implies inadequacies in households' current self-insurance strategies. Second, there is much heterogeneity in the strategies to self-insure even within zones. Third, the expectation of public food aid decreases demand for drought insurance, which suggests that food aid is causing moral hazard. Fourth, households with large <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> can {{reduce the size of}} herd by substituting drought insurance for <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings.</b> Copyright 1997, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|In Nepal, {{many rural}} {{households}} need {{access to public}} forest resources to complement private resources for food and livestock production. However, current forest policies are largely directed at Environmental protection. The {{first part of this}} study identified the effect of current forest policy on livestock production using survey data from 259 households in three Nepal hill districts. The second part used a forestry-agriculture integrated model to examine alternative land use policies that could increase household <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> and income while maintaining the environmental services of the community forest. The results show that current forest policies contributed to reductions in potential household <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> by 34 % for goats, 30 % for cattle and 27 % for buffalo. This exacerbated problems of farm fertility and food shortages in vulnerable and poor households. Modeling of alternative policy scenarios indicates that <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> and income could both be increased for most households in communities practicing agroforestry while still maintaining environmental protection. The increase could be highest for the poorest households. Finally, the article discusses potential implications of new environmental policies on local food security and sustainability in the country...|$|R

30|$|The {{results showed}} a {{discrepancy}} between wealth grouping by land and wealth grouping by <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings.</b> Grouping by <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> showed that 43.9 % of households were ‘better off’[*], 50 % {{were in the}} ‘middle’ group and only 6.1 % were ‘poor’. But grouping by land holdings showed that 37.9 % of households were ‘better off’[*], 7.6 % were in the ‘middle’ group and 54.5 % were ‘poor’. This shows that although few of the Fulani on the Jos Plateau are poor in terms of livestock, many are still land-poor. There is a continuous distribution amongst wealth groups by <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings,</b> but the distribution of wealth groups by land was bimodal: households owned either a lot of land or very little, with few households in the middle category. This pattern of land ownership {{may be due to}} the duration of settlement of different groups of Fulani. Fulani that have been settled for longer are more likely to be granted permission to acquire land, but they are also more likely to be attracted by the advantages of mixed farming than those who have only recently settled in an area. This distribution may also be linked to the amount of labour required to till large pieces of land once acquired. Larger, wealthier households are more likely to have spare hands for farm labour or spare cash to hire labourers. The majority of Fulani with large land holdings contract the tilling and weeding to labourers from the indigenous population, but family labour was used for harvesting. There were no reports of animal traction used by either the Fulani or indigenes for tilling their land.|$|R

They answered questions such as the following: What was {{the impact of the}} shifta war on the people? How was livestock production affected by war? Which livestock was most affected? Further, 32 households from Merti, 58 from Kulamawe and 40 from Kinna were interviewed in detail. The informants were asked to report on the estimated numbers by livestock species owned by the family just {{before the start of the}} shifta war and at the end of the dhaabaa period in 1968. With the help of the selected family members, the households' <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> for selected years from 1984 to 2007 were reconstructed (here, the family used herd life histories).

40|$|<b>Livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> {{in rural}} areas of the West African Semi-arid Tropics (WASAT) are often {{substantial}} yet {{there is little evidence}} for precautionary saving in the form of livestock out of transitory income. The present paper re-visits farm households' ability to smooth consumption ex post via savings in the form of livestock. Exploiting two comprehensive panel datasets covering Burkina Faso's 2004 drought, we find that livestock sales increase significantly in response to drought. Consistent with consumption smoothing, the motive frequently cited by households for these extra sales is the need to finance food consumption. Using deviations in rainfall to extract the transitory component of crop profit, we find evidence that shocks are nevertheless to a large extent passed on to consumption expenditure. In line with the literature, our results suggest that some consumption smoothing is achieved via adjustments to grain stocks while households apparently fail to smooth consumption by adjusting <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings.</b> We argue that this seemingly contradictory finding is largely due to a decrease in relative livestock prices during droughts. This suggests that selling livestock is a costly coping strategy which may be the reason that households rely on it only to a limited extent...|$|R

40|$|First draft, not for citation. Comments {{most welcome}} 1. This paper investigates whether the {{frequently}} observed relation-ship between savings and activity choices holds {{in the face}} of violent conflict, when savings are risky and unstable. Standard economic risk theory postulates that households with more savings will engage in higher-risk, more profitable activities since those households can de-plete their savings or asset base when things go wrong. Using data from the 1998 household priority survey in Burundi, we estimate the relationship between <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> (accumulated savings) and crop choices (risky vs non-risky crops). Estimating this relationship for the whole of rural Burundi, we find the empirical results to be consistent with theory, in the sense that households with a higher value of live-stock significantly reduce allocation to low-risk activities and increase investment in higher-risk, higher value activities. However, limiting the analysis to the three provinces which were most affected by the civil war, this relationship disappears, suggesting that households with higher-valued <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> (more savings) do not significantly re-duce their allocation to low-risk, low-value crops nor increase alloca-tion to higher-risk, higher-value crops when they assume a considerable degree of risk in their assets. This finding has important poverty im-plications. We argue that this result could possibly account (in part...|$|R
40|$|In the {{northern}} highlands of Ethiopia degraded hillsides have been allocated to landless farmers for tree planting since the mid- 1990 s. The authors assessed {{the effect of}} hillside plantations on the livelihoods of landless farmers {{in the eastern part}} of the Tigray Region by using transect walks, focus group discussions, and pretested questionnaires. A matched-pairs design was used to compare crop yields, <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> per household, and household incomes to test the differences before and eight years after the intervention. In addition, regression analysis was used to capture variables influencing hillside management. The findings revealed that the plantations significantly increased crop yields, <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings,</b> and the household incomes of all beneficiaries. In addition, tree planting on degraded hillsides had a positive impact on the livelihoods of formerly landless farmers. However, moisture stress and free-ranging livestock were crucial problems. The findings are highly relevant in a conservation context because many existing or planned hillside allocations to landless farmers are located on degraded steep slopes that are unsuitable for crop production. Thus, replicating the practice to other areas with similar environment and problems would be worthwhile, although the management should focus on careful planning to avoid conflicts of interest between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{trends of}} farming systems and livelihood options over time, and examined changes in livestock inventory {{in relation to}} changes in farm size and socio-economic status of smallholder farmers in the Harar Highlands of Ethiopia. Three districts with different rural population densities (low, medium, and high) were identified. Community level information was collected using participatory research methods. Then a formal survey was administered on 225 households randomly selected from the three districts and belonging to three well-being categories (poor, medium, and well-to-do). Both one-way and two-way ANOVA were used to analyse data. The results showed that farmers changed their livestock inventory (species composition and number) as farm sizes declined, moving mainly from ruminants to non-ruminants. Total <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> varied significantly across districts and well-being groups (P< 0. 001). <b>Livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> per household of all species, except donkeys, declined as rural population density increased and augmented with improvements in socio-economic status. The number of livestock per unit area of cultivated land, however, increased significantly (P< 0. 001) with rural population density, except for sheep and goats. Though <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> declined as farm sizes shrank with significant variations across districts, farmers continued to rear livestock. This was observed even when land sizes declined to less than a hectare per household. In the most populated district, the average livestock holding was 2. 21 TLU per household. The conceptual framework, which assumes that as land resources dwindle mixed farming systems will have to specialise into crop or livestock farming units or could face involution, {{does not seem to}} be holding for the Harar Highlands of Ethiopia, at least in the near future. Its validity in similar areas will have to be re-examined. Therefore, research priorities and development initiatives in tropical smallholder mixed farming systems must consider the continued importance of the crop-livestock integration even when farm sizes decline significantly.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{potential}} for pastoral communities inhabiting. Kenyan Masailand to adapt to climate change using conservancies and payments for ecosystem services. Design/methodology/approach – Multiple methods and data sources were used, comprising: a socio-economic survey of 295 households; informal interviews with pastoralists, conservancy managers, and tourism investors; focus group discussions; a stakeholder workshop. Monthly rainfall data was used to analyse drought frequency and intensity. A framework of the interactions between pastoralists’ drought coping and risk mitigation strategies and the conservancy effects was developed, and used to qualitatively assess some interactions across the three study sites. Changes in household <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> and sources of cash income are calculated in relation to the 2008 - 09 drought. Findings – The frequency and intensity of droughts are increasing but are localized across the three study sites. The proportion of households with per capita <b>livestock</b> <b>holdings</b> below the 4. 5 TLU poverty vulnerability threshold increased by 34 per cent in Kitengela and 5 per cent in the Mara site, mainly due to the drought in 2008 - 2009. Payment for ecosystem services was found to buffer households from fluctuating livestock income, but also generates synergies and/or trade-offs depending on land use restrictions. Originality/value – The contribution of conservancies to drought coping and risk mitigation strategies of pastoralists is analyzed as a basis for evaluating the potential for ecosystem-based adaptation...|$|R
