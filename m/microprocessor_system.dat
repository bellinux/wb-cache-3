Introduction to microcomputer and <b>microprocessor</b> <b>systems</b> of rail devices will permit to eliminate and to replace disused relay devices with them and raising safety on railway and increasing reliability of used devices. 1. INTRODUCTION Since the beginning of existence of railway lines, devices allowing for safe control of traffic have been applied. Development of devices progresses continuously. Requirement pose them steady increasing as well as needs and expectation of their users. However the major purposes of applying these devices – the safety and efficiency of traffic, remain unchanged. New <b>microprocessor</b> <b>systems</b> meet these requirements. An application of modern information technology and more effective <b>microprocessor</b> <b>systems</b> has a large influence on development of railway transport.
