50|$|One must {{exercise}} caution {{when making}} inferences based on topology-related energy barriers, {{as it can}} be misleading to apply the notion of topology—a description which only rigorously applies to continuous fields— to infer the energetic stability of structures existing in discontinuous systems. Giving way to this temptation is sometimes problematic in physics, where fields which are approximated as continuous become discontinuous below certain size-scales. Such is the case for example when the concept of topology is associated with the micromagnetic model—which assimilates the <b>magnetic</b> <b>texture</b> of a system to a continuous field—and then applied indiscriminately without consideration of the model's physical limitations (i.e. that it ceases to be valid at atomic dimensions). In practice, treating the spin textures of magnetic materials as vectors of a continuous field model becomes inaccurate at size-scales on the order of < 2 nm, due to the discretization of the atomic lattice. Thus, it is not meaningful to speak of magnetic skyrmions below these size-scales.|$|E

40|$|Topological <b>magnetic</b> <b>textures</b> - like skyrmions - {{have become}} {{a major player in}} the design of {{next-generation}} magnetic storage technology due to their stability and the control of their motion by ultra-low current densities. A major challenge to develop this new skyrmion-based technology is to achieve the controlled and deterministic creation of magnetic skyrmions without the need of complex setups. We demonstrate a solution to this challenge by showing how to create skyrmions and other <b>magnetic</b> <b>textures</b> in ferromagnetic thin films by means of a homogeneous DC current and without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This is possible by exploiting a static loss of stability arising from the interplay of current-induced spin-transfer torque and a spatially inhomogeneous magnetization, which can be achieved, e. g., by locally engineering the anisotropy, the magnetic field, or other magnetic interactions. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>textures</b> are created controllably, efficiently, and periodically with a period that can be tuned by the applied current strength. We propose specific experimental setups realizable with simple materials, such as cobalt based materials, to observe the periodic formation of skyrmions. We show that adding chiral interactions will not influence the basics of the generations but then influence the consequent dynamics with respect to the stabilization of topological textures. Our findings allow for the production of skyrmions on demand in simple ferromagnetic thin films by homogeneous DC currents.
