40|$|Wave Energy Converters (WECs) {{have been}} in {{development}} for several decades with some devices now coming close to commercial realities. As such, pilot projects are being developed, particularly in the UK and Ireland, to deploy WECs on a pre-commercial array scale. The ultimate ambition is to have multiple WECs installed in a ‘wave farm’ {{in a similar fashion}} to offshore wind farms. For large scale wind farms the inter-array and export electrical systems can represent more than 20 % of the project’s capital expenditure. Submarine power cables account for a large proportion of this cost. The same is expected to hold true for wave farms. This paper investigates the possibility of underrating and dynamically rating the electrical inter-array and export cable systems for wave farms in order to assess the cost savings that can be made. This paper will also look at a simulated WEC array power output time series. The aim is to establish whether the electrical equipment, particularly submarine cables, will operate outside its design parameters if under-rated based on <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>current.</b> This paper also investigates the WEC capacity factor effect on the overall economics of the array electrical system.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution of leakage radiation from two unshielded diagnostic-type X-ray tube housings. This information was used to determine the shielding required in the housings to bring them into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing, as set forth by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements in Report No. 33. Two special diagnostic X-ray tube units were used, one containing a rotating anode tube and the other a stationary anode tube. The only shielding supplied was that provided by the steel, oil-containing tube casing which surrounds the X-ray tube. A measurement of the distribution of leakage radiation on a sphere of one meter radius about the focal spot of the X-ray tube was made on each tube when the tube was operated at its <b>maximum</b> rated <b>continuous</b> <b>current</b> for its <b>maximum</b> rated operating voltage. From the leakage radiation measured, the thickness of lead shielding required to bring the X-ray tube housing into compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing was calculated. Lead shielding was placed on each of the X-ray tube housings, and measurements were made to determine if each housing was then in compliance with the definition of a diagnostic-type protective tube housing. As a result of this study, it was found that the distribution of leakage radiation from an unshielded diagnostic-type tube housing is non-uniform. The amount and location of shielding required in the housing is dependent upon the distribution of the leakage radiation, and is, therefore, a function of the design and rating of the X-ray tube used in the housing...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The brushless de (BLDC) motor is becoming widely used and popular in the small horsepower motor applications. Factors such as simplicity in control, low cost, high efficiency, low frame size, high torque per inertia, high power density and, most importantly, being br-ushless are the reasons that make the BLDC motor very attractive in motor drive applications. In this research a systematic approach to synchronous operation of the brushless DC (BLDC) motor has been investigated and implemented. This thesis establishes principles of synchronous operation of the BLDC motor, develops stable operating conditions, derives the required implementation formulas and introduces some new definitions. The synchronous system follows, open loop, a speed command. The system has been provided by two input references: current and speed. The current reference throughout the operation has been kept constant at the <b>maximum</b> applicable <b>continuous</b> <b>current</b> to obtain <b>maximum</b> torque. Current regulation has been achieved by hysteresis current control. The speed reference has been varied from zero speed to the desired speed linearly. Once speed reaches to the desired speed, it is kept constant at the desired speed. Since the motor operates synchronously and no position information has been used, the motor has to follow exactly the reference speed, otherwise pull out occurs. By this implementation, three operating points of the BLDC motor with synchronous operational system has been presented. One of the three operating points at maximum speed corresponds to maximum load operation...|$|R

40|$|Motors used {{to actuate}} powered {{prostheses}} generally under-utilize their torque capacity due to thermal {{limitations of the}} windings. This thesis investigates the effectiveness of increasing {{the rate of heat}} transfer away from the windings in order to enable running motors at higher currents than their rated maximum levels, thus raising this torque saturation limit. Simulation models and physical prototypes based on the RCTiger 100 KV U 8 brushless outrunner motor were built to observe the temperature of the windings as constant current was applied to the motor. The addition of a fan-based active cooling system allowed the motor to run at 142 % of its <b>maximum</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>current</b> rating for up to 56 seconds before winding temperatures exceeded 550 C, and limited temperature increase in simulation to 26 ' above ambient temperature when the full 35 A stall current was applied for one second. Although the simplified circuit model was not able to fully capture nonlinear thermal behavior of the motor, simulations were able to predict approximate heating time constants and time duration before windings reached threshold temperature for current ranges 5 - 15 A. Experimental and simulation results support the hypothesis that active cooling enables motors to run at their full torque potential for short periods of time, which holds promise for the use of cooling mechanisms in prosthetic applications. by Ava E.

40|$|Currently {{there are}} the {{beginnings}} of a commercial wave energy industry and the ultimate ambition will be to deploy Wave Energy Converters (WECs) in arrays, or wave farms, in a similar fashion to offshore wind. These arrays will require electrical networks to collect and export the generated electrical power to shore and onto the electrical grid. For large scale wind farms the inter-array and export electrical networks can represent more than 20 % of the project’s capital expenditure.
