5|$|The 47 districts {{from which}} Senators are elected are apportioned every ten {{years on the}} basis of population. Maryland's {{constitution}} explicitly defines the process for the drawing of these districts, requiring that the Governor <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>recommendation</b> of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and incumbent Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent slates in their districts. It is rare, however, for an incumbent to be challenged.|$|E

5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>recommendation</b> as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E

It is not uncommon for a bill to be voted to the Select Committee stage even by parties which do not support it — since Select Committees can recommend amendments to bills, parties will often not make a final decision on whether to back a bill until the Second Reading.|$|E
25|$|In August 1946, Torsten Nilsson {{suggested}} merging Aerotransport and SILA, {{but this}} had been rejected by both companies. A meeting was held on 28 May 1947 with the main owners of SILA, where Nilsson proposed a 50–50 state–private ownership in a merged company. While both parties saw the advantage of merging to rationalize operations, neither party was willing to let the other receive the chair. At the time, Aerotransport had just ordered ten DC-6 and was planning to start intercontinental flights to Africa and Asia. The minister appointed Torsten Nothin to lead a board to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>recommendation,</b> and then negotiate with SILA's owners for a merger. One issue was that the Swedes perceived that the privately owned DDL and DNL would not agree with a nationalization of SILA. The Swedish government chose not to contact the two other social democratic Scandinavian governments about partially nationalizing their own flag carriers.|$|E
25|$|Rolf {{served on}} Murray's {{transition}} team following his successful bid for Mayor of Seattle in 2013, {{and was named}} co-chair of the 23-person Income Inequality Advisory Committee, which addresses minimum wage and other social issues. In late December 2013, Murray announced plans to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour, which he had pledged to do during his election campaign, earning him an endorsement from Local 775 of SEIU. Simultaneously, Rolf was working alongside newly elected Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant, who had also advocated for a $15-per-hour minimum wage, to bring the issue into the mainstream and attract support for the policy from both Seattle Mayors Michael McGinn and Murray. Both politicians sought to earn the support of Rolf and Local 775 of SEIU {{in order to bring}} their agendas to fruition. The Income Inequality Advisory Committee was scheduled to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>recommendation</b> by April 30, 2014, allowing Murray the ability to submit a proposal to City Council by the end of July.|$|E
