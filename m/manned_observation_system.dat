40|$|A {{number of}} coastal and ocean <b>observation</b> <b>systems</b> exist {{throughout}} the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), but {{the network of}} systems is not currently linked or integrated and at present not fully implemented. The network of local systems are diverse, typically involving unique mandates and several different funding sources at various levels of permanence. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the ocean <b>observation</b> <b>systems</b> that currently exist in the GOM, and to identify and quantify the expected economic benefits that may result from the implementation of an integrated regional network. Improved ocean <b>observation</b> <b>systems</b> are expected to reduce the uncertainty of ocean/weather forecasting and to enhance the value of ocean/weather information throughout the Gulf region. The source of benefits and the size of activity from which improved ocean observation benefits may be derived are estimated for private sector, non-market, and public sector activities categorized according to marine transportation, commercial fishing, recreational fishing, search and rescue operations, and pollution management.

This <b>observation</b> <b>system</b> is constructed for purpose of observing the solar wind speed and scintillation index by using the normalized cross-spectrum of simultaneous dual-frequency IPS measurement. The system consists of a universal dual-frequency front-end and a dual-channel multi-function back-end specially designed for IPS.

40|$|Organized Autotelescopes for Serendipitous Event Survey (OASES) is {{an optical}} {{observation}} project {{that aims to}} detect and investigate stellar occultation events by kilometer-sized trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). In this project, multiple low-cost <b>observation</b> <b>systems</b> for wide-field and high-speed photometry were developed in order to detect rare and short-timescale stellar occultation events. The <b>observation</b> <b>system</b> consists of commercial off-the-shelf 0. 28 m aperture f/ 1. 58 optics providing a 2. 3 × 1. 8 square-degree field of view. A commercial CMOS camera is coupled to the optics to obtain full-frame imaging with a frame rate greater than 10 Hz. As of September 2016, this project exploits two <b>observation</b> <b>systems,</b> which are installed on Miyako Island, Okinawa, Japan. Recent improvements in CMOS technology in terms of high-speed imaging and low readout noise mean that the <b>observation</b> <b>systems</b> are capable of monitoring ∼ 2000 stars in the Galactic plane simultaneously with magnitudes down to V∼ 13. 0, providing ∼ 20 % photometric precision in light curves with a sampling cadence of 15. 4 Hz. This number of monitored stars is larger than for any other existing instruments for coordinated occultation surveys. In addition, a precise time synchronization method needed for simultaneous occultation detection is developed using faint meteors. The two OASES <b>observation</b> <b>systems</b> are executing coordinated monitoring observations of a dense stellar field in order to detect occultations by kilometer-sized TNOs for the first time.

With ISOGAME, one can perform <b>observation</b> <b>system</b> simulation experiments (OSSEs). A typical OSSE using ISOGAME would involve: (1) simulating various ionospheric conditions on global scales; (2) simulating ionospheric measurements made from a constellation of low-Earth-orbiters (LEOs), particularly Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation data, and from ground-based global GNSS networks; (3) conducting ionospheric data assimilation experiments with the Global Assimilative Ionospheric Model (GAIM); and (4) analyzing modeling results with visualization tools. ISOGAME can provide quantitative assessment of the accuracy of assimilative modeling with the interested <b>observation</b> <b>system.</b> Other <b>observation</b> <b>systems</b> besides those based on GNSS are also possible to analyze.
