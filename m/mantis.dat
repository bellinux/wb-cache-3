5|$|M. C. Escher's woodcut Dream {{depicts a}} human-sized <b>mantis</b> {{standing}} on a sleeping bishop. The 1957 film The Deadly <b>Mantis</b> features a <b>mantis</b> as a giant monster.|$|E
5|$|A {{cultural}} trope {{imagines the}} female <b>mantis</b> as a femme fatale. The idea is propagated in cartoons by Cable, Guy and Rodd, LeLievre, T. McCracken, and Mark Parisi, among others. It ends Isabella Rossellini's short {{film about the}} life of a praying <b>mantis</b> in her 2008 Green Porno season for the Sundance Channel.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, Cedar Point {{announced}} the pending closure of <b>Mantis</b> scheduled the following month. The park later revealed that <b>Mantis</b> wouldn't be removed {{but would be}} transformed into a floorless roller coaster design for the 2015 season. It reopened as Rougarou on May 9, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Rougarou, {{formerly}} known as <b>Mantis,</b> is a floorless roller coaster located at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio. Designed and built by Bolliger & Mabillard, the roller coaster originally opened in 1996 as a stand-up roller coaster called <b>Mantis,</b> {{which at the time}} was the tallest, fastest, and longest {{of its kind in the}} world. Cedar Point had planned to name the ride Banshee, but due to negative publicity following the announcement, the name was later changed to <b>Mantis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two species, the Chinese <b>mantis</b> and the European <b>mantis,</b> were {{deliberately}} {{introduced to}} North America {{in the hope}} that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture; they have spread widely in both the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|A {{genre of}} films {{has been based}} on {{oversized}} insects, including the pioneering 1954 Them!, featuring giant ants mutated by radiation, and the 1957 The Deadly <b>Mantis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The bird-dropping spider Ornithoscatoides decipiens, {{the flower}} <b>mantis</b> Hymenopus bicornis and other camouflaged hunters are described.|$|E
5|$|When {{directly}} threatened, many <b>mantis</b> species {{stand tall}} and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the <b>mantis</b> seem {{larger and more}} threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a <b>mantis</b> may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward {{the safety of the}} ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.|$|E
5|$|Although mantises {{are rarely}} {{mentioned}} in Ancient Greek sources, a female <b>mantis</b> in threat posture is accurately illustrated {{on a series}} of fifth-century BC silver coins, including didrachms, from Metapontum in Sicily.|$|E
5|$|As in {{closely related}} insect {{groups in the}} {{superorder}} Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the hemimetabolous insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 weeks as opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A <b>mantis</b> nymph grows bigger as it molts its exoskeleton. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ("short-winged"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a <b>mantis</b> depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4–8 weeks, while larger species may live 4–6 months.|$|E
5|$|In the 10th century AD, Byzantine era Adages, Suidas {{describes}} an insect resembling a slow-moving green locust with long front legs. He translates Zenobius 2.94 {{with the words}} seriphos (maybe a <b>mantis)</b> and graus, an old woman, implying a thin, dried-up stick of a body.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{appeared}} in mythology around the world from ancient times. Among the insect groups featuring in myths are the bee, butterfly, cicada, dragonfly, praying <b>mantis</b> and scarab beetle. Scarab beetles held religious and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt, Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality. In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to dragonflies, signifying the impossibility of immortality. Amongst the Arrernte Aborigines of Australia, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems. In {{the case of the}} San bushmen of the Kalahari, it is the praying <b>mantis</b> which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.|$|E
5|$|Mantises have large, {{triangular}} {{heads with}} a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple eyes, {{and a pair}} of antennae. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of <b>mantis</b> can rotate their heads nearly 180°.|$|E
5|$|Mantises were {{considered}} to have supernatural powers by early civilizations, including Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Assyria. A cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines the female <b>mantis</b> as a femme fatale. Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as pets.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis is also {{employed}} by some predators and parasites to lure their prey. For example, a flower <b>mantis</b> mimics {{a particular kind}} of flower, such as an orchid. This tactic has occasionally been used in warfare, for example with heavily armed Q-ships disguised as merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|On September 2, 2014, {{after weeks}} of leaking clues that a major {{announcement}} was forthcoming, Cedar Point released a statement that <b>Mantis</b> would close on October 19, 2014. According to the park, the roller coaster had given over 22 million rides since its debut. However, Cedar Point revealed on September 18, 2014, that <b>Mantis</b> wouldn't be removed, but instead would be converted into a floorless roller coaster complete with new trains, new colors, and a new theme. It reopened as Rougarou, {{the name of a}} legendary creature in French folklore that draws comparisons to the mythical werewolf, on May 9, 2015.|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 1995, Cedar Point {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new roller coaster, which would open as the tallest, fastest, and longest stand-up roller coaster in the world. The ride was to be named Banshee after the mythical wailing ghost in Irish folklore. In the days following the announcement, there was some negative reaction from the public regarding the term Banshee, which in the dictionary is described as a female spirit that warns of an impending family death. On November 14, 1995, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name <b>Mantis,</b> which later became the ride's official name. As a result of the name change, its logo was also changed to resemble a <b>mantis.</b> The discarded name would later be reused for Banshee at Kings Island which opened in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Other orders {{such as the}} Dermaptera (earwigs), Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets), Mantodea (praying <b>mantis)</b> and Blattodea (cockroaches) have rigid {{leathery}} forewings that aren't flapped while flying, {{sometimes called}} tegmen (pl. tegmina), elytra, or pseudoelytron.|$|E
5|$|The creek whaler feeds {{predominantly}} {{on small}} teleost fishes (including threadfin breams and lizardfishes) and crustaceans (including penaeid prawns and <b>mantis</b> shrimps); cephalopods are also infrequently consumed. Known parasites {{of this species}} include the tapeworm Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, and a nematode in the genus Pulchrascaris.|$|E
5|$|Within the Malacostraca, no fossils {{are known}} for krill, while both Hoplocarida and Phyllopoda contain {{important}} groups that are now extinct as well as extant members (Hoplocarida: <b>mantis</b> shrimp are extant, while Aeschronectida are extinct; Phyllopoda: Canadaspidida are extinct, while Leptostraca are extant). Cumacea and Isopoda are both known from the Carboniferous, as are the first true <b>mantis</b> shrimp. In the Decapoda, prawns and polychelids appear in the Triassic, and shrimp and crabs appear in the Jurassic; however, the great radiation of crustaceans occurred in the Cretaceous, particularly in crabs, {{and may have been}} driven by the adaptive radiation of their main predators, bony fish. The first true lobsters also appear in the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} robot {{inspired by}} the forelegs of the praying <b>mantis</b> has front legs that allow the robot to walk, climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower <b>mantis</b> resembles {{a particular kind of}} flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard is hard to see in long grass.|$|E
5|$|Among the insects, in both Japan and Europe, as {{far back}} as ancient Greece and Rome, a {{butterfly}} was seen as the personification of a person's soul, both while they were alive and after their death. The scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt, while the praying <b>mantis</b> was considered a god in southern African Khoi and San tradition for its praying posture.|$|E
5|$|For its {{transition}} to Rougarou, the ride received three new floorless trains which allows riders' legs to dangle freely above the track, {{as there is}} no floor between rows. Each has the same 32-rider configuration as the previous trains on <b>Mantis.</b> Riders are also secured by an over-the-shoulder harness with an interlocking seatbelt.|$|E
5|$|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was {{released}} on May 5, 2017, again {{written and directed by}} James Gunn. Pratt, Saldana, Bautista, Diesel, Cooper, Rooker, Gillan, and Sean Gunn all reprise their roles in the film, and are joined by Pom Klementieff as <b>Mantis,</b> Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, Chris Sullivan as Taserface, and Kurt Russell as Quill's father Ego.|$|E
5|$|Malacostracans {{live in a}} {{wide range}} of marine and {{freshwater}} habitats, and three orders have terrestrial members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the woodlice) and Decapoda (terrestrial hermit crabs, crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and terrestrial crayfish). They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although some, such as the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and some, such as <b>mantis</b> shrimps, are carnivores.|$|E
5|$|Mantises can be loosely {{categorized}} as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a <b>mantis</b> has {{two sets of}} wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.|$|E
5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} <b>mantis,</b> the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment {{about as long as}} the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of the}} femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the <b>mantis</b> its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{omission}} was {{the removal}} of the cutscene prior to the Psycho <b>Mantis</b> battle in which he reads the player's memory card and activates the vibration function of the player's controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating <b>Mantis</b> was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E
5|$|Over 2,400 {{species of}} <b>mantis</b> in about 430 genera are recognized. They are {{predominantly}} found in tropical regions, but some live in temperate areas. The systematics of mantises {{have long been}} disputed. Mantises, along with stick insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the order Orthoptera with the cockroaches (now Blattodea) and rock crawlers (now Grylloblattodea). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the cockroaches and termites into the order Dictyoptera, suborder Mantodea.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the nervous}} shark {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes (including silversides, smelt-whitings, wrasses, and grunters). Crustaceans (including prawns, crabs, and <b>mantis</b> shrimps) and molluscs (predominantly cephalopods but also bivalves and gastropods) constitute secondary food sources. This shark is also known to occasionally prey on the semiaquatic snakes Cerberus rynchops and Fordonia leucobalia. A known parasite {{of the nervous}} shark is the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini.|$|E
5|$|The <b>mantis</b> thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5|$|Two {{martial arts}} {{separately}} developed in China have movements and fighting strategies {{based on those}} of the <b>mantis.</b> As one of these arts was developed in northern China, {{and the other in}} southern parts of the country, the arts are nowadays referred to (both in English and Chinese) as 'Northern Praying Mantis' and 'Southern Praying Mantis'. Both are very popular in China, and have also been exported to the West in recent decades.|$|E
5|$|At its opening, Chang {{claimed the}} record for the tallest {{vertical}} loop of any roller coaster in the world. At the time, it was the world's tallest, fastest and longest stand-up coaster. It also claimed records for the largest drop and the most inversions on a stand-up roller coaster. All of these records had eclipsed those set by <b>Mantis,</b> which opened at Cedar Point in 1996. In 1998 Riddler's Revenge opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain, and Chang surrendered its titles.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} September 2012 and took roughly eight months to complete. The park {{built a new}} {{entrance}} plaza featuring the keyhole towers as the centerpiece. The roller coaster replaced Disaster Transport and Space Spiral, both demolished {{during the summer of}} 2012, bringing Cedar Point back to its former total of 16 roller coasters. It was Cedar Point's first new roller coaster since Maverick debuted in 2007, and the third B coaster in the park following Raptor (1994) and <b>Mantis</b> (1996). In 2013, GateKeeper was the most frequently-ridden roller coaster at Cedar Point, and it ranked 28th among steel roller coasters in the annual Golden Ticket Awards poll from Amusement Today.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy co-writer Nicole Perlman {{confirmed}} that Gunn {{would return to}} write and direct the sequel. Chris Pratt returns for the sequel as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, {{along with the other}} Guardians from the first film as well as additional cast members. They are joined by Pom Klementieff as <b>Mantis,</b> and Kurt Russell as Ego. In June 2015, the film's title was revealed as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Filming began in February 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta, and concluded in June 2016. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 premiered in Tokyo on April 10, 2017, and was released on May 5, 2017.|$|E
