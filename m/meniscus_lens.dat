25|$|Convex-concave (meniscus) lenses can {{be either}} {{positive}} or negative, depending on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces. A negative <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> has a steeper concave surface and is thinner at the centre than at the periphery. Conversely, a positive <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> has a steeper convex surface and is thicker at the centre than at the periphery. An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light. All real lenses have nonzero thickness, however, which makes a real lens with identical curved surfaces slightly positive. To obtain exactly zero optical power, a <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> must have slightly unequal curvatures {{to account for the}} effect of the lens' thickness.|$|E
25|$|All {{formulas}} {{require an}} {{estimation of the}} position that the IOL will sit in the eye, a factor known as the ELP, which is defined as the distance between the cornea and the IOL. ELP correlates with the placement of the IOL inside the eye, whether it is in the anterior chamber in the sulcus or in the capsular bag. It also varies with the implant’s configuration and the location of its optical center. For example, the use of a <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> calls for a smaller ELP value than a biconvex IOL.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{component}} {{is concerned with}} producing a reduced inverted image on the retina. The eye's optical system consists of not only two but four surfaces—two on the cornea, two on the lens. Rays are refracted toward the midline. Distant rays, due to their parallel nature, converge to a point on the retina. The cornea admits light at the greatest angle. The aqueous and vitreous humors both have a refractive index of 1.336-1.339, whereas the cornea has a refractive index of 1.376. Because the change in refractive index between cornea and aqueous humor is relatively small compared to the change at the air–cornea interface, it has a negligible refractive effect, typically -6 dioptres. The cornea {{is considered to be}} a positive <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
50|$|Concerning the {{curvature}} of the lens elements, the following statements can be drawn: Acceptable lens shapes are most bi-convex, plano-convex and mild meniscus shapes. Not unacceptable but hard to mould are bi-concave <b>lenses,</b> steep <b>meniscus</b> <b>lenses,</b> and lenses with severe features (e.g. a bump on a convex surface).In general, plano-curved lenses are easier to mould than lenses with both sides curved since matching of flat faces is easier.Moulding concave forms with small centre thickness is difficult due to sticking of the moulded part to the mould occurring {{as a result of}} the different thermal expansion coefficients.Furthermore it is recommended to avoid undercuts and sharp edges. For the lens design it should be considered that the lens has to be mountable in measurement systems.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Results of a solar thermophotovoltaic (STPV) system {{study are}} reported. Suntrackers, {{sunlight}} concentrators and STPV modules were designed, fabricated and tested at {{indoor and outdoor}} conditions. Developed sunlight concentrators of refractive- and reflective-types with secondary quartz <b>meniscus</b> <b>lenses</b> ensured the high concentration ratio exceeding 7000 x, which is necessary for achieving the high efficiency of the concentrator-emitter system owing to trap escaping radiation. Several types of STPV modules have been developed and tested under concentrated sunlight. Temperature as high as 2000 K was obtained in a 12 mm dia and 15 mm length tungsten/tantalum emitters in vacuum, illuminated by concentrated sunlight. Photocurrent density of 4. 5 A/cm 2 was registered in a photoreceiver based on 1 x 1 cm 2 GaSb cells under a solar powered tungsten emitter. Cell efficiency as high as 19 % has been measured in this STPV system with solar powered tungsten emitter heated to ~ 2000 K. ETA = 27 % was estimated for the tungsten emitter spectrum cut-off at λ> 1820 nm. Analysis of various parameters, influencing {{the performance of the}} developed STPV systems is presented. The ways for the STPV system efficiency increase up to 30 % and higher are considered:- improvement of the emitter radiation selectivity and application of selective filters for better matching the spectra of emitter radiation and cell photoresponse;- application of the cells with a back-surface reflector for recycling the sub-bandgap photons;- development of the low-bandgap tandem TPV cells for better utilisation of the radiation spectra...|$|R

40|$|That {{minimizing}} {{the mass of}} space optical remote sensor {{at the same time}} guaranteeing of structural rigidity and surface shape accuracy, became a new critical research topic. This paper achieves detailed design of <b>meniscus</b> rectangular <b>lens</b> body structure by taking the choice of materials, design of supporting structure and lightweight form of mirror into account. And we established lightweight concrete of the mirror under self-weight by the method of topological optimization design. For the optimization, we used a 3 -D model of the rectangular mirror and calculated based on that making minimum weight of the mirror as an objective function constrained by the displacement of the mirror surface. Finally finite element analysis method was adopted to get the optimization results analyzed and compared with the traditional triangular lightweight model. Analysis results prove that: the new mirror is superior to the traditional model in surface accuracy and structural rigidity, PV value, RMS value and the lightweight rate. With enough high dynamic-static stiffness and thermal stability, this kind of mirror can meet the demand under the self-weight and the random vibration environment respectively. So this article puts forward a new idea in the lightweight design of rectangular mirror. Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Optics and Electronics (IOE); Chinese Optical Society (COS...|$|R
50|$|A {{box camera}} {{is a simple}} type of camera, {{the most common form}} being a {{cardboard}} or plastic box with a lens in one end and film at the other. They were very popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The lenses are often single element designs <b>meniscus</b> fixed focus <b>lens,</b> or in better quality box cameras a doublet lens with minimal (if any) possible adjustments to the aperture or shutter speeds. Because of the inability to adjust focus, the small lens aperture and the low sensitivity of the sensitive materials available, these cameras work best in brightly lit day-lit scenes when the subject is within the hyperfocal distance for the lens and of subjects that move little during the exposure. Eventually, box cameras with photographic flash, shutter and aperture adjustment were introduced, allowing indoor photos.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to fabricate and characterize an adaptive optofluidic lens device with aberration control. In this work, an electric field is employed as a driving tool to manipulate the liquid-liquid interface for suppressing spherical aberration by using a single flat unstructured electrode. The equilibrium <b>lens</b> <b>meniscus</b> profiles are determined by the balance of Laplace pressure and Maxwell stress. It involves understanding the response of a liquid drop under the influence of electric field and further discerning the optimum drop shapes which would yield the best optical performance. First, lenses are characterized by capturing the side view images of meniscus profiles and calculating the Longitudinal spherical aberration (LSA) by geometrical ray tracing. Subsequently, ray tracing analysis of optically measured lens profiles is performed on Zemax for numerically computing the Zernike spherical aberration (ZSA) coefficients and other standard optical metrics. Next, all-electrically controlled optofluidic lens device with EW-based pressure controller and electrically adjustable lens shape is designed and fabricated. The optical performance of lens device is evaluated by experimentally measuring the ZSA coefficients by using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWS). The measured range of EW-tunability of focal length and spherical aberration is 10. 1 mm to 26. 76 mm and 0. 059 waves to 0. 003 waves respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{aesthetic}} utilised by {{the early}} pictorialist photographers {{in their attempts to}} get artistic photography recognised as one of the Fine arts, rather than merely a method of mechanical reproduction, was one which relied on the use of soft focusing with the resulting hazing of outlines to produce images which would evoke emotion in the viewer. Printing methods which allowed for the manipulation of the finished image, introducing the notion of ‘handwork’ and therefore a degree of artistic intervention by the photographer, were also heavily utilised by some of these practitioners. Processes such as gum-bichromate, which produced a multi-layered printed image, were used by photographers such as Demachy and Steichen. As a genre pictorialism was at its most popular between 1885 and 1915, and spread through both Europe and North America with the formation of dedicated pictorialist photography groups such as the British “Brotherhood of the Linked Ring” and the American “Photo-Secessionists”. Prior to the outbreak of World War I there was a growing feeling that the genre was becoming dated and insipid, with some of the more established pictorialist photographers moving into new directions such as towards a more “straight” print. During the 1960 ’s and 70 ’s there was a trend towards using ‘toy’ cameras, specifically the Diana camera and the many Diana clone models. These were medium format cameras consisting of a plastic body, plastic lens and very basic operational and focus controls. Photographers such as Nancy Rexroth managed to utilise the limited optical quality of these lenses and produce work which was quite ethereal in nature, capturing an almost dreamlike quality in the finished print. This trend has continued with many new models of toy cameras being produced such as the Holga, which has taken over the place of the Diana camera in the medium format market, becoming more and more popular. The question that I am interested in addressing is whether the optical defects inherent in a single <b>meniscus</b> plastic <b>lens</b> make these cameras a suitable medium to reproduce the aesthetic of the original pictorialist images and whether the increased use and popularity of these cameras could be seen as creating a neo-pictorialist genre for the new century. ...|$|R
50|$|His optical {{work was}} {{important}} as well, {{where he is}} remembered for his observations of dark Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum (1802), which {{eventually led to the}} discovery of the elements in the Sun. He invented the camera lucida (1807), the reflecting goniometer (1809), and the Wollaston prism. He also developed the first lens specifically for camera lens called Wollaston's <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens,</b> or just <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens,</b> in 1812. The lens was designed to improve the image projected by the camera obscura. By changing the shape of the lens, Wollaston was able to project a flatter image, eliminating much of the distortion that was a problem with many of that day's biconvex lenses.|$|E
50|$|A {{meniscus}} corrector is {{a negative}} <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> {{that is used to}} correct spherical aberration in image-forming optical systems such as catadioptric telescopes. It works by having the equal but opposite spherical aberration of the objective it is designed to correct (usually a spherical mirror).|$|E
50|$|If {{the lens}} is biconcave or plano-concave, a {{collimated}} {{beam of light}} passing through the lens is diverged (spread); the lens is thus called a negative or diverging lens. The beam, after passing through the lens, appears to emanate from a particular point on the axis {{in front of the}} lens. The distance from this point to the lens is also known as the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a converging lens.Convex-concave (meniscus) lenses can be either positive or negative, depending on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces. A negative <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> has a steeper concave surface and is thinner at the centre than at the periphery. Conversely, a positive <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> has a steeper convex surface and is thicker at the centre than at the periphery. An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light. All real lenses have nonzero thickness, however, which makes a real lens with identical curved surfaces slightly positive. To obtain exactly zero optical power, a <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> must have slightly unequal curvatures to account for the effect of the lens' thickness.|$|E

5000|$|The double Gauss lens {{consists}} of two back-to-back Gauss lenses (a design with a positive <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> on the object side and a negative <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> on the image side) making two positive meniscus lenses on the outside with two negative meniscus lenses inside them. The symmetry {{of the system and}} the splitting of the optical power into many elements reduces the optical aberrations within the system. There are many variations of the design.

The design forms the basis for many camera lenses in use today, especially the wide-aperture standard lenses used on 35 mm and other small-format cameras. It can offer good results up to [...] with a wide field of view, and has sometimes been made at 1.0. Extra wide aperture f/1.4 Double Gauss lenses usually have seven elements for extra aberration control. Modern super wide aperture models can have eight or more elements. Moderate aperture f/2.8 versions can be simplified to five elements.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{invention}} of the wide-field Schmidt camera in the early 1930s, at least four optical designers in early 1940s war-torn Europe {{came up with the idea}} of replacing the complicated Schmidt corrector plate with a simpler <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens,</b> including Albert Bouwers, Dmitri Dmitrievich Maksutov, K. Penning, and Dennis Gabor. All of these designs used full aperture correctors (a meniscus corrector shell) to create a wide-field telescope with little or no coma or astigmatism. Albert Bouwers built a prototype meniscus telescope in August 1940 and patented it in February 1941. His design had the mirror and <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> with surfaces that had a common centre of curvature, called a [...] "concentric" [...] or [...] "monocentric" [...] telescope. The design had an ultrawide field of view but did not correct chromatic aberration and was only suitable as a monochromatic astronomical camera. Dmitri Maksutov built a prototype for a similar type of meniscus telescope, the Maksutov telescope, in October 1941, and patented it in November of that same year. His design corrected most spherical aberration and also corrected for chromatic aberration by placing a weakly negative-shaped meniscus corrector closer to the primary mirror. Dennis Gabor’s 1941 design was a non-monocentric meniscus corrector. Wartime secrecy kept these designers from knowing about each other's design, making each invention independent.|$|E
50|$|In 1804 William Hyde Wollaston {{invented a}} {{positive}} <b>meniscus</b> <b>lens</b> for eyeglasses.

Niépce began using Wollaston Meniscus in 1828. Daguerre used this lens in his experiments, but since it was a single-element lens that lacked any chromatic aberration control it was impossible to focus accurately with the blue-sensitive media in the daguerreotype process.|$|E
