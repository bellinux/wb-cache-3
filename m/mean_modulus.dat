The material properties of the polymer allow it to be injected into irregularly shaped voids in vivo and provide mechanical stability as well as function as a bone regeneration scaffold. We fabricated a series of biomaterial composites, comprised of varying quantities of PPF, NaCl and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), into the shape of right circular cylinders and tested the mechanical properties in four-point bending and compression.

40|$|To {{encourage}} {{new developments}} in building technology, a solid basis for building code requirements is needed. Fire endurance is a code requirement, yet no objective procedure exists for computing a structure’s chances of failing (degree of risk) in a fire. However, a model for predicting the fire endurance of part of a structure, a conventional unprotected wood joist floor, is available. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the fire endurance performance of an unprotected wood joist floor for use in the model. Eleven ASTM Standard E 119 floor tests were conducted. All the floors were 2 by 10 Douglas-fir wood joists, sixteen inches on center with 2 3 / 32 -inch-thick plywood as the floor sheathing. In addition to one trial test, five tests were conducted using a live load of 11. 35 lb/ft 2. For the other five tests, the live load was 79. 2 lb/ft 2. Twenty joists were tested for modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture. The joist population had a <b>mean</b> <b>modulus</b> of rupture of 5, 280 lb/in. 2 and a <b>mean</b> <b>modulus</b> of elasticity of 1, 530, 000 lb/in. 2. For the five floors loaded to 11. 35 lb/ft 2, the mean time for initial joist failure was 17. 9 min with a coefficient of variation (COV) of 3. 7 %. For the five floors loaded to 79. 2 lb/ft 2, the mean time was 6. 5 min with a COV of 11. 6 %. Based on linear interpolation of these results, first joist failure would have occurred in 13. 1 min if a 40 lb/ft 2 live load had been used, which is the typical live loading specified in the building codes for residential one- and two-family dwellings. As a result of this study, fire-resistance performance of a wood floor is known for a specific population of wood joists with known structural properties. These results can be used to verify and revise the model for predicting fire endurance...|$|E

To answer this question, for finite element models of periodic structures of Mooney-type material with different structural geometry and subject to large strain deformations, we identify a nonlinear elastic modulus as the ratio between the mean effective stress and the mean effective strain in the solid cell walls, and show that this modulus increases when the thickness of the walls increases, as well as when the number of cells increases while the volume of solid material remains fixed. Since, under the specified conditions, this nonlinear elastic modulus increases also as the corresponding mean stress increases, either the <b>mean</b> <b>modulus</b> or the mean stress can be employed as indicator when the optimum wall thickness or number of cells is sought...|$|E
