50|$|A sponge ferment {{is usually}} a sticky process that uses part of the flour, part {{or all of the}} water, and part or all of the yeast of a total- or straight-dough formula. Highly liquid sponges of batter consistencies are mixed with a whip, spoon, or fork. Lower hydration, stiffer sponges are lightly mixed <b>or</b> kneaded <b>just</b> <b>until</b> the dough begins to develop. The sponge is allowed to rest and ferment {{for a period of time}} in an {{environment}} of a desired temperature and humidity. When the sponge's fermentation time has elapsed or it has reached a desired volumetric growth characteristic, the final dough's ingredients are added. The gluten is developed in the mixing or kneading process, and it may then be processed through further work and rest cycles before being proofed then baked.|$|R

5000|$|Frank Rich in {{his review}} for The New York Times wrote: [...] "Big Deal, the new Fosse musical at the Broadway, {{contains}} exactly one of those show stoppers, and attention must be paid. If only for 10 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> so <b>just</b> {{before the end of}} Act I, Mr. Fosse makes an audience remember what is (and has been) missing from virtually every other musical in town. The number is set to the old song Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar, and it unfolds in a Chicago ballroom of the 1930s called (need I tell you?) Paradise...The disappointment of Big Deal is that even Mr. Fosse, one of the form's last magicians, can conjure up that joy so rarely. There are some other pleasurable passages in this musical - period songs (or snatches of them) agreeably sung or danced by talented performers - but this is a mostly lackluster effort that often seems to be lumbering clumsily about." ...|$|R

5000|$|Many Native American arrowheads {{have been}} found in Cannondale's level meadows, and a large flat rock {{on the east side of}} the {{railroad}} tracks, south of Honey Hill Road, was purportedly a [...] "Dancing Rock" [...] of local Indians. By the 1720s there were no dangerous Indians in the area around Wilton, but there are reports of individual Indians in or close to Cannondale coexisting with English settlers in the early 18th century. According to one report, an Indian lived in a wigwam near the present intersection of School Road and Danbury Road, at the edge of Cannondale <b>or</b> <b>just</b> to the southwest of it. According to Captain Daniel Hurlbutt Jr. (1740-1827), he was nursed by an Indian woman as an infant near 236 Hurlbutt Street (at the southern end of Cannondale <b>or</b> <b>just</b> beyond it), <b>until</b> his father, fearing the woman's milk might be a negative influence on his son, stopped the practice.|$|R

He was in some respects not an ungenerous man, but though he must, Grace fancied, have seen how meagrely they fared, such a course had evidently never suggested itself to him, and in that fact lay the sting.

'The first time we most of us do funk it.

[...] Draiman then joined the band in 1996 and the band was renamed Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he suggested to name the band [...] "Disturbed," [...] Draiman said, [...] "It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense." ...|$|R

It is the first real insight into why Elminster is [...] "Elminster". It starts with an overview of his tragic childhood, on to his even rougher life growing up trying to hide who he is. Then as a thief he sneaks into a closed temple of Mystra to defile it. He is about to set to his task when he is spotted by a mage but then saved by the Lady of mysteries and given a chance to slay the mage that was to slay him. After he debated with the Goddess over {{whether or not it is}} right to use magic he let the mage go. Mystra then helps to hide him from those who might want him to be used in their plots, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> kill him, <b>until</b> he has the power to take his revenge.|$|R

5000|$|While {{devices for}} {{circular}} end-to-end anastomosis of digestive tract are widely used, {{in spite of}} intensive research [...] circular staplers for vascular anastomosis never had yet significant impact on standard hand (Carrel) suture technique. Apart from the different modality of coupling of vascular (everted) in respect to digestive (inverted) stumps, the main basic reason could be that, particularly for small vessels, the manuality and precision required just for positioning on vascular stumps and actioning any device cannot be significantly inferior to that required {{to carry out the}} standard hand suture, then making of little utility the use of any device. An exception to that however could be organ transplantation where these two phases, i.e.device positioning at the vascular stumps and device actioning, can be carried out in different time, by different surgical team, in safe conditions when the time required does not influence donor organ preservation, i.e. at the back table in cold ischemia condition for the donor organ and after native organ removal in the recipient. This is finalized to make as brief as possible the donor organ dangerous warm ischemia phase that can be contained in the couple of <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> less necessary <b>just</b> to connect the device's ends and actioning the stapler.|$|R

40|$|The normal {{operating}} temperature range of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack for automotive application lies between – 20 °C and 80 °C. Safe freeze start should be possible down to – 30 °C [1], while the start-up time of the fuel cell vehicle should be clearly shorter than a <b>minute,</b> <b>or</b> better <b>just</b> a few seconds. However, in most climatic regions the temperature stability of the stack at higher temperatures is even more interesting to be explored, {{in order to meet}} specific environmental or operative conditions. The work presented here concerns the characterization of a 30 -cell PEMFC stack developed at the German Aerospace Center designed for operation in an extended temperature range up to 120 °C. The feasibility to operate in a broader temperature range can be of particular relevance in two possible scenarios, represented by vehicles running in hot areas like deserts, or by long uphill drive (e. g. during mountain driving) that requires higher power with simultaneous slow average speed, and thus with minimized air cooling. This would contribute to the improvement of cooling system components with scaled down dimensions, which in turn would lead to a reduced vehicle weight and thus to an overall lower fuel consumption. In this contribution we present the current-voltage characteristic curves measured on the 30 -cell stack and the homogeneity obtained along the cells. Moreover, in order to investigate the stack behaviour at extended {{operating temperature}}s, we performed a series of 20 temperature cycles from 90 to 120 °C, operating at a galvanostatic controlled current of 70 A, that corresponded to an electrical stack power output of approx. 1. 5 kW. The results are promising, since only a slight stack voltage decrease was observed. Furthermore, the results of a 1000 h long-term stability test are shown, whose focus lies on the evaluation of the possible lifetime and the related overall cells degradation. Literature: [1] E.
