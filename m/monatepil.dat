40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>monatepil,</b> a new calcium {{antagonist}} with a 1 -blocking activity, and nitrendipine on li poprotein and carbohydrate metabolism in 86 pa tients with mild-to-moderate hypertension {{were examined in}} a randomized, open-label, multicenter (32 hospitals) study. Thirty-nine patients treated with <b>monatepil</b> and 33 patients treated with nitren dipine completed the 12 -week study. <b>Monatepil</b> and nitrendipine each significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Changes in heart rate were not seen in either group. <b>Monatepil</b> administration significantly decreased total choles terol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the LDL cholesterol to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio, apolipoprotein (Apo) Β levels, and H b A l c levels, whereas no changes in these measurements were observed in nitren-dipine-treated patients. <b>Monatepil</b> also signifi cantly decreased lipoprotein(a) levels, {{but there were no}} significant changes in HDL cholesterol, Apo-AI, or Apo-E levels. After nitrendipine treat ment, the C peptide concentration decreased sig nificantly, although no significant changes were observed in fasting blood glucose or immunoreac tive insulin levels. On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that <b>monatepil</b> belongs to a new class of antihypertensive calcium antagonist with favorable carbohydrate metabolism and lipid-low-ering activity, although the clinical importance of these findings has not been established.

40|$|A multicenter, open-label {{trial in}} Japan {{examined}} the efficacy; safety, and optimal dose of <b>monatepil</b> (AJ- 2615) as monotherapy and in combination ther apy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or β-blockers. Patients with essential hypertension {{who had never}} been treated or had been refractory to conventional antihypertensive agents were enrolled in the trial. During a 4 -week control period patients assigned to monotherapy received placebo and those as signed to combination therapy received an ACE inhibitor or β-blocker and placebo. Patients with systolic blood pressure (BP) > 160 mm Hg and dia stolic BP> 95 mm Hg {{at the end of the}} control pe riod were enrolled in the study. The initial dose of <b>monatepil</b> was 30 mg/day in monotherapy and 15 mg/day in combination therapy; the daily dose was titrated to 60 mg/day according to the antihyperten sive response. The treatment period was 8 to 12 weeks. Blood pressure decreased from 168 ± 8 / 100 ± 6 to 142 ± 9 / 85 ± 7 mm Hg (SD) with <b>monatepil</b> monotherapy, from 171 ± 11 / 102 ± 6 to 141 ± 9 / 84 ± 6 mm Hg in combination with ACE inhibitors, and from 175 ± 13 / 102 ± 7 to 153 ± 21 / 91 ± 9 mm Hg in combination with β-blockers (P 13 mm Hg were defined as responders, the re sponse rate was 80. 4 %, 78. 1 %, and 51. 6 % in the respective groups. <b>Monatepil</b> did not cause ortho static hypotension; adverse effects were observed in 9. 8 % of the monotherapy patients and 7. 9 % of combination therapy patients. The most frequent side effect was mild-to-moderate headache. The optimal daily dose was considered to be 30 to 60 mg, with a mean dose of 45. 6 ± 15. 1 mg in mono therapy, of 38. 9 ± 17. 4 mg in ACE inhibitor com bination therapy, and of 36. 8 ± 18. 5 mg in β-blocker combination therapy. Therefore <b>monatepil</b> appears to be an effective antihyperten sive agent. Am J Hypertens 1994; 7 : 141 S- 145...|$|E
