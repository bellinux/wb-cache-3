25|$|While {{working in}} London {{in the early}} 1970s with John R. Vane (Nobel prize in Medicine, 1983), he participated in the {{discovery}} of the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins by aspirin-like drugs. At that time, he proposed that the mechanism of the analgesic action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was due to the prevention of pain receptor sensitization which results from an inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandins. This hypothesis was supported by further work from his laboratory and from many other investigators. His studies on the basic mechanisms involved in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia led to the discovery that a select class of analgesics like <b>metamizole,</b> in contrast to the classical NSAIDs, are able to counteract the ongoing sensitization of the primary sensory neuron via the stimulation of the arginine/nitric oxide pathway. He recently (December 2008) characterized a phenomenon described as retrograde sensitization of the primary sensory neuron, which emphasizes the importance of the peripheral component of the inflammatory pain. His group made a relevant contribution to the role of bradykinin and of cytokines in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. He found that among the cytokines, interleukin 1b mediates the endogenous release of prostaglandins and IL-8 is responsible {{for the development of the}} sympathetic hyperalgesia. In this area he described an antagonist of IL-1 that is now being developed as a model for a new class of analgesics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Metamizole</b> is generic, and in {{countries}} where it is marketed, it is available under many brand names.|$|E
5000|$|Its precise {{mechanism}} of action is unknown, although {{it is believed that}} inhibiting brain and spinal cord prostaglandin (fat-like molecules that are involved in inflammation, pain and fever) synthesis might be involved. Recently, researchers uncovered another potential mechanism involving <b>metamizole</b> being a prodrug. In this proposal, not yet verified by other researchers, the <b>metamizole</b> itself breaks down into other chemicals that are the actual active agents. The result is a couple of cannabinoid and NSAID arachidonic acid conjugates (although not in the strict chemical meaning of the word) of metamizole's breakdown products. Despite this studies in animals have found that the first cannabinoid receptor is not involved in the analgesia induced by <b>metamizole.</b> Although it seems to inhibit fevers caused by prostaglandins, especially prostaglandin E2. It appears to produce its therapeutic effects by means of its metabolites, especially N-methyl-4-aminoantipyrine (MAA) and 4-aminoantipyrine (AA).|$|E

50|$|<b>Metamizole</b> has a {{potential}} of haematologic (blood-related) toxicity (blood dyscrasias), but causes less kidney, cardiovascular, and GI toxicity than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

50|$|In some {{countries}} of Eastern Europe, Corvalol {{is believed to}} be safe enough to use in recommended doses without prescription. It is widely used to treat elevated blood pressure and as a general-purpose tranquilizer/sedative. Despite the -lol suffix, the drug is not a beta-blocker. Corvalol is so common in Eastern Europe that, in 1996, the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation included it in the list of mandatory items in all Russian passenger vehicle first aid kits, alongside such drugs as aspirin, <b>metamizole</b> sodium (branded Analgin), nitroglycerin, and activated charcoal.|$|E

40|$|<b>Metamizole</b> {{is an old}} {{analgesic}} agent. Its use {{is highly}} controversial due to its capacity to induce agranulocytosis, a rapid and severe fall of neutrophil granulocytes with risk of fatal outcome. Despite of this debate and {{withdrawal from the market}} in several countries, the use of <b>metamizole</b> increased {{in the last ten years}} in Switzerland as well as in Germany. The goal of this PhD-thesis project was therefore to improve our understanding of the clinical toxicity of <b>metamizole.</b> The work should contribute to a better understanding of the risk-benefit profile and promote the safe use of <b>metamizole.</b> In a first approach, we descriptively analyzed worldwide pharmacovigilance data concerning adverse effects related to <b>metamizole.</b> The main objective was to characterize spontaneously reported cases of hematological adverse drug reactions associated with <b>metamizole</b> as suspected drug regarding appearance, course, and severity of the reactions. The worldwide case safety reports were selected from the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report Database (VigibaseTM), the national reports from the National Pharmacovigilance Database from Swissmedic.

40|$|WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: <b>Metamizole</b> was {{withdrawn}} from {{the market in the}} United States and several European countries following reports of fatal agranulocytosis among users, but is still available in many countries in Europe, South America and Asia. Over the past several decades, a number of epidemiologic studies have been conducted to quantify the risk of agranulocytosis and other adverse effects associated with <b>metamizole</b> and other non-narcotic analgesics. The objective {{of this study was to}} perform a systematic review of the safety of <b>metamizole.</b> METHODS: Epidemiologic studies published between 1 January 1980 and 15 December 2014 were identified through systematic searches of PubMed and Google Scholar; the reference sections of selected articles were also reviewed to identify potentially relevant studies. Studies included in this review focused on the safety of <b>metamizole,</b> that is on outcomes such as haematologic abnormalities, gastrointestinal bleeding, anaphylaxis and hepatotoxicity. Two study investigators independently reviewed the abstracts and articles to determine relevant studies according to prespecified criteria. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 22 articles met the criteria for evaluation. The majority of studies that evaluated agranulocytosis indicated an increased risk associated with <b>metamizole,</b> with relative risk (RR) estimates ranging from 1. 5 (95 % CI, 0. 8 - 2. 7) to 40. 2 (95 % CI, 14. 7 - 113. 3). Findings of three case-control studies do not suggest an association between <b>metamizole</b> and aplastic anaemia. Of the five case-control studies that evaluated the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, four found a statistically significant increased risk associated with <b>metamizole</b> (RR estimates ranging from 1. 4 to 2. 7). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether <b>metamizole</b> increases the risk of other outcomes (e. g. hepatic effects, anaphylaxis, congenital anomalies). Few studies evaluated the effects of dose, route of administration or duration of therapy. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Published studies reported differences in the magnitude of risk of adverse outcomes associated with <b>metamizole</b> use and often had small sample sizes and a number of other limitations that may have biased the results. Further research is needed to better quantify the potential risks associated with <b>metamizole</b> compared to other non-narcotic analgesics...|$|E

Further investigation of <b>metamizole</b> and various derivatives on different potential target genes in human primary hepatocytes demonstrated time- and concentration-dependent induction by <b>metamizole</b> of CYP 2 B 6 (7. 8 - and 3. 1 -fold for mRNA and protein, respectively, at 100 M) and CYP 3 A 4 (2. 4 - and 2. 9 -fold, respectively), whereas other genes (CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 C 19, CYP 2 D 6, NADPH:cytochrome P 450 reductase, ABCB 1, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR)) were not substantially altered.
