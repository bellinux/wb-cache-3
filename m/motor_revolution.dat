40|$|Abstract: Minimizing the {{cylinder}} wear and the consumption rate of cylinder {{oil in a}} large two-stroke marine diesel engine is of great economic importance. In Korea, a motor-driven cylinder lubricator for a large two-stroke marine diesel engine manufactured by Wärtsilä Switzerland Co., Ltd. was first developed by authors through the joint research of industry-university in 2002. The characteristic of the developed product is that can control automatically the oil feed rate to a load fluctuation by the motor drive and the offset cam. The performance of the product is not also inferior to the conventional one. For manufacturing the reliable and useful products, however, it is necessary to investigate further characteristics and improve the performance of a cylinder lubricator. In this study, the effect of quill with and without accumulator on maximum discharge pressure, delivery delay duration and oil feed rate relative to <b>motor</b> <b>revolution</b> speed using plunger stroke as a parameter is experimentally investigated by using the developed cylinder lubricator. It is found that the maximum discharge pressure with accumulator is higher than that of no accumulator as plunger stroke and <b>motor</b> <b>revolution</b> speed are elevated, and the delivery delay duration with accumulator is shorter than that of no accumulator as plunger stroke and <b>motor</b> <b>revolution</b> speed are increased. Also, oil feed rate with accumulator is les...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} a following robot with omni-directional wheels, which {{is able to}} take action to avoid obstacles. The robot design is based on both fuzzy and extension theory. Fuzzy theory was applied to tune the PMW signal of the <b>motor</b> <b>revolution,</b> and correct path deviation issues encountered when the robot is moving. Extension theory was used to build a robot obstacle-avoidance model. Various mobile models were developed to handle different types of obstacles. The ultrasonic distance sensors mounted on the robot were used to estimate the distance to obstacles. If an obstacle is encountered, the correlation function is evaluated and the robot avoids the obstacle autonomously using the most appropriate mode.

It has been stated by some fishermen that the shipborne noise of steel boats has become louder than that of wooden boats and it maight disturb fishing effects. Many reports have been published on the shipborne noise by Hashimoto, Maniwa, Nishimura, E. J. Skudrzyk, and J. H. Janssen, on the orditory sense of fish by Yoshino and others, and on the reaction of fish to the shipborne noise by E. V. Shishkova and by a working group in Norway. G.

On June 18, 1955, an experimental study on the shipborne noise of purse seiners was carried out in the norther waters off Hirado Island (Figs. 1, 2) to solve the above mentioned fishermen's question. The instruments principally used were a Hydrophone (OKI 57 TA), Pre-Amp (57 TA- 2), Tape-Recorders (SONY TC- 802 and FT- 2), Son-agraph (RION Soundspectrograph) used by Shibata, and Panoramic-Analyser (Panoramic Radio Products Inc.) used by Maniwa. Character-istics of those instruments are shown in Fig. 3. The acoustic pattern and section of shipborne noise analysed by means of Sonagraph and sound spectrum by Panoramic-Analyser are shown in Figs. 4 to 19.

40|$|This {{invention}} is an electronically commutated {{brushless motor}} controller that incorporates Hall-array sensing in a small, 42 -gram package that provides 4096 absolute counts per <b>motor</b> <b>revolution</b> position sensing. The unit {{is the size}} of a miniature hockey puck, and is a 44 -pin male connector that provides many I/O channels, including CANbus, RS- 232 communications, general-purpose analog and digital I/O (GPIO), analog and digital Hall inputs, DC power input (18 - 90 VDC, 0 -l 0 A), three-phase motor outputs, and a strain gauge amplifier. This controller replaces air cooling with conduction cooling via a high-thermal-conductivity epoxy casting. A secondary advantage of the relatively good heat conductivity that comes with ultra-small size is that temperature differences within the controller become smaller, so that it is easier to measure the hottest temperature in the controller with fewer temperature sensors, or even one temperature sensor. Another size-sensitive design feature is in the approach to electrical noise immunity. At a very small size, where conduction paths are much shorter than in conventional designs, the ground becomes essentially isopotential, and so certain (space-consuming) electrical noise control components become unnecessary, which helps make small size possible. One winding-current sensor, applied to all of the windings in fast sequence, is smaller and wastes less power than the two or more sensors conventionally used to sense and control winding currents. An unexpected benefit of using only one current sensor is that it actually improves the precision of current control by using the "same" sensors to read each of the three phases. Folding the encoder directly into the controller electronics eliminates a great deal of redundant electronics, packaging, connectors, and hook-up wiring. The reduction of wires and connectors subtracts substantial bulk and eliminates their role in behaving as EMI (electro-magnetic interference) antennas. A shared knowledge by each motor controller of the state of all the motors in the system at 500 Hz also allows parallel processing of higher-level kinematic matrix calculations...|$|E

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} biological nanomotors {{were classified}} {{into two categories}} in the past: linear and rotation motors. In 2013, a third type of biomotor, revolution without rotation, was discovered and found to be widespread among bacteria, eukaryotic viruses, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages. This review focuses on recent findings about various aspects of motors, including chirality, stoichiometry, channel size, entropy, conformational change, and energy usage rate, {{in a variety of}} well-studied motors, including F o F 1 ATPase, helicases, viral dsDNA-packaging motors, bacterial chromosome translocases, myosin, kinesin, and dynein. In particular, dsDNA translocases are used to illustrate how these features relate to the motion mechanism and how nature elegantly evolved a revolution mechanism to avoid coiling and tangling during lengthy dsDNA genome transportation in cell division. Motor chirality and channel size are two factors that distinguish rotation <b>motors</b> from <b>revolution</b> <b>motors.</b> Rotation motors use right-handed channels to drive the right-handed dsDNA, similar to the way a nut drives the bolt with threads in same orientation; <b>revolution</b> <b>motors</b> use left-handed motor channels to revolve the right-handed dsDNA. Rotation motors use small channels (3 nm) with room for the bolt to revolve.

40|$|The Embedded Information Systems Research Group (EISRG) {{being part}} of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (Budapest, Hungary) {{launched}} the development of a modularized electronic device which will help their students to be introduced in the area of embedded information systems design and application within the frameworks of the Embedded Information Systems Engineering (EISE) major. The device is formed by several modules with many different functions: microprocessor module, radio communication module, accoustical module, Ethernet interface module etc. Within this project, the demand for a motorized mobile rolling subsystem appeared. This would serve to transport the modularized device. For this purpose, not only the transporting mechanics and the motor control hardware has to be worked out but a motor control software has to be implemented as well. During this semester this subsystem has been developed by the author. The developed subsystem consists of two driving motors, a mechanical structure carrying the motors and the electronics, two separated electrical supply system (battery and accumulator holders) for the motors and the modularized electronics, two optical detector modules for <b>motor</b> <b>revolution</b> speed sensing, an 8 -bit Atmel AVR microcontroller -based motor control module and a positioner servo motor with limited rotation and integrated closed-loop position control electronics.

40|$|The term {{precision}} linear actuator, {{direct drive}} (PLADD) {{refers to a}} robust linear actuator designed {{to be capable of}} repeatedly performing, over a lifetime of the order of 5 to 10 years, positioning maneuvers that include, variously, submicron increments or slews of the order of a centimeter. The PLADD is capable of both long stroke (120 mm) and high resolution (repeatable increments of 20 nm). Unlike precise linear actuators of prior design, the PLADD contains no gears, levers, or hydraulic converters. The PLADD, now at the prototype stage of development, is intended for original use as a coarse-positioning actuator in a spaceborne interferometer. The PLADD could also be adapted to terrestrial applications in which there are requirements for long stroke and high resolution: potential applications include medical imaging and fabrication of semiconductor devices. The PLADD (see figure) includes a commercially available ball-screw actuator driven directly by a commercially available three-phase brushless DC motor. The ball-screw actuator comprises a spring-preloaded ball nut on a ball screw that is restrained against rotation as described below. The motor is coupled directly (that is, without an intervening gear train) to a drive link that, in turn, is coupled to the ball nut. By eliminating the gear train, the direct-drive design eliminates the complexity, backlash, and potential for misalignment associated with a gear train. To prevent inadvertent movement, there is a brake that includes flexured levers compressed against the drive link by preload springs. This is a power-off brake: There are also piezoelectric stacks that can be activated to oppose the springs and push the levers away from the drive link. Hence, power must be applied to the piezoelectric stacks to release the drive link from braking. To help ensure long operational life, all of the mechanical drive components are immersed in an oil bath within hermetically sealed bellows. The outer end of the bellows holds the outer end of the ball screw, thereby preventing rotation of the ball screw. Positioning is controlled by an electronic control system that includes digital and analog subsystems that interact with the motor and brake and with two sensor/encoder units: a Hall-effect-sensor rotation encoder and a linear glass-scale encoder. This system implements a proportional + integral + derivative control algorithm that results in variation of voltage commands to each of the three pairs of windings of the brushless DC motor. In one of two alternative control modes, the voltages are applied to the windings in a trapezoidal commutation scheme on the basis of timing signals obtained from the Hall-effect sensors; this scheme yields relatively coarse positioning - 24 steps per <b>motor</b> <b>revolution.</b> The second control mode involves a sinusoidal commutation scheme in which the output of the linear glass-scale encoder is transposed to rotational increments to yield much finer position feedback - more than 400, 000 steps per revolution...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{the work}} is in {{progress}} to develop wheeled and caterpillar tractors with electromechanical transmission. Range of changes in transmission gear ratio while using propulsion electric motor depends on mechanical characteristics of a tractor propulsion electric motor which is equipped with electromechanical transmission. In case when the range is rather high then {{it is possible to}} minimize number of gearings in the tractor gearing box or exclude its usage at all. Type of the applied propulsion electric motor and regulation method specify type of mechanical characteristics (characteristics family) of the propulsion electric motor. The paper considers a propulsion asynchronous electric motor with frequency control. While using frequency control it is possible to regulate electric <b>motor</b> <b>revolutions</b> by mutual changes in voltage and voltage frequency. There are various laws of mutual changes in voltage and frequency (regulation laws). Selection of a regulation law influences on type of mechanical characteristics of a propulsion electric motor. Application of any law can be admissible only for some specific range of voltage frequency otherwise it is possible to exceed some parameters (for example, admissible voltage in the winding of electric motor stator). It is necessary to ensure the required moment within wide range for a tractor propulsion electric motor. In this case losses in the electric motor must be minimal. Losses in the rotor of the propulsion asynchronous electric motor are directly proportional to its sliding and its best propulsion and mechanical properties of a mobile machine will be ensured in the case when sliding is preserved at a constant value. According to these reasons selection of regulation laws has been carried out for operation of the propulsion asynchronous electric motor with nominal sliding and mechanical characteristics at nominal sliding is conventionally called a nominal characteristics. The paper analyzes the possible laws of mutual application of voltage and voltage frequency and their application boundaries. A combination of laws for regulation of the propulsion asynchronous electric motor has been selected in the paper. The combination ensures the widest operational range of the electric motor with high moment value at nominal sliding and due account of limitations on application of every used regulation law. The following mechanical characteristics family has been constructed for the propulsion asynchronous electric motor regulated in accordance with the proposed law: at nominal sliding, at critical sliding, at changeable sliding and without changes in voltage and frequency. </p...|$|R

Enseigne Bienvenue assumed the watch on navigation, {{at the tip of}} the conning tower while a couple of sailors were having lunch on the bridge. Engineer Aveline ordered the launching trials for the diesel, while in the officers circle, Cousepel du Mesnil heard noises of compressed air which he interpreted as skipped <b>motor</b> start-up <b>revolutions.</b> A couple of seconds later, he heard agitation on the bridge and the conning tower, thinking that a sailor fell into sea.

Upon his arrival, he realized that his boat was sinking quickly towards the rear. Enseigne Bienvenue signaled the opening of the purges and ordered immediately the closing of the bridge panels which allowed the general communication between the submarine's exterior and interior façade. Sailors (Matelots) Pourre, Kermoal, and Antonio activated themselves promptly and entered into Le Prométhée by closing the panels behind them. They were cited on day (cités à l'ordre du jour) for this act of courage. Couespel du Mesnil ordered the throwing of buoys and gratings. The submarine was sinking even further and quickly; water dissipated into the air sleeves of the diesels. The commandant was rushed into the water with almost fifteen individuals present on the bridge at that moment. The submarine disappeared with a maximum angle, which Couespel du Mesnil estimated an angle of almost 80° in relation to the horizontal axes: Le Prométhée was sinking in a vertical axes. The ensemble of these events didn't even last one minute.|$|R
40|$|A protonmotive force (pmf) {{across the}} cell's inner {{membrane}} powers the flagellar rotary motor of Escherichia coli. Speed {{is known to}} be proportional to pmf when viscous loads are heavy. Here we show that speed also is proportional to pmf when viscous loads are light. Two motors on the same bacterium were monitored as the cell was slowly deenergized. The first motor rotated the entire cell body (a heavy load), while the second motor rotated a small latex bead (a light load). The first motor rotated slowly and provided a measure of the cell's pmf. The second motor rotated rapidly and was compared with the first, to give the speed–pmf relation for light loads. Experiments were done at 24. 0 °C and 16. 2 °C, with initial speeds indicating operation well into the high-speed, low-torque regime. Speed was found to be proportional to pmf over the entire (accessible) dynamic range (0 – 270 Hz). If the passage of a fixed number of protons carries the <b>motor</b> through each <b>revolution,</b> i. e., if the motor is tightly coupled, a linear speed–pmf relation is expected close to stall, where the work done against the viscous load matches the energy dissipated in proton flow. A linear relation is expected at high speeds if proton translocation is rate-limiting and involves multiple steps, a model that also applies to simple proton channels. The present work shows that a linear relation is true more generally, providing an additional constraint on possible motor mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Department of Sociology, Rand Afrikaans University, 28 July 1975 The {{conflict}} between Marx and Malthus {{as it exists}} today, centres around the problems of poverty and development in the Third World where the very high rate of population growth seems to nullify the attempts made towards development. Whereas the rate of population growth {{in the developed countries}} averages only 1, 0 % per year, population in the Third World increases by 2, 3 % per year. This will result not only in a 78, 6 % share of the total world population in the year 2000, but will also imply that almost 2 / 3 of investment in these countries will be directed to the maintenance of their already low standards of living, leaving only 1 / 3 to be implemented towards increasing the per capita income. In contrast we find that in developed countries only 1 / 3 of the natural income is being used to maintain their already high standards of living, while the remaining two-thirds can be geared towards further increases in the per capita income. The overwhelming proportion of children in the Third World populations results in one quarter of the available food resources being used by children not participating in the production process. It is estimated that with a population growth of 2, 4 % per year, and a yearly increase of 4 % in the Gross National Product, it will take a country 43 years to double its per capita income. It is in view of these problems that the neo-Malthusian or Western approach stresses population control {{as an integral part of}} development and developmental aid. The antagonism nevertheless displayed by the underdeveloped countries towards curtailing their population growth, has been actively encouraged by the Soviet Union and Communist China. Partly, because of the connotation between Malthusian propaganda for birth control and a class egoism and racism, Russia and China have gained support with their attitude. The Communist countries probably also hopes for the mobilization of this ever growing proletariat in the non-aligned countries towards a Communist take-over. In sharp contrast with this view being held towards the less-developed world, we find that the rate of population increase in the Soviet-Union and the Communist countries of Eastern Europe have in fact declined to the same level as those of Western countries. In South Africa, where the dualism of rich and underdeveloped/poor countries is present in micro format, the population increase of the poorer population groups can be reduced by a redistribution of the national income within the Capitalist context, whereby more training and employment opportunities can create an individual strive towards selfimprovement an upward mobility. This runs counter to the Marxism ideal of class solidarity as the essential <b>motor</b> of <b>revolution...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This study {{discussed}} {{configuration of}} driving system for improving power efficiency of {{hybrid electric vehicle}} driven by two motors connected in series with CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). In the system, the driving power was supplied by two motors in which one had large ability in power generation {{compared with that of}} another one. Algebraic simulation was executed to determine the shear ratio of the power by each motor with a simple model which referred information on the torque property curve of each motor. In the simulation, it was supposed that mechanical power was produced only by two motors but reciprocal engine in the system, in which the engine contributed to supply electric power to the motors. Nominal capabilities of motors used in this study were 10, 20, 30 kw, respectively. Two motors were selected among them in which total motor power was to be 30, 40, or 50 kw for the system in each condition. An effective parameter (Emt) was defined as the threshold of applied torque by sub-motor to determine the minimum condition where auxiliary power was supplied by the sub-motor beyond the condition. In the two <b>motors</b> system, the <b>revolution</b> speed of the sub-motor was controlled to be constant at 150 rad/s by the CVT with metal V-belt to maintain high efficiency of the sub-motor. Calculation results of current system were compared with that of traditional system driven by single motor. The difference of energy consumption was also calculated according to the difference of driven modes. In some conditions, energy consumption often decreased when double-motor system was applied. However, simply designed double motor system was not always effective to reduce the energy consumption to drive the vehicle. When the CVT was applied to double motor system, energy consumption was decreased compared with those by simply double and single motor system both for the acceleration up to low and high speed. Lowest energy consumption was observed on the double motor system controlled with CVT, when the 30 Nm of the (Emt) was set on the sub-motor. Improvement of 6 % in fuel consumption should be obtained in case of the “ 10 mode ” in which vehicles were often driven under low speed mode...|$|R
