500|$|In 1997, the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{listed the}} night shark as a [...] "Species of Concern", {{meaning that it}} merits {{conservation}} concern but there is insufficient evidence for listing on the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In 1999, the NMFS Fishery Management Plan (FMP) of the Atlantic tunas, swordfish, and sharks was revised to prohibit the retention of 19 species, including the night shark. The prohibition of this species was upheld by Amendment 1 of the FMP, added in 2003. Night sharks suffer high bycatch mortality on longlines, and prohibited or not some are kept by fishers because of their value {{and the difficulty of}} identifying disembodied parts to species. Nevertheless, a 20032008 NMFS population assessment concluded that night shark population in United States waters has stabilized (perhaps even increasing) and no longer merits categorization as a [...] "Species of Concern", though recommended that the prohibition on retention be maintained as a precautionary measure. This species should also benefit from the imposition of time/area closures in the Florida Straits and on the Charleston Bump. Off Brazil and elsewhere, fishing continues largely unmanaged. IUCN members have urged that Brazil improve catch <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement</b> of existing regulations, declare some critical habitat off-limits, and implement the Brazilian National Plan of Action for Sharks (NPOA-Sharks) under the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks).|$|E

[...] International environmental protocols came to feature in environmental governance after trans-boundary environmental problems became widely perceived in the 1960s. [...] Following the Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated. Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for global commons issues. [...] Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the lowest common denominator, and lack <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>enforcement.</b> They also take an incremental approach to solutions where sustainable development principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.|$|E
