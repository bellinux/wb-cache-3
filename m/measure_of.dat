40|$|We {{introduce}} two subclasses <b>of</b> convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk, {{referred to}} as entropy coherent and entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk. Entropy coherent and entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk are special cases of φ-coherent and φ-convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk. Contrary to the classical use of coherent and convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk, which for a given probabilistic model entails evaluating a financial position by considering its expected loss, φ-coherent and φ-convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk evaluate a financial position under a given probabilistic model by considering its normalized expected φ-loss. We prove that (i) entropy coherent and entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk are obtained by requiring φ-coherent and φ-convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk to be translation invariant; (ii) convex, entropy convex, and entropy coherent <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk emerge as certainty equivalents under variational, homothetic, and multiple priors preferences upon requiring the certainty equivalents to be translation invariant; and (iii) φ-convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk are certainty equivalents under variational and homothetic preferences {{if and only if}} they are convex and entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk. In addition, we study the properties of entropy coherent and entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk, derive their dual conjugate function, and characterize entropy coherent and entropy convex <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> risk in terms of properties of the corresponding acceptance sets...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{construct}} twelve different <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> productivity at the plant level and test which <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> productivity are most closely associated with direct <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> economic performance. We first examine how closely correlated these measures are with various <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> profits. We then evaluate {{the extent to which}} each productivity measure is associated with lower rates of plant closure and faster plant growth (growth in employment, output, and capital). All <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> productivity considered are credible in the sense that highly productive plants, regardless <b>of</b> <b>measure,</b> are clearly more profitable, less likely to close, and grow faster. Nevertheless, labor productivity and <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> total factor productivity that are based on regression estimates of production functions are better predictors of plant growth and survival than factor share-based <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> total factor productivity (TFP). <b>Measures</b> <b>of</b> productivity that are based on several years of data appear to outperform <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> productivity that are based solely on data from the most recent year.

40|$|Though {{researchers}} now {{are aware}} of the potential importance of character skills, such as conscientiousness, grit, self-control, and a growth mindset, researchers struggle to find reliable <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> these skills. In this paper, we use data collected from the Understanding America Study, a nationally representative internet panel to study the validity <b>of</b> innovative <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> character skills based on <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> survey effort. We believe surveys themselves {{can be seen as a}} behavioral tasks and that respondents provide meaningful information about their character skills by way of the effort they put forward on surveys. In particular, we compare <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> grit, conscientiousness and other personality traits, and growth mindset, based on self-reports, and survey effort <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> character. We study the relationship across each other and their relationship with academic and life outcomes such as income and labor-market outcomes, after controlling for cognitive ability and other relevant demographic characteristics.
