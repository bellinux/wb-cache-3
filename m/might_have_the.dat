5|$|The Ka-band {{subsystem}} {{was used}} for demonstration purposes. Due to lack of spectrum at 8.41GHz X-band, future high-rate deep space missions will use 32GHz Ka-band. NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) implemented Ka-band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes (Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid) over its 34-m beam-waveguide (BWG) antenna subnet. During the cruise phase, spacecraft Ka-band telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving functionality at all antennas. Ka-band tests were also planned during the science phase, but during aerobraking a switch failed, limiting the X-band high gain antenna to a single amplifier. If this amplifier fails all high-speed X-band communications will be lost. The Ka downlink is the only remaining backup for this functionality, and since the Ka-band capability {{of one of the}} SDST transponders has already failed, (and the other <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same problem) JPL decided to halt all Ka-band demonstrations and hold the remaining capability in reserve.|$|E

25|$|The {{prominent}} crimson {{port-wine stain}} birthmark on Gorbachev's forehead {{was the source}} of much attention from critics and political cartoonists, who often illustrated the mark as the communist Hammer and Sickle. Though some suggested that he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> mark surgically removed, Gorbachev opted not to, as once he was publicly known to have the mark, he believed it would be perceived as his being more concerned with his appearance than other more important issues.|$|E
25|$|Thomson {{attacked}} Whitehouse's contention in {{a letter}} to the popular Athenaeum magazine, pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger conductor with a larger cross section of insulation. However, he thought Whitehouse no fool and suspected that he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson's work had, however, caught the eye of the project's undertakers and in December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.|$|E

25|$|By 1921, Bryan {{considered}} Darwinism {{as a major}} internal {{threat to}} the US. He was affected by James H. Leuba's major study, The Belief in God and Immortality, a Psychological, Anthropological and Statistical Study (1916). In this study, Leuba shows that during four years of college {{a considerable number of}} college students lost their faith. Bryan was horrified that the next generation of American leaders <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> degraded sense of morality which he believed had prevailed in Germany and caused the Great War. Bryan launched an anti-evolution campaign.|$|E
25|$|The name {{is likely}} Anglo-Saxon {{and made of}} three parts each {{corresponding}} to a syllable. The meaning of {{the second and third}} is 'belonging to' ('-ing') and 'farmstead or place' ('-ton'). The first part may refer to a person, 'Impa' or Empa', so the village name means 'Impa's place or farm'. But given the Domesday Book spelling 'Epin', the first part <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same meaning as in 'Epping' - 'a platform or raised place'. Impington might even mean 'place belonging to the imps', since 'imp' had its modern meaning in Anglo-Saxon.|$|E

50|$|Dhanga's {{claims of}} {{military}} success in eastern India (Anga and Raḍha) {{may not be}} without basis. <b>The</b> Pala Empire <b>had</b> been declining after declarations of independence by the Kambojas and the Chandras. The king of Anga defeated by Dhanga <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>the</b> weakened Pala ruler. The ruler of Raḍha <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>the</b> Kamboja usurper of the Pala kingdom. Dhanga did not annex any new territory {{as part of this}} campaign: his objective was only to prevent the Kambojas from becoming a threat. Dhanga's invasion <b>might</b> <b>have</b> weakened <b>the</b> Kambojas, allowing the Pala ruler Mahipala to restore his imperial rule in Bengal.|$|R
25|$|Other ancient civilizations, notably India and China, {{used some}} form of {{adoption}} as well. Evidence suggests {{the goal of this}} practice was to ensure the continuity of cultural and religious practices; in contrast to the Western idea of extending family lines. In ancient India, secondary sonship, clearly denounced by the Rigveda, continued, in a limited and highly ritualistic form, so that an adopter <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> necessary funerary rites performed by a son. China had a similar idea of adoption with males adopted solely to perform the duties of ancestor worship.|$|E
25|$|In August 2005, an Australian mining company, Yamarna Goldfields, {{suggested}} that Niue <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> world's largest deposit of uranium. By early September these hopes {{were seen as}} overoptimistic, and in late October the company cancelled its plans, announcing that exploratory drilling had identified nothing of commercial value. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission filed charges in January 2007 against two directors of the company, now called Mining Projects Group Ltd, alleging that their conduct had been deceptive and that they engaged in insider trading. This case was {{settled out of court}} in July 2008, both sides withdrawing their claims.|$|E
25|$|Preston {{was anxious}} for {{opportunities}} of preaching at Cambridge, {{and listened to}} proposals in 1624 for putting him into a vacant lectureship at Trinity Church. The other candidate, Middlethwait, fellow of Sidney Sussex, was favoured by Nicholas Felton, Bishop of Ely. The matter was referred to James I, who wanted to keep Preston out of a Cambridge pulpit, and, through Edward Conway (afterwards Viscount Conway), offered him any other preferment at his choice. It was then that Buckingham told Preston he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> bishopric of Gloucester, vacant {{by the death of}} Miles Smith (d. 20 October 1624). But Preston, backed by the townsmen, maintained his ground and got the lectureship.|$|E

25|$|Different {{regions of}} the world are {{researched}} very unevenly. The largest number of studies has been conducted in European countries and in North America, where the experts agree on the mean estimate to be about 1% of the general population (Bloodtein, 1995. A Handbook on Stuttering). African populations, particularly from West Africa, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> highest stuttering prevalence in the world—reaching in some populations 5%, 6% and even over 9%. Many {{regions of the}} world are not researched sufficiently, and for some major regions there are no prevalence studies at all (for example, in China). Some claim the reason for this might be a lower incidence in the general population in China.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the first detection, policy- or {{decision-makers}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to make a conscious decision about composing and sending a message. The ambiguity and content of signals sent both to and from Earth would have profound implications for what actions needed to be taken. A PDP that did not take signal comprehensibility into account would not be flexible enough to inform appropriate action. The area of SETI research known as CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence), is concerned with how humankind should carry out this communication and, to some extent, representation problems such as whether a response should be with one collective voice or if anyone with access to a transmitter should have the right to communicate.|$|E
25|$|A human's karmic acts {{result in}} merits and demerits. Since {{unconscious}} things {{generally do not}} move except when caused by an agent (for example, the axe moves only when swung by an agent), and since the law of karma is an unintelligent and unconscious law, Sankara argues {{there must be a}} conscious supreme Being who knows the merits and demerits which persons have earned by their actions, and who functions as an instrumental cause in helping individuals reap their appropriate fruits. Thus, God affects the person's environment, even to its atoms, and for those souls who reincarnate, produces the appropriate rebirth body, all in order that the person <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> karmically appropriate experiences. Thus, there must be a theistic administrator or supervisor for karma, i.e., God.|$|E

25|$|As {{it comes}} to word {{formation}} processes such as derivation and compounding, the earliest derivational suffixes {{to show up in}} children's speech are those they hear adults use most frequently. (-er as the *'doer' of the action such as walker.) When {{it comes to}} compounds, children first make up names for agents and instruments that they don't know by a pattern (N-N), though some of them do not follow the pattern (*cutter grass for grass cutter). Then, they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right structure but the words are inappropriate since English already has words with the intended meaning such as car-smoke = exhaust. This process points to a preference for building words from other words, thus place less demand on memory than learning an entirely new word for each concept.|$|E
25|$|Under the rules, {{investors who}} do not sue Madoff or other parties will be allowed a theft-loss {{deduction}} for the 2008 tax year, equal to 95 percent of their total investment, including all fictitious earnings credited to their accounts on which they were taxed, but less any withdrawals, or actual or potential recoveries from SIPC or their own insurance. Victims who decide to sue Madoff or third parties, believing they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> possibility of some recovery, may still deduct 75 percent of their investment. The deduction will {{not be subject to}} the limitations on deduction of itemized deductions. Any loss exceeding current income may result in a net operating loss, which can be carried back, at the taxpayer's election, 3, 4, or 5 years, with any loss still remaining carrying forward 20 years. These rules apply to all Ponzi schemes where there has been a federal or state indictment of the lead promoter.|$|E
25|$|Pets <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{ability to}} stimulate their caregivers, in {{particular}} the elderly, giving people someone to take care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past. Animal company can also help people to preserve acceptable levels of happiness {{despite the presence of}} mood symptoms like anxiety or depression. Having a pet may also help people achieve health goals, such as lowered blood pressure, or mental goals, such as decreased stress. There is evidence that having a pet can help a person lead a longer, healthier life. In a 1986 study of 92 people hospitalized for coronary ailments, within a year 11 of the 29 patients without pets had died, compared to only 3 of the 52 patients who had pets. Having pet(s) was shown to significantly reduce triglycerides, and thus heart disease risk, in the elderly. A study by the National Institute of Health found that people who owned dogs were less likely to die {{as a result of a}} heart attack than those who didn’t own one. There is some evidence that pets may have a therapeutic effect in dementia cases. Other studies have shown that for the elderly, good health may be a requirement for having a pet, and not a result. Dogs trained to be guide dogs can help people with vision impairment. Dogs trained in the field of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) can also benefit people with other disabilities.|$|E
