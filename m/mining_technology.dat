5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use <b>mining</b> <b>technology</b> to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E

25|$|Campbell River has {{a variety}} of growing {{industries}} that enhance the oceanside community. As of 2012 the focus of business is directed towards aquaculture, agrifoods, clean energy development, construction, creative industries, forestry, health care, international education, <b>mining,</b> <b>technology</b> and tourism. The existing small businesses including those in succession planning stage as well as new business start-ups have significant potential for growth. Business ownership in Campbell River presents an opportunity to market self-employment to youth, immigrants from other parts of Canada and International locations. Since Elk Falls Mill, one of the largest employers in the area, shut down in 2009 there have been many cases of people moving away to other places with higher demands for a similar labour force, particularly Fort McMurray, Alberta.|$|E

The minister of Gran-Colombia in Paris, Francisco Antonio Zea, contracted Mariano Eduardo in May 1822, who had been highly recommended by Alexander von Humboldt, to found and to manage a mining school in Bogotá together with a group of young European scientists. Therefore, Mariano Eduardo made the necessary trip preparation. He bought some laboratory equipment and ordered constructions of precisions instruments for certain measurements.|$|E

25|$|SAGD {{has proved}} to be a major {{breakthrough}} in production technology since it is cheaper than CSS, allows very high oil production rates, and recovers up to 60% of the oil in place. Because of its economic feasibility and applicability to a vast area of oil sands, this method alone quadrupled North American oil reserves and allowed Canada to move to second place in world oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. Most major Canadian oil companies now have SAGD projects in production or under construction in Alberta's oil sands areas and in Wyoming. Examples include Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd's (JACOS) project, Suncor's Firebag project, Nexen's Long Lake project, Suncor's (formerly Petro-Canada's) MacKay River project, Husky Energy's Tucker Lake and Sunrise projects, Shell Canada's Peace River project, Cenovus Energy's Foster Creek and Christina Lake developments, ConocoPhillips' Surmont project, Devon Canada's Jackfish project, and Derek Oil & Gas's LAK Ranch project. Alberta's OSUM Corp has combined proven underground <b>mining</b> <b>technology</b> with SAGD to enable higher recovery rates by running wells underground from within the oil sands deposit, thus also reducing energy requirements compared to traditional SAGD. This particular technology application is in its testing phase.|$|E
500|$|Creation of the {{monument}} resulted in a temporary closing of the lands to prospecting and mining. However, Death Valley was quickly reopened to mining by Congressional action in June of the same year. As improvements in <b>mining</b> <b>technology</b> allowed lower grades of ore to be processed, and new heavy equipment allowed greater amounts of rock to be moved, mining in Death Valley changed. Gone were {{the days of the}} [...] "single-blanket, jackass prospector" [...] long associated with the romantic west. Open pit and strip mines scarred the landscape as international mining corporations bought claims in highly visible areas of the national monument. The public outcry that ensued led to greater protection for all national park and monument areas in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} process for extraction of bitumen from the sands {{was developed by}} Dr. Karl Clark, working with the Alberta Research Council in the 1920s. Today, all of the producers doing surface mining, such as Syncrude Canada, Suncor Energy and Albian Sands Energy etc., use {{a variation of the}} Clark Hot Water Extraction (CHWE) process. [...] In this process, the ores are mined using open-pit <b>mining</b> <b>technology.</b> The mined ore is then crushed for size reduction. [...] Hot water at [...] is added to the ore and the formed slurry is transported using hydrotransport line to a primary separation vessel (PSV) where bitumen is recovered by flotation as bitumen froth. The recovered bitumen froth consists of 60% bitumen, 30% water and 10% solids by weight.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, German deep <b>mining</b> <b>technology</b> was in {{enormous}} demand all over Europe and German miners were licensed {{to live and}} work in Elizabethan England particularly in the Stannaries of Devon & Cornwall and in Cumbria. In other parts of England the technique was used in Elizabeth's royal mines [...] for calamine and by 1638 German miners were recorded using the technique in silver mines in Wales. It is thought that the dialect term [...] "dowsing" [...] was introduced at this period – its origin is unknown but features characteristics of the West Country dialects. In the lead-mining area of the Mendip Hills in Somerset in the 17th century the natural philosopher Robert Boyle, inspired by the writings of Agricola, watched a [...] practitioner try to find [...] "latent veins of metals". Boyle saw the hazel divining rod ("virgula divinatoria") stoop {{in the hands of the}} diviner, who protested that he was not applying any force to the twig; Boyle accepted the man's genuine belief [...] but himself remained unconvinced.|$|E

It repealed the sunset date for surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act [...] in other words, {{it would have made}} those sections permanent. A number of amendments were also proposed and passed. Several of the amendments were to surveillance provisions and included an amendment that added to the list of terrorist crimes {{that could be used for}} obtaining electronic surveillance, the requirement that the Director of the FBI must personally approve any library or bookstore requests by the FBI under section 215, making law enforcement report back to a court within 15 days of using the a roving wiretap and the narrowing of the scope for [...] "sneak-and-peek" [...] delayed notification search warrants. Several other amendments were related to NSLs, including allowing those in receipt of an NSL the ability to consult a lawyer and challenge it in court and preventing the penalization of NSL recipients who are mentally incompetent, under undue stress, under threat of bodily harm, or under a threat of being fired if they disclose they have been served an NSL. Other amendments included standardizing penalties for terrorist attacks and other violence against railroad carriers and mass transportation systems on land, water, or in the air and clarifying the definition of terrorism in forfeiture laws. Congressman Howard Berman proposed an amendment that required a report to Congress on the development and use of data <b>mining</b> <b>technology</b> by departments and agencies of the Federal government. Other amendments were proposed to other areas not covered by the USA PATRIOT Act, for instance one amendment defined a new crime of [...] "narco-terrorism," [...] while another addressed crime and terrorism at U.S. seaports. The bill was passed 257-171 however when it was introduced into the Senate it was replaced by a bill proposed by Arlen Specter, S.1389. The Senate then requested a conference with the House.|$|E
