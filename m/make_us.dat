5|$|This {{policy was}} {{realized}} as NSC-68, a classified report {{issued by the}} United States National Security Council in April 1950 and written by Paul Nitze, Kennan's successor as director of policy planning. Kennan and Charles Bohlen, another State Department expert on Russia, argued about the wording of NSC-68, which became the basis of Cold War policy. Kennan rejected the idea that Stalin had a grand design for world conquest implicit in Nitze's report and argued that he actually feared overextending Russian power. Kennan even argued that NSC-68 {{should not have been}} drafted at all, as it would <b>make</b> <b>U.S.</b> policies too rigid, simplistic, and militaristic. Acheson overruled Kennan and Bohlen, endorsing the assumption of Soviet menace implied by NSC-68.|$|E

25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will <b>make</b> <b>us</b> happy or how to achieve the things that will <b>make</b> <b>us</b> happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E

[162] It is {{not enough}} that the Holy Spirit {{convince}} us of sin at our first setting out on pilgrimage, and <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> sensible of our want of Christ; but He also keeps up a sight and sense of the evil of sin in its original nature, as well as actual transgressions. This often <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> wonder at sin, at ourselves, and at the love of Christ in becoming a sacrifice for our sins.

25|$|The {{right-of-way}} through Fort Wayne {{was purchased}} by the New York, Chicago and Lake Erie Railway (the Nickel Plate Road) which ran from Buffalo to Chicago. This allowed the railway to run straight {{through the heart of}} a major midwestern city without razing a single home. The canal right-of-way was also directly adjacent to downtown, which made the new railway quite convenient for passengers and many businesses.

25|$|Some of his assertions seem {{paradoxical}} {{and difficult}} to understand at first glance, {{not only because they}} are taken out of context, but above all because our habits of thought <b>make</b> <b>us</b> reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.|$|E
25|$|Such tissue heterogeneity, however, {{is not as}} {{predictable}} as {{the generic}} model can <b>make</b> <b>us</b> imagine.

The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.|$|E

What makes Helnwein's art significant is its ability to <b>make</b> <b>us</b> reflect emotionally and intellectually on the very expressive subjects he chooses.

25|$|Both {{regular and}} {{irregular}} involvement in sports leisure {{can result in}} heightened SWB. Serious, or systematic involvement in certain leisure activities, such as taekwondo, correlates with personal growth {{and a sense of}} happiness. Additionally, more irregular (e.g. seasonal) sports activities, such as skiing, are also correlated with high SWB. Furthermore, the relationship between pleasure and skiing is thought to be caused in part by a sense of flow and involvement with the activity. Leisure activities, such as meeting with friends, participating in sports, and going on vacation trips, positively correlate with life satisfaction. It may also be true that going on a vacation makes our lives seem better, but does not necessarily <b>make</b> <b>us</b> happier in the long term. Research regarding vacationing or taking a holiday trip is mixed. Although the reported effects are mostly small, some evidence points to higher levels of SWB, or happiness, after taking a holiday.|$|E

25|$|There is {{one final}} matter to consider: the {{possibility}} that euthanasia not only would be performed on incompetent patients {{in violation of the}} rules—as an abuse of the safeguards—but would become the rule in the context of demographic and budgetary pressures on Social Security and Medicare as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire, around 2010. Once legalized, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia would become routine. Over time doctors would become comfortable giving injections to end life and Americans would become comfortable having euthanasia as an option. Comfort would <b>make</b> <b>us</b> want to extend the option to others who, in society's view, are suffering and leading purposeless lives. The ethical arguments for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, advocates of euthanasia have maintained, do not apply to euthanasia only when it is voluntary; they {{can also be used to}} justify some kinds of nonvoluntary euthanasia of the incompetent.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today.

We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E
