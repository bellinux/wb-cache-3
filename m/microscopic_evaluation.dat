Their subsequent studies showed this technique can easily replace traditional <b>microscopic</b> <b>evaluation</b> in genetic hair shaft abnormalities such as Netherton syndrome, monilethrix, wooly hair syndrome, pili torti, pili annulati and trichothiodystrophy.

40|$|Possible {{relationships}} among cellular energy {{status and the}} induction and initiation of aflatoxin synthesis were studied by using replacement culture techniques in conjunction with aflatoxin-supporting and-nonsupporting media. Transcription and translation processes associated with the induction of aflatoxin synthesis occurred 3 to 6 and 6 to 10 h, respectively, after mycelia were transferred to glucose-containing media. From adenylate energy charge determinations and in situ 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, a relationship between overall energy status and the induction or initiation of aflatoxin synthesis could not be identified; however, electron <b>microscopic</b> <b>evaluations</b> indicated that aflatoxin synthesis occurred in association with a glucose-mediated inactivation of mitochondria.

Ossicles may fuse to form much large mineralizations. Cementum-like psammomatous bodies (cementicles) may also be present. Osteoblastic rimming is not uncommon.

5000|$|Phillips pioneered {{a number}} of {{techniques}} that would subsequently become standard in the field, including the microscopic examination of historic paint layers, the use of epoxies for wood repairs, and the acrylic consolidation of fragile historic material. He and Andy Ladygo perfected an acrylic injection technique for re-attaching historic plaster walls and ceilings to wooden laths. [...] His contributions to historic paint analysis ranged from developing the technique of 'cratering' using sandpaper (to macroscopically reveal multiple paint layers), to the <b>microscopic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of paint cross-sections in situ and in the laboratory, to techniques meant to reverse the natural yellowing of linseed oil and thus reveal the 'true' colors of historic paints.

The biological tissues adherent to the filter and the small thrombi formed in vivo were detached from the metallic structure of the device, fixed, dehydrated and prepared for the histological and the electron microscopy. The analyses showed that both samples (thrombus and newly formed tissue) contained foreign, in some cases nano-sized, bodies. The chemistry of these particles was different and varied, and unusual compounds containing non-biocompatible elements like bismuth, lead, wolfram, tungsten were also detected.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of martensitic Alloy EP- 823 {{to stress}} corrosion cracking was evaluated with and without an applied cathodic potential using the slow-strain-rate (SSR) testing technique.

The cracking susceptibility in an acidic environment at different temperatures was expressed in terms of the true failure stress (ơf), time to failure (TTF), and ductility parameters, including percent elongation (%El) and percent reduction in area (%RA). The data indicate that the magnitudes of ơr, TTF, %El, and %RA were reduced due to cathodic charging. The scanning electron <b>microscopic</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the primary fracture surface of the specimens used in SSR testing revealed a combination of ductile and brittle failures.

Several animal models are used for scar induction in preclinical studies which target prevention and/or suppression of perineural scar.

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{screening}} devices that may assist dentists in detecting oral cancer, including the Velscope, Vizilite Plus and the identafi 3000. There is no evidence that routine use of these devices in general dental practice saves lives. However, there are compelling reasons {{to be concerned about the}} risk of harm this device may cause if routinely used in general practice. Such harms include false positives, unnecessary surgical biopsies and a financial burden on the patient. While a dentist, physician or other health professional may suspect a particular lesion is malignant, there is no way to tell by looking alone - since benign and malignant lesions may look identical to the eye. A non-invasive brush biopsy (BrushTest) can be performed to rule out the presence of dysplasia (pre-cancer) and cancer on areas of the mouth that exhibit an unexplained color variation or lesion. The only definitive method for determining if cancerous or precancerous cells are present is through biopsy and <b>microscopic</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the cells in the removed sample. A tissue biopsy, whether of the tongue or other oral tissues and microscopic examination of the lesion confirm the diagnosis of oral cancer or precancer. A FOXM1-based molecular cancer diagnostic test (qMIDS) has recently been tested in Europe and China for quantifying squamous cell tumour aggressiveness with promising diagnostic and prognostic significance.|$|E
