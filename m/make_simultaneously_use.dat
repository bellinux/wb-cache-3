40|$|A DNA {{structure}} is described that can cleave single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides {{in the presence}} of ionic copper. This “deoxyribozyme” can self-cleave or can operate as a bimolecular complex that <b>simultaneously</b> <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> of duplex and triplex interactions to bind and cleave separate DNA substrates. Bimolecular deoxyribozyme-mediated strand scission proceeds with a kobs of 0. 2 min− 1, whereas the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction could not be detected. The duplex and triplex recognition domains can be altered, making possible the targeted cleavage of single-stranded DNAs with different nucleotide sequences. Several small synthetic DNAs were made to function as simple “restriction enzymes” for the site-specific cleavage of single-stranded DNA...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal use of remedies and efficiency defence for merger control. We develop a framework where the merger efficiency gains are endogenously obtained and not observed by the Competition Authority. The {{possibility of an}} efficiency defence can push firms to better design the merger, leading to more efficiency gains. The submission of merger remedies interacts with the efficiency defence: it lowers the incentives to enhance the efficiency gains, but also improves the merger assessment, in particular by signaling the true level of efficiency gains. We examine to what extent it may be optimal to <b>simultaneously</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> of both instruments, and thus discuss the opportunity for the Competition Agency to actually refrain from using one of these instruments {{in an attempt to}} improve the overall performance of merger control...|$|R
40|$|We {{extensively}} {{study the}} evolution and distinct signatures of cosmological models, in which dark energy interacts directly with dark matter. We first {{focus on the}} imprints of these coupled models on {{the cosmic microwave background}} temperature power spectrum, in which we discuss the multipole peak separation together with the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also address the growth of matter perturbations, and disentangle the interacting dark energy models using the expansion history together with the growth history. We find that a disformal coupling between dark matter and dark energy induces intermediate-scales and time-dependent damped oscillatory features in the matter growth rate function, a unique characteristic of this coupling. Apart from the disformal coupling, we also consider conformally coupled models, together with models which <b>simultaneously</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> of both couplings.

40|$|Spintronics {{directly}} {{based on}} relativistic {{quantum mechanics is}} called as relativistic spintronics, which involves the study of active control and manipulation of 4 D spin-tensor degrees of freedom via the electromagnetic field tensor. For future potential electronic devices with smaller size, the study of relativistic spintronics would be valuable. In this paper, we try to establish a general theoretical basis for relativistic spintronics, from which we have: 1) in relativistic spintronics, there have more plentiful contents for relativistic effects, e. g. the usual 3 D spatial spin-orbit coupling is extended to the 4 D spin-orbit-tensor coupling; 2) via the spin and like-spin degrees of freedom we can <b>simultaneously</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> of electric and magnetic field strengths to orientate an electron; 3) not only the spin quantum states of a moving electron but also those of a motionless electron can be affected by some particular electrostatic fields.

40|$|Abstract — For many {{evolving}} application scenarios like ubiquitous and {{autonomic computing}} systems, trustworthy computing solutions are essential. However {{the fact that}} the autonomic elements that may take part in such networks may be 1) severely resource constrained, and that 2) the sheer scale of such devices may also place constraints on their cost, calls for inexpensive, low complexity (but nevertheless trustworthy) computing modules, or secure co-processors (ScP). We propose two synergistic strategies for the realization of very low complexity, inexpensive ScPs. The first is a simple security policy, decrypt only when necessary (DOWN). The second is the utilization of untrusted external resources to improve the security of very low complexity ScPs. We point out some very desirable properties of probabilistic key pre-distribution schemes (PKPS) that can take good advantage of the DOWN policy and <b>simultaneously</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> of external resources, to render the problem of their susceptibility to collusions irrelevant.

Taking advantage of PI switching manifold method, it projects a kind of sliding mode controller and fuzzy the switching function of sliding mode surface with membership function, then finally adopts the output of fuzzy controller.

40|$|Multithreading {{has become}} a {{dominant}} paradigm in general purpose MIMD parallel computation. To execute a multithreaded computation on a parallel computer, a scheduler must order and allocate threads to run on the individual processors. The scheduling algorithm dramatically affects both the speedup attained and the space used when executing the computation. We consider the problem of scheduling multithreaded computations to achieve linear speedup without using significantly more space-per-processor than required for a single-processor execution. We show that for general multithreaded computations, no scheduling algorithm can <b>simultaneously</b> <b>make</b> efficient <b>use</b> of space and time. In particular, we show that there exist multithreaded computations such that any execution schedule X that achieves P-processor execution time T P (X) T 1 =ae, where T 1 is the minimum possible serial execution time, must use space at least S P (X) 1 4 (ae Γ 1) p T 1 + S 1, where S 1 is the space use [...] ...|$|R
40|$|One is {{interested}} {{here in the}} observation of dynamic processes starting from the traces which they leave or those that one makes them produce. It is considered here {{that it should be}} possible to <b>make</b> several observations <b>simultaneously,</b> <b>using</b> a large variety of independently developed analyzers. For this purpose, we introduce the original notion of ``full trace'' to capture the idea that a process can be instrumented in such a way that it may broadcast all information which could ever be requested by any kind of observer. Each analyzer can then find in the full trace the data elements which it needs. This approach uses what has been called a "tracer driver" which completes the tracer and drives it to answer the requests of the analyzers. A tracer driver allows to restrict the flow of information and makes this approach tractable. On the other side, the potential size of a full trace seems to make the idea of full trace unrealistic. In this work we explore the consequences of this notion in term of potential efficiency, by analyzing the respective workloads between the (full) tracer and many different analyzers, all being likely run in true parallel environments. To illustrate this study, we use the example of the observation of the resolution of constraints systems (proof-tree, search-tree and propagation) using sophisticated visualization tools, as developed in the project OADymPPaC (2001 - 2004). The processes considered here are computer programs, but we believe the approach can be extended to many other kinds of processes.

40|$|Abstract – Document {{clustering}} {{has been}} widely used in information retrieval systems {{in order to improve}} the efficiency and also the effectiveness of ranked output systems using clustering hypothesis. Based on this hypothesis, documents relevant to a query tend to be highly similar in the context defined by the query. In this way, a pair of documents has an overall similarity (ignoring the query) and a specific similarity (similarity of a pair of documents given a query). A Query-Sensitive Similarity Measure (QSSM) is a mechanism to measure the similarity of two documents given a query. In this paper, in the first step, we identify the sources of information that may be used for this purpose. In the second step, we propose a QSSM based on these information sources. Finally, we propose a parametric QSSM that <b>simultaneously</b> <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> of the product and weighted sum to fuse the information from the identified sources. A genetic algorithm is used to learn the optimal values of parameters in this measure for a specific collection. The leave-one-out method is used to evaluate the proposed learning scheme. Our motivation for this is to see whether the learning scheme can perform significantly better than the measure proposed in the second step. Using several document collections, the performance of each measure is evaluated and the results are compared with other QSSMs proposed in the past research...|$|R
40|$|We present initial {{results from}} a {{population}} synthesis model aimed at determining the star formation rate of the Milky-Way. We find that a total star formation rate of 0. 68 to 1. 45 Msun/yr is able to reproduce the observed number of young stellar objects in the Spitzer/IRAC GLIMPSE survey of the Galactic plane, assuming simple prescriptions for the 3 D Galactic distributions of YSOs and interstellar dust, and using model SEDs to predict the brightness and color of the synthetic YSOs at different wavelengths. This is the first Galaxy-wide measurement derived from pre-main-sequence objects themselves, rather than global observables such as the total radio continuum, Halpha, or FIR flux. The value obtained is slightly lower than, but generally consistent with previously determined values. We will extend this method {{in the future to}} fit the brightness, color, and angular distribution of YSOs, and <b>simultaneously</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> of multiple surveys, to place constraints on the input assumptions, and reduce uncertainties in the star formation rate estimate. Ultimately, this {{will be one of the}} most accurate methods for determining the Galactic star formation rate, as it makes use of stars of all masses (limited only by sensitivity) rather than solely massive stars or indirect tracers of massive stars.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} diversity of wireless access technologies, and the further integration of mobile communication and heterogeneous wireless networks, {{more and more}} mobile devices equipped with multiple network interfaces. The mobile devices, which have integrated multi-homing technology, can transmit data through multiple network interfaces {{to improve the quality}} of data transmission for users. The advantages of multi-homing technology have contributed to the rapid development of multipath protocols. Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) is an extension of the traditional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which can take advantage of the capabilities of multiple network interfaces to <b>simultaneously</b> <b>make</b> <b>use</b> of multiple paths for data transmission, aiming at improving the performance of the data delivery. Although the multi-homing mobile devices configuring MPTCP protocol can obtain a lot of benefits, the current MPTCP path selection mechanism is too simple resulting in some concerns. So, a multi-attribute aware path selection approach for MPTCP (MPTCP-MAPS) is proposed in the paper, which jointly taking the Round-Trip Time (RTT) and the packet loss rate (Loss) of transport layer into account for efficient data delivery. MPTCP-MAPS designs a Multi-attribute path switch Prober (MP) to enhance the efficiency of the path selection mechanism. The results, which are gained from a closing realistic simulation topology, demonstrate how MPTCP-MAPS' path selection approach is superior to the current MPTCP path selection mechanism in terms of continuity of mobile services and performance in heterogeneous wireless networks...|$|R
