Our preferred implementation uses the relatively prime bases { 2, 3 }. If we allow the exponents of the bases to be arbitrarily large signed integers, then we can represent any real number to any arbitrary precision by a single digit DBNS representation. By representing the digit position by the exponent values, we generate a logarithmic-like representation which we can manipulate using an index calculus. A <b>multiplier</b> <b>accumulator</b> architecture for a FIR filter application has been reported which uses a half-index domain to remove the problem of addition within the index calculus. In this paper we show that using a 2 digit DBNS representation for both the input data and the filter coefficients can result in substantial hardware savings compared to both the single-digit a DBNS approach and an equivalent binary implementation of a general <b>multiplier</b> <b>accumulator.</b> In the paper we discuss the filter architecture, techniques for converting between binary and the 2 -digit DBNS representations, and also the design technique used to generate the 2 digit DBNS FIR filter coefficients...|$|E

40|$|There are {{hundreds}} of papers on accelerating sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV), however, only a handful target FPGAs. Some claim that FPGAs inherently perform inferiorly to CPUs and GPUs. FPGAs do perform inferiorly for some applications like matrix-matrix multiplication and matrix-vector multiplication. CPUs and GPUs have too much memory bandwidth and too much floating point computation power for FPGAs to compete. However, the low computations to memory operations ratio and irregular memory access of SpMV trips up both CPUs and GPUs. We {{see this as a}} leveling of the playing field for FPGAs.

First, most SpMV implementations traverse the matrix in row-major order, but we mix column and row traversal.
