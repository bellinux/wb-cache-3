40|$|This {{research}} work {{is focused on}} developing simple parametric models of the unbalanced <b>magnetic</b> <b>pull</b> produced in eccentric-rotor electrical machines. The influence of currents circulating in the parallel paths of the stator winding on the unbalanced <b>magnetic</b> <b>pull</b> is given the main attention. The interaction between these currents and those circulating in the rotor cage/damper winding is also considered. First, a parametric force model for an eccentric-rotor salient-pole synchronous machine is developed. The effects of the parallel stator windings are not considered in this model. Next, a low-order parametric force model is built for electrical machines equipped with parallel stator windings but operating without the rotor cage/damper winding. This force model is applicable to salient-pole synchronous machines {{as well as to}} induction motors. And finally, a special force model is developed for electrical machines furnished with parallel paths both in the rotor and stator windings. This model accounts for the equalising currents circulating in the rotor and stator windings and also for the interaction between these currents. This third force model can be applied to a salient-pole synchronous machine and to an induction machine. The parameters of the force models are estimated from the results of numerical simulations applying a soft-computing-based estimation program. All the developed force models with the estimated parameters demonstrate a very good performance in a wide whirling frequency range. The effects of parallel paths in the rotor and stator windings on the unbalanced <b>magnetic</b> <b>pull</b> are investigated numerically. The acquired results reveal that the total unbalanced <b>magnetic</b> <b>pull</b> and its constituents related to the fundamental magnetic field and slotting are strongly affected by the presence of parallel paths in the stator winding. However, unlike the rotor cage, parallel stator windings may instigate anisotropy in the unbalanced <b>magnetic</b> <b>pull.</b> In such cases, the results of the numerical impulse response test may differ significantly from the conventional calculation results. It is also shown that, {{despite the fact that the}} number of parallel paths in the stator is often substantially lower than the number of parallel paths in the rotor, parallel stator windings may still provide a more efficient UMP mitigation than the rotor cage/damper winding. reviewe...|$|E

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. This paper presents a small power generation system motivated by a coreless stator AFPM (Axial Flux Permanent Magnet) generator which {{is driven by the}} rooftop ventilator. The generator consists of discs for the rotor and the stator geometry. The stator disc is sandwiched between two rotor discs and the magnets in the two opposite rotor discs may be placed N-S arrangements. Since there is no silicon steel inside the coils, we should eliminate the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pulling</b> force between the rotors and the stators. When the ventilator rotates, the flux of the permanent magnet rotors part move across the air gap and induces the emf in the coreless coils. After that, the ac voltage is rectified to dc voltage and finally charged to the 12 V 5 Ahr battery for household appliances. To analyze the magnetic circuit, the finite element analysis was used to simulate the magnetic flux density in the AFPM generator. The test is operated in electrical machines labo-ratory and essentially to determine the characteristics of prototype generator. Based on the experiments, the results of the output voltage can achieve 103 V with no-load, and 20 V on 100 Ω resistive loads at the speed of 200 rpm. For the results after installing the generator on the roof of a building to charge the 12 V battery, the minimum wind speed for enough charging to battery is at 10 rpm. Furthermore, the prototyped of the generator is relatively small and cheap. Af-ter the fabrication and testing of the prototype, this system has been proved feasible for practical application...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} an {{advanced}} {{contribution to the}} design process of large synchronous generators with high number of poles. It proposes two original contributions, the first one allowing a very precise prediction of the no-load voltage and of the no-load losses in the damper winding, the second one allowing a rigorous calculation of the unbalanced <b>magnetic</b> <b>pulls</b> and of the associated losses in the damper winding {{in the case of}} a machine in eccentricity conditions or with any kind of rotor and stator deformation. Both contributions are based on the same strategy, apart from the fact that it has to be taken into account that the geometry is not the same in both cases, it is supposed perfect in the first case and damaged in the second. The magnetostatic 2 D finite element method (FEM) is used to determine the magnetic coupling of the machine conductors as a function of the rotor position. These values of magnetic coupling are then used in the voltage equations of the machine which are solved using a numerical method. A particularity is the calculation of the magnetic flux coupled with a conductor in two situations, once with only the field winding currents, fixing the levels of saturation, and once with field winding currents and a current in one damper bar. This strategy leads to the concept of differential inductances. The two contributions are different because for the first one the geometric, cyclic periodicity of the machine is of one stator slot pitch and for the damaged machine no short cyclic periodicity can be found. In the first case the values of flux linkage and the inductances necessary for the voltage prediction are therefore calculated only for some rotor positions within one stator slot pitch. These values are then reused for all other rotor positions. This method allows to predict the currents and the losses in the damper winding, as well as the no-load voltage waveform with the same precision as a transient magnetic FEM simulation but reducing the simulation time by a factor of about 20. Comparisons with measurements and with transient magnetic FEM simulations on several operating units prove the precision of this approach. As in the case of the calculation of the unbalanced <b>magnetic</b> <b>pulls</b> and of the associated losses in the damper winding for a machine with damaged geometry one can not take advantage of a short geometric periodicity, the procedure has to be different. Again the magnetic coupling of the different circuits is calculated in advance using the magnetostatic FEM, but in this case without rotation of the rotor. The stator slotting can be neglected because it does not influence the aimed results. Any kind of geometric deformation is represented by contiguous segments, placed on the interior stator surface, which can be displaced radially in both directions. A correct adjustment in time of the air gap value of each segment allows to represent any combination of static and dynamic deformation of the air gap for any position of the rotor. The use of a linear superposition of the linearized influences of all segments on the values of magnetic coupling and on the inductances allows to reduce the number of preliminary magnetostatic FEM calculations to the minimum. It has to be specified that the preliminary magnetostatic 2 D FEM calculations are carried out only once for a given machine. They can then be used for different deformations of the geometry. If one wants to use the transient magnetic 2 D FEM the whole approach has to be repeated for every geometric deformation to be analyzed. The results obtained haven been systematically compared to results obtained through transient magnetic FEM calculations. The agreement is excellent and the reduction of calculation time is enormous. Both contributions were implemented in highly automatized tools; they are therefore well adapted to an industrial application...|$|R
