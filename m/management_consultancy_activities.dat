40|$|Abstract—The {{amount of}} effort needed to {{maintain}} a software system {{is related to the}} technical quality of the source code of that system. The ISO 9126 model for software product quality recognizes maintainability as one of the 6 main characteristics of software product quality, with adaptability, changeability, stability, and testability as subcharacteristics of maintainability. Remarkably, ISO 9126 does not provide a consensual set of measures for estimating maintainability {{on the basis of a}} system’s source code. On the other hand, the Maintainability Index has been proposed to calculate a single number that expresses the maintainability of a system. In this paper, we discuss several problems with the MI, and we identify a number of requirements to be fulfilled by a maintainability model to be usable in practice. We sketch a new maintainability model that alleviates most of these problems, and we discuss our experiences with using such as system for IT <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> <b>activities.</b> I...|$|E

This allows the identification of critical success factors that are pertinent to the switching of providers and provides recommendations for a successful transition...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} and intricacy {{in the construction}} industry cause difficulties in maintaining performance, time, and quality services of a construction project, which leads to the failure to meet the scope and objective of a project. In addition, improper planning, widespread dependence, and low availability of materials increase the cost of the construction project. To manage such issues, Project <b>Management</b> <b>Consultancy</b> is one of the management solutions that have been widely used. Project <b>Management</b> <b>Consultancy</b> plays a multifaceted role in providing services from the beginning of construction to its completion. Project <b>Management</b> <b>Consultancy</b> makes sure whether we are moving in the right pathway according to the planned schedule. Use of Project <b>Management</b> <b>Consultancy</b> offers constructive <b>management</b> solution for the proper execution of work, improved performance, quality, and outcome of the project. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the role and responsibilities of Project <b>Management</b> <b>Consultancy</b> while executing a project and the risks associated with it. This research is carried out via a case study of the construction of an industrial project governed by a Project <b>Management</b> <b>Consultancy</b> from preconstruction phase to completio...|$|R
40|$|As China seriously lacks {{trained and}} {{experienced}} personnel at its current stage of development, <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> may be adopted as an economical solution to improve efficiency and performance. However, as institutional theory suggests, {{it is likely}} that the adoption of <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> in China is driven more by mimetic isomorphism factors than by actual performance considerations. Using data from a survey of 219 listed Chinese firms, our results suggest that there are significant positive effects from mimetic isomorphism factors and adoption of management accounting and controls and information and communication technology. Our study provides strong evidence that the adoption of <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> has a positive effect on firm performance, yet we cannot conclude that <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> is adopted to improve firm performance. Moreover, state ownership held by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has a significant and positive effect on <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> adoption, whereas state ownership held by government agencies does not. One interpretation is that firms controlled by SOEs have acquired increased autonomy and become more innovative...|$|R

40|$|The {{worldwide}} <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> {{industry is}} estimated to be worth over $ 300 billion annually. Its importance, in terms of the global economy, cannot be overestimated. But what is <b>management</b> <b>consultancy?</b> The thesis addresses this question by drawing on the work of Michel Foucault and applying his diagnostic method to the field of <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> knowledge. Managerial advisory services take place in a variety of operational areas, such as business strategy, human resources, manufacturing, marketing, and finance. But there is a type of knowledge that remains the same for all management consultants, irrespective of the specific operational area in which they work. This knowledge is found in the practitioner literature for management consultants and takes the form of prescriptive guidelines for dealing with managers in the client organization. Some practitioners have begun to suggest that these prescriptive guidelines can be used by managers as well as consultants. Instead of dealing with their subordinates in the traditional way, managers are now being told to act as 'their own consultants' in relation to their 'clients'. This means that <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> knowledge is changing the way we understand the function of modern management. The thesis brings to light the field of <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> knowledge by describing the formation of its objects, concepts, and diverging theories. It also examines the institutional effects of the practitioner literature in terms of the profession of <b>management</b> <b>consultancy.</b> By outlining the relations between knowledge and power, the thesis answers the question of what <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> is.

40|$|Much of the {{estimated}} $ 554 billion annual expenditure on <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> services is accounted for by projects with a direct link to client profitability. As such, it is critical for clients (and arguably the wider economy) that the purchase process for such services is managed effectively. For many within the <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> literature, this requires close, bilateral buy-side service end-user / supplier engagement. In recent years, however, this bilateral engagement has been modified by {{a significant increase in}} procurement professional involvement. This has caused concern within the <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> literature as it is believed it will inevitably lead to a cost-focused approach that disrupts close end-user / supplier engagement and causes sub-standard service outcomes. In this paper, we explore, via qualitative research, whether this concern is justified. In the event, the analysis suggested partial justification. However, examples of positive procurement involvement were also reported, suggesting that existing models and assumptions within the <b>management</b> <b>consultancy</b> literature regarding the impact of increased procurement involvement require modification...|$|R

In a "league table, " published in the Financial Times of September 12, 1995, {{almost all of the}} top ten {{and more than half of}} the top forty European consultancies were of American origin. Over the past few years, many formerly independent national consultancies have been taken over by foreign, mainly U. S., firms [17]. Concerning the historical evolution of the profession, a large part of the relevant literature also highlights the American predominance. The work of Frederick W. Taylor and his followers is very often seen as the origin of <b>consultancy</b> <b>activities</b> [29, 39]. Concerning today's market leaders, Christopher McKenna has recently shown that what he calls "modern " management consultants, i. e. those individuals and firms offering "CEO-level studies of organization, strategy and operations, " were not linked to Taylorism. He asserts, on the other hand, the leading role of the U. S. consultancies world-wide. In his view, the growth of firms such as McKinsey during the 1930 s in the Unite...|$|R
