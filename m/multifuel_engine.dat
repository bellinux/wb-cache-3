50|$|Eaton, Ford, the US Army, and IMPACT Engineering, Inc. (of Kent, Washington), {{built an}} E-450 shuttle bus {{as part of}} the Army's HAMMER (Hydraulic Hybrid Advanced Materials <b>Multifuel</b> <b>Engine</b> Research) project.|$|E
50|$|From 1994 until 1999, the M35A3 variant was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} Extended Service Program. Usually, A3 vehicles have a Caterpillar 3116 Diesel engine and had their manual transmissions replaced with automatic ones, as well as receiving numerous other improvements with a redesigned frontal appearance. No new A3 standard-transmission vehicles were produced, all vehicles being upgraded from previous configurations during the rebuild process. The exception is some M109A3 shop vans. A small number of M109A3s were upgraded to A4 specifications using the M35A3 upgrade parts and procedures. As-built original A1's are gasoline-powered, A2's use the LDS 427-2 <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine,</b> and A3 use the LD/LDT 465-1c <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine.</b> It is common, however, to find rebuilds of former gas-powered REO and Studebaker models having A1 and A2 multifuel configurations.|$|E
50|$|Going {{into the}} war, Coventry Climax used their marine diesel {{experience}} to further develop {{and build the}} Armstrong Whitworth supercharged H30 <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine</b> for military use. This has been fitted as an auxiliary engine in the British Chieftain and Challenger battle tanks and Rapier anti-aircraft missile systems.|$|E
50|$|Currently, a {{wide range}} of Russian {{military}} vehicles employ <b>multifuel</b> <b>engines,</b> such as the T-72 tank (multifuel diesel) and the T-80 (multifuel gas turbine).|$|R
50|$|The {{movement}} to establish alternatives to automobiles running solely on gasoline has greatly {{increased the number}} of automobiles available which use <b>multifuel</b> <b>engines,</b> such vehicles generally being termed a bi-fuel vehicle or flexible-fuel vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Bi-fuel {{vehicles}} {{or otherwise}} known as dual fuel are vehicles with <b>multifuel</b> <b>engines</b> capable of running on two fuels. On internal combustion engines one fuel is gasoline or diesel, {{and the other is}} an alternate fuel such as natural gas (CNG), LPG, or hydrogen. The two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time in some cases, in others both fuels are used in unison. Bi-fuel vehicles have the capability to switch back and forth from gasoline or diesel to the other fuel, manually or automatically.|$|R
50|$|The Leyland L60 was {{an engine}} {{designed}} by Leyland Motors Ltd for the Chieftain main battle tank. It {{was designed to}} be a <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine</b> based on a bomber engine design but ultimately was underpowered and plagued with many problems like reliability issues and many more.|$|E
50|$|On 12 August 1964, BWB {{drafted the}} second {{generation}} requirements. Specification {{of the next generation}} called for mostly standard commercial vehicles with unlimited cross-country mobility, amphibious, with permanent all-wheel drive, low-pressure run flat tires, a steel cab, NBC protection, a <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine</b> and a minimum service life of ten years.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine</b> is {{constructed}} {{so that its}} compression ratio permits firing the lowest octane fuel of the various accepted alternative fuels. A strengthening of the engine is {{necessary in order to}} meet these higher demands. [...] Multifuel engines sometimes have switch settings that are set manually to take different octanes, or types, of fuel.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s more {{trucks were}} required, and the Army wanted {{to replace the}} <b>multifuel</b> <b>engines</b> with a {{standard}} diesel. AM General (successor of Kaiser-Jeep) developed an updated and redesigned version of the M39 series. Standardized as the M809 series, the primary difference was the engine. The hood, frame, and fenders were lengthened {{to make room for}} the larger engine, and it had a redesigned grille. All had an air cleaner on the left front fender, a quick visual way to tell them from the earlier M39 series. Jeep/AM General built all M809s between 1969 and 1982.|$|R
50|$|<b>Multifuel</b> <b>engines</b> are not {{necessarily}} underpowered, but in practice some engines have had issues with power due to design compromises necessary to burn multiple types of fuel in the same engine. Perhaps the most notorious example from a military perspective is the L60 engine used by the British Chieftain Main Battle Tank, {{which resulted in a}} very sluggish performance -- in fact, the Mark I Chieftain (used only for training and similar activities) was so underpowered that some were incapable of mounting a tank transporter. An equally serious issue was that changing from one fuel to another often required hours of preparation.|$|R
50|$|Multifuel, {{sometimes}} spelled multi-fuel, is {{any type}} of engine, boiler, or heater or other fuel-burning device {{which is designed to}} burn multiple types of fuels in its operation. One common application of multifuel technology is in military settings, where the normally-used diesel or gas turbine fuel might not be available during combat operations for vehicles or heating units. <b>Multifuel</b> <b>engines</b> and boilers have a long history, but the growing need to establish fuel sources other than petroleum for transportation, heating, and other uses has led to increased development of multifuel technology for non-military use as well, leading to many flexible-fuel vehicle designs in recent decades.|$|R
5000|$|The M39 series were {{originally}} {{powered by a}} Continental R6602, a [...] 602 cuin L inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine. The -A1 upgrade had a Mack ENDT-673, a [...] 673 cuin L turbocharged inline 6 cylinder diesel engine. The -A2 had a Continental LDS-465-1A [...] 478 cuin L turbocharged inline 6 cylinder <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The M809 series used a Cummins NHC250 engine, a 855 cuin L {{naturally}} aspirated inline 6 cylinder diesel engine developing [...] at 2100rpm and [...] of torque at 1500rpm. All {{models of the}} M809 series used this engine throughout their service life. The N series was a successful commercial design, with a conservative rating the engine was more powerful and less stressed than the Continental LDS-465 <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine</b> used in the M39 series.|$|E
5000|$|The M54 (officially M39) series (G-744) was a {{standardized}} military design 5-ton off-road 6x6 chassis, with many models. A Continental 6606 602 cuin L overhead valve inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developing [...] at 2800 rpm was used. In 1952 Mack began building the M51 Dump (4,310), M52 Semi-tractor (1,443), M54 Cargo (1,126), M55 Long cargo (85), and M61 Chassis-cab (107). In 1962 they {{took part in}} program to retrofit some of the series with a Mack ENDT 673 673 cuin L turbocharged inline 6 cylinder diesel engine developing [...] at 2100 rpm. Inside two years, after 2,500 conversions, the Army standardized the Continental LDS-465-1A, a 478 cuin L turbocharged inline 6 cylinder <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine</b> developing [...] at 2100 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|The first A2 trucks {{received}} the bigger LD-465-1 naturally aspirated 478 CID <b>multifuel</b> <b>engines,</b> keeping the OD {{transmission of the}} A1s. Through the years the trucks were upgraded to LD 465-1c engines, with 60Amp alternator instead of the 25Amp generator. With {{the addition of a}} turbocharger, the engine evolved into the LDT 465-1c (turbo clean air). The turbo was added more to clean up the black exhaust on the Non Turbo engines, than to add power; the HP was raised from 130 to only 135 HP. Turbo models used: 3LD305 (early engines only) and 3LJ319 (the [...] "whistler") The LDT-465-1D was the last version of the Multi Fuel, it had the same 3LJ319 Turbo (whistler), or the quieter 3LM39 (non-whistler), better head gasket sealing and head cooling.|$|R
50|$|For 62 years, Waukesha was an {{independent}} supplier of gasoline <b>engines,</b> diesel <b>engines,</b> <b>multifuel</b> <b>engines</b> (gasoline/kerosene/ethanol), and LNG/propane engines to many truck, tractor, heavy equipment, automobile, boat, ship, and engine-generator manufacturers. In 1906, The Waukesha Motor Company {{was founded in}} Waukesha, Wisconsin. In 1957, Waukesha bought the Climax Engineering Co. of Clinton, Iowa, also a noted builder of large engines. In 1968, Waukesha Motor Company was acquired by the Bangor-Punta Corporation. In 1973, Waukesha sold the Climax division to the Arrow Engine Company. In 1974, Waukesha Motor Company was sold to Dresser Industries and became Dresser's Waukesha Engine Division; its typical nicknames afterward were Waukesha Engine and Dresser Waukesha. In 1989, Dresser acquired the Brons company of the Netherlands. In 2010, Dresser, including Dresser Waukesha, was acquired by GE Energy.|$|R
50|$|BlueMotionTechnologies {{include all}} products, basic {{technologies}} and innovations that significantly improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. These basic technologies represent {{the foundations of}} BlueMotion. Currently, they cover the TDI (turbocharged diesel direct injection) and TSI (boosted petrol stratified direct injection) engines {{as well as the}} extremely efficient Direct Shift Gearbox (DSG). They are supplemented by technological innovations that include drive variants such as EcoFuel (natural gasengines), BiFuel (liquid natural gas <b>engines),</b> <b>MultiFuel</b> (ethanol <b>engines),</b> hybrid systems and electric drives, as well as NOx emissions control, regenerative braking and the Stop-Start system. These basic technologies and innovations are getting incorporated into a growing range of products. These products / vehicles are currently grouped at Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles into three concept brands: ‘BlueMotion’, ‘BlueMotion Technology’ and ‘BlueTDI’.|$|R
5000|$|The M35A2 is {{commonly}} powered by an LDT 465 engine, made by either Continental Motors Company, Hercules, or White Motor Company. It is an in-line, 478-cubic-inch (7.8 L), six-cylinder, turbocharged <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine</b> developing [...] and [...] of torque. This is {{coupled with a}} 5-speed manual transmission and divorced 2-speed transfer case (either a sprag-operated transfer case Rockwell 136-21 or air-operated selectable transfer case Rockwell 136-27). Multifuel engines are designed to operate reliably {{on a wide variety}} of fuels, including diesel fuel, jet fuel, kerosene, heating oil or gasoline. Gasoline may be used only in an emergency because it does not properly lubricate the injector pump. While using gasoline, common practice calls for the addition of at least 1 U.S. quart of clean motor oil per 15 U.S. gallons of gasoline (1 imp qt/13 imp gal; 1 L/60 L) for proper pump lubrication where available.|$|E
50|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle is an {{alternative}} fuel automobile or light duty truck with a <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine</b> that can use more than one fuel, usually mixed in the same tank, and the blend is burned in the combustion chamber together. These vehicles are colloquially called flex-fuel, or flexifuel in Europe, or just flex in Brazil. FFVs are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks. The most common commercially available FFV in the world market is the ethanol flexible-fuel vehicle, with the major markets concentrated in the United States, Brazil, Sweden, and some other European countries. In addition to flex-fuel vehicles running with ethanol, in the US and Europe there were successful test programs with methanol flex-fuel vehicles, known as M85 FFVs, and more recently there have been also successful tests using p-series fuels with E85 flex fuel vehicles, but as of June 2008, this fuel is not yet available to the general public.|$|E
40|$|The Brican TD 100 {{is a high}} performance, small UAS {{designed}} and made in Brampton Ontario Canada. The concept was defined in late 2009 and it is designed for a maximum weight of 25 kg which is now the accepted cut-off defining small civil UASs. A very clean tractor propeller layout is used with a lightweight composite structure and a high aspect ratio wing to obtain good range and endurance. The design features and performance of the initial electrically powered version are discussed and progress with developing a <b>multifuel</b> <b>engine</b> version is described. The system includes features enabling operation {{beyond line of sight}} (BLOS) and the proving missions are described. The vehicle has been used for aerial photography and low cost mapping using a professional grade Nikon DSLR camera. For forest fire research a FLIR A 65 IR camera was used, while for georeferenced mapping a new Applanix AP 20 system was calibrated with the Nikon camera. The sorties to be described include forest fire research, wildlife photography of bowhead whales in the Arctic and surveys of endangered caribou in a remote area of Labrador, with all these applications including the DSLR camera...|$|E
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines can be configured {{to run on}} many kinds of fuel, including gasoline, kerosene, tractor vaporizing oil (TVO), vegetable oil, diesel fuel, biodiesel, ethanol fuel (alcohol), and others. <b>Multifuel</b> <b>engines,</b> such as petrol-paraffin engines, can benefit from an initial vaporization of the fuel when they are running less volatile fuels. For this purpose, a vaporizer (or vaporiser) {{is placed in the}} intake system. The vaporizer uses heat from the exhaust manifold to vaporize the fuel. For example, the original Fordson tractor and various subsequent Fordson models had vaporizers. When Henry Ford & Son Inc designed the original Fordson (1916), the vaporizer was used to provide for kerosene operation. When TVO became common in various countries (including the United Kingdom and Australia) in the 1940s and 1950s, the standard vaporizers on Fordson models were equally useful for TVO. Widespread adoption of diesel engines in tractors made the use of tractor vaporizing oil obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Like the T-14, the T-15 {{is based}} on the Armata Universal Combat Platform, but unlike the T-14 it has its engine in the front. It is powered by a new {{generation}} 1,500 hp <b>multifuel</b> diesel <b>engine</b> coupled with a hydro-mechanical automatic transmission, has a combat weight of about 48 tons, a maximum road speed of 65-70 km/h, an operational range of 550 km, and a power-to-weight ratio of over 30 h.p./t.|$|R
5|$|De Gaulle {{decided that}} France, though {{formally}} remaining a member, {{would no longer}} participate in the NATO military organization. This caused a rift between France and West Germany, which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use <b>multifuel</b> diesel <b>engines.</b> German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the German Bundesrat decided to procure a purely national tank. In response, the same month the French government decided likewise.|$|R
50|$|The SuperAV is an 8x8 wheeled amphibious vehicle. It {{is powered}} by an Iveco Cursor 13 6L {{turbocharged}} <b>multifuel</b> diesel <b>engine</b> coupled with a ZF 7HP902 gearbox (seven forward and one reverse). It has {{a top speed of}} 105 kph mph on land and 10 kph mph on water. The vehicle's range is 500 mi on land and 40 mi on water. The wheels have a central tire inflation system and run-flat tires. The SuperAV is fully amphibious, able to operate in and over sea state 3. It can be air transported by a C-130 Hercules or an Airbus A400M.|$|R
50|$|The T-80 is {{a third-generation}} main battle tank (MBT) {{designed}} and {{manufactured in the}} Soviet Union. When it entered service in 1976, {{it was the first}} MBT in the world to feature a powerful <b>multifuel</b> turbine <b>engine</b> as its main propulsion engine. The T-80U was last produced in a factory in Omsk, Russia, while the T-80UD and further-developed T-84 continue to be produced in Ukraine. The T-80 and its variants are in service in Belarus, Cyprus, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Russia, South Korea, and Ukraine. The chief designer of the T-80 was the Russian engineer Nikolay Popov.|$|R

50|$|MUST-equipped {{surgical}} {{hospitals were}} operated {{for several years}} in Vietnam with mixed success. These units consisted of three basic elements, each {{of which could be}} airlifted and dispatched by truck or helicopter. The expandable surgical element was a self-contained, rigid-panel shelter with accordion sides. The air-inflatable ward element was a double-walled fabric shelter providing a free-space area for ward facilities. The utility element or power package contained a <b>multifuel</b> gas turbine <b>engine</b> which supplied electric power for air-conditioning, refrigeration, air heating and circulation, water heating and pumping, air pressure for the inflatable elements, and compressed air or suction. In addition, other expandables were used for central materiel supply, laboratory, X-ray, pharmacy, dental, and kitchen facilities.|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} towards 100 % renewable {{electricity production}} already raises several challenges at only 20 - 30 % of renewable share. To match energy production and consumption, {{there will be}} a need for massive daily and seasonal electricity storage, in particular for fluctuating sources such as wind and solar. Power-to-fuel is one of the energy storage systems that allows long term storage such as season shifting. Electricity can be stored into fuels that are gaseous (hydrogen or methane), easily liquefiable (ammonia), or liquid (methanol). Still, these four fuels are regarded separately in terms of energy production, which reduces the flexibility of the power-to-fuel technology and its potential use as a storage mean. Our approach is to integrate these four fuels into a single technology for power and heat production: Homogeneous-Charge Compression-Ignition (HCCI) engines. Therefore, we developed a 0 -Dimensional model to assess the suitability of a unique HCCI engine for the combustion of the four fuels of interest. This paper reports the feasibility of compression-ignition within achievable intake conditions (temperature and pressure) for various engine compression ratios, equivalence ratios and exhaust gas recirculation rates. For the four fuels, we obtained a proper ignition within a single engine design and for intake conditions (temperature and pressure) that can be sustained by recovering the heat losses of the engine only. As a consequence, power-to-fuel can effectively be used as a storage system when combined to a <b>multifuel</b> HCCI <b>engine</b> for the fuel reconversion to energy. Yet the low power densities estimated require further work on increased equivalence ratio and boosting conditions, {{as well as on the}} ringing risks associated with such techniques.
