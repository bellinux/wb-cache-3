In the United States, its incidence in African-Americans is twice that of Caucasian women (Trope et al. 2012). Because hematogenous metastasis often occurs early and the disease is often resistant to radiation and chemotherapy, the prognosis is poor without early surgical intervention (Gadducci et al. 2008). Patients with a rapidly enlarging uterine tumors, uterine tumors and abnormal vaginal bleeding, or giant uterine tumors are suspected to have uterine sarcomas.

There has been a series of governance reforms within the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in the past eighteen years. These vigorous reforms over the years have improved significantly CAS’s stability of organizational research landscape and focused governance of complex R&D across varying institutes, disciplines and fields. Dynamics of <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> as a key instrument of governance reforms, has experienced four stages from zero, being purely quantitative towards strategic usefulness and categorized principles. Organizational governance of CAS has been learning to be increasingly aggregated from the institutionalization of <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the growing stakeholders’ communication and interactions. The roles of <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> are for governing complexity and mitigating stakeholders’ tensions in CAS, which perform varyingly at different levels of organizational framework.

In the service QoE <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> proposed in this paper, QoE <b>evaluation</b> score <b>mechanism</b> would not be affected when the video streaming is encoded using layered coding and inter layered network coding technologies. Nonetheless, the corresponding QoE evaluation guidance policy requires appropriate guidelines, such as the introduction of partially redundant transmission mechanism, re-distribution of flow payload, and other technologies. It can also select one transport path as a backup path in multipath transmission. When the values of other path network QoS parameters are lower than the critical value, the path shall be prepared for redundant transmission, so as to ultimately improve service QoE score. The research on service QoE policy decision mechanism needs to be further strengthened in the future work.|$|R

40|$|Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is {{becoming}} the reference model for the specification and evaluation of access control policies. In ABAC policies and access requests are {{defined in terms of}} pairs attribute names/values. The applicability of an ABAC policy to a request is determined by matching the attributes in the request with the attributes in the policy. Some languages supporting ABAC, such as PTaCL or XACML 3. 0, take into account the possibility that some attributes values might not be correctly retrieved when the request is evaluated, and use complex decisions, usually describing all possible evaluation outcomes, to account for missing attributes. In this paper, we argue that the problem of missing attributes in ABAC {{can be seen as a}} nondeterministic attribute retrieval process, and we show that the current <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> in PTaCL or XACML can return a complex decision that does not necessarily match with the actual possible outcomes. This, however, is problematic for the enforcing mechanism, which needs to resolve the complex decision into a conclusive one. We propose a new <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> explicitly based on non-deterministic attribute retrieval for a given request. We extend this mechanism to probabilistic attribute retrieval and implement a probabilistic policy <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> for PTaCL in PRISM, a probabilistic model-checker...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Static {{semantic}} check remains an active research {{topic in the}} construction of compiler front-ends. The main reasons lie into the ever-increasing set of semantic properties that have to be checked in modern languages and the diverse requirements in the timing of checks during the compilation process. Challenging single-pass compilers, impose the development of appropriate parse-driven attribute <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> LR parsing is amenable to L-attributed definitions, where, in every syntax tree, the attributes may be evaluated in only one left to right depth-first-order traversal. In such definitions, for every production of the grammar, the inherited attributes on the right side depend only on attributes to the left of themselves. When the LR-parser begins to analyze a word for a non-terminal, the values of its inherited attributes must be made available. This outstanding difficulty constitutes the major concern of the existing attribute <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> found in the literature. We review them and then we introduce the <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which we successfully utilized in YAPL, a complete programming language build exclusively for educational purposes. Our approach takes advantage of an effective attributecollection management scheme, between a parse-driven symbol node stack and the symbol table, for delivering synthesized and inherited attribute values. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the suggested approach to representative problems of enforcing language rules for declaration and scope related properties and in type checking of assignments. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an {{evolutionary}} framework for categorization. Evolution needs an <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> to work, and it is argued that primary values that the organism needs for its survival [...] such as food, mates for reproduction, and shelter [...] can drive the evolution of categories. Sensory stimulation is needed to build up the cognitive apparatus, but cannot in itself provide the <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> for evolution. Categorization constrained by values will be dependent on the availability of sensory information, and its power as predictive of values. As perception and categorization are tied to the actions of the organism, it is argued that the unit of perception should be seen as larger than the usual singledimension stimulus, and evidence is reviewed to support this claim. Covarying stimuli will also provide a much greater predictive power than single-dimension stimuli alone...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation {{has been}} {{designed}} and used {{as an instrument of}} organisational governance for publicly funded research institutions (PRIs). Such an instrument can justify external public support and provide internal evidence for decision-making and organisational learning. Under given national and institutional contexts, defined missions of PRIs shape the characteristics of organisational governance in at least three aspects: strategies, funding, and operation. Governance tensions related to them involve key stakeholders at three organisational levels: central decision-making and supervisory bodies at the macro-level (L 1), research institutes at the meso-level (L 2) and individual researchers at the micro-level (L 3). The thesis offers a conceptual framework, built in a formative way, to answer the research question: How do <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of PRIs play a balancing role and help to mitigate tensions in organisational governance? Three PRIs were investigated, namely, the Max Planck Society (MPG) and the Helmholtz Association (HGF) in Germany, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Their governance tensions across the three levels are reflected and balanced by the <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which facilitate the organisational learning. The balancing processes occur when the individual evaluation activities supplement each other within the institutionalisation of the overarching <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> During the processes, the stakeholders’ interactions and negotiations vis-à-vis their diverging interests are also facilitated. Generalisable balancing roles of <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in organisational governance are found at each organisational level in the three PRIs studied. Specifically, the balance found at L 1 is between external justification of public funding and internal governance of heterogeneous research; at L 2 between required alignment of organisational strategies and individual institutes’ autonomous development; and at L 3 between meeting management instructions and protecting scientists’ trust and freedom. A common principle to mitigate governance tensions across the three levels involving various stakeholders is found—a proper contextualisation of evaluation designs and uses. Implications are suggested for useful ways of discovering and balancing governance tensions at PRIs in general and for public policies on research evaluation in wider landscapes of PRIs...|$|R
