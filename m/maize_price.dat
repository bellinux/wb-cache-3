5000|$|However, as {{government}} policies increasingly favored industry over agriculture, rural conditions began to deteriorate. In 1957, the Mexican government began {{to regulate the}} price of maize through massive imports {{in order to keep}} low urban food costs. [...] This regulation severely undercut the market price of maize lowering the profit margins of small farmers. At the same time, the Green Revolution had entered into Mexican agriculture. Inspired by the work of Norman Borlaug, farmers that employed hybrid seeds and fertilizer supplements were able to double or even triple their yields per acre. [...] Unfortunately, these products came at a relatively high cost, {{out of the reach of}} many farmers struggling after the devaluation of the price of maize. The combined effects of the <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> regulation and the Green Revolution was the consolidation of small farms into larger estates. [...] A 1974 study conducted by Osorio concluded that in 1960, about 50.3% of the individual land plots in Mexico contained less than 5 hectares of land. In contrast, the top 0.5% of estates by land spanned 28.3% of all arable land. As many small farmers lost land, they either migrated to the cities or became migrant workers roving from large estate to large estate. Between 1950 and 1970, the proportion of migrant workers increased from 36.7% to 54% of the total population. The centralized pattern of industrial development and government policies overwhelmingly favoring industrialization contributed to massive rural flight in Mexico beginning in the late 1960s until the present day.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the role of}} market remoteness in explaining <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> volatility in Burkina Faso. A model of price formation is introduced to demonstrate formally that transport costs between urban and rural markets exacerbate <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> volatility. Empirical support is provided to the proposition by exploring an unusually rich data set of monthly <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> series across 28 markets over 2004 – 13. The methodology relies on an autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model to investigate the statistical effect of road quality and distance from urban consumption centers on <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> volatility. The analysis finds that <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> volatility is greatest in remote markets. The results also show that maize-surplus markets and markets bordering Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana and Togo have experienced more volatile prices than maize-deficit and non-bordering markets.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} role of market {{remoteness}} on <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> volatility in a developing country, Burkina Faso. A trade model between a rural area and an urban area is used to show that transport costs increase volatility in rural markets when this volatility is due to local supply or demand shocks in the rural area. We provide empirical support to this proposition by exploring a dataset of monthly <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> series across 28 markets over the 2004 – 2014 period in Burkina Faso. Travel time, kilometric distance and road pavement are used as proxies for transport costs. We estimate an autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model to investigate the statistical effect of these proxies on <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> volatility. We find a robust and positive effect of transport costs on <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> volatility.

40|$|Thesis (MCom (Risk management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Maize traders on the South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX) {{strive to}} {{determine}} future price movements by tracking the following influential price indicators: domestic fundamental factors, the USA yellow <b>maize</b> <b>prices,</b> and the ZAR/USD exchange rate. This study investigates {{whether there were}} certain periods where the CBOT yellow <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> influenced the SAFEX yellow <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> more than in other periods, as well as whether fundamental factors {{can be used as}} a price indicator in the periods where CBOT had a less significant effect on the SAFEX prices. Therefore, this study examined the approach of determining the future price movements of yellow <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> in South Africa by establishing the volatility spill–over effect between the two markets in two seasonal regimes and comparing the results. After an extensive empirical study and a supporting literature overview of the fundamental factors that influence the South African and USA maize markets, the volatility spill–over effect between SAFEX and CBOT was determined. This led the study to conclude the following: There are certain periods where the CBOT yellow <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> influenced the SAFEX yellow <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> more than in other periods. Consequently, in the periods where CBOT did have a less significant influence on the SAFEX prices, fundamental factors could be used as an alternative price indicator. Traders on the SAFEX market can therefore use the CBOT yellow <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> as a reliable price indicator in the South African harvesting season; whereas, in the planting season, the CBOT prices in collaboration with fundamental analysis should be used.

40|$|Maize {{is one of}} {{the major}} staples and cash crops for many Tanzanians. Excessive {{volatility}} of <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> destabilises farm income in maize-growing regions and is likely to jeopardise nutrition and investment in many poor rural communities. This study investigates whether market reform policies in Tanzania have increased the volatility of <b>maize</b> <b>prices,</b> and identifies regional characteristics that can be attributed to the spatial price volatility. To achieve the objectives, an autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity in mean (ARCH-M) model is developed and estimated in this study. Results show that the reforms have increased farm-gate prices and overall <b>price</b> volatility. <b>Maize</b> <b>prices</b> are lower in surplus and less developed regions than those in deficit and developed regions. Results also show that the developed and maize-deficit regions, and regions bordering other countries have experienced less volatile prices than less developed, maize-surplus and non-bordering regions. Our findings indicate that investments in communication and transportation infrastructures from government and donor countries are likely to increase inter-regional and international trade, thereby reducing the spatial price volatility in Tanzanian <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> in the long run.

This {{study was conducted in}} two ASAL counties of Kenya, Kajiado and Makueni, inhabited by pastoral communities. Both primary and secondary data were collected on climate and socio-economic aspects from published and unpublished documents. Time series data covering a 31 year period were collected on rainfall amounts, rain days, temperature, beef and <b>maize</b> <b>prices,</b> stocking, livestock sales and land under cultivation to generate descriptive statistics and regression results based on the OLS, GLS and AR models.

Given the importance of South Africa as a regional supplier of maize and price discovery mechanism, investigations into the volatility of the <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> are not only important, but also indispensable if all parties involved are to manage this risk.

40|$|In Swaziland, maize is {{important}} for food security, yet its production is low and the country has not achieved self-sufficiency. Swaziland has had a shortfall in domestic maize production since independence. About 80 percent of the rural population never has enough maize for consumption. The National Maize Corporation (NMC) was established as a self-sufficiency mechanism in 1985. The NMC is the only white maize importer and is also responsible for the stabilisation of domestic prices. The organisation has endeavoured to stabilise Swaziland's <b>maize</b> <b>prices,</b> though they are still high by regional comparisons. This study seeks to investigate the relationship between Swaziland and South African white <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> {{in the presence of}} <b>maize</b> marketing and <b>pricing</b> policy, as implemented by the NMC. The maize marketing policy controls flow of maize imports and exports in Swaziland, while the pricing policy controls the domestic white <b>maize</b> <b>prices.</b> The current pricing relationship between the two countries was compared with a scenario where marketing and pricing policies in Swaziland are absent. This was done in order to gauge the effect that these policies have on the integration of Swaziland into the regional maize market and ultimately how Swaziland <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> are affected by price transmission process in the presence and absence of these policies. The study used secondary data from the NMC, the Ministry of Agriculture, and journals. Monthly data from 2000 to 2014 are used and econometric time series techniques are applied. The study hypothesised that there is a long-run relationship between Swaziland and South African <b>maize</b> <b>prices,</b> given the current market structure. It also hypothesised the short-run dynamics correct deviations from the long run in a fast and efficient manner. Lastly, it is hypothesised that current policies are not hampering marketing integration or impeding regional price signals to flow through to Swaziland maize markets. The results confirm the presence of a long-run price relationship between the above-mentioned markets. In the presence of the current <b>maize</b> marketing and <b>pricing</b> policy, the error correction term corrected or adjusted the disequilibrium, from long-run equilibrium levels, at a speed of 3. 8 per cent per period, indicating relatively slow correction. This could serve as evidence of inefficient integration between the two markets and an indication of weak arbitrage process. Weak arbitrage, in turn, has definite welfare implications in that it leads to inefficient allocation of resources. In comparison to the other scenario, there is a slight difference: when analysing the relationship between import parity and Swaziland domestic prices without policy measures, short-run and long-run relationship between markets are also confirmed. Here the error correction term, however corrected the disequilibrium of the system at a speed of 4. 7 percent per period. This shows a slight improvement of efficiency when policies are eliminated. This study could be useful to policy makers in that it imparts knowledge on how world price signals are transmitted to their domestic markets. Understanding the price dynamics could, therefore, facilitate policy formulation related to price and marketing in the white maize industry. The findings of this study could ultimately also inform the self-sufficiency versus food affordability debate. Dissertation (MSc (Agric)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

Based on food security needs and {{the central role of}} agriculture, Africa may stand to benefit from green biotechnology given the low agricultural productivity and the looming food crises in most urban areas. However, the adoption of GM crops in Africa has been slow and limited to a handful of countries. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the impact of GM maize adoption in South Africa by looking at wholesale spot prices. We apply a threshold autoregressive model to time series data on the price of maize and GM adoption rates in South Africa to address the following questions: (1) Does the adoption of GM maize excite the growth rate of price of maize in South Africa; (2) Does the error variance of the <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> growth rate exhibit regime-switching behaviour to impact the volatility? The results show evidence that the adoption of GM maize influences the dynamics of the <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> growth rate in South Africa. Further, there is strong evidence that the error variance exhibits regime-switching behaviour with the posterior mean for the error variance in the first regime about twice as large as that of the second regime.

40|$|The {{high cost}} of maize in Kenya is {{basically}} driven by East African regional commodity demand forces and agricultural drought. The production of maize, which is a common staple food in Kenya, is greatly affected by agricultural drought. However, calculations of drought risk and impact on maize production in Kenya {{is limited by the}} scarcity of reliable rainfall data. The objective {{of this study was to}} apply a novel hyperspectral remote sensing method to modelling temporal fluctuations of maize production and prices in five markets in Kenya. SPOT-VEGETATION NDVI time series were corrected for seasonal effects by computing the standardized NDVI anomalies. The maize residual price time series was further related to the NDVI seasonal anomalies using a multiple linear regression modelling approach. The result shows a moderately strong positive relationship (0. 67) between residual price series and global maize prices. Maize prices were high during drought periods (i. e. negative NDVI anomalies) and low during wet seasons (i. e. positive NDVI anomalies). This study concludes that NDVI is a good index for monitoring the evolution of maize prices and food security emergency planning in Kenya. To obtain a very strong correlation for the relationship between the wholesale <b>maize</b> <b>price</b> and the global <b>maize</b> <b>price,</b> future research could consider adding other price-driving factors into the regression models...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{evaluation}} of Thailand's maize export agreement policy through economic analyses of prices and markets for Thai maize. Maize export agreements between Thailand and Japan since 1966 and recently Taiwan has {{played an important role}} to the overall development of Thai maize. These agreements feature two important policy elements, (a) an export quota and (b) a fixed export price. Some disagreements now exist, however, as to whether these export agreements are more or less desirable for Thailand than free trade. Statistical analyses of the wholesale-export <b>price</b> linkages of <b>maize</b> in Bangkok, using monthly contract data during 1970 - 1974 crops years, showed that the Bangkok wholesale <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> were heavily influenced by fixed formula export prices and the export quotas under the agreement contracts. The former has its direct impact on local <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> and <b>maize</b> stocks. The latter, on the other hand, influence maize stocks which later help to determine <b>maize</b> <b>prices.</b> Since the formula export prices and export quotas are known at least 30 to 60 days before shipments of maize, the local market tends to react to these coming export conditions one to two months earlier. In addition, the local supply conditions and the weather also play a part in the pricing process of Thai maize in Bangkok. The estimated relations between wholesale <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> and <b>maize</b> stocks revealed that maize stocks in a given month were largely determined by wholesale <b>maize</b> <b>prices</b> in the past one to two months. Also, the <b>price</b> responsiveness of <b>maize</b> stocks was very high when wholesale prices were low relative to export prices and vice versa. The analysis of structural changes in maize exporting firms also showed that the number of very small exporting firms increased substantially while the number of large firms was small and stable. Most large exporters exhibited average apparent size close to maximum size barrier (5 percent) of the quota system. Many small exporters, on the other hand, held, on average, less than 1 percent export share. The apparent export concentration of the firms was between 52 to 64 percent and did not substantially change between 1969 and 1974 crop years. Because of the limited quotas, large firms tended to secure additional export quotas sold by small exporters. The actual changes in size and number of exporting firms were then accentuated by these quota transfers. Moreover, an analysis of export markets for Thai maize showed that Thailand {{can be viewed as a}} price taker in either the world or regional maize market. Despite being a <b>price</b> taker, Thailand's <b>maize</b> exports deteriorated in a relative sense through a weakening competition position in the international maize trade. In addition, there is little evidence that the maize export agreements help to offset this relative trade deterioration. The agreements probably prevented widespread market disruption, but at the same time small and inefficient exporting firms are protected by the ensured market demand under agreements. This protection reduces incentives for small firms to be innovative and aggressive and also stifles growth and expansion by larger firms. Finally, the study argues that Thailand's maize export agreement policy should be abandoned in the long run and an adjustment toward free trade should be encouraged.
