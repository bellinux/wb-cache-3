Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month.

When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.|$|E

50|$|Forests cover 31% {{of total}} land area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet. <b>Of</b> that, 12% are {{designated}} for <b>the</b> conservation <b>of</b> biological diversity {{and nearly all}} are inhabited. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples,</b> who live in and have customary rights to their forests, have developed ways of life and traditional knowledge that are attuned to their forest environments.

These encroachments often force forest peoples out of their forest homes. Many conservation schemes to establish wilderness reserves also deny forest peoples’ rights.|$|R
