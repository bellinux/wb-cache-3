The task is challenging because signalto-noise ratio (SNR) cannot be readily inferred from the acoustics alone.

The method produces an audio-visual recognition performance better than that of both the audio-only and the videoonly baselines across a wide range of SNRs.

40|$|Classification {{of remote}} sensing imagery {{provides}} an inexpensive yet efficient approach to land cover mapping. In supervised image classification, training samples are collected through certain sampling schemes, {{which are used}} to derive classification rules, aiming for adequate accuracy for the applications at hand. However, in conventional classification methods, the potential of training samples in terms of locational information is not tapped further, confounding the classification accuracy to the limited separability inherent to the given input feature vector. This paper explores two methods pertaining to geostatistics, i. e., simple kriging with local mean and cokriging, to predict class occurrences based on training samples' indicator transforms (location and classes) and spectrally derived class probabilities, thus calibrating the a posterior class probability vectors derived from initial spectral classification. The results showed that classification accuracy is significantly increased by these two methods for utilizing spatial information contained in training samples and initial spectral classification, compared with those obtainable with spectral classification. Moreover, the proposed methods constitute a valuable strategy for <b>making</b> <b>fuller</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> information residing in training data for improving spectrally derived classification, which is independent of the specific classifiers initially adopted for image classification...|$|R

We prove that the only non-identity automorphism of P is the duality map. Then we apply these results to investigate definability in the closely related lattice of universal classes of posets. We prove that this lattice has only one non-identity automorphism, the duality map; that the set of finitely generated and also the set of finitely axiomatizable universal classes are definable subsets of the lattice; and that for each member K of either of these two definable subsets, {K,K ∂ } is a definable subset of the lattice.

Second, in terms of integrity, the SEC had {{to get rid of the}} penny-ante swindles based on fake information, fraudulent devices, and unsound get-rich-quick schemes. That unsavory element had to be prosecuted and shut down. Thirdly, and much more important than the outright frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar insider maneuvers by top officials of major corporations, whereby insiders with access to much better information about the condition of the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was given high priority. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear-cut set of deadlines, rules and guidelines that everyone had to follow. Drafting precise rules was the main challenge faced by the bright young lawyers. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and tricked and taken advantage of by Wall Street.

The co-designing framework and its outcome are revisited and scrutinized here in light of four factors presumed to influence the quality of the process and its outcome: representativity, continuity, ownership, and innovation.

The intention is to deepen our understanding of the planning framework and the consequences of user participation and co-designing by highlighting recurring factors connected to the collaborative planning process and its outcome.
