40|$|The {{various types}} of fishways are {{installed}} at the multi-functional weirs in the four major rivers to minimize the negative effect due {{to the construction of}} the transverse structures. The <b>movable</b> <b>weir</b> was installed at the upstream of the ice-harbor type artificial fishway of the Dalseong weir in the Nakdong river, which can control the fishway flowrate regardless of the river flowrate. The incoming flowrate to the artificial fishway is closely related with the hydraulic characteristics that dominate the fish passage efficiency. Thus, it is crucial to find out the weir operation rule for properly sustaining efficient fish-passage, such as the optimized flowrate. In this study, the FLOW- 3 D was used to analyze and compare the various hydraulic characteristics associated with the passage efficiency, based upon the given different flowrate, and subsequently provide the optimized flowrate for the fishway <b>movable</b> <b>weir</b> to maintain the bes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} a hybrid panel that can overcome the current problem of corrosion of the steel panels of improved <b>movable</b> <b>weirs</b> when they are exposed to a sulfate and calcium chloride environment such as sea water. A hybrid panel with glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) layers on both sides of a steel panel means that the central panel is not exposed to the external elements, which can avoid corrosion problems. In this study, to maximize the hybrid panel’s strength and durability, the moisture absorption characteristics and the durability in an accelerated environment were evaluated. The test results were considered to indicate no durability issues as the final absorption ratio was approximately 2. 0 % or less in all environments. Also, from the accelerated deterioration test results when the steel panel processed by sand blasting was applied in all accelerated deterioration environments, it satisfied the residual strength level of 65 % or more. However, in the case without surface processing, upon exposure to MgSO 4 solution, it did not satisfy the standard residual strength level of 65 %. These results show that sand blasting on the surface of a steel panel is adequate for hybrid panels for improved <b>movable</b> <b>weirs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in the bed}} of Geum River (L= 130 km from Daechung {{regulation}} dam to Geum River estuarial bank) in South Korea were predicted {{using the}} 1 -D HEC-RAS model and the 2 -D CCHE 2 D model. Three <b>movable</b> <b>weirs</b> have been installed and dredging has been carried out in Geum River under the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project (2009 - 2012). Inflow data of sub basins were calibrated with daily runoff data generated by PRMS based on a hydrologic unit map. To determine the gate opening height for maintaining the management water level, unsteady analysis was performed using HEC-RAS. Thereafter, long-term riverbed changes through quasi-unsteady analysis were simulated for 20 years. In order to investigate the effect of <b>movable</b> <b>weirs,</b> sediment analysis was done for three cases of gate opening: case 1 is fully close, case 2 is fully open, and case 3 is regulating gates by the operating rule. Also, short-term riverbed changes were predicted with CCHE 2 D for 11 days in the problem area, depending on the results of 1 -D model, and the effect of dikes was examined. In future, gate operation and structural methods such as dikes must be in step with each other in order to manage sediment and rivers in an ecofriendly manner...|$|R
40|$|<b>Movable</b> <b>weirs</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} to address the weaknesses of conventional fixed weirs. However, the structures for riverbed protection downstream of <b>movable</b> <b>weirs</b> are designed using the criteria of fixed weirs in most cases, and these applications cause problems, such as scour and deformation of structures, due to misunderstanding the difference between different types of structures. In this study, a hydraulic experiment was conducted to examine weir type-specific hydraulic phenomena, compare hydraulic jumps and downstream flow characteristics according to different weir types, and analyze hydraulic characteristics, such as changes in water levels, velocities and energy. Additionally, to control the flow generated by a sluice gate, energy dissipators were examined herein for their effectiveness in relation to different installation locations and heights. As a result, it was found that although sluice gates generated hydraulic jumps similar to those of fixed weirs, their downstream supercritical flow increased to eventually elongate the overall hydraulic jumps. In energy dissipator installation, installation heights were found to be sensitive to energy dissipation. The most effective energy dissipator height was 10 % of the downstream free surface water depth in this experiment. Based on these findings, it seems desirable to use energy dissipators to reduce energy, as such dissipators were found to be effective in reducing hydraulic jumps and protecting the riverbed under sluice gates...|$|R

Qin administrators introduced improved agricultural technology. Li Bing, engineered the Dujiangyan irrigation system to control the Min River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. This innovative hydraulic system was composed of <b>movable</b> <b>weirs</b> which could be adjusted for high or low water flow according to the season, to either provide irrigation or prevent floods. The increased agricultural output and taxes made the area a source of provisions and men for Qin's unification of China.|$|R
50|$|Human {{intervention}} sometimes inadvertently modifies {{the course}} or {{characteristics of a}} river, for example by introducing obstructions such as mining refuse, sluice gates for mills, fish-traps, unduly wide piers for bridges and solid weirs. By impeding flow these measures can raise the flood-level upstream. Regulations {{for the management of}} rivers may include stringent prohibitions with regard to pollution, requirements for enlarging sluice-ways and the compulsory raising of their gates for the passage of floods, the removal of fish traps, which are frequently blocked up by leaves and floating rubbish, reduction in the number and width of bridge piers when rebuilt, and the substitution of <b>movable</b> <b>weirs</b> for solid weirs.|$|R

Additional work was carried out starting in 1837 by Russian Empire and completed around 1846-1848. To supply the canal system with water, mainly the canal pound, Beloozerski and Orekhovski watercourses were started in 1839 and completed in 1843.The number of <b>movable</b> <b>weirs</b> between Brest and Pinsk reached 22.

To solve the dis-turbance of flood control caused by soil sediment and environment problems from the severance of moving sediment, <b>movable</b> <b>weir</b> is currently set up so as to solve that serious problem. There have been many studies focusing on the weir in specific target area. however, it is not applicable for all kinds of moveable weir. Therefore, In this study, experiments for moveable weir typed sluice gate are performed and hydraulics characteristics are measured depending on gate operation. According to comparison results between apron length calculated by Bligh's equation and hydraulic jump length by experiments, hydraulic jump length is bigger than apron length by Bligh's equation where oscillation jump happens.

40|$|Weirs {{may be used}} {{to control}} the discharge, {{decrease}} the water slope in canals and to distribute water between canals for irrigation, etc. The objective of this research was to investigate the influence of using one opening or more in weirs on discharge coefficient (Cd), the hydraulic jump characteristics and velocity distribution downstream of these structures. This study is based on an experimental program. Three cases of openings arrangements were included, one, two and three openings. Different diameters of openings (D) and different heights from the bed (Z) were tested. The experiments showed that decreasing (D/Z) for weirs which have the same openings numbers and diameters decreases the discharge coefficient (Cd) and the ratio between the length of the submerged hydraulic jump (Lj) and the water tail depth (yt). Also, decreasing (D/Z) leads to make the maximum velocity near the bed tends to be lifted upward. Moreover, Comparing <b>weirs</b> <b>with</b> different openings numbers but have the same openings area leads to that, <b>weirs</b> <b>with</b> one opening have a bigger (Cd) than <b>weirs</b> <b>with</b> two or three openings but the maximum velocity near the bed of the <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> three openings is less than that with one opening. Also, the hydraulic jump length downstream <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> three openings is less than that downstream <b>weir</b> <b>with</b> one opening. Finally, equations were developed to deduce the value of the coefficient of discharge for the composite structure...|$|R

In addition, it can predict time-dependent scour depth considering soil properties under unsteady state in order to investigate the hydraulic effects on bridge structure located downstream.

50|$|By {{installing}} gauges in {{a fairly}} large river and its tributaries at suitable points, and keeping continuous records for some time of the heights of the water at the various stations, {{the rise of the}} floods in the different tributaries, the periods they take in passing down to definite stations on the main river, and the influence they severally exercise on the height of the floods at these places, can be ascertained. With the help of these records, and by observing the times and heights of the maximum rise of a particular flood at the stations on the various tributaries, the time of arrival and height of the top of the flood at any station on the main river can be predicted with remarkable accuracy two or more days beforehand. By communicating these particulars about a high flood to places on the lower river, weir-keepers are enabled to fully open the <b>movable</b> <b>weirs</b> beforehand to permit the passage of the flood, and riparian inhabitants receive timely warning of the impending inundation.|$|R
