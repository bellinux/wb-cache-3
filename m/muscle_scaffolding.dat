40|$|International audienceDystrophin is a <b>muscle</b> <b>scaffolding</b> {{protein that}} {{establishes}} a structural {{link between the}} cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Despite the large body {{of knowledge about the}} dystrophin gene and its interactions, the functional importance of the large central rod domain remains highly controversial. It is composed of 24 spectrin-like repeats interrupted by four hinges that delineate three sub-domains. We express repeat 1 - 3 and repeat 20 - 24 sub-domains, delineated by hinges 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 and the single repeats 2 and 23. We determine their lipid-binding properties, thermal and urea stabilities and refolding velocities. By using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography, we show that repeat 2 and the repeat 1 - 3 sub-domain strongly interact with anionic lipids. By contrast, repeat 23 and the repeat 20 - 24 sub-domain do not interact with lipids. In addition, the repeat 1 - 3 sub-domain and repeat 2 are dramatically less stable and refold faster than the repeat 20 - 24 sub-domain and repeat 23. The contrasting properties of the two sub-domains clearly indicate that they make up two units of the rod domain that are not structurally interchangeable, thus providing molecular evidence supporting the observations on the biological function of dystrophin...|$|E
40|$|Desmin (DES) {{is a major}} <b>muscle</b> <b>scaffolding</b> {{protein that}} also {{functions}} to anchor mitochondria. Pathogenic DES mutations, however, have not previously been recognized {{as a cause of}} multi-systemic mitochondrial disease. Here, we describe a 45 -year-old man who presented to The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Mitochondrial-Genetics Diagnostic Clinic for evaluation of progressive cardiac, neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, and mood disorders. Muscle biopsy at age 45 was remarkable for cytoplasmic bodies, as well as ragged red fibers and SDH positive/COX negative fibers that were suggestive of a mitochondrial myopathy. Muscle also showed significant reductions in mitochondrial content (16 % of control mean for citrate synthase activity) and mitochondrial DNA (35 % of control mean). His family history was significant for cardiac conduction defects and myopathy in multiple maternal relatives. Multiple single gene and panel-based sequencing studies were unrevealing. Whole exome sequencing identified a known pathogenic p. S 13 F mutation in DES that had previously been associated with desmin-related myopathy. Desmin-related myopathy is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by right ventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myopathy, and arrhythmias. However, neuropathy, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and depletion of both mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA have not previously been widely recognized in this disorder. Recognition that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in desmin-related myopathy clarifies the basis for the multi-systemic manifestations, as are typical of primary mitochondrial disorders. Understanding the mitochondrial pathophysiology of desmin-related myopathy highlights the possibility of new therapies for the otherwise untreatable and often fatal class of disease. We postulate that drug treatments aimed at improving mitochondrial biogenesis or reducing oxidative stress may be effective therapies to ameliorate the effects of desmin-related disease...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{receptor}} potential (TRP) {{channels are}} nonselective cation channels, several {{of which are}} expressed in striated <b>muscle.</b> Because the <b>scaffolding</b> protein Homer 1 has been implicated in TRP channel regulation, we hypothesized that Homer proteins {{play a significant role}} in skeletal muscle function. Mice lacking Homer 1 exhibited a myopathy characterized by decreased muscle fiber cross-sectional area and decreased skeletal muscle force generation. Homer 1 knockout myotubes displayed increased basal current density and spontaneous cation influx. This spontaneous cation influx in Homer 1 knockout myotubes was blocked by reexpression of Homer 1 b, but not Homer 1 a, and by gene silencing of TRPC 1. Moreover, diminished Homer 1 expression in mouse models of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy suggests that loss of Homer 1 scaffolding of TRP channels may contribute to the increased stretch-activated channel activity observed in mdx myofibers. These findings provide direct evidence that Homer 1 functions as an important scaffold for TRP channels and regulates mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle...|$|R
40|$|Caveolin- 3 is a <b>muscle</b> {{specific}} <b>scaffolding</b> protein {{with both}} structural and signaling roles. Lack of caveolin- 3 expression has {{been implicated in}} limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, along with distal myopathy and rippling muscle disease. These diseases are characterized by progressive muscle weakness and muscle wasting. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) clustering and localization are important for efficient nerve to muscle contractile signal transmission. It is hypothesized that muscle weakness could originate through disrupted nAChR clustering, disrupting the efficiency of signaling from the motorneuron to the muscle. While the molecular mechanisms involved in nAChR clustering remain to be fully defined, we hypothesize caveolin- 3 is important for nAChR clustering and overall neuromuscular junction function. Caveolin- 3 and the nAChR co-localize and associate evidenced by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation. These results were replicated in differentiated wildtype myotubes treated with the nAChR clustering agent, neural agrin. In differentiated caveolin- 3 null myotubes, agrin treatment yields a 60 % reduction in nAChR clusters as compared to agrin treated wildtype myotubes. Agrin induces nAChR clustering, through activation of muscle specific kinase (MuSK) and downstream through Rac- 1 activation. In differentiated wildtype myotubes, Rac- 1 activation peaks at 1 hour of agrin treatment, while in differentiated caveolin- 3 null myotubes there is dramatically reduced Rac- 1 activation upon agrin treatment. Immunoprecipitation of MuSK shows that caveolin- 3 and MuSK association peaks at 1 hour of agrin treatment in wildtype cells. This corresponds to the peak of MuSK phosphorylation which also occurs at 1 hour. Agrin induced MuSK phosphorylation was decreased more significantly than the overall decrease in MuSK expression in the caveolin- 3 null cells {{as compared to the}} wildtype results. These results indicate a role for caveolin- 3 in efficient nAChR clustering. Electromyography studies in anesthetized mice indicated lengthened latencies of the muscle action potential in the caveolin- 3 null mice as compared to wildtype mice. There were also decreased overall electromyography (EMG) amplitude and EMG area under the curve in caveolin- 3 null mice. Comparison of contractile strength in wildtype and caveolin- 3 null animals indicated tetanic contractions to be less stable in the caveolin- 3 null animals, though there was late potentiation in actual contractile strength. Lack of caveolin- 3 affects the neuromuscular junction formation and transmission without affecting overall contractile strength. This research opens a novel view, that correct neuromuscular junction formation and neuromuscular transmission is important in the development of muscular dystrophies...|$|R
40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) {{is the most}} devastating form of {{muscular dystrophy}} caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Defects in the dystrophin gene in DMD, are homologous to that found in mdx mice, and result in profound muscle damage, inflammation and weakness in diaphragm and limb <b>muscles.</b> Dystrophin, a <b>scaffolding</b> protein located in the sarcolemmal cytoskeleton, helps cells to maintain their structural integrity and associates with critical cell signaling molecules that regulate cell growth and repair (e. g., nNOS). While the contributing mechanisms leading to DMD-induced degenerative muscle function and damage are multi-factorial, elevated oxidative stress has been proposed as a central mechanism. In contrast, antioxidants can attenuate muscle damage as well as improve contractile function in dystrophin-deficient muscles. However, it is unknown if oxidative stress is a causal factor in dystrophin-deficient diaphragm muscle pathology and specifically targeted antioxidant (e. g., EUK- 134) treated early {{in the course of}} the disease (3 - 4 weeks) can modulate oxidative stress, functional damage and weakness in mdx diaphragm. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of catalase/superoxide dismutase mimetic EUK- 134 on damage, inflammation, and contractile function of the diaphragm muscle in mdx mice. We hypothesized that (a) EUK- 134 would attenuate muscle damage and oxidative stress in mdx diaphragm, (b) EUK- 134 would reduce inflammatory cells and an important transcription factor including nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) in mdx diaphragm and (c) EUK- 134 would restore proteins that attach to dystrophin such as nNOS and cytoskeletal proteins back to sarcolemmal region and improve muscle contractility in mdx diaphragm. C 57 BL/ 10 ScSn wild type and mdx mice were given EUK- 134 (30 mg/kg, i. p., injection) beginning at 20 days of age for 8 days. The mice were euthanized and the diaphragm muscle was harvested at 4 weeks of age, the time of peak inflammation, and analyzed to measure myofiber inflammation, NF-kB activation, cytoskeletal proteins and oxidative stress markers using Western immunoblotting, ELISA, immunofluoresence, and immunohistochemistry. We found that EUK- 134 ameliorated muscle damage and oxidative stress in mdx diaphragm. EUK- 134 protected against inflammation by decreasing NF-kB activation in the nucleosome fraction of mdx diaphragm. Further, EUK- 134 partially rescued nNOS and k- 1 syntrophin back to sarcolemmal membranes and recovered force generation even in acute application in vitro in mdx diaphragm. These results are the first to demonstrate a causal relationship between oxidative stress and pathology caused by dystrophin-deficient diaphragm muscle. Moreover, the data indicate that EUK- 134 has a protective effect against muscle damage, inflammation, and contractility in mdx diaphragm. We believe that the results from our investigation will provide clinical significance, as we expect to elucidate mechanisms by which oxidative stress contribute to tissue damage and weakness in dystrophic diaphragm...|$|R
