40|$|Recently, a novel Direct String <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Gradiometer</b> (DSMG) {{has been}} developed, where a {{vibrating}} wire, {{driven by an}} AC current, {{is used as a}} single sensitive element. It is designed to directly measure the local off-diagonal components of the magnetic gradient tensor, Bxz, Byz and Bxy, provided the distance to an object creating magnetic anomalies is much larger than the length of the string. This requirement is well satisfied in space, if the sensor is deployed from a satellite platform orbiting near the planet under surveillance. Current instruments operating at 1 kPa pressure achieve sensitivity of 1. 8 × 10 ^- 10 T/m in the band 0. 0001 Hz to 0. 1 Hz.

40|$|Magnetic {{susceptibility}} is {{an important}} indicator of anthropogenic disturbance in the natural soil. This property is often mapped with <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometers</b> in archaeological prospection studies. It is also detected with frequency domain electromagnetic induction (FDEM) sensors, which have the advantage that they can simultaneously measure the electrical conductivity. The detection level of FDEM sensors for magnetic structures is very dependent on the coil configuration. Apart from theoretical modelling studies, a thorough investigation with field models has not been conducted until now. Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was to test multiple coil configurations on a test field with naturally enhanced magnetic susceptibility in the topsoil and with different types of structures mimicking real archaeological features. Two FDEM sensors were used with coil separations between 0. 5 and 2 m and with three coil orientations. First, a vertical sounding was conducted over the undisturbed soil to test the validity of a theoretical layered model, which can be used to infer the depth sensitivity of the coil configurations. The modelled sounding values corresponded well with the measured data, which means that the theoretical models are applicable to layered soils. Second, magnetic structures were buried in the site and the resulting anomalies measured to a very high resolution. The results showed remarkable differences in amplitude and complexity between the responses of the coil configurations.

The introduction of new differential quantities adds a new dimension for the identification of magnetic sources.

40|$|Activation of {{the cardiac}} muscle is {{associated}} with ion transport through the membrane of the cardiac cell. This {{gives rise to the}} strongest electrophysiological signals in human body: the cardiograms. Segments of the cardiogram are related to the contraction of the hearts chambers. In fetal magnetocardiography, the magnetic field of a fetal heart is recorded {{in the vicinity of the}} maternal abdomen. This magnetic field, however, is extremely weak and can only be recorded by means of Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). To reach the superconducting state the SQUIDs are cooled to about - 270 oC. Typically, fetal magnetocardiograms are recorded inside magnetically shielded rooms in order to reduce the influence of the environmental magnetic interference. As an alternative to <b>magnetic</b> shielding, higher-order <b>gradiometers</b> can be used. Ideally, a higher-order gradiometer is insensitive to the lower-order gradients of the magnetic field that originate from relatively remote noise sources. In practice, however, it is difficult to manufacture a gradiometer such that its sensitivity to these lower-order gradients is eliminated completely. The residual sensitivity to the lower-order gradients is referred to as imbalance. Balancing a gradiometer reduces imbalance and, thus, improves the environmental interference suppression. The objective of the work presented in this thesis is to design a highly-balanced higherorder gradiometer that enables measurements of fetal magnetocardiograms in unshielded environment. This includes optimization of the geometry of the gradiometer with respect to signal-to-noise ratio, design of a magnetic coils set for gradiometer balancing and gradiometer balancing experiments...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{task in the}} field of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of aircraft components is the reliable detection of small cracks hidden very deep in the material. This will become even more important in the future, because the thickness of aircraft parts is going to increase further. Conventional eddy current testing systems reach their limit here, whereas SQUIDs (Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices) show an excellent sensitivity for the low excitation frequencies needed. As it is required to suppress large magnetic disturbances without <b>magnetic</b> shielding, a <b>gradiometer</b> SQUID is utilized for these measurements. By calculations, it is proved in this work that an optimum signal-to-noise ratio is reached when the baseline of the SQUID gradiometer is enlarged from the so far used 3. 6 mm to about 10 mm. However, an enhancement of the baseline leads to a significant increase of the SQUID inductance and hence of the white noise. Consequently, the SQUID sensor cannot be operated reliably in the flux locked loop any more. It is shown that the inductance may be reduced significantly by placing a superconducting cover strip on top of the gradiometer slit. Thus, the gradiometer slit cannot be penetrated by magnetic flux any more. Calculations of the goemetric and kinetic inductance confirm that a distinct reduction of the inductance can be reached this way. Furthermore, the calculations show {{that it is possible to}} raise the baseline to 9 mm without an increase of the inductance, compared to an uncovered gradiometer with 3. 6 mm baseline. (orig.)

Bu amaç için geliştirilmiş bir yöntem ve program kullanılmıştır. Yöntemde yatay tabakalı ortamda 3 boyutlu elasto-dinamik dalga yayılmı dikkate alınmıştır. Saçıcı ortama gömülerek modellenmektedir. Yöntemde Born yaklaşımı dikkate alınmakta ve saçılmış dalga alanı domen tipi {{integral}} yardımı ile ifade edilmektedir. Yöntemde saçılmış dalga alanı hesaplanırken sadece yoğunluk kontrastı dikkate alınmaktadır. Dalga yayılımı saçılma matrisi yöntemi ile modellenmektedir. Yatay tabakalı ortam varsayımı nedeniyle ortamın fiziksel özellikleri sadece düşey yönde değiştiğinden radyal simetriden yararlanılmakta ve integral ifadesinde yer alan Green tensörü elemanlarının hesaplama süresi etkin hale getirilmektedir. Yüzeye yakın saçıcıların belirlenmesi amacıyla Born yaklaşımının geçerli olduğu ve olmadığı iki koşulda farklı saçıcı boyutları ve derinlikleri dikkate alınarak kestirilen yoğunluk kontrast değerlerinin değişimi incelenmiştir. Derinliğin artmasi ile kestirilen yoğunluk kontrastı değerlerinin gerçek değerden uzaklaştığı ve hata oranının arttığı belirlenmiştir. Bunun nedeni ise yüzey dalgaları genliğinin derinlikle azalmasından kaynaklanmaktadır. Ancak her koşulda saçıcının konumu doğru bir şekilde belirlenebilmektedir. Sayısal olarak oluşturulan saçılmış dalga alanları, sinyal bandının tanımlı olduğu düşük, orta ve yüksek frekans bandlarında süzgeçlenerek ters çözümü yapılmıştır. Orta (baskın) frekans bandının yoğunluk kontrastı kestiriminde daha başarılı sonuç verdiği belirlenmiştir. Yapılan çalışmada dikkate alınan koşullar altında yüzey dalgaları yardımıyla saçıcının konumunun belirlenebildiğini gösterilmiştir. Gerçek yoğunluk kontrastı değeri ise koşula bağlı olarak belli hata oranları ile elde edilebilmiştir. Surface {{waves are}} widely used for determining properties of the subsurface on different scales. In most applications, the dispersion of surface waves is analysed to yield depth-dependent velocity profiles. However, the heterogeneity of the shallow subsurface complicates such as analysis because of the scattering it causes. The estimation of the shear-wave velocity from the surface waves become a popular tool and different techniques are applied for this purpose. In civil and environmental engineering the detection of cavities is of great interest and surface waves are convenient for this purpose (Leparoux et al, 2000). Imaging shallow layers by body waves requires high resolution data acquired in a dense spatial array. Surface waves do not require the same dense sampling, since their wavelengths are longer when compared to body waves. Therefore, surface waves are more economic for this purpose. Surface waves {{are widely used}} in global, exploration and near-surface geophysics. Scattering is a general physical process where some forms of radiation, such as light, sound, or moving particles, are forced to deviate from a straight trajectory {{by one or more}} localized non-uniformities in the medium through which they pass. In conventional use, this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection. Reflections that undergo scattering are often called diffuse reflections and unscattered reflections are called specular (mirror-like) reflections. The types of non-uniformities which can cause scattering, sometimes known as scatterers or scattering centers, are too numerous to list, but a small sample includes particles, bubbles, droplets, density fluctuations in fluids, crystallites in polycrystalline solids, defects in monocrystalline solids, surface roughness, cells in organisms, and textile fibers in clothing. The effects of such features on the path of almost any type of propagating wave or moving particle can be described in the framework of scattering theory. The complex structure of the near subsurface causes scattered surface waves. Scattered surface waves are sensitive to near-surface heterogeneities and they can be used for imaging cavities, buried objects or shallow water reservoirs. A general theory of elastodynamic wave scattering is given by Snieder (2002 a, b). The scattered waves often have high amplitudes and mask the reflections from deeper parts of the Earth. In some cases the information on the target reflectors is important, like in hydrocarbon exploration; therefore the elimination of the scattered surface waves becomes an important task. There are many circumstances that necessitate nondestructive detection and characterization of underground cavities. For example, it may be required to locate a utility conduit before an excavation or to examine the presence of subsiding sinkholes to prevent pavement collapse. A number of different physical and geophysical techniques are being tested and used for cavity detection, such as ground penetrating radar (GPR), gravity <b>gradiometer,</b> <b>magnetic</b> and electromagnetic induction, seismic methods, and imagery analysis. Each of these methods has shown limited success in certain circumstances, but none of them has been unconditionally successful. By using the scattered surface waves Snieder (1987), Herman et al (2000) detect near surface objects. By considering a scalar approximation, Campman et al (2005) estimate the lateral variations and relative contrast of the heterogeneities from scattered surface waves. Riyanti and Herman (2005) consider 3 D elastodynamic problem and include the effect of multiple scattering for near-surface imaging. In this thesis, the propagation and scattering of elastic waves in an isotropic, laterally homogenous embedding is considered in which bounded objects with contrasting density are present. By using the linearity principle, the wavefield is expressed as the sum of an incident wavefield accounting for propagation in the embedding, and the scattered wavefield, accounting for the presence of the scatterer:. Considering a vertical point force, the incident wave field can be expressed as, where is the source waveform and is the Green’s tensor. The Green’s tensor elements are calculated in an efficient way by considering radial symmetryy of the medium. In this thesis, an inverse scattering method is used to determine the size, the location and properties of the heterogeneity. In the physics field of scattering theory, the inverse scattering problem is that of determining characteristics of an object (its shape, internal constitution, etc.) based on data of how it scatters incoming radiation or particles. In this study, it is aimed to observe the change of density contrast values for the different size of scatterers at the several depths with weak and strong density contrast. The purpose of this thesis is to estimate the size, the location and the density contrast of the heterogeneity by using scattered surface waves. In this study an efficient method developed by Kaslilar and Herman (2006) and Kaslilar (2007) is used for imaging the near surface heterogeneities in a half-space at different depths and sizes. For this reason, several models are considered: Imaging scatterers for several depths (&# 12310; 0. 00 &# 61548;&# 12311;_d, &# 12310; 0. 25 &# 61548;&# 12311;_d, &# 12310; 0. 50 &# 61548;&# 12311;_d, &# 12310; 1. 00 &# 61548;&# 12311;_d), different sizes of scatterers (&# 12310; 0. 25 &# 61548;&# 12311;_d, &# 12310; 0. 50 &# 61548;&# 12311;_d, &# 12310; 1. 00 &# 61548;&# 12311;_d), different density contrasts (density contrast that satisfies the Born Approximation and not) and different frequency bands (low, middle and high bands). First of all, forward problem has been solved. For this aim, different models are considered and by using these models’ parameters, scattered wavefield is calculated. By using the calculated scattered wavefields, inverse problem has been solved. In here, inverse problem can be defined as estimating the size, the location and the density contrast value of scatterers. In all of models, the location {{and the size of the}} scatterers were observed; also the density contrast values were calculated. For the models with the scatterers on surface, density contrast values were measured with a high accuracy. On the other hand, when the scatterers located at any depths, the density contrast values are estimated with a low accuracy. But, it is possible to observe that in all conditions the locations of scatterers are well-estimated. It is possible to say that, the scatterer with the size of &# 12310; 0. 50 &# 61548;&# 12311;_d gives the best result and the calculated density contrast value is the closer the real denstiy contrast value. Another research in this project is to determine the results for specific frequency bands. In aiming of categorizing these bands, there have been applied Butterworth filter to full-band scattered wavefield which came with the result of three frequency bands: low, mid and high. At the end, the best results on the inversed scattered wavefield have been observed at mid (dominant) frequency band. It is seen that, in all cases considered, the density contrast value is estimated with less accuracy as the depth of the scatterer increases. However in all cases the location of the scatterer is reasonably well estimated. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

40|$|Characterization of {{material}} changes with depth (profiles) in many landfill sites can be problematic for some conventional geophysical methods. Localized anomalies within the landfill can complicate mapping of underlying layers, and layered-model techniques are inappropriate for imaging laterally discontinuous landfills. Recently-developed geophysical {{hardware and software}} tools provide the opportunity to image the vertical structure of a landfill and its geologic setting. In May, 2000 a sequence of geophysical data sets were acquired at a landfill site at Camp Roberts, CA to test the benefits of new hardware and software for characterizing the three-dimensional boundaries of the landfill and the geologic setting. Conventional magnetic and electromagnetic measurements provided a backdrop for these new methods. A Geometrics G- 858 <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer</b> equipped with a real-time GPS positioning system was used to map the areal extent of the landfill. Resistivity, seismic refraction, and electromagnetic data were acquired along profile lines to characterize the vertical extent of the landfill and geology. Seismic refraction data were processed with conventional time-delay methods, and with newer tomographic methods. Th...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a system {{developed}} for detection andaccurate mapping of ferro-metallic objects buried below the seabed in shallow waters. Thesystem comprises a precise <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer</b> and navigation subsystem, both installedon a non-magnetic catamaran towed by a low-magnetic interfering boat. In addition wepresent the results of a marine survey of a near-shore area in the vicinity of Atlit, a townsituated on the Mediterranean coast of Israel, about 15 km south of Haifa. The primarypurpose of the survey was to search for a Harvard airplane that crashed into the sea in 1960. A magnetic map of the survey area (3. 5 km 2 on a 0. 5 m grid) was created revealing theanomalies at sub-meter accuracy. For each investigated target location a correspondingferro-metallic item was dug out, one of which turned to be very similar to a part of thecrashed airplane. The accuracy of location was confirmed by matching the position of theactual dug artifacts with the magnetic map within a range of Ã‚Â± 1 m, in a water depth of 9 m...|$|E
40|$|Our {{long-term}} {{goal is to}} provide a robust suite of algorithms capable of performing real-time localization of both isolated and grouped ferromagnetic targets. It is intended that these algorithms be applicable to any tensor <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer</b> system used for surface or subsurface platforms. These algorithms will be most robust when used in conjunction with conventional navigational systems, but will be provided with a self- navigating capability that exploits the magnetic fields and gradients of the sources being localized. OBJECTIVES Perform a thorough analysis of the motion compensation process used to allow tensor fluxgate gradiometers to be moved about {{in the presence of the}} earth’s magnetic field. Incorporate the results into interactive real time gradient motion compensation software running on a PC platform. Upgrade tensor fluxgate gradiometer localization software to make it more interactive and self-contained. Generalize it to incorporate GPS positional information, when available, and to allow real time data input from either GPIB/VXI interfaces or Serial interfaces. Develop software to use angular rate sensor data to correct for rotational changes in the gradient tensor measured by a moving gradiometer in the presence of magnetic targets...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} fields produced by naturally occurring steady currents {{in the body}} were measured by using a new <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer</b> in a magnetically shielded room. A field of 0. 1 micro G/cm with reproducible pattern was seen over the head and over the limbs, whereas the field over the torso proper was weaker (except over the abdomen). Most of the field over the head is produced by electrical sources associated with the hair follicles of the scalp; this field is produced only {{as a response to}} touching or pressing the scalp, in regions where the hair is dense. Most of the field over the limbs is produced by electrical sources associated with the muscles. The field over the forearm, studied in detail, was often present spontaneously; when absent, it could be induced by mild twisting and rubbing. On the basis of auxiliary experiments involving electrolytes, a general mechanism for generation of steady current in the body is suggested. In this mechanism, the steady current is generated by a nonclosed or a nonuniform polarized layer across an elongated semipermeable membrane such as a muscle fiber; the nonuniform polarization is due to a gradient of extracellular K+ along the membrane...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The stratospheric balloon <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer</b> {{system is}} {{developed}} and maintained at IZMIRAN already about 20 years. This system {{consists of three}} instrumental containers uniformly placed along a vertical 6 km line. System allows measuring parameters of the geomagnetic field along the whole flight trajectory. The GPS-receivers, located in each instrumental container, fix the flight coordinates. The developed launching technology, deployment in flight, assembly, data, transfer and processing, landing the containers with the equipment {{can be used for}} other similar problems of monitoring and sounding an environment. Useful flight weights of each instrumental container may be reaching 50 kg. received from Ukraine and Kazakhstan). With the appearance of GPS receivers, it has become possible to locate the balloon during its flight at an accuracy of a few meters. Various azimuths of the balloon motion, due to variations {{in the direction of the}} carrier air flow, allow the balloon to perform a detailed magnetic survey of large regions. The instability of the balloon flight altitude does not prevent a high-quality magnetic survey, because, if the data on the vertical gradient of the magnetic field are available, the field can be recalculated to any specified level within the altitude range 20 - 40 km...|$|E
40|$|The remote {{detection}} of buried structures and tunnels {{is important to}} the mining, construction, and defense industries. It is often desirable to identify underground power lines, pipe lines, and utility tunnels which have unique electromagnetic cross sections. A computational model for the electromagnetic {{detection of}} buried conducting cylinders is described in this paper. The source of electromagnetic radiation is either current injection into the soil or a surface based magnetic dipole with possible extensions to airborne platforms. Frequency ranges from a few kHz to 100 kHz are considered. The target conductor is a cylinder buried directly in the soil or placed inside an insulating pipe. The receiver is a <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer</b> held 1 m above the ground, separate from the transmitter. Data are taken widely over the terrain under investigation. Cases where the target conductor is grounded at both ends, one end, or not at all are modeled. The scattered field and field gradient are computed at or above ground level and compared in magnitude and phase with the transmitted signal. Calculated results are compared with experimental tests done to detect a buried wire at Sandia National Laboratory and a tunnel at Yucca Mountain. Essential factors affecting detection performance are frequency optimization, dynamic range of reception and proper data processing...|$|E
40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) {{has been}} {{highlighting}} {{the need for}} modern, multi-sensor airborne geophysical data in the UK. Here David Beamish, geophysicist with the BGS, describes the first trial airborne electromagnetic data acquired and its relevance to environmental geoscience. The lack of modern, multi-sensor (magnetic, radiometric and electromagnetic) data {{represents one of the}} most serious gaps in the geoscience knowledge base of the UK, and a national, high resolution airborne survey has been a stated corporate objective for many years. In 1999, the fixed-wing, frequency domain, airborne EM (AEM) system developed and operated by the Geological Survey of Finland was used in a series of trials to acquire detailed EM data sets in addition to <b>magnetic</b> <b>gradiometer</b> (wing-tip) and radiometric information. The purpose of the trials was, in part, to assess the case for the inclusion of AEM in future strategic airborne geophysical surveying. The limited data acquired (3324 line km in 5 days’ flying) constitute the first high resolution AEM survey information to address specific environmental issues in the UK. It was anticipated that the AEM data would provide pathfinder information for the general assessment of land quality issues such as planning and pollution control and water supply/resource protection. ...|$|E
