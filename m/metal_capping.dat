It was built in 1958 on the southern banks of Great Sacandaga Lake {{in the foothills of}} the Adirondack Mountains. It is a 1 1/2-story Modern Movement style dwelling measuring 23 feet wide and 20 feet deep. The facade consists of a glass curtain wall set on a concrete foundation and topped by a flat roof with <b>metal</b> <b>capping.</b> It has brick end walls. It was designed by George Lawrence Moore for screenwriter David Rayfiel (1923- 2011) and husband of actress Maureen Stapleton (1925-2006), and is often compared to Philip Johnson's iconic Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut.|$|E

40|$|Dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the microcutting process because target material piled up on the tool–chip– workpiece interface can alter the cutting geometry. The target of this study is to model and simulate the microorthogonal cutting process in the presence of dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> in order to investigate the effects of this phenomenon on the micromachining process outputs (cutting force, thrust force and chip thickness) and stress distribution, equivalent plastic strain and temperature inside the workpiece shear zones. For this purpose, the finite element method with explicit dynamic solution and adiabatic heating effect along with arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian approach is used. It is shown that the finite element models with current state-of-the-art assumptions cannot take into account the dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> by default. For this reason, dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> is artificially introduced on the rounded tool edge in this study for carrying out a proper analysis. Several simulations with different dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> geometries are performed and obtained results show that prediction of cutting force, thrust force and chip thickness are sensitive to the presence of dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> and its geometry. Micro-orthogonal cutting experiments are carried out on tubular AISI 1045 workpieces for validating and interpreting simulated results. The error between predicted and experimental data is calculated, and it is shown that simulation performances can be improved by considering the dead <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> into the process model. For example, it is possible to reduce the error to less than 5...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} simple design method of a ceramic pressure-tight housing having an {{extended}} length of cylinder and <b>metal</b> <b>caps.</b> Ceramics have higher compressive strength and lower specific gravity than typical metals.

40|$|Abstract. The energy-generating {{capability}} of a cymbal transducer was studied {{in order to}} supply the power of low-consumption electric products. An analytical model of the cymbal transducer was established by the hydrostatic piezoelectric constant method. The relation between the material of <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> {{as well as the}} structure of transducer and energy generation were analyzed by numerical simulation. The simulation validation was done by the element software ANSYS. The results of the study show that, in the same force, the materials of <b>metal</b> <b>cap,</b> the radius of cavity bottom, and the thickness of <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> have bigger influence on the voltage outputted, the radius of cavity top have less influence on the voltage outputted. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the growth of Ag on bilayer high Co nanoislands on Cu(111) using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. Noble <b>metal</b> <b>capping</b> of {{magnetic}} nanostructures is known to influence the magnetism {{and knowledge of the}} growth is therefore important. We find that Ag preferentially nucleates on the Co nanoislands initially leaving the free Cu sites clean. Furthermore we observe, that those Co islands which are capped with Ag are almost completely capped thus making a perfect multilayered system of Ag/Co/Cu(111). We observe a (9 × 9) reconstruction of the Ag overlayer on Co/Cu(111). Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examined}} the effects of postdeposition annealing on the electrical properties of titanium-capped (TC) indium-zinc oxide (IZO) films and their IZO thin-film transistors. The TC IZO transistor oxidized at the temperature of 300 degrees C exhibited a high field-effect mobility of 61. 0 cm(2) /Vs, low subthreshold gate swing of 110 mV/decade, Vth of - 0. 4 V, and high I-ON/OFF ratio of 2. 3 x 10 (8). In addition, the positive gate bias stress-induced stability of the TC IZO transistor was better than that of the control device without <b>metal</b> <b>capping</b> treatment. This was attributed to the scavenging effect of the loosely bonded oxygen species in the IZO semiconductor by titanium thermal oxidation...|$|E

Reduction of the hexaosmium cluster [Os 6 (CO) 18] with K–Ph 2 CO gave the cluster dianion [Os 6 (CO) 17] 2 – 3 in quantitative yield. When this dianion was treated with [Os(η 6 -C 6 H 6) (MeCN) 3] 2 + the heptanuclear cluster [Os 7 (CO) 17 (η 6 -C 6 H 6) ] 4 was obtained in fair yield, while the corresponding reaction with [Os(η 6 -C 6 H 5 Me) (CF 3 SO 3) 2] gave [Os 7 (CO) 17 (η 6 -C 6 H 5 Me) ] 5 in similar yield (ca. 25 %). The four arene clusters have been characterised by spectroscopic techniques, and the molecular geometries of 1, 2 and 4 established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. In both 1 and 2 the metal framework geometry is best described as a bicapped tetrahedron. In 1 the η 6 -C 6 H 6 ligand occupies a site on the central Os 4 tetrahedron while in 2 in the η 6 -arene is co-ordinated {{to one of the}} capping Os atoms. The metal framework in 4 may be viewed as derived from a bicapped tetrahedron with the seventh <b>metal</b> <b>capping</b> one of the caps to give a chain of four fused tetrahedra. The η 6 -C 6 H 6 ligand in 4 occupies a similar site to that found in 1...|$|E

40|$|Part of {{energies}} in {{asphalt pavement}} caused by vehicle {{can be converted}} into electric energy by piezoelectric transducer. A bridge-shaped transducer is selected to harvest energy because of its reasonable efficiency and moderate stiffness close to asphalt pavement. This paper is to compare the performance of Bridge transducers with trapezoidal, arc and arch structure through finite element analysis (FEA) and laboratory test. Results show that the arch Bridge has higher energy conversion efficiency and the trapezoidal Bridge has stronger ability to resist pressure. For arc and trapezoidal Bridge, the maximum tensile stress and shear stress are both in the inner corner of contact area between cap and PZT (lead zirconate titanate) disk. They were broken because of the cracking of PZT at the stress concentrations area. For arch Bridge, the maximum tensile stress increases with thickness of <b>metal</b> <b>cap</b> but decrease with modulus, and maximum shear stress decreases first and increases later with increasing thickness and modulus of <b>metal</b> <b>cap.</b> In laboratory test, its cracking area is shifted from edge to inner corner of contact area between cap and PZT disk with increasing thickness of <b>metal</b> <b>cap.</b> The electric potential generated by arch Bridge decreased with increasing thickness and modulus of <b>metal</b> <b>cap.</b> Under the load of 0. 7 MPa, the electric potential is about 286 V for an arch Bridge transducer with 0. 4 mm thickness of stainless steel cap, and its storage electric energy is 0. 6 mJ. The designed arch Bridge transducer is suggested as the optimum one for harvesting energy from asphalt pavement...|$|R

40|$|A report {{describes}} an improved high-voltage isolator for preventing electrical discharge along the flow {{path of a}} propellant gas being fed from a supply at a spacecraft chassis electrical potential to an ion thruster at a potential as high as multiple kilovolts.

The isolator includes an alumina cylinder containing a spiral channel filled with a porous medium made from alumina microbeads fired together with an alumina slurry. Connections to gas-transport tubes are made {{at both ends of the}} alumina cylinder by means of <b>metal</b> <b>caps</b> containing fine-mesh screens to prevent passage of loose alumina particles.
