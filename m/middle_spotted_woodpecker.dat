5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, <b>middle</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{success in}} birds is {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} factors, many of which can be attributed to human activities such as land use or forest management. Others like weather or age of the birds are not under human control but are influential as well. From 1992 - 96, I examined breeding phenology and performance of <b>Middle</b> <b>Spotted</b> <b>Woodpeckers</b> Dendrocopos medius in northeastern Switzerland in relation to weather, territory quality and age of the birds. Timing of breeding, length of the nestling period as well as nesting and breeding success significantly differed between years. On average, incubation started earlier in years with higher daily temperatures in March-April. Neither territory quality nor the participation of 1 -year old individuals in pairs influenced breeding success, whereas low temperatures and high amounts of rainfall during the nestling phase negatively affected breeding performance, which probably reflects the difficulties encountered by the woodpeckers in provisioning their young with sufficient food during periods of bad weather. These findings suggest that weather events can strongly influence reproduction even of primary cavity-nesting species, exceeding presumed differences in habitat quality at a local scale...|$|R
5000|$|The Sauberge, which {{reach their}} highest point at Hammerstein's Höhe (...) {{and are the}} source of several {{tributary}} streams for the River Lamme, are crisscrossed by numerous trails and forest tracks; but there are no roads across the unpopulated ridge. Part of the B 243 federal road cuts through the middle of the hills, running between the villages of Wesseln and Nette. There is an eighteen-hole golf course on the northern slope of Hammerstein's Höhe. Access to the hills is restricted by a hunting preserve, where a herd of fallow deer is kept. The wild boar population is relatively large. Amongst the most important species of bird are the <b>middle</b> and lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> the European green woodpecker and the grey-headed woodpecker. A high density of breeding red kites live {{around the edges of the}} forest, especially in the east and south.Buzzard, goshawk, sparrowhawk and hobby also breed here. Amongst the more numerous songbirds are firecrest, crested tit, wood warbler, tree pipit and common crossbill.|$|R

5|$|The great <b>spotted</b> <b>{{woodpecker}}</b> {{is similar}} to some other species in its genus. The Syrian woodpecker lacks its relative's black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts, although juvenile great <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> often have an incomplete cheek bar, so can potentially be misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged woodpecker has a far more extensive white wing patch than the great <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The Sind woodpecker {{is very similar to}} the Syrian species, and can be distinguished from great <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> in the same way.|$|R

5|$|Great <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> {{have only}} one brood a year. The {{survival}} rates for adults and young are unknown, as is the average lifespan, but the maximum known age for a great <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is just over 11 years.|$|R
5|$|The {{woodpeckers}} are {{an ancient}} bird family consisting of three subfamilies, the wrynecks, the piculets {{and the true}} woodpeckers, Picinae. The largest of the six tribes within the Picinae is the pied woodpeckers, a group which includes the great <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> Within the large genus Dendrocopus the great <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker's</b> closest relatives are the Himalayan, Sind, Syrian and white-winged woodpeckers and possibly the Darjeeling <b>woodpecker.</b> The great <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> has been recorded as hybridising with the Syrian woodpecker.|$|R
50|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> lives {{predominantly}} {{on a diet}} {{of insects}} {{as well as their}} larvae, which it finds by picking them from branches and twigs rather than hacking them from beneath the bark. It will also feed on tree sap. It is rarely heard drumming, and never for territorial purposes, which it asserts by song; a slow,nasal gvayk gvayk gvayk gvayk gvayk. Calls include a fast kik kekekekek.|$|E
50|$|The Fläming {{is rich in}} {{wildlife}} (fallow deer, red deer, {{raccoon dog}} and the mouflon).

50|$|Birds are {{the most}} {{numerous}} group of vertebrates, with 230 species recorded to date. The world of birds is represented by 102 species of nesting birds found in the broader park area. The nesting bird group includes a community of birds inhabiting rocks and cliffs in the canyons of Velika Paklenica and Mala Paklenica, with 24 bird species. A special value {{is added to the}} park by the endangered and rare bird species such as the golden eagle, peregrine falcon, short-toed eagle and goshawk.

50|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> occurs only in Europe and {{southwest}} Asia, from northern Spain and France east to Poland and Ukraine, and south to central Italy (where local), the Balkan Peninsula, Lithuania, Latvia, Turkey, the Caucasus, and Iran. This species used to breed in Sweden but became extirpated in the 80's. However, middle spotted woodpeckers {{have been seen}} in Sweden in appropriate breeding habitats after the extirpation. Due to its sedentary nature {{it has never been}} recorded in Great Britain. It prefers deciduous forest regions, especially areas with old oak, hornbeam and elm, and a patchwork of clearings, pasture and dense woodland.|$|E
50|$|The <b>middle</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is 20-22 cm {{long and}} has plumage {{similar to the}} great spotted woodpecker. As with that species the upperparts are {{predominantly}} black with white oval wing patches and white barring on the wings, and the underparts are white. The main differences are a red crown, lack of a black moustachial stripe, a pink vent, and dark streaks on the flanks.Although only slightly smaller than the great spotted woodpecker, it appears smaller due to its short, slender bill and more rounded, pale head. It can also {{be confused with the}} Syrian woodpecker (particularly juveniles), being distinguished from this by the smaller bill, and the red crown not having narrow black sides.|$|E
