40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic {{reputation}} model of news reporting by a profit-maximizing <b>media</b> <b>outlet</b> whose credibility is uncertain to the public. In each period, the <b>media</b> <b>outlet</b> chooses its source of news: a costly independent inves-tigation or, possibly, a free report prepared by an interest group. The revenue of the <b>media</b> <b>outlet</b> {{consists of the}} subscription fees for {{the public and the}} access fees for interest groups. We characterize the equilibrium structure of informa-tion transmission with and without disclosure of the source of the news to the public. In particular, we demonstrate that uncertainty about the source of the news may increase the probability of independent investigation by the <b>media</b> <b>outlet.</b> Nevertheless, the probability of correct decisions by the public and the profit of the <b>media</b> <b>outlet</b> decreases when the <b>media</b> <b>outlet</b> can be paid for reporting the news by the interest group without disclosing this to the public...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a model of}} indirect lobbying where special interest groups try to influence policy outcomes by targeting voters. Specifically, competing lobbies engage in influence activities to affect the information that a (possibly biased) <b>media</b> <b>outlet</b> collects on the public value of approving/rejecting a policy proposal. The <b>media</b> <b>outlet</b> acts as a filter between lobbies and voters. It has {{to decide what to}} communicate to voters based on the information it collects and its own idiosyncratic bias. The results show that the higher the idiosyncratic bias of the <b>media</b> <b>outlet,</b> the lower the lobbies’ incentives to spend resources on influence activities. Conversely, the lower the cost of engaging in influence activities for lobbies, the higher the probability of news-slanting by the <b>media</b> <b>outlet.</b> Moreover, the more voters care about receiving accurate information, the higher the expected distortion in the policy outcome. From a public policy perspective, increasing the cost of lobbies’ influence activities would decrease the distortion in the policy outcome and increase voters’ welfare. Finally, asymmetries between lobbies lead to different probabilities of news-slanting by different <b>media</b> <b>outlet</b> types...|$|R
