5|$|A {{key element}} of quantum {{mechanics}} is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and <b>momentum</b> of a particle along the same direction. Remarkably, the uncertainty principle for charged, material particles requires the quantization of light into photons, and even the frequency dependence of the photon's energy and <b>momentum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the Sun {{dominates the}} system by mass, it {{accounts}} for only about 2% of the angular <b>momentum.</b> The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account {{for most of the}} rest of the angular <b>momentum</b> due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.|$|E

5|$|Einstein {{argued that}} {{this is true for}} {{fundamental}} reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy <b>momentum</b> pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy <b>momentum</b> distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{includes a}} dynamical spacetime, {{so it is}} difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and <b>momentum.</b> Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and <b>momentum</b> derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.|$|E
5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism {{to conclude that}} the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or <b>momentum</b> measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or <b>momentum.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to give {{explicitly}} all non-linear vacuum {{solutions to}} our non-linear field equations, and to define in a coordinate free manner the important subclass of non-linear solutions, {{which we call}} almost photon-like. By means of a correct introduction of the local and integral intrinsic angular <b>momentums</b> of these solutions, we saparate the photon-like solutions through the requirement their integral intrinsic angular <b>momentums</b> to be equal to the Planck's constant. Finally, we consider such solutions, moving radially to or from a given center, using standard spherical coordinates. Comment: 14 pages, LaTex, no figure...|$|R

5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to <b>momentum.</b> Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and <b>momentum</b> are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, <b>momentum</b> must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are directly related to energy and <b>momentum,</b> namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, <b>momentum,</b> pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stars are}} {{observed}} {{to be members}} of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular <b>momentum</b> in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular <b>momentum.</b> The primordial binaries transfer some angular <b>momentum</b> by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated (soft) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations distributions.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} formulae for {{the energy}} and <b>momentum</b> of electromagnetic radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events.

5|$|The {{physics of}} {{accretion}} disks encounters some problems. The {{most important one}} is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its angular <b>momentum.</b> One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that angular <b>momentum</b> was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The <b>momentum</b> is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular <b>momentum</b> is magnetic braking, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for {{the disappearance of the}} gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.|$|E

5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions.

This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular <b>momentum</b> associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the initial {{conditions}} in the quasi-Heisenberg quantization scheme can be set at the initial cosmological singularity per se. This possibility is provided by finiteness of some quantities, namely <b>momentums</b> of the dynamical variables, at a singularity, in spite of infinity of the dynamical variables themselves. The uncertainty principle allows avoiding a necessity to set values of the dynamical variables at singularity, as a wave packet can be expressed through the finite <b>momentums.</b> Influence of the initial condition set in the singularity {{in such a way}} to a number of gravitons under a vacuum state, arising during later evolution, is investigated. It is shown that, even choosing of some special state at the singularity minimizing late time expansion rate, some amount of gravitons still appear in the late time evolution. Comment: 9 page...|$|R

5|$|For illustration, if a {{physical}} system behaves the same, {{regardless of how}} it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the angular <b>momentum</b> of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular <b>momentum</b> despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the physical laws governing the system {{is responsible for the}} conservation law. As another example, if {{a physical}} experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear <b>momentum</b> and energy within this system, respectively.|$|E
