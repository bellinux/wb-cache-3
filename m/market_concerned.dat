50|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, Rockwell-Lucent and USRobotics {{introduced}} competing technologies {{based upon the}} digital transmission used in telephony networks. The standard digital transmission in modern networks is 64 kbit/s but some networks use {{a part of the}} bandwidth for remote office signaling (e.g. to hang up the phone), limiting the effective rate to 56 kbit/s DS0. This new technology was adopted into ITU standards V.90 and is common in modern computers. The 56 kbit/s rate is only possible from the central office to the user site (downlink). In the United States, government regulation limits the maximum power output, resulting in a maximum data rate of 53.3 kbit/s. The uplink (from the user to the central office) still uses V.34 technology at 33.6 kbit/s. USRobotics began work on the technology first, calling theirs X2 because 56k was twice the speed of 28k modems. USRobotics held a 40-percent share of the retail modem market, and Rockwell International held an 80-percent share of the modem chipset <b>market.</b> <b>Concerned</b> with being shut out of the market, Rockwell began work on a rival 56k technology and joined with Lucent and Motorola on what it called K56Flex or Flex. Both technologies reached the market around February 1997; although problems with K56Flex modems were noted in product reviews through July, within six months they worked equally well with variations dependent on local connection characteristics. The retail price of the 56K modems was about US$200, compared to $100 for 33K modems. Separate equipment was required by Internet service providers (ISPs) to support the incompatible technologies, with costs varying depending on whether their current equipment could be upgraded. About half of all ISPs offered 56K support by October 1997. Consumer sales were relatively low, which USRobotics and Rockwell attributed to conflicting standards.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to investigate, in one {{emerging}} Arab economy (Libya), the strategic and tactical choices of MNE (multinational enterprise) domestic appliance brands and, also, the attitudes of local consumers towards those choices. Various choice characteristics are investigated - including marketing mix standardization/adaptation - and, also, country-of-origin brand (COB). To establish extant organizational choices, local representatives of four established brands were interviewed and survey responses from 609 consumer were analyzed. No statistically discernible relationship between standardization/adaptation choices and consumer attitude towards marketing programs was found, but the study identified one especially successful brand that appeared to owe its achievements to an especially holistic approach to marketing that demonstrated 'fit' with the <b>market</b> <b>concerned.</b> Coincidentally, findings also address the conventional country-of-origin wisdom, and this is investigated/speculated upon accordingly. This is one of few marketing studies concerning Libya, and it adds to the limited literature on an increasingly relevant region...|$|E

40|$|The {{struggle}} between efficiency and equity {{is a topic}} of many discussions in a broad field, from economics to healthcare. It is also a key issue {{in the distribution of}} environmental quality. In decisions on the allocation of resources, costs, burdens and amenities, ‘efficiency’ and ‘effectiveness ’ are most often used as the most important criteria (Marsh & Schilling, 1994). Efficiency is not only an important issue for the players in the <b>market</b> <b>concerned</b> with private goods, it is also important in policymaking, when dealing with e. g. environmental issues. In defining policy goals and developing measures to reach those goals, or in siting decisions concerning hazardous waste facilities, polluting industries, or highways, this is not any different (Nijkamp, 1985; Davy, 1997). However, efficiency criteria are insufficient for generating acceptable, implementable decisions. Then criteria as ‘fairness ’ and the ‘equitability ’ of impacts on those affected by the decision become important issues as wel...|$|E
40|$|Are {{commercial}} real estate prices in metropolitan New York affected by the type or nationality of the investors involved in a transaction? Previous research has highlighted differences in pricing between in-state and out-of-state investors and between different types of investors, but there are few extant studies that consider the influence of nationality on pricing at a micro-level. Foreign investors might pay more than domestic investors for {{commercial real}} estate assets {{because of a lack}} of information or experience in the <b>market</b> <b>concerned.</b> However, they might use local partners or brokers to mitigate such problems. To explore these issues, we use data provided by Real Capital Analytics on over 3, 000 office transactions in the New York metro area from 2001 - 2015. We use hedonic regression techniques and propensity score matching to examine whether pricing differs across investor groups after controlling for asset attributes. We find that foreign investors pay more than domestic investors at acquisition, but receive more when selling assets. Tests suggest that it is unmeasured aspects of quality that explain any apparent overpayment for offices in this location, not information issues...|$|E
40|$|Article 15 (1) of the Community Trade Mark Regulation {{states that}} the Community Trade Mark holder has to put the mark into genuine use in the Community within five years from registration. Even though the {{regulation}} does not deal with the extent of use necessary, the Joint Statements uphold that genuine use within one country is enough. However, recent case law from national offices have ruled in the opposite direction, resulting in legal uncertainty concerning how much use that is needed. The courts claimed that use within merely one Member State is not use in {{a substantial part of}} the Community and therefore not genuine. This paper shows that it is not satisfactory to define genuine use in the Community by way of analogy to the term substantial part of the territory. The latter derives from the test of reputation concerning a different case entirely. Instead, most indicators point towards a market-oriented approach where national frontiers do not matter. Focus should be on the extent of use being made compared to the <b>market</b> <b>concerned</b> in the entire EU. A case-by-case assessment is required, where all relevant circumstances are taken into consideration...|$|E

40|$|The {{setting up}} of the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS) and of the European Banking Union (EBU) had a {{tremendous}} impact on EU financial governance. The division of supervisory competences between national competent authorities (NCAs) and European ones – both of the ESFS and the EBU – vary not only according to the currency adopted (Euro or non Euro), or the financial <b>market</b> <b>concerned</b> (banking, securities or insurance), but also because of the existence of emergency situations, the size of a financial institution (significant or non significant banking institution), and the specific matter concerned (money laundering and consumer protection fall out of the scope of the EBU; the ESMA has been given direct supervisory powers in areas such as Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) and derivatives). These different supervisory models vary in the degree of integration, {{as well as in the}} type of independence and the accountability of the regulators. This variety of supervisory models is generally the result of political compromises. It shows that in the aftermath of the crisis differentiation is increasing in the EU, but, at least in the financial area, at the expenses of regulatory efficiency...|$|E

Micklitz, European Univesity InstituteThis thesis {{intends to}} provide some {{insights}} into the substantive, organizational and procedural segments {{of the process of}} Europeanization of public services that is being brought into national legal systems and practices of public authorities, regarding their decisions on the definition of which public services they wish to render available to their citizens and on the means they wish to use to provide these services. The thesis is tied together throughout its various strands by a main idea that comprises a twofold assumption. Firstly, the discharge of the social democratic mandate, by political public authorities, when they define the general interest requirements to be pursued in the provision of certain public services, is and can not be per se under Community scrutiny. Secondly, however, it is only the 'exercise' of that social democratic mandate that may be under Community scrutiny, to the extent that such authorities choose a non-market solution as a way to cope with the social needs of their citizens’ community, i. e., in case they regard it as 'necessary' to restrict or exclude economic freedoms and/or competition in the <b>market</b> <b>concerned,</b> in order to enable the [socially desired and politically defined] general interest requirements to be secured, through the provision of public services, and by doing so public authorities can fully comply with their social democratic mandate. The main focus then lies on the political choices as to the level of social welfare, quality and other general interest service specifications that market fails to provide in a satisfactory manner, and will then justify the need to choose a non-market solution to enable such services to be rendered available to social communities, although with restrictions to competition or to economic freedoms. Moreover, in case the non-market solution also entails the need to arrange funding mechanisms that depart from normal market-functioning, a 'transparency frame', in particular, set out by Altmark conditions and the recent legal regime build up on it, must be respected...|$|E
