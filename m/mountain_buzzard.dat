50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzard</b> and {{the forest}} buzzard are said to form a {{superspecies}} with the common buzzard and the Madagascar buzzard Buteo brachypterus, and may be also with the red-tailed hawk Buteo jamaicensis of North and South America and the rufous-tailed hawk Buteo ventralis of southern South America. The <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzard</b> has been classified as a subspecies of common buzzard, then split as a single species with the forest buzzard but nor these two are regarded as separate species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzard</b> {{occurs in}} the mountainous regions of eastern Africa from Ethiopia, west through Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Rwanda to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo then south into Tanzania, Burundi and Malawi.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{important}} birds found here include the great blue turaco, <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo oreophilus), white-spotted flufftail (Sarothrura pulchra), grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus), bar-tailed trogon (Apaloderma vittatum) and the black-and-white-casqued hornbill (Bycanistes subcylindricus).|$|E

In East Africa nests with eggs have been reported from in January and March, while a nests with chicks {{have been reported in}} March, June and July. In Malawi there are no confirmed breeding records, but displaying pairs are most active in September and a juvenile has been seen in October.|$|R
25|$|Shipton's Camp is {{administered}} by Bantu Utamaduni Lodge. It is home to many rock hyrax, as well as striped mice, many types of sunbirds and Alpine Chats. <b>Mountain</b> <b>Buzzards</b> fly overhead. The vegetation is dominated by giant groundsel, {{but there are many}} flowers and lobelia as well. On the skyline is a view of Points Peter and Dutton, with Batian overshadowing them. Also in view are Thompson's Flake and Point Thompson, with Point Lenana {{on the other side of}} the Gregory Glacier. In front of the main peaks is the Krapf Rognon, with the Krapf Glacier behind.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo oreophilus) is a {{bird of prey}} {{that lives}} in montane forests in East Africa, it and the forest buzzard (Buteo trizonatus) of {{southern}} Africa were, until recently, {{considered to be a}} single species.|$|E
50|$|The forest buzzard forms {{part of a}} {{superspecies}} {{which includes}} the common buzzard and the Madagascar buzzard, {{as well as the}} <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzard.</b> The decision to treat forest buzzard and <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzard</b> as different species is based on differences in habitat, structure and plumages {{and the fact that the}} two taxa are not monophyletic. It is likely that the forest buzzard evolved from the steppe buzzard, which is a common wintering bird within the breeding range of the forest buzzard. The steppe buzzards is a generalist and breeds over a large area of the eastern Palearctic in a variety of habitats and winters widely in eastern and southern Africa, with a few non-breeding birds remaining in southern Africa over the northern summer.|$|E
50|$|The forest buzzard (Buteo trizonatus), is {{a species}} of bird of prey found in Africa, though some {{authorities}} have placed it as a subspecies of another species, the <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzard,</b> Buto oreophilus. This is a resident breeding species in woodlands in southern and eastern South Africa.|$|E

50|$|Zebras, buffaloes, {{black and}} white colobus, blue monkeys, bushbucks, sunis, and leopards {{populate}} the park. The park contains some 350 species of birds in total, of which 52 are birds of prey. The cliffs in {{the northern end of}} Lake Paradise, in Gof Sokorte Gurda, are home to a number of birds, including Ruppell's griffon vultures, peregrine falcons, <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzards,</b> black kites and African fish eagles. Ducks such as garganeys, southern pochards and teals are found on the lake, which is also home to red-knobbed coots, hamerkops, ibises, purple herons, and yellow-billed storks.On the lower slopes of the forest of the park, marked by scrubland, there are populations of olive baboons, vervet monkeys, Peter's gazelles, beisa oryxes, striped hyenas, caracals and aardwolves.|$|R
50|$|Many {{species of}} animals {{live in the}} montane forest. Some are residents, and others visit from the {{surrounding}} land. Various species of monkeys, several antelopes, tree hyrax and some larger animals such as elephant and buffalo all live in the forest. Zebra are only found on the northern slopes, where the forest belt is narrowest, and more open. Some rare species, such as the giant forest hog, suni, mountain bongo, and maned rat {{are found in the}} forest. Larger predators include hyena and leopard, and occasionally lion. Many bird species are also found here, including turacos, francolins and hornbills. Various types of sunbirds, parrots, swallows and <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzards</b> are common. At the Met Station, on the Naro Moru route, the olive ibis (Bostrychia olivacea; also called the African green ibis), and Abyssinian ground-thrush can be found, both of which are rare. Also on the Naro Moru route buffalo have been observed digging the soil with their horns and eating it. This is probably because of the nutrients in the soil.|$|R
50|$|The Pare Mountains are {{accessible}} by 4WD, {{but there are}} few roads in the South Pares. Species in the Pare mountains include the endemic South Pare white-eye (Zosterops winifredae), <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo oreophilus), olive woodpecker (Mesopicos griseocephalus), moustached tinkerbird (Pogoniulus leucomystax) and the African hill babbler (Pseudoalcippe abyssinica).|$|E
50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzard</b> {{spends most}} of the day perched within the forest cover, but it can {{sometimes}} be seen soaring overhead. It is a territorial bird which is usually seen singly or in pairs. The main prey consists of small mammals, reptiles, and insects which are caught after the bird sights them from an open perch before gliding down and capturing them. In Uganda this species has been recorded hunting bats at caves.|$|E

40|$|VAURIE (1961) in {{a recent}} review of the {{geographical}} races of the Common, or Eurasian, Buzzard (Buteo buteo (Linnaeus)) has found no evidence in favour of the recognition of a West Chinese or Tibetan mountain race of that species. Even less he considers it likely that the <b>Buzzard</b> nests in <b>mountain</b> forests in the Himalayas. In his conclusion he is at variance with PORTENKO (1929 : 644) who described a special race from the Cham region in East Tibet and mentioned specimens ascribed to this race from West China, Darjeeling, Sikkim, and the northwestern Himalaya. This race, originally described as Buteo japonicus saturatus, was re-named by PORTENKO in 1935 Buteo japonicus refectus on nomenclatorial reasons (Orn. Monatsb., 43 : 152). It was considered by HARTERT & STEINBACHER (1932 â€” 38) as a synonym of Buteo buteo burmanicus Hume and by VAURIE (1961) as a synonym of Buteo buteo japonicus Temminck & Schlegel. Neither {{the question of the}} occurrence of Buzzards as breeding birds in the Sino-Himalayan mountains, nor the nomenclature of Buzzards actually collected in these regions has at present been solved. Still, the Buzzard is mentioned to breed in Tibet and Ladakh by both RIPLEY (1961) and ALI (1962) under the name of burmanicus, but not in Sikkim (ALI, 1962). For zoogeographical reasons the occurrence of a Sino-Himalayan race of Common Buzzard would be most interesting since these mountain populations would enclose a Central Asiatic group of buzzards living in semi-deserts and cold steppes (B. rufinus and B. hemilasius). These Central Asiatic high plateau buzzards occur south of the forest-inhabiting Common Buzzards from Siberia and are sometimes considered as conspecific, or almost so, with the whole group of Buzzards of the species Buteo buteo. The breeding range and the characters of the <b>mountain</b> <b>buzzards</b> therefore have those noteworthy zoogeographical complications in that they would indicate an additional ecological basis for the subspecies formation in this group of raptors...|$|R

50|$|The opening {{programme}} {{shows how}} life has {{adapted to the}} volcanic highlands bordering the Rift Valley. Volcanic activity created the Ethiopian Highlands 30 million years ago, and is still evident at Erta Aleâ€™s molten lava lake. Further south, it thrust up huge peaks such as Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya. The <b>mountain</b> hyrax, augur <b>buzzard,</b> giant lobelia and side-striped chameleon {{are some of the}} species filmed on the latter's storm-blasted mountain slopes. In the Aberdares, an older, more eroded range, elephants and mountain bongos are marooned by surrounding human development. In the central Rift Valley, giant mastiff bats roost in a cave beneath the collapsed lava plateau of Mount Suswa. Infrared cameras reveal the activities of the bats and their unusual cohabitants, a troop of baboons. Ol Doinyo Lengai is Africa's most active volcano. The 2007 eruption showered the Serengeti plains with ash, ideal fertiliser for the grass that supports the vast game herds. To the south, the remote Kitulo Plateau in Tanzania is attracting considerable scientific attention due to its unique flora and fauna. The programme includes the first professional footage of the kipunji, a rare primate discovered in 2005. Other species shown include the montane widowbird, the Temple's chameleon and various monkey beetles. The final scenes show mountain gorillas in the Virunga Mountains. Inside the Great Rift shows how the crew enlisted the help of a local Maasai tribe to film inside Mount Suswa's cave.|$|R
