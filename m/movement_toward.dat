5|$|After {{the second}} study {{resulted}} in no further <b>movement</b> <b>toward</b> divided highway construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) in response to the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US113 compared to the state average. The high collision rate, which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US113 to four lanes. MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, because at the time traffic volumes on the highway did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway.|$|E

40|$|The {{trajectories of}} arm <b>movements</b> <b>toward</b> {{visually}} defined targets are curved, even if participants {{try to move}} in a straight line. A factor contributing to this curvature may be that participants systematically misjudge the direction to the target, and try to achieve a straight path by always moving in the perceived direction of the target. If so, the relation between perception of direction and initial movement direction should not only be present for <b>movements</b> <b>toward</b> visually defined targets, but also when making <b>movements</b> <b>toward</b> haptically defined targets. To test whether this is so, we compared errors in the initial movement direction when moving as straight as possible toward haptically defined targets with errors in a pointer setting task toward the same targets. We found a modest correlation between perception of direction and initial movement direction for <b>movements</b> <b>toward</b> haptically defined targets. The amount of correlation depended on the geometry of the task. © 2013 American Psychological Association...|$|R
5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, {{which called for}} an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, the PLO, and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any <b>movement</b> <b>toward</b> direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of <b>movement</b> <b>toward</b> or away from the observer. The component of movement that is {{in the direction of the}} observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 1758, James Abercromby {{attacked}} Fort Carillon on Lake Champlain, but was repelled {{with heavy}} losses. In August, Montgomery and the 17th foot sailed to Boston, marched {{to join with}} Abercromby's forces in Albany and then moved to Lake George. On November 9, Abercromby was recalled; Amherst replaced him as commander-in-chief. The British high command, for the 1759 campaign, developed {{a plan for a}} three-pronged attack into Canada, in which forces including the 17th foot would assault Fort Carillon and also capture Fort St. Frédéric, near Crown Point, New York. Under Amherst's command, Montgomery and the 17th Foot participated in the capture of Fort Carillon. While the army was gathering prior to the battle, Montgomery's company was on guard duty; he ordered his men to remain vigilant for French and Indian ambush parties. On May 9 his suspicions proved correct when 12 men from the 17th were attacked. Montgomery and the 17th met stiff resistance at first. Montgomery ordered that his men were not to fire at night, fearing they would shoot their comrades. On July 21, the army began its <b>movement</b> <b>toward</b> Fort Carillon; by the 26th they were in position outside the fort's walls, from which the French had already withdrawn most of their forces to Fort St. Frédéric. That night, after some exchange of cannon fire during the day, the French blew up Carillon's powder magazine, and Fort St. Frédéric the next day, and withdrew {{to the far end of}} Lake Champlain.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the verbal and nonver-bal strategies that preschoolers used to obtain objects from peers. Two Head Start classrooms of 41 Puerto Rican and African American preschoolers were observed and videotaped over 1 school year using qualitative methods. The preschoolers used three different strategies to obtain objects from peers during play, including <b>movements</b> <b>toward</b> objects, verbal intentions with <b>movements</b> <b>toward</b> objects, and verbal intentions. The students were able to obtain objects from classmates in 40 % of their attempts and were most successful when they combined physical <b>movements</b> <b>toward</b> an object with a request, statement, or claim. The strategies used by the preschoolers and their rates of success varied between the sand, kitchen, and block areas in the two classrooms studied, with children obtaining the greatest success in the block area. The implications of this study’s findings for intervention in the classroom by teachers or speech-language pathologists are discussed. In the last 20 years, speech-language researchers have focused on the study of children’s communication skills in naturalis-tic contexts. One area of growing interest is peer interactio...|$|R

He asked to be sent out of the capital. Emperor Jingzong made him the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (武昌, headquartered in modern Ezhou, Hubei). Also, that year after Emperor Jingzong declared a general pardon, Li Fengji submitted a proposed edict announcing the general pardon that would permit those exiled officials who had previously received a <b>movement</b> <b>toward</b> Chang'an be given another one, but not stating anything with regard to those exiled officials who had never received a previous <b>movement</b> <b>toward</b> Chang'an. Wei pointed out that this wording was intended by Li Fengji to prevent Li Shen's <b>movement</b> <b>toward</b> Chang'an. At Wei's suggestion, the edict was revised, allowing Li Shen to be moved to Jiang Prefecture (江州, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi) to serve as its secretary general.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Upper limb {{movements}} are often performed {{in conjunction with}} other tasks, which may affect its performance. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of <b>movements</b> <b>toward</b> a target in younger when a cognitive task is simultaneously performed. Methods: Twenty young adults, right-handed, traced a line between two targets, as fast as possible, on a tablet, with the right and left upper limb, isolated and during the cognitive task. Targets of different dimensions (0. 5 cm, 1 cm and 1. 5 cm) or placed on distinct distances from the initial point (15 cm, 25 cm and 35 cm) were used. Results: The duration was greater to reach the target when the cognitive task was performed simultaneously, in particular for the men. The duration and the linearity error were greater for targets placed more distant. Conclusion: The execution of a secondary cognitive task interferes negatively on the performance of the upper limb <b>movements</b> <b>toward</b> a target...|$|R
