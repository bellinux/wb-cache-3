25|$|The {{modalities}} {{of financing}} {{water and sanitation}} infrastructure differ substantially between countries. Some countries that have reached higher levels of cost recovery, such as Chile and some utilities in Brazil and Mexico, rely on commercial credit financing. However, {{the vast majority of}} utilities relies on transfers from national governments. These can take various forms: In Colombia municipalities are legally entitled to receive transfers calculated through a formula based on their costs and poverty levels; in Mexico municipalities can apply for matching federal grants provided they fulfill certain conditions that vary by program; in Ecuador municipalities receive transfers based on a formula that takes into account their choice of <b>management</b> <b>model</b> and improvements in cost recovery; and in other countries utilities simply receive transfers that can vary from one year to the other without any conditions. The level of transfers from national governments is highly variable and often far from sufficient to increase coverage and improve service quality. Some countries pass loans from international financial institutions on to utilities in the form of credits. However, these international loans only account for a relatively small share of water and sanitation financing in Latin America.|$|E
25|$|In 2006-07 nine {{small towns}} (between 5,000 and 25,000 inhabitants) across Peru {{introduced}} a new water and sanitation <b>management</b> <b>model,</b> under which the community is being more empowered, including through deciding themselves about {{a certain level of}} service quality, such as low-cost technologies, and corresponding tariffs. Subsequently the municipality hires a specialized operator who is being regulated by a Community Supervision Board under a Public-Private-Social Partnership. The specialized operator can be a private or a mixed company. The aim of the new approach was to break with the low-level equilibrium of poor service quality and poor cost recovery that prevails throughout small towns in Peru, under which poor quality water services are provided directly by the municipality. The new approach was supported through the Small Town Pilot Project (STPP) of the Ministry of Housing, with technical support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and financial support of US$ 6.6 million from the Canadian International Development Agency for limited infrastructure investments and training for both the operator and members of the Community Supervision Boards. After the municipal elections of 2007, 3 new mayors decided to abandon the new approach and to return to the old model of direct municipal management. In the 6 other cities specialized operators continue to operate.|$|E

The definitive version is available at: www. emeraldinsight. com/ 10. 1108 / 14714170510815258 Performance management is a key issue in the construction industry as a result of complex internal and external factors. Large construction organisations are implementing performance <b>management</b> <b>models</b> to improve business processes, products and management of people to facilitate continuous improvement. This study investigates the implementation of performance <b>management</b> <b>models</b> in large construction engineering organisations. Firstly, a brief review of the drive for performance improvement and the strategic considerations for the adoption of performance <b>management</b> <b>models</b> is carried out with specific reference to the Balanced Scorecard and the EFQM Excellence Model. Secondly, using case studies of large construction engineering organisations, the findings from the implementation of performance <b>management</b> <b>models</b> are analysed and discussed. It is shown that whilst {{progress has been made in}} the implementation of performance <b>management</b> <b>models</b> in large construction organisations, significant challenges remained at the planning, deployment and assessment and review stages. This includes the motivation for performance management, leadership and resources, communication mechanisms, measurement and data collection techniques, and the role of knowledge <b>management.</b> Performance <b>management</b> <b>models</b> provide a basis to develop strategy for sustaining long-term business objectives, and more construction organisations will adopt such innovative tools to facilitate continuous improvement, as the business benefits become clear...|$|R

2500|$|Managed {{intensive}} {{rotational grazing}} paints a wide brush over many different managed grazing systems. Managers {{have found that}} rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management purposes, but scientific experiments have demonstrated that rotational grazing systems do not always necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. [...] This controversy stems from two main categorical differences in rotational grazing, prescribed management and adaptive management. [...] The performance of rangeland grazing strategies are similarly constrained by several ecological variables establishing that differences among them are dependent {{on the effectiveness of}} those management models. Depending on the <b>management</b> <b>model,</b> plant production {{has been shown to be}} equal or greater in continuous compared to rotational grazing in 87% of the experiments.|$|E
2500|$|From 1950 to 1984 {{water in}} rural areas was {{provided}} free of charge to beneficiaries and infrastructure was owned by the national government. Beginning in 1984 the responsibility for rural service provision was transferred to communities. In 1987 a decree (Arrêté Présidentiel n°291/11 du 15 mai 1987) [...] transferred ownership of rural water infrastructure to districts, well before the government enacted a comprehensive decentralization policy. Reconstruction activities after the 1994 genocide initially did not achieve a large increase in {{water supply and sanitation}} coverage, nor was there a sustainable <b>management</b> <b>model</b> for water systems {{in rural areas}}. Many users did not pay for water, some collected funds were mismanaged, and voluntary members of water committees in charge of operating and maintaining systems were often poorly motivated. As a result, about half of rural water schemes did not function in 2004 according to an extensive field survey. The adoption of a new sector policy based on a demand driven approach in 1997 did not change the situation much.|$|E
