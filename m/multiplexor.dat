25|$|The {{first use}} of channel I/O was with the IBM 709 vacuum tube mainframe, whose Model 766 Data Synchronizer was the first channel controller, in 1957. Its {{transistorized}} successor, the IBM 7090, had two or more channels (the 7607) and a channel <b>multiplexor</b> (the 7606) which could control up to eight channels.|$|E
2500|$|Amdahl Corporation's {{hardware}} {{implementation of}} System/370 compatible channels was quite different. A single internal unit, called the [...] "C-Unit", supported up to sixteen channels using {{the very same}} hardware for all supported channels. Two internal [...] "C-Units" [...] were possible, supporting up to 32 total channels. Each [...] "C-Unit" [...] independently performed a process generally called a [...] "shifting channel state processor" [...] (a type of [...] "barrel processor"), which implemented a specialized type of finite state machine (FSM). Each CPU cycle, every 32 nanoseconds in the 470/V6 and /V5 and every 26 nanoseconds in the 470/V7 and /V8, the [...] "C-unit" [...] read the complete status of next channel in priority sequence and its I/O Channel in-tags. The necessary actions defined by that channel's last state and its in-tags were performed: data was read from or written to main storage, the operating system program was interrupted if such interruption was specified by the channel program's Program Control Interrupt flag, and the [...] "C-Unit" [...] finally stored that channel's next state and set its I/O Channel out-tags, {{and then went on}} to the next lower priority channel. Preemption was possible, in some instances. Sufficient FIFO storage was provided within the [...] "C-Unit" [...] for all channels which were emulated by this FSM. Channels could be easily reconfigured to the customer's choice of IBM 2860 (selector) emulation, IBM 2870 (byte <b>multiplexor)</b> emulation or IBM 2880 (block <b>multiplexor)</b> emulation without any significant restrictions by using maintenance console commands. [...] "Two-byte interface" [...] was also supported as was [...] "Data-In/Data-Out" [...] and other high-performance IBM channel options. Built-in channel-to-channel adapters were also offered, called CCAs in Amdahl-speak, but called CTCs in IBM-speak. A real game-changer, and this forced IBM to redesign its mainframes to provide similar channel capability and flexibility. IBM's initial response was to include stripped-down Model 158s, operating in [...] "Channel Mode", only, as the Model 303x channel units. In the Amdahl [...] "C-unit" [...] any channel could be any type, 2860, 2870 or 2880, without reserving channels 0 and 4 for 2870s, as on some IBM models.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} by-pass a {{pipeline}} register, {{we have used}} two methods. In the first one, the pipeline register logic is organized {{in such a way}} that a signal can pass through it regardless of the clock signal when the VSP is enabled. This solution can be implemented if the pipeline registers are made up of transparent latches. It is simple, but its drawback is the cost-effectiveness of using transparent latches in the pipeline. In the second method, the logic gates and <b>multiplexors</b> are involved. The <b>multiplexors</b> are meant to decide which pipeline registers are active and which ones are to be shutdown when the unification signal is applied. An example of this solution is shown in [24].|$|R
