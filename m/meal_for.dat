5|$|Ka'ak bi 'awja is a {{semolina}} shortbread pastry {{filled with}} ground dates called ajwa or walnuts. The dessert {{is a traditional}} <b>meal</b> <b>for</b> Christians during Easter, however, ka'ak bi awja is also prepared {{towards the end of}} Ramadan, to be eaten during Eid al-Fitr—a Muslim festival immediately following Ramadan, as well as during Eid al-Adha. During Mawlid—the holiday honoring the birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad—Zalabieh which consists of small, crunchy deep fried dough balls in dipped in syrup, is served. The dough is made from flour, yeast and water.|$|E

That day, Monitor was made ready for sea, her crew under strict orders not to discuss the impending voyage with anyone, but bad weather delayed her departure until 29 December.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every <b>meal</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E
5|$|In Bakuriani, {{the street}} where Kumaritashvili's {{childhood}} home is located was renamed in his honour. Felix Loch of Germany, who {{won the gold medal}} in luge at the Vancouver Olympics, had his medal melted down and refashioned into two disks, etched with an image of Kumaritashvili and the years of his birth and death, one of which he gave to Kumaritashvili's parents. In spite of several donations of money to the Kumaritashvili family, the tragedy was hard on them; twice in the years afterwards Dodo, who continued to fix a <b>meal</b> <b>for</b> Kumaritashvili every day, tried to kill herself, while David dealt with severe health problems resulting in multiple stays in hospital.|$|E
5|$|Nabis' {{rule was}} {{largely based on}} his social reforms and the {{rebuilding}} of Sparta's armed forces. The military of Lacedaemonia, Sparta, had traditionally been based on levies of full citizens and perioeci (one of the free non-citizen groups of Lacedaemonia) supported by lightly armed helots. From several thousands in the times of the Greco-Persian Wars, the numbers of full citizen Spartans had declined to a few hundred in the times of Cleomenes III. There were possibly several reasons for the decline of numbers, {{one of which was}} that every Spartan who wasn't able to pay his share in the syssitia (common <b>meal</b> <b>for</b> men in Doric societies) lost his full citizenship, although this didn't exclude his offspring from partaking in the agoge (traditional Spartan education and training regime).|$|E

5|$|Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb, {{a general}} under the Umayyads, was {{appointed}} {{the head of}} a great army to lead the Mazandaran expedition. On the way to Mazandaran, the general ordered captives to be hanged at {{the two sides of the}} road so that the victorious Arab army pass through. The attack on Tabarestan (present-day Mazandaran) failed, but he established his control in Gorgan. By the orders of Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb so many Persians were beheaded in Gorgan that their blood mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day <b>meal</b> <b>for</b> him, as he had vowed. Extent of his brutality represented itself by running watermills by people's blood for three days and he fed his army with the bread made from that very bloody flour. But, Tabarestan remained invincible until the majority of Zoroastrians migrated towards India and the rest converted to Islam gradually.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the details}} of Hendrix's last day and death are widely disputed, {{he spent much of}} September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she {{prepared}} a <b>meal</b> <b>for</b> them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill, sometime around 11 p.m., when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove Hendrix to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45a.m., where he remained for about an hour before she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. Dannemann said they talked until around 7 a.m., when they went to sleep. She awoke around 11 a.m., and found Hendrix breathing, but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18a.m., which arrived on the scene at 11:27a.m. Paramedics then transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital where Dr. John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45p.m. on September 18, 1970.|$|E
5|$|On November15, {{a massive}} {{evacuation}} of residents began to remove survivors from unsafe conditions. Two flights to California {{took place on}} the first day of evacuation, carrying a total of 154people. Thousands of residents were also brought to Wake Island for shelter. Military Air Transport Service planes from the United States mainland, Japan, the Philippines, and Hawaii were called in for the operation. On November16, residents were warned of a possible typhoid epidemic and urged to get inoculations for the disease. Over a three-day span, roughly 30,000people were given preventative shots for the disease. In contrast to their previous ban on alien workers, the Government of Guam requested 1,500carpenters, masons, and other building workers from the Philippines. By November21, the Navy Supply Depot planned to have enough supplies for the entire populous shipped until replenishment arrived. In order to shelter homeless, the United States Navy set up tent villages across the island. Military kitchens were also established to provide food. Due to continued rains in the wake of the typhoon, many were unable to get a full <b>meal</b> <b>for</b> Thanksgiving.|$|E

5|$|Parasites {{can also}} be {{aggressive}} mimics, though the situation is somewhat different from those outlined previously. Some predators have a feature that draws prey; parasites can also mimic their host's natural prey, but are eaten themselves, a pathway into their host. Leucochloridium, a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird in the faeces. They are then taken up by Succinea, a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this intermediate host, and must then find a suitable bird to mature in. Since the host birds do not eat snails, the sporocyst has another strategy to reach its host's intestine. They are brightly coloured and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail's eye stalks, coming to resemble an irresistible <b>meal</b> <b>for</b> a songbird. In this way, it can {{bridge the gap between}} hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle. A nematode (Myrmeconema neotropicum) changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant Cephalotes atratus to make it appear like the ripe fruits of Hyeronima alchorneoides. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (rear part) is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds. The droppings of birds are collected by other ants and fed to their brood, thereby helping to spread the nematode.|$|E
5|$|The identification, in 2000, of a {{probable}} Deinonychus egg associated {{with one of}} the original specimens allowed comparison with other theropod dinosaurs in terms of egg structure, nesting, and reproduction. In their 2006 examination of the specimen, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky examined the possibility that the dromaeosaurid had been feeding on the egg, or that the egg fragments had been associated with the Deinonychus skeleton by coincidence. They dismissed the idea that the egg had been a <b>meal</b> <b>for</b> the theropod, noting that the fragments were sandwiched between the belly ribs and forelimb bones, making it impossible that they represented contents of the animal's stomach. In addition, {{the manner in which the}} egg had been crushed and fragmented indicated that it had been intact at the time of burial, and was broken by the fossilization process. The idea that the egg was randomly associated with the dinosaur was also found to be unlikely; the bones surrounding the egg had not been scattered or disarticulated, but remained fairly intact relative to their positions in life, indicating that the area around and including the egg was not disturbed during preservation. The fact that these bones were belly ribs (gastralia), which are very rarely found articulated, supported this interpretation. All the evidence, according to Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky, indicates that the egg was intact beneath the body of the Deinonychus when it was buried. It is possible that this represents brooding or nesting behavior in Deinonychus similar to that seen in the related troodontids and oviraptorids, or that the egg was in fact inside the oviduct when the animal died.|$|E
