40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a virtual {{platform}} of a <b>manned</b> <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> carrying an underwater manipulator to animate operation tasks under the deep sea. The {{models of the}} vehicle and the manipulator refer to the structures of the 鈥淛iaolong鈥?deep <b>manned</b> <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> and a master-slave servo hydraulic manipulator, respectively. The master-slave manipulator with 7 functions developed by Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), Chinese Academy of Sciences, is able to perform operation tasks below the ocean&# 39;s surface 7000 meters. The platform is a powerful multi-purpose tool: First, {{it can be used}} for training an operator to telepresence operate the virtual manipulator to complete basic tasks under the deep sea by coordinating a cradle head, the <b>manned</b> <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the underwater manipulator; Second, {{it can be used to}} test or to validate motion control methods for operating the submersible and manipulator. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the virtual platform, we present two typical underwater operation tasks: picking-up a rock sample and making a mark...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the safety factors of MSV (<b>Manned</b> <b>Submersible</b> <b>Vehicle)</b> and shorten the pilot {{training}} cycle, the real hardware and software system combine with the modeling and simulation calculation of its sensors, equipment, actuators submersible ontology and motion status in deep sea environment, realizing the semi physical simulation system. First of all, the system model is built and hardware structure is introduced; then the model calculation software structure is studied, mainly focusing on the motion data simulation; finally open-loop motion data, close-loop motion data, all virtual devices and their network data transmission delay time are estimated. The conclusions that the MSV&# 39;s semi physical simulation system network performance is better than Jiaolong&# 39;s and the motion data is favorable are got, realizing the simulation of sensors, equipment, actuators and three-dimensional motion data. This lays foundation for improvement of MSV&# 39;s safety factors and contraction of pilot training period...|$|E
40|$|A semi-physical {{virtual reality}} system {{applying}} to MSV (<b>Manned</b> <b>Submersible</b> <b>Vehicle)</b> control study {{is presented in}} this paper. This system is composed of three nodes: (1) control node for receiving sensors information and sending control command, (2) virtual sensors node for virtual devices and sensors and (3) Visualization node for virtual ocean environment and displaying the posture of MSV. The control node can be both linked to the real sensors and actuators dealing with a real mission, and linked to the virtual world for test purpose. The advantages of this semi-physical virtual reality system include that: (1) the MSV software can be tested in the laboratory before real experiments taking place, (2) the merit and demerit of some newly underwater vehicle system can be verified, (3) Moreover intensive testing is easy and its cost is not too expensive.

40|$|Aquariums {{as sources}} of {{invasive}} species Exurban land-use change The existence of deep-sea corals was first docu-mented over 200 years ago, although {{most of what we}} now know about them has been learned in the past few decades. Since the development of <b>manned</b> and un-manned <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicles,</b> scientists have finally been able to study these corals in their natural envi-ronment. In many ways, deep-sea corals are similar to their shallow-water relatives. They show great diversity in size, shape, and color, from white cups the size of fin-gertips to crimson trees 3 m tall. Some are stony and hard to the touch, while others are soft and sway with the current. A few species build large reef structures reaching many meters from the seafloor (Rogers 1999) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a virtual platform of an underwater manipulator {{mounted on a}} submersible vehicle via the three-dimensional simulator “Webots” for teleoperation through a replica master arm. The graphical, kinematic and dynamic models of the manipulator refer to a master-slave servo hydraulic manipulator with 7 functions, consisting of {{six degrees of freedom}} (DOFs) and a parallel gripper, while the “Jiaolong” deep <b>manned</b> <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle,</b> operating below the sea surface down to 7000 meters, is chosen as the underwater manipulator carrier. This study uses the virtual platform for training an operator to telepresence control the virtual manipulator to complete basic tasks in subsea environments. When training the operator, one has to consider uncertain external disturbances and the visual impacts that stem from subsea environments. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the virtual platform, one designs two typical underwater operational tasks: grasping a marine organism sample, and reaching at a given position. This paper presents the comparative studies: 1. The performances demonstrated by remotely controlling the virtual manipulator and the real manipulator; 2. The operating performances delivered by three operators before and after training when using the platform...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} a project with the {{objective}} to inspect seam welds on underwater structures (e. g. oil platforms). A robot is mounted to a <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> which also carries the required equipment and tools for cleaning, measuring and inspection. The robot's tasks {{as well as the}} path of the <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> are preprogrammed using an off-line programming and simulation system developed at the IPK. In {{the first phase of the}} project, the overall concept was simulated by computer. Additionally, a laboratory model was constructed using a Manutec R 15 industrial robot and a tube intersection of a research platform in order to test the system. In further project phases, real underwater experiments are planned. Design work has begun concerning a waterproof robot and a mechanical interface between <b>submersible</b> <b>vehicle</b> and robot. This includes additional translational and rotational axes for robot positioning. The execution of robot tasks and the transport of the robot by the submersi ble vehicle to the underwater docking position have to be executed autonomously. For autonomous transport, a navigation system is required. Therefore, a feasibility study concerning analytical principles and performance evaluation was conducted in combination with a market survey of available components. Some of the study results are briefly presented in the paper...|$|R
