25|$|Donkeys can interbreed {{with other}} members of the family Equidae, and are {{commonly}} interbred with horses. The hybrid between a jack and a mare is a mule, valued as a working and riding animal in many countries. Some large donkey breeds such as the Asino di Martina Franca, the Baudet de Poitou and the Mammoth Jack are raised only for <b>mule</b> <b>production.</b> The hybrid between a stallion and a jenny is a hinny, and is less common. Like other inter-species hybrids, mules and hinnies are usually sterile. Donkeys can also breed with zebras in which the offspring is called a zonkey (among other names).|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, {{widespread}} usage of mules declined in industrialized countries. The use of mules for farming and transportation of agricultural products largely gave way to modern tractors and trucks. However, in the United States, a dedicated number of mule breeders continued the tradition as a hobby and continued breeding the great lines of American Mammoth Jacks started in the United States by George Washington with the gift from the King of Spain of two Zamorano-Leonés donkeys. These hobby breeders began to utilize better mares for <b>mule</b> <b>production</b> until today's modern saddle mule emerged. Exhibition shows where mules pulled heavy loads have now been joined with mules competing in Western and English pleasure riding, as well as dressage and show jumping competition. There is now a cable TV show dedicated to the training of donkeys and mules. Mules, once snubbed at traditional horse shows, have been accepted for competition at the most exclusive horse shows in the world in all disciplines.|$|E

40|$|Owing to the {{mechanization}} {{in agriculture}} and transport, {{the number of}} donkeys reared in Europe was reduced of 50 % in the last 20 years and more than 80 % {{since the middle of}} the last century. During this period, no attention was devoted to the breeding selection and biodiversity conservation, with the results that, nowadays, most of the European breeds of donkey are threatened of extinction. The remaining donkeys, in Europe, are employed for niche purposes as <b>mule</b> <b>production</b> or maintenance of soil and landscape. The consumption of donkey meat is not popular in Europe, and a few animals are sent to the slaughterhouse. A new interest is growing in Europe for donkey milk, mostly for human consumption, but also for the production of beauty products. Marginal areas of donkey employment are the social and leisure uses. In {{spite of the fact that}} interest for donkey in Europe is very marginal and very few or even no funding for research were provided from national or European authorities, more or less one third of articles published on different aspect of donkey sciences in the last 20 years were produced in Europe...|$|E

Seminal {{parameters}} and field fertility of cryopreserved donkey jack semen after insemination of horse mares. Equine Veterinary Journal, 43 (2), 179 - 183. IMPF: 01. 45 Reasons for performing study: As <b>mule</b> <b>production</b> is often concentrated {{in remote areas}} of the world, a simplified semen cryopreservation protocol is required. Aim: To compare the seminal parameters of cryopreserved donkey semen in lactose-EDTA and lactose-yolk extenders and the fertility rates on horse mares. Methods:Trial 1 : Sperm total and progressive motility, vigour (scale 0 ? 5), morphology (major and minor defects) and plasma membrane integrity (HOST) were evaluated in 25 ejaculates from 5 donkey jacks immediately after collection (raw), after chilling to 5 ?C (chilled) and after freezing/thawing. The semen was mixed with skimmed-milk extender, centrifuged, and then re-suspended in lactose-EDTA or lactose-yolk extender. Semen was loaded into 0. 5 ml straws and chilled to 5 ?C for 1 h, after which samples were either evaluated (chilled semen) or placed above liquid nitrogen for 20 min prior to immersion. Seminal parameters were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey's test. Trial 2 : Cryopreserved semen from 3 males was used to inseminate 53 mares at 60 oestrous cycles randomly assigned to lactose-yolk (n = 30 cycles) or lactose-EDTA (n = 30 cycles) extenders. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed 15 and 25 days post ovulation. The pregnancy rates were compared using Chi-squared tests. Results:Trial 1 : No significant differences were evident in any seminal parameters between extenders after either chilling or cryopreservation. Total and progressive motility were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower in cryopreserved semen than raw and chilled semen for both extenders. Trial 2 : Pregnancy rates did not significantly differ between extenders (lactose-EDTA extender 53. 33 and 43. 33 %; lactose-yolk 50. 0 and 46. 66 % for Days 15 and 25 post ovulation, respectively). Conclusions: Cryopreservation of donkey semen using the simplified lactose-yolk extender resulted in similar seminal {{parameters and}} fertility rates when compared to lactose-EDTA extender. Potential relevance: Lactose-yolk extender may be advocated as a simple, easy to prepare extender, for use in geographically isolated enterprises producing mules throughout the world.

50|$|After the war, Continental {{introduced}} its own R-975 version for aircraft, the R9-A. Though {{it was basically}} similar to other R-975 engines, and its compression ratio and supercharger gear ratio were unchanged from the R-975E-3, other improvements in the R9-A allowed it to achieve 525 hp (391 kW) for takeoff, surpassing any Wright version. A military version, the R-975-46, could reach 550 hp (410 kW), and was used in Piasecki's HUP Retriever and H-25 Army <b>Mule</b> helicopters. Continental's <b>production</b> of R-975 engines continued into the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The Roberts {{was made}} {{at a time when}} the power loom {{industry}} was set to expand. Until this moment, hand looms were more common than power looms. The reliable Roberts loom was quickly adopted and again it was the spinning side that was short of capacity. Roberts then addressed this, with the construction of a self-acting (automatic) spinning <b>mule.</b> Essentially, textile <b>production</b> was no longer a skilled craft but an industrial process that could be manned by semi-skilled labour. Mule spinning became the mans occupation, and weaving a girls occupation.|$|R
50|$|John Hough James was {{interested}} in nearly every aspect of business and commerce that he encountered. He read for law and began to practice soon after graduating from college. He also worked for his father’s river shipping business in various capacities. In his lifetime he owned a bank, a newspaper and several farming properties. He was treasurer {{and president of the}} Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, helping to build one of the earliest railroads in the country. He experimented with numerous other enterprises including <b>mule</b> breeding, silk <b>production,</b> real estate speculation, railroad and canal building, river shipping and more. Although he seems to have been very financially successful throughout his entire life, James was central to many failed business ventures in banking, canal building and railroading.|$|R
40|$|Among {{different}} duck genetic types, Muscovy {{and especially}} mule ducks {{are the only}} ones involved in fatty liver <b>production.</b> <b>Mule</b> ducks are hybrids from male Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata, Cm) and female common ducks (Anas platyrhynchos, Ap). They benefit from a heterosis effect on feed ingestion capacity and fatty liver weight and thus they account for 95 % of fatty liver production. Conversely, common ducks and hinny hybrids (male common duck X female Muscovy duck) are not used to produce fatty liver. In order to better characterize these reciprocal hybrids, genome specific expression was analyzed. RNA sequencing was conducted in the liver of common, Muscovy, mule and hinny ducks fed ad libitum or overfed (n= 10). SNPs with genome specific alleles were selected in common and Muscovy duck RNA sequences by discosnp++, a de novo assembly method that does not require a reference genome. Sequence reads corresponding to the two alleles of genome specific SNPs were then counted in RNA sequences from mule and hinny hybrids. These counts were considered as expression levels. Only three loci were found to be expressed in a strict genome specific manner. They were localized in the mitochondrial genome and, as expected, the maternal allele of the hybrids was found to be expressed. Interestingly, some genes were also found to be expressed with allelic imbalance, i. e. the ratio of Ap allele expression on Cm allele expression being 1 in overfed ducks or conversely > 1 in at libitum fed and < 1 in overfed ducks, pointing out orthologue genes with and without regulation by (over) feeding. In conclusion, genome specific expression and allelic imbalance could be observed in duck hybrids, strongly suggesting regulatory divergence between parental alleles...|$|R
