5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
500|$|To play Tracy, Witherspoon {{developed}} a distinct speech pattern combining strident intonations with a chipper Midwestern accent. She also worked on clenching her facial muscles {{and maintaining a}} clipped walking pace. [...] "That was just Tracy, it so escapes <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> came out!" [...] she said. [...] "I just imagined how uptight people carry themselves, and they grind their teeth at night and they clench their jaw because {{everything has to be}} just perfect." [...] Praising her performance, her co-star Matthew Broderick said, [...] "From the first she knew exactly what she wanted—a very aggressive person in a small and cute package... she comes out very funny and very scary at the same time." ...|$|E
500|$|Lauren London as New New/Erin Garnett, Rashad's love {{interest}} and John Garnett's daughter. The character of New-New was {{loosely based on}} R group TLC's [...] "T-Boz as a kid," [...] said London. [...] "I talked to her about my character... she explained to <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was when she was young— the attitude and the flavor. And it’s funny, {{a lot of people}} say that I act like she used to act at the skating rink.” Director Robinson was impressed by London and [...] "everything from her look, to the fact that she's new. And there's just so much truth in her, and she doesn't know how to lie yet as an actress. It was perfect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't believe--Don't raise me! Bern, let me kneel. I see {{truth in}} your face--in Miss Withersteen's. But {{let me hear}} it all--all on my knees. Tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it's</b> true!" ...|$|R
60|$|Let <b>me</b> {{remember}} <b>how</b> <b>it</b> used to be, {{and bring}} one morning back again.|$|R

500|$|In [...] "No Time for It", Fantasia sings about {{blocking}} out drama and negativity. Samantha Callender of The Source wrote that its lyrics are {{a list of}} [...] "all the things Fantasia has no time for (basically everything except money)". In the chorus, [...] "You wanna tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is, but there’s no time for it / You wanna {{tell me how you}} feel, but there's no time for it"; Fantasia sings in [...] "a cool collected manner", contrasting with her biting lyrics. Idolator's Mike Wass described the song as a [...] "catchy mid-tempo anthem" [...] and its lyrics, such as [...] "Bitch, no time for the haters tripping", as exemplifying that [...] "Fantasia has always been the realest". Her vocal delivery was described as [...] "a combination acid-rosewater solution" [...] and the lyrics [...] "Do you thing, get your change / By the way you don't think I'ma care cause I'm not" [...] classified as [...] "a slow jam with a score to settle", with Fantasia [...] "warn a clueless second party that bad behavior will no longer be tolerated".|$|E
2500|$|My {{first piece}} of four-way Bargello was started {{approximately}} ten years ago [...] I placed a mirror on a Bargello design {{in a way that}} showed <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would look if I mitered [...] a corner. This intrigued me so much, I graphed a design starting in the center and mitering all four corners.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 5 {{looks at}} the inanity of the society depicted, insofar as an {{intellectual}} discussion {{of the work of}} Chatterton between Obtuse Angle, Little Scopprell, Aradobo and Tilly Lally descends into farce; [...] "Obtuse Angle said in the first place you thought he was not [...] & then afterwards when I said he was not you thought he was not. Why I know that – Oh no sir I thought that he was not, but I ask'd to know whether he was. – How can that be said Obtuse Angle how could you ask & think that he was not – why said he. It came into my head that he was not. – Why then said Obtuse Angle you said that he was. Did I say so Law I did not think I said that – Did not he said Obtuse Angle Yes said Scopprell. But I meant said Aradobo I I I can't think Law Sir I wish you'd tell <b>me,</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is." [...] Northrop Frye refers to this incident as [...] "farcical conversational deadlock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, Muster Fenwick. Murder is {{a terrible}} crime. And now, if you'll tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> much <b>it</b> was you paid the lawyer at Heytesbury--" ...|$|R
6000|$|RAINA. Tell <b>me,</b> tell <b>me.</b> <b>How</b> was <b>it!</b> (Ecstatically) Oh, mother, mother, mother! (Raina {{pulls her}} mother {{down on the}} ottoman; and they kiss one another frantically.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} not to do so," [...] Will said firmly. [...] "Mother--I always call her mother--told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> bad <b>it</b> was, and I said I'd try." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Arthur's face brightened {{up when he}} saw it. 'That is {{just what}} I want,' he cried, 'and now tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> goes off.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Father!' cried Little Dorrit, {{pale and}} trembling. 'I am very sorry. Pray forgive me. Tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is, that I {{may not do}} it again!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> happened," [...] said James Morris, {{and now all}} in {{the camp}} {{gathered}} around {{to hear what the}} old frontiersman had to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear <b>me!</b> <b>how</b> nicely <b>it's</b> framed, and <b>how</b> beautifully she has {{finished}} it!" [...] pursued Valentine, gently patting Madonna's shoulder, in token {{of his high}} approval and admiration.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean to {{take this}} down and ask grandma to show <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it's</b> done. I've heard her tell about {{spinning}} and weaving {{when she was a}} girl, and I know I can learn," [...] said Minnie, who {{had fallen in love with}} the little wheel, and vainly tried to twist the flax into as smooth a thread as the one hanging from the distaff, as if shadowy fingers had lately spun it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] {{broke in}} Iduna hurriedly. [...] "The {{truth is that}} Steinar is jealous of <b>me.</b> <b>How</b> is <b>it</b> {{that you can make}} us all love you so much, Olaf?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Very well, I'll come if I can. (ASIDE.) Dear <b>me,</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> does tire a person's arm to {{hold this}} thing up so long! I wish she'd-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I feared {{this when}} I {{saw he was}} not with you. Tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> happened. It {{is not the first}} shrewd blow fate has dealt me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> all happened, Dick," [...] {{said the}} princess; [...] "I'm sure it's {{not so bad}} as you make out. Perhaps I can help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gently, gently, Gerald. We have no {{certainty}} {{that this is}} true. Your father had known her for years. Tell <b>me,</b> <b>how</b> did <b>it</b> come out—- what evidence did she adduce?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have very}} much to tell <b>me.</b> <b>How</b> is <b>it</b> you come from the westward, and where is your compañero?" [...] she asked; and once more Maxwell was wholly misled.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} take a long time," [...] said madame, [...] "for an {{earthquake}} to swallow a town. Eh well! Tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> long <b>it</b> takes to prepare the earthquake?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> all happened," [...] I cried, almost faint with joy, {{and still}} {{wondering}} whether my innocence {{had really been}} proved beyond all fear of cavil.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed; and {{goodness}} knows there's plenty of the sow's ear about him. But now, Æneas, dear, do tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> all was, {{just from the}} beginning." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Time," [...] he said, [...] "will {{not stand}} still {{for all of}} us. Yet my memory tells <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{possible}} <b>it</b> would be--for indeed those days seem but as yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Loudon," [...] said he, with {{a visible}} effort, after the coffee was come and our pipes lighted, [...] "you can never {{understand}} the gratitude and loyalty I bear you. You don't {{know what a}} boon {{it is to be}} taken up by a man that stands on the pinnacle of civilisation; you can't think <b>how</b> <b>it's</b> refined and purified <b>me,</b> <b>how</b> <b>it's</b> appealed to my spiritual nature; and I {{want to tell you that}} I would die at your door like a dog." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{is wrong}} is shame! Cannot you see <b>how</b> unworthy <b>it</b> {{would be in}} <b>me,</b> and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would grieve my uncle that I should have done such a thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} did, and spoiled your story by {{beginning}} at the wrong end. Now, start right, and tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> all happened. I'm pining to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'But {{what is the}} treasure, then?' I asked. 'I am {{as ready}} to be rich as you can be, if you will but show <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> can be done.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dod, the auld deevil laughed till he nigh {{sat down}} on Dandie. 'Send me the bill,' says he. 'I'm long past champagne, but tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> tastes the morn.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Suppose that pack-saddle were to {{fall and}} kill <b>me,</b> <b>how</b> dreadful <b>it</b> would be!' and she sat down just under the pack-saddle she was so much afraid of, and began to cry.|$|R

6000|$|... "Lord love you, son," [...] soothed Howard Griffin, [...] "we aren't {{trying to}} change your opinion of Frazer. We're, your friends, you know. We're proud of you for {{standing}} up for him. Only thing is, now that he's practically fired, just tell <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>it's</b> {{going to help him}} or you or anybody else, now, to make everybody sore by roasting them because they can't agree with you. Boost; don't knock! Don't make everybody think you're a crank." ...|$|R
