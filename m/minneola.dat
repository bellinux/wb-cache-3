5000|$|The <b>Minneola</b> tangelo (sometimes misspelled [...] "Mineola") is a {{cross between}} a Duncan {{grapefruit}} and a Dancy tangerine, and was released in 1931 by the USDA Horticultural Research Station in Orlando. It is named after <b>Minneola,</b> Florida. Most <b>Minneola</b> tangelos are characterised by a stem-end neck, which tends to make the fruit appear bell-shaped. Because of this, it is also called the Honeybell in the gift fruit trade, where {{it is one of the}} most popular varieties. A true Honeybell Tangelo is a hybrid-cross between Thompson tangerine and a pomelo, hence the name Tangelo released by the USDA. Both Minneolas and Honeybells are usually fairly large, typically 3-3½ inches in diameter; the Honeybells tend to be larger and sweeter. The peel colour, when mature, is a bright-reddish-orange colour. The rind of the <b>Minneola</b> is relatively thin, while the rind of the Honeybell is slightly thicker. Both the <b>Minneola</b> and Honeybell Tangelo peel rather easily. Both are very juicy. Both the <b>Minneola</b> and the Honeybell are not strongly self-fruitful, and yields will be greater when interplanted with suitable pollenisers such as Temple tangor, Sunburst tangerine, or possibly Fallglo tangerine. It tends to bear a good crop every other year. In the Northern Hemisphere the fruit matures in the December-February period, with January being the peak.|$|E

50|$|Up to 1857 Peoria Township {{belonged to}} the Peorias, Weas and Piankeshaws. In April of that year the land was thrown upon the market. Previous to that time, a few {{settlers}} had entered the Township in anticipation of that event. Upon being offered, the land was nearly all immediately bought up at prices. During the year 1857, Albert Johnson settled and opened a store, and around his store gathered {{the nucleus of the}} future town of Peoria. It is beautifully situated on a promontory projecting between the valleys of Hickory Creek and that of the Marais des Cygnes. Albert Johnson was appointed first Postmaster, and also first Assessor, the latter appointment being made by the County Board. In the year 1859, a strife sprang up for the possession of the County seat. It was then at <b>Minneola</b> (then the state capitol and soon-to-be ghost town); Peoria and Mt. Vernon contended for it against <b>Minneola</b> and Ohio City, at the general election. Peoria was successful. <b>Minneola</b> forbade the removal, and a lawsuit followed in which <b>Minneola</b> was successful as elsewhere detailed.|$|E

50|$|The {{ghost town}} can trace its origins {{to the earlier}} {{settlement}} of St. Bernard, founded in 1855. The town's postmaster, J. M. Bernard, was pro-slavery, and he angered {{many of the men}} in the area, who had anti-slavery leanings. Eventually, Bernard was convinced to leave the settlement. Eventually, St. Bernard developed into <b>Minneola,</b> which was the rival to the nearby town of Centropolis, as both were hoping to be the newly appointed territorial capital of Kansas. After Kansas free-state voters overcame the pro-slavery faction in 1857, the government voted against naming Centropolis as the capital of Kansas, since the town had pro-slavery leanings. However, the newly free-state government still wished to move the territorial capital from Lecompton, and so the newly elected legislature convened at Lawrence to decide the new location. Perry Fuller—a man who had been successful in establishing Centropolis as a successful city—and several associates purchased 14 quarter sections of farm land near <b>Minneola,</b> hoping to expand the small town into the future capital of Kansas. Around this time, Centropolis's newspaper, the Kansas Leader was brought into <b>Minneola,</b> and renamed to the <b>Minneola</b> Statesman.|$|E
