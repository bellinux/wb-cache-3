500|$|A USMARC {{long-term}} multi-breed {{study of}} Limousins, three British (Red Poll, Hereford, Angus) {{and five other}} continental European (Braunvieh, Pinzgauer, Gelbvieh, Simmental, Charolais) cattle breeds [...] reported that Limousin cattle were the most efficient and fastest of all breeds at converting feed into saleable meat even though Limousin's live weight growth was the slowest. This arose because saleable <b>meat</b> <b>yield</b> expressed as percentage of live weight was significantly higher in Limousins than in most other cattle breeds. Saleable <b>meat</b> <b>yield</b> was an average 34.9% of live weight for the three British cattle breeds, compared with 40.4% for the five other continental European breeds, and 46.0% for Limousins, for two market end points of 225kg saleable meat at 8mm fat trim, and 210kg saleable meat at 0mm fat trim. Live weight gain for the Limousins averaged 1.27kg/day, compared with an average 1.29kg/day for the British breeds and 1.38kg/day for the other continental European cattle. Limousin saleable meat gain averaged 585g/day, with the balance being 687g/day of low value or waste product, such as bone, trimmed fat, internal organs, and hide. The British breeds produced significantly less saleable meat (average 451g/day) and significantly more low value product (841g/day), while consuming about twice the feed of the Limousins from entry to the trial (weaning) to the market end point (slaughter). The other continental European breeds produced on average less saleable meat (556g/day) and more low cost product (819g/day) while consuming about 25% more feed than the Limousins. Although the Simmental and Charolais produced marginally more saleable meat (590g/day) than Limousins, they produced significantly more low cost product (847g/day) and consumed 18% more feed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{method for}} the rapid removal of {{meat from the}} defeathered, noneviscerated warm chicken carcass was developed. Initially, breast meat, skin, and wing {{from one side of}} the bird were {{stripped}} in one motion from the noneviscerated carcass. Then leg bones are cut and pulled from leg meat. The procedure eliminates the need to eviscerate chickens before deboning. Yield data for 7 -through 12 -week-old broilers showed increases in combined breast and leg <b>meat</b> <b>yields</b> from 24. 7 % of slaughter weight for 7 -week-old males to 29. 3 % for 12 -week-old males and 24. 4 % for females at 7 weeks to 28. 2 % at 12 weeks of age. <b>Meat</b> <b>yields</b> were evenly divided be-tween breast and leg in males, but breast meat was heavier than leg meat in the females.

40|$|Mussel {{aquaculture}} is {{a growing}} industry in Scotland, dominated by the production of Mytilus edulis. However, Mytilus trossulus, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and their hybrids with M. edulis have recently been detected in Scotland. At some farms, M. trossulus {{have been associated with}} significant losses in production because of presenting low <b>meat</b> <b>yields</b> and fragile shells. In the present study, M. edulis, M. trossulus, and their hybrids were examined from three cultivation areas in order to investigate shell and meat characteristics and advise on future management of mixed-species areas in Scotland. Results suggest that M. edulis is likely to consistently outperform M. trossulus and hybrids in mixed-species areas, but that M. trossulus <b>meat</b> <b>yields</b> from different areas can vary considerably. The ability to classify mussels into two (M. edulis and non-edulis) groups suggests that separation of M. trossulus genotypes could potentially be achieved by grading the harvested mussels. In the most affected areas, however, the fallowing of cultivation sites and importation of unispecific M. edulis spat appear as an alternative. Management of this problem in Scotland is likely to involve the implementation of area-specific measures, and the establishment of clear guidance on good practice aiming at preventing further distribution of M. trossulus...|$|R
