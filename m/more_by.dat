5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired <b>more</b> <b>by</b> the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.|$|E

5|$|The novel explores {{themes of}} history, religion, and social movements. The {{historical}} narrative is guided <b>more</b> <b>by</b> social history than political or military history.

40|$|Research on {{biological}} {{sex differences in}} romantic jealousy suggests that males are <b>more</b> upset <b>by</b> sexual infidelity and females are <b>more</b> upset <b>by</b> emotional infidelity. Researchers identify two types of jealousy (i. e., sexual and emotional) and two types of commitment (i. e., sexual exclusivity and relational duration). The type of jealousy experienced may be a rational or emotional response to different commitment beliefs rather than dependent {{on biological}} sex. A sample of 230 college students completed various measures of commitment and jealousy {{as part of an}} online survey. People who valued sexually exclusive relationships were <b>more</b> distressed <b>by</b> sexual infidelity. People who valued long-term relationships were <b>more</b> distressed <b>by</b> emotional infidelity. Commitment beliefs predict jealousy responses irrespective of biological sex...|$|R
5|$|The {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Paul Due (1835–1919) and his son, Paul Armin Due (1870–1926). Original stations between Stjørdal and Levanger were designed by Paul Due, while those from Rinnan to Byafossen, as well as Hell Station, were designed by Paul Armin Due. The designs are characterized by the transition period between Dragestil and Art Nouveau, with early stations dominated <b>more</b> <b>by</b> the former and later stations <b>more</b> <b>by</b> the latter. Norway went through a nationalistic period during the construction, and Paul Due chose to replace his older buildings' foreign elements with traditional Norwegian elements. Røra and Byafossen were the only stations not custom designed, while Sunnan was designed by Peter Andreas Blix—as it was originally built at Hell in 1881.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes: age, weight loss and the diet itself. First, younger women are likely to {{experience}} menstrual irregularities due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss.

Finally, the cycle is affected <b>more</b> <b>by</b> a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by this Spartan naval resurgence, the Athenians {{sent out}} a fleet of 40 triremes under Thrasybulus. He, judging that he could {{accomplish}} <b>more</b> <b>by</b> campaigning where the Spartan fleet was not than by challenging it directly, sailed to the Hellespont. Once there, he won over several major states to the Athenian side and placed a duty on ships sailing past Byzantium, restoring a source of revenue that the Athenians had relied on in the late Peloponnesian War. He then sailed to Lesbos, where, {{with the support of}} the Mytileneans, he defeated the Spartan forces on the island and won over a number of cities. While still on Lesbos, however, Thrasybulus was killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus.|$|E

5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained <b>more</b> <b>by</b> rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E
5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or <b>more</b> <b>by</b> the end of this century.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, Yeats was 51 {{years old}} and {{determined}} to marry and produce an heir. His rival John MacBride had been executed {{for his role in}} the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry. His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne's history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her life—including chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife and biographer R.F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated <b>more</b> <b>by</b> a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.|$|E
5|$|Climatologically, {{tropical}} cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west {{trade winds}} on the equatorial {{side of the}} subtropical ridge—a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans. In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out. These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region. In contrast, in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, tropical cyclogenesis is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and <b>more</b> <b>by</b> the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough. Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Defender is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling shooting game {{set on the}} surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn <b>more</b> <b>by</b> reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, or hit by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the {{succeeding}} Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised <b>more</b> <b>by</b> parliament and the government. The first Hanoverian monarch, George I, relied on his ministers {{to a greater extent than}} had previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the Coronation Oath, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal domination, and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.|$|E
5|$|Early on May29, Tropical Depression One nearly {{attained}} {{tropical storm}} status, with intensity estimates using the Dvorak Technique reaching T2.5, or 40mph (65km/h); however, the estimates were also {{as low as}} T1.5, leading to {{the intensity of the}} depression remaining at 35mph (55km/h). After a burst in convective activity overnight, shower and thunderstorm activity waned once <b>more</b> <b>by</b> 0700UTC. Situated {{at the edge of the}} Gulf Stream, intensification into a tropical storm was no longer anticipated. Later that morning, the center of circulation became fully exposed by strong wind shear; an approaching trough also began absorbing the small depression by this time. The remaining convection associated with the system was displaced to the southeast. With no convection developing around the depression, it degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area during the afternoon of May29. At 2100UTC, the NHC issued their final advisory on Tropical Depression One. The remnants of the depression persisted until 0600UTC on May30, at which time it was absorbed by a warm front south of Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Emigration to {{the west}} {{decreased}} over the following years, but {{it is likely that}} the drop in numbers was caused <b>more</b> <b>by</b> fears over the outcome of the ongoing Mexican-American War than by the cautionary tale of the Donner Party. In 1846, an estimated 1,500 people migrated to California. In 1847, the number dropped to 450 and to 400 in 1848. The California Gold Rush spurred a sharp increase, however, and 25,000 people went west in 1849. Most of the overland migration followed the Carson River, but a few forty-niners used the same route as the Donner Party and recorded descriptions about the site.|$|E
