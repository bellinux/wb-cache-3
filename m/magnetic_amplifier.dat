Electrical hazards were of great concern in South African gold mines, and Rubin, an engineer at the company C.J. Fuchs Electrical Industries of Alberton Johannesburg, initially developed a cold-cathode system in 1955 which operated at 525 V and had a tripping sensitivity of 250 mA. Prior to this, core balance earth leakage protection systems operated at sensitivities of about 10 A.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Boston, {{the ship was}} extensively examined by the US Navy. Her very large GHG passive sonar array was removed and installed on the submarine [...] for testing. American interest in <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifier</b> technology increased again after findings in investigations of the fire control system of Prinz Eugen. The guns from turret Anton were removed while in Philadelphia in February. On 1 May the German crewmen left the ship and returned to Germany. Thereafter, the American crew had significant difficulties in keeping the ship's propulsion system operational—eleven of her twelve boilers failed after the Germans departed. The ship was then allocated to the fleet of target ships for Operation Crossroads in Bikini Atoll. Operation Crossroads was a major test {{of the effects of}} nuclear weapons on warships of various types. The trouble with Prinz Eugens propulsion system may have influenced the decision to dispose of her in the nuclear tests.|$|E
2500|$|The Shreeve {{mechanical}} repeater and {{the vacuum}} tube {{were the only}} amplifying devices, other than specialized power devices such as the <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifier</b> and amplidyne, for 40 years. [...] Power control circuitry used magnetic amplifiers until {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century when power semiconductor devices became more economical, with higher operating speeds. Shreeve repeaters were used as adjustable amplifiers in telephone subscriber sets for the hearing impaired until the transistor provided smaller and higher quality amplifiers in the 1950s. [...] The replacement of bulky electron tubes with transistors during the 1960s and 1970s created another revolution in electronics, making possible a large class of portable electronic devices, such as the transistor radio developed in 1954. [...] Today, use of vacuum tubes is limited for some high power applications, such as radio transmitters.|$|E

They were important in implementing early autoland systems and Concorde made use of the technology for the control of its engine air intakes before development of a system using digital electronics. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> were used in stabilizer controls of V2 rockets.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifier</b> (colloquially {{known as}} a [...] "mag amp") is an {{electromagnetic}} device for amplifying electrical signals. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifier</b> was invented early in the 20th century, and {{was used as an}} alternative to vacuum tube amplifiers where robustness and high current capacity were required. World War II Germany perfected this type of amplifier, and it was used in the V-2 rocket. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifier</b> was most prominent in power control and low-frequency signal applications from 1947 to about 1957, when the transistor began to supplant it. [...] The <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifier</b> has now been largely superseded by the transistor-based amplifier, except in a few safety critical, high-reliability or extremely demanding applications. Combinations of transistor and mag-amp techniques are still used.|$|E

50|$|Interest in <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> {{lasted only}} a short time through the 1950s. When they were first being studied, {{transistors}} were expensive and unreliable devices, but the introduction of new manufacturing techniques in the late 1950s started to address both of these problems. In spite of their other advantages, <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> quickly disappeared as transistor based logic became increasingly common, and only a few computers based on these systems were produced.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method to}} control the {{inductance}} without any moving parts requires an additional DC current bias winding which controls the permeability of an easily saturable core material. See <b>Magnetic</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E
50|$|One group {{working on}} the <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifier</b> design was Gordon Scarrott's team at Ferranti R&D labs in West Gorton, Manchester.

50|$|The UNIVAC Solid State was a 2-address, decimal computer, with memory on a {{rotating}} drum with 5000 signed 10 digit words, {{aimed at the}} general purpose business market. It came in two versions: the Solid State 80 (IBM-Hollerith 80 column cards) and the Solid State 90 (Remington-Rand 90 column cards). This computer used <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> not transistors, because the transistors then available had highly variable characteristics and were not sufficiently reliable. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> were based on tiny magnetic cores with two wire windings. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> required powerful pulses of heavy current produced by a transmitter-type vacuum-tube, of a type still used in amateur radio final amplifiers. Thus the Solid State depended, {{at the heart of}} its operations, on a vacuum tube.|$|R

50|$|The gain {{available}} {{from a single}} stage is limited and low compared to electronic amplifiers. Frequency response of a high-gain amplifier is limited to about one-tenth the excitation frequency, although this is often mitigated by exciting <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifiers</b> with currents at higher than utility frequency. Solid-state electronic amplifiers can be more compact and efficient than <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> The bias and feedback windings are not unilateral and may couple energy back from the controlled circuit into the control circuit.

50|$|In an {{electric}} power transmission system, a thyristor-controlled reactor (TCR) is a reactance connected in series with a bidirectional thyristor valve. The thyristor valve is phase-controlled, which allows the value of delivered reactive power to be adjusted to meet varying system conditions. Thyristor-controlled reactors {{can be used for}} limiting voltage rises on lightly loaded transmission lines. Another device which used to be used for this purpose is a magnetically controlled reactor (MCR), a type of <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifier</b> otherwise known as a transductor.|$|E
50|$|A {{transductor}} (not to {{be confused}} with a transducer) is type of <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifier</b> used in power systems for compensating reactive power. It consists of an iron-cored inductor with two windings - a main winding through which an alternating current flows from the power system, and a secondary control winding which carries a small direct current. By varying the direct current, the iron core of the transductor can be arranged to saturate at different levels and thus vary the amount of reactive power absorbed.|$|E

50|$|Visually a mag amp device may {{resemble}} a transformer, but {{the operating principle}} {{is quite different from}} a transformer - essentially the mag amp is a saturable reactor. It makes use of magnetic saturation of the core, a non-linear property of a certain class of transformer cores. For controlled saturation characteristics, the <b>magnetic</b> <b>amplifier</b> employs core materials that have been designed to have a specific B-H curve shape that is highly rectangular, in contrast to the slowly tapering B-H curve of softly saturating core materials that are often used in normal transformers.|$|E
5000|$|One such {{system was}} the <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Similar to magnetic core memory, or [...] "cores", magnetic amplifiers used small toroids of ferrite as a switching element.

This field induced a current in a separate read circuit, creating an amplified output of known current. Unlike digital logic based on tubes or transistors, which uses defined voltages to represent values, magnetic amplifiers based their logic values on defined current values.|$|E
