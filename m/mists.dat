40|$|<b>MIST</b> 1 {{is a basic}} helix-loop-helix (bHLH) {{transcription}} factor that is expressed in serous secretory cells of multiple organs. In the pancreas, <b>MIST</b> 1 expression is restricted to pancreatic acinar cells. Mouse <b>Mist</b> 1 null (<b>Mist</b> 1 KO) pancreata consist of acinar cells exhibiting dramatic differentiation defects including hyperproliferation, lack of cell polarity, failure to establish cell-cell junctions and compromised secretory function. Despite extensive characterization of <b>Mist</b> 1 KO mice, the molecular properties of the protein and the mechanisms by which it regulates pancreatic acinar cell differentiation are largely unknown. In this thesis, I dissected the <b>MIST</b> 1 protein {{with the aim of}} identifying the position of its functional motifs that are responsible for transcription activation/repression. <b>MIST</b> 1 and <b>MIST</b> 1 bHLH, a <b>MIST</b> 1 truncation that only contains the central bHLH domains of the protein, were expressed in pancreatic acinar cells of <b>Mist</b> 1 KO mice, and the pancreata of the transgenic mice were studied to compare the activities of <b>MIST</b> 1 and <b>MIST</b> 1 bHLH in rescuing the <b>Mist</b> 1 KO phenotype. Both <b>MIST</b> 1 and <b>MIST</b> 1 bHLH completely restored <b>Mist</b> 1 KO pancreatic acinar cells in all aspects of the <b>Mist</b> 1 KO phenotype, including proliferation control, cellular organization and <b>MIST</b> 1 target gene expression. These results support the contention that all functional motifs necessary for the transcriptional activity of <b>MIST</b> 1 reside within the central bHLH region. To reveal the molecular mechanisms behind the function of <b>MIST</b> 1 in acinar cells, <b>Mist</b> 1 KO pancreatic acinar cells were also examined for structural defects involving organization of their actin cytoskeleton. Expression profiling of the RHO family GTPases, a group of key regulators of cellular actin organization, revealed that <b>MIST</b> 1 regulates expression of Rnd 2, a RHO family GTPase 2 gene. Indeed, <b>MIST</b> 1 binds to the Rnd 2 gene promoter and represses Rnd 2 gene expression in pancreatic acinar cells. Interestingly, RND 2 overexpression correlates with acinar cell de-differentiation caused by various genetic or chemical reagents. Additionally, diminished Rnd 2 expression in pancreatic AR 42 J cells results in suppressed cell proliferation and altered cell morphology. Taken together, I propose that <b>MIST</b> 1 controls pancreatic acinar cell differentiation through its regulation of the Rnd 2 gene. In normal acinar cells, <b>MIST</b> 1 maintains low levels of RND 2. Elevation of Rnd 2 expression upon <b>Mist</b> 1 deletion leads to acinar cell de-differentiation, a condition that primes the exocrine pancreas for acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic cancer. ...|$|R
5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a slight risk of poisoning where <b>mists</b> or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as ethylene glycol causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence. Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E

To appeal to a wider readership, The Firebrand includes fewer elements of fantasy than Bradley's previous works. Her only novel set in ancient Greece, her husband Walter H.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this area is to evaluate and understand the fire suppression behavior of a patented ultra-fine water <b>mist</b> technology with the tradename NanoMist™. NanoMist is a dense gas-like, ultra-fine (< 10 µm) water <b>mist</b> produced at ambient pressure. The <b>mist</b> exhibits superior ability to readily diffuse around obstructions and has a {{potential to be a}} total flooding agent. However, the technology needs research into key issues such as the <b>mist</b> deployment design, the transport behavior of <b>mist</b> within the flooding volume, the optimum conditions for the <b>mist</b> entrainment into the firebase, and the interaction of <b>mist</b> with laminar and turbulent fires.

The origins of the Mérens are very old, and are commonly said to be lost in the <b>mists</b> of time. It is native to the upper valley of Ariege, near Andorra.

5|$|The area {{generally}} has warm summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary {{from day to}} day as well as from season to season. Its latitude means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing unsettled and windy weather particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fine weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. The two dominant influences on the climate of the Whitby area are shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the North York Moors and the proximity of the North Sea. Late, chilly springs and warm summers are a feature of the area but there are often spells of fine autumn weather. Onshore winds in spring and early summer bring <b>mists</b> or low stratus clouds (known locally as sea frets) to the coast and moors.|$|E

5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} breeds either {{alone or in}} small colonies {{averaging}} two to five nests in size, though nearly fifty nests are present at one site. It is monogamous and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate. It is believed to breed cooperatively in Equatorial Guinea, as four different birds were observed feeding one nest. The rockfowl's courtship displays are unknown. The timing of the egg laying in a colony is not synchronized, leading to various stages of development of nestlings within the colony. It {{has been suggested that}} this is to promote cooperative breeding. The laying dates also vary by region, typically coinciding with {{a few weeks before the}} onset of the wet season; in areas where the wet season is bimodal, two different breeding seasons occur. However, in mountainous regions such as Mount Cameroon, it breeds during the dry season to avoid the frequent <b>mists</b> of the wet season. Birds in Nigeria lay their eggs between August and November, birds in Gabon lay between November and April, birds in western Cameroon lay between March and November with peaks of June, July, and October, and birds in southern Cameroon have two breeding seasons, a main one from October to December and a secondary one lasting from April to May. In Equatorial Guinea, nesting occurs in mid-February.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, the {{influence}} of the romance tradition of Arthur continued, through novels such as T. H. White's The Once and Future King (1958) and Marion Zimmer Bradley's The <b>Mists</b> of Avalon (1982) in addition to comic strips such as Prince Valiant (from 1937 onward). Tennyson had reworked the romance tales of Arthur to suit and comment upon the issues of his day, and the same is often the case with modern treatments too. Bradley's tale, for example, takes a feminist approach to Arthur and his legend, in contrast to the narratives of Arthur found in medieval materials, and American authors often rework the story of Arthur to be more consistent with values such as equality and democracy. The romance Arthur has become popular in film and theatre as well. T. H. White's novel was adapted into the Lerner and Loewe stage musical Camelot (1960) and the Disney animated film The Sword in the Stone (1963); Camelot, with its focus on the love of Lancelot and Guinevere and the cuckolding of Arthur, was itself made into a film of the same name in 1967. The romance tradition of Arthur is particularly evident and, according to critics, successfully handled in Robert Bresson's Lancelot du Lac (1974), Eric Rohmer's Perceval le Gallois (1978) and perhaps John Boorman's fantasy film Excalibur (1981); it is also the main source of the material used in the Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975).|$|E
