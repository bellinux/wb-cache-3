5|$|Both Steep Holm and Flat Holm were {{fortified}} in the 1860s as a defence against invasion. They {{form part}} {{of a line of}} defences, known as Palmerston Forts, built across the channel to protect the approaches to Bristol and Cardiff. The island was fortified following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France, where they had been concerned at the strength of the French Navy. The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, under the direction of Lord Palmerston, recommended fortification of the coast, and the island formed part of this strategic coastal defence system. Construction began in 1865 and was completed in 1869 by John Perry of Weston-super-Mare. The work involved the creation of a perimeter road around the summit plateau and a lime kiln for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> mortar to build the barracks and gun emplacements with their ammunition stores.|$|E
25|$|Limestones, {{abundant}} {{in many parts}} of Texas, are used in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Plants for the production of lime are operating in Bexar, Bosque, Burnet, Comal, Deaf Smith, Hill, Johnson, Nueces, and Travis counties.|$|E
25|$|Coal {{deposits}} {{had been}} {{worked in the}} area close to the Fife coast for centuries. Coal had been important in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> and of salt, both of which required huge quantities of coal. Transport of heavy minerals before the era when roads had been properly made was expensive, and most minerals were carried {{on the backs of}} pack horses. The expense of even a short transit hugely increased the cost of the product.|$|E

50|$|During 1894, Hausmann Brothers were coopers in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> fruit, <b>lime</b> {{and flour}} barrels. Their office was located at 508 Highland Street and shops were at 208 Basin Street.|$|R
50|$|Chunaru (চুনারু) is a Bengali Hindu caste whose {{traditional}} occupation is the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> slaked <b>lime</b> {{from the}} shell of snails. After the advent <b>of</b> quick <b>lime</b> from limestone {{and the arrival of}} cement as mortar ingredient, the Chunaru struggled to make a living of their traditional vocation and gradually dwindled in numbers. According to Dr. Maniklal Sinha, there are only about two to three hundred Chunaru families in West Bengal today.|$|R

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{economy is}} based on agriculture, fishing, the raising of livestock, and the hunting of small game. Another source of income is palm-wood artisanry. In the past, the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> oyster-shell <b>lime</b> for mortar was an important economic activity, but the availability of mass-produced building materials has reduced demand {{to the point where}} its production is no longer profitable.|$|R
500|$|Large {{amounts of}} raw {{materials}} were also needed for the work, including stone, timber and lead and many other supplies. Camber, for example, probably required over 500,000 bricks, Sandgate needed 44,000 tiles, while constructing a small blockhouse along the Thames was estimated by contemporaries to require [...] of chalk just to enable the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lime</b> mortar. Some materials could be sourced locally, but coal was shipped from the north of England and prefabricated items were brought in from London.|$|R
50|$|The Mithibai Hormasji Wadia Dispensary {{was built}} by Mr. Bamanji Hormasji Wadia in 1855, and endowed by him with £1200 (Rs. 12,000). It {{was in charge of}} an {{assistant}} surgeon, and, in 1880-81, had an attendance of 7367 out-patients. The salt pans covered an area of about 66 acre and yielded a yearly revenue of £3418 (Rs. 34,180). There was also a considerable <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> shell <b>lime.</b> The Stone quarries of Kurla were well known and supplied material for the construction of most of the city's famous heritage buildings like the Prince of Wales Museum, and the General Post Office among others.|$|R
50|$|Also at Montreal was a lime kiln. Materials for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> were {{extracted}} here. In 1920 {{the ruins}} of two platforms with the remains of stones and ashes could still be seen. Today, taking the road through Montgriffon passing by Colognat {{it is possible to}} clearly discern the place where this industry was practiced.|$|E
50|$|The chalky subsoil allowed, {{as in many}} medieval cities, {{the digging}} {{of a network of}} cellars, tunnels and {{quarries}} under the city. The poor quality of the Cambrai chalk was reserved for use in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> or filling, as well as common constructions. For prestigious buildings, stone from the nearby villages of Noyelles-sur-Escaut, Rumilly or Marcoing was used.|$|E
50|$|Stockton {{has long}} been {{associated}} with the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> and cement. The village is surrounded by areas of blue lias clay, a raw material used in cement manufacture.

50|$|The Totternhoe Stone is {{underlain}} by the argillaceous Chalk Marl. Above is {{the less}} argillaceous Grey Chalk. The bed varies in thickness from 0.5 to 5 metres. The stone, although fine-grained, is siliceous, and partial cementing with silica accounts for its relative hardness. It forms a distinct escarpment at several locations {{at the base}} of the Chiltern ridge, notably at Totternhoe, Bedfordshire , where it is at its thickest. In addition to use as a building stone, in the past it was used in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> a hydraulic <b>lime,</b> and in cement manufacture at three cement plants.|$|R
50|$|Production <b>of</b> {{artificial}} <b>manufactured</b> fertilizer {{for agriculture}} was pioneered by Sir John Lawes at his purpose-built Rothamsted Research facility. In the 1840s he established large works near London for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> superphosphate <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Processes for the vulcanization of rubber were patented by Charles Goodyear in the United States and Thomas Hancock in England in the 1840s. The first synthetic dye {{was discovered by}} William Henry Perkin in London. He partly transformed aniline into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He also developed the first synthetic perfumes. However, it was German industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes. The three major firms BASF, Bayer and Hoechst produced several hundred different dyes, and by 1913, the German industry produced almost 90 {{percent of the world}} supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad. In the United States, Herbert Henry Dow's use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from brine was a commercial success that helped to promote the country's chemical industry.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Effect {{of various}} {{additives}} on hydration <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> {{has been carried}} out. Lime which is formed by the calcining <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> stone (CaCO 3) at 1000 oC is of great importance. As, it is used in laboratory as reagent, in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> bleaching powder, glass & steel making, in agriculture as source of calcium and in water treatment, neutralization of soil acidity etc. More than 72 % <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> stone {{is used in the}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> cement. Though free lime does not found in properly made Portland cement (generally found in its hydrated form) but it {{plays an important role in}} the setting of cement. Sometimes fast reactivity <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> decreases the strength of set cement due to false setting. By adding certain chemicals (retarders), the hydration <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> can be slowed down and it may help in overall increase in setting time as well as strength of set cement. Various additives –called retarders- are added to inhibit the setting of cement such as gypsum, sucrose etc...|$|R
50|$|Besides {{being used}} for building, hamstone was also burnt locally in small kilns for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> This was {{predominantly}} for local use as fertiliser. Some {{was used for the}} manufacture of builders mortar and limewash render, but the results were of poor quality due to the iron content of the stone. Mortar made from hamstone invariably failed, often washing away, while limewash would blister and bubble, eventually falling from the wall. At least two lime kilns still exist: one close to the abandoned medieval hamlet of Witcombe, with another close to Norton Quarry.|$|E

50|$|The geology of the Matlock area is {{extremely}} complex. Broadly speaking, the Derwent valley bottom forms a {{boundary between the}} sandstones and gritstones to the NE and the limestones to the SW. There are igneous intrusions into the limestones to the SW. This geology has been exploited by the quarrying and mining industries. The sandstones and gritstones have been quarried as building materials (e.g. at Bentley Brook Quarries) and the limestones for building materials and the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> (e.g. at Harvey Dale Quarries). The igneous intrusions gave rise to valuable minerals which have been mined (e.g. in the Bonsall area), particularly for lead. A very rare lead halide mineral called Matlockite was first discovered at nearby Bage Mine in the early 1800s, and is named after the town.|$|E

Shipbuilding, ice harvesting and the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> were important early industries. In 1817, 300 casks of lime were sent to Washington, DC for use building the United States Capitol, which had been damaged by the British during the War of 1812. In 1852, the citizens of Goose River voted to change their village's name to Rockport for its rocky terrain. On February 25, 1891, Rockport officially split from Camden because of a dispute over the cost of constructing a bridge. The town of Rockport was born and from Camden it took half the population, {{three quarters of the}} land, and most importantly the profitable lime and ice industries.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCompressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEBs) are {{manufactured}} using stabilizers {{to provide adequate}} compressive strength and durability, so, as to make them suitable as building blocks. Though cement is a popular stabilizer used in <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> CSEBs, no study has been reported utilizing <b>lime</b> in combination <b>of</b> cement. This experimental study on CSEBs prepared using lime as a replacement to cement in certain proportions has clearly brought out the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> with cement in improving the long-term build-up of strength better than using cement alone. It was observed that blocks prepared with optimum quantity <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> along with cement has led to continuous buildup of strength even beyond 2 years, whereas blocks prepared with cement alone and lesser quantity <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> than optimum quantity have not gained much strength after 6 months {{from the time of}} preparation of the blocks. The research findings show a need to relook at the grading of ingredients and quantity of stabilizers for achieving good building blocks.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the materials and}} traditional knowledge used in the <b>manufacture</b> and application <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> mortars and stuccoes by Romans and Arabs in Seville (southern Iberian Peninsula). All of the samples studied contain calcite as a binder, combined with aggregates based on river sand from the filling materials of the Guadalquivir River's depression, located {{in the vicinity of}} the Real Alcazar Palace in Seville, Spain, where the artefacts were discovered. The Romans used high-quality production technology, as evidenced by the careful selection of raw materials as well as by the adequate binder-to-aggregate ratio and the elevated homogeneity of the mortars and stuccoes. The suitable distribution of aggregates resulted in higher density values for Roman fragments than for Arabic ones. Results derived from Arabic samples suggest a decline in technology manufacture over time. This work provides useful information, particularly regarding the Roman and Arabic periods in the Iberian Peninsula. The analytical techniques employed in this study were X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) -using conventional and portable systems, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), petrographic microscopy, differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetry (DTA/TG), particle-size analysis and mercury intrusion porosimetry. © 2013 University of Oxford.
