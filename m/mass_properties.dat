25|$|Once in place, {{concrete}} offers great {{energy efficiency}} over {{the lifetime of}} a building. Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames. Air leakage accounts for {{a large percentage of}} energy loss from a home. The thermal <b>mass</b> <b>properties</b> of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs. While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or rastra that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.|$|E

[...] By restricting the lens sample of a galaxy-galaxy lensing study to lie at only one particular redshift, it is possible to understand the <b>mass</b> <b>properties</b> of the field galaxies that existed during this earlier time. [...] Comparing the results of several such redshift-restricted lensing studies (with each study encompassing a different redshift), one can begin to observe changes in the mass features of galaxies {{over a period of several}} epochs, leading towards a better understanding of the evolution of mass on the smallest cosmological scales.|$|E

40|$|A {{scanning}} mirror assembly {{which is part}} of a Synchronous Orbit Meteorological Satellite is an example where mission objectives required measurement and control of weight, mass center, principal moments of inertia, and products of inertia. The {{scanning mirror}} oscillates within the spin stabilized spacecraft, and both the scanning motor torque and perturbation of spacecraft attitude and spin rate have to be reduced to low levels. A theoretically ideal solution would be to make the mirror inertia constant about all axes in a plane perpendicular to the oscillation axis. A practically attainable compromise is to locate principal axes preferentially and make the difference between two of them acceptably small. Methods for making the necessary <b>mass</b> <b>property</b> measurements and deriving and applying minimum weight ballast correction to achieve the necessary mass distribution are discussed. It is noted that <b>mass</b> <b>property</b> control operations are typically subject to practical constraints such as geometry and functional operation of the system and capability of available measurement facilities and fixtures...|$|R

To achieve the precise <b>mass</b> <b>property</b> control, the centroids of both the shell and the center body must coincide {{with each other and}} with the center of pressure of the shell. Precise spin balancing is needed for launch and orbital stability, and the deployable antennas need accurate alignment. Corrective measures, developed after the preliminary mass measurements showed flaws in the <b>mass</b> <b>property</b> control, are described in detail. Inertia booms and a yo-yo despin system were developed as add-on units, spin balance measurements about all three geometric axes were used to define weight minimized correction within the outer shell envelope, and boom tip mass differentials were optimized for the most favorable inertia ratio margin achievable within the mission weight constraints. The weight versus orbital lifetime trade-offs were also considered...|$|R

40|$|Reconfiguration is an {{important}} characteristic in furthering on-orbit servicing, assembly, and operations. Previous work has focused on large assemblers manipulating small payloads, where {{the dynamics of the}} assembler is not significantly changed. This work seeks to identify the impact of reconfiguration on maneuver performance. Reconfiguration is considered in two categories: implementation and application. Implementation of reconfiguration consisted of developing a method for defining and updating a configuration, implementation on the SPHERES testbed, and execution of tests (in simulation and on the International Space Station) to assess the control performance improvement after reconfiguration. Four applications were considered in this work, two hardware applications and two systems applications modeled through simulation. The objective of the SWARM application was to demonstrate autonomous assembly capability through docking and undocking maneuvers. The objective of the SIFFT application was to demonstrate formation reconfiguration capability, through the expansion and rotation of an equilateral triangle of three satellites. The objective of the systems applications was to determine the impact of re-configuration in a larger mission context. (cont.) One application, <b>Mass</b> <b>Property</b> Update, considered how the choice of method for obtaining the <b>mass</b> <b>property</b> information impacts operations. The other application, Modularity Analysis, considered how the implementation of modularity is driven by the mission objectives. Overall, this work has served to demonstrate the control impact of reconfiguration though implementation on the SPHERES testbed. This implementation was used on two hardware applications to determine the performance of reconfiguration for assembly and formation reconfiguration missions. Also, the impact of reconfiguration has been studied in the broader systems context. The choice of method of <b>mass</b> <b>property</b> update was demonstrated {{to have an impact on}} operations, in terms of reliability and mass. Finally, the method incorporation of modularity for purposes of on-orbit servicing and assembly was demonstrated to be driven by mission design parameters. by Swati Mohan. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In cheese technology, {{the mass}} {{transfer}} of small solutes, such as salt, moisture and metabolites during brining and ripening, {{is very important}} for the final quality of the cheese. This paper has the following objectives: (i) to review the data concerning the diffusion coefficients of solutes in different cheese types; (ii) to review the experimental methods available to model the <b>mass</b> transfer <b>properties</b> of small solutes in complex matrices such as cheese; and (iii) to consider some potential alternative approaches. Numerous studies have reported the transfer of salt in cheese during brining and ripening. Regardless of the type of cheese and its composition, the effective diffusion coefficients of salt have been reported to be between 1 and 5. 3 × 10 − 10 m 2 ·s− 1 at 10 – 15 °C. However, few papers have dealt with the <b>mass</b> transfer <b>properties</b> of other small solutes in cheese. Most of the reported effective diffusion coefficient values have been obtained by macroscopic and destructive concentration profile methods. More recently, some other promising techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetic resonance imaging or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, are currently being developed to measure the <b>mass</b> transfer <b>properties</b> of solutes in heterogeneous media at microscopic scales. However, these methods are still difficult to apply to complex matrices such as cheese. Further research needs to focus on: (i) the development of nondestructive techniques to determine the <b>mass</b> transfer <b>properties</b> of small solutes at a microscopic level in complex matrices such as cheese; and (ii) the determination of the <b>mass</b> transfer <b>properties</b> of metabolites that are involved in enzymatic reactions during cheese ripening...|$|R
