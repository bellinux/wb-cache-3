5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} cause {{in terms of}} ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. The endowment effect has found that people ascribe more value to things <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect {{is just one example}} of a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E
5|$|The Augustan History (Latin: Historia Augusta) is a late Roman {{collection}} of biographies, written in Latin, of the Roman Emperors, their junior colleagues, designated heirs and usurpers {{of the period}} 117 to 284. Supposedly modeled on the similar work of Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, it presents itself as a compilation of works by six different authors (collectively known as the Scriptores Historiae Augustae), written during the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine I and addressed to those emperors or other important personages in Rome. The collection, as extant, comprises thirty biographies, most of which contain {{the life of a}} single emperor, while some include a group of two or more, grouped together <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> these emperors were either similar or contemporaneous.|$|E
5|$|In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, {{ex parte}} Lain (1967), {{it was held}} that {{the powers of the}} Board were in {{principle}} reviewable, despite it having been established under prerogative powers. This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case, which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of prerogative powers in the United Kingdom. In this case, their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from the common law (or the prerogative) rather than a statutory source. It was the subject-matter that counted, not the source. In this case, the Government, through an order in council, banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. The House of Lords held that this exercise of the prerogative was judicially reviewable, and the trade unions had a legitimate expectation of prior consultation before the ban was imposed. However, although the failure to consult the unions was unfair, this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not justiciable.|$|E

5|$|The {{virtues of}} slate as a {{building}} and roofing material {{have been recognized}} since the Roman period. The Roman fort at Segontium, Caernarfon, was originally roofed with tiles, but the later levels contain numerous slates, used for both roofing and flooring. The nearest deposits are about five miles (8km) away in the Cilgwyn area, indicating that the slates were not used <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> they were available on-site. During the mediaeval period, there was small-scale quarrying of slate in several areas. The Cilgwyn quarry in the Nantlle Valley dates from the 12th century, and {{is thought to be}} the oldest in Wales. The first record of slate quarrying in the neighbourhood of the later Penrhyn Quarry was in 1413, when a rent-roll of Gwilym ap Griffith records that several of his tenants were paid 10 pence each for working 5,000 slates. Aberllefenni Slate Quarry may have started operating as a slate mine as early as the 14th century. The earliest confirmed date of operating dates from the early 16th century when the local house Plas Aberllefenni was roofed in slates from this quarry.|$|E
5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after a pitch is not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never {{considered to be an}} error. If a pitch is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, a pitch is not a wild pitch <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher {{should have been able to}} control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the advance.|$|E

50|$|In the 2005 {{feature film}} The Dukes of Hazzard, Daisy Duke is portrayed by Jessica Simpson. Film critics commended Simpson on her performance, but claimed that her {{portrayal}} had {{little in common}} with the character Catherine Bach created, and that she was <b>merely</b> cast <b>because</b> of her celebrity status.|$|R
50|$|In virology, eggs of {{domestic}} poultry {{are used for}} culturing viruses for research purposes. Viruses generally can propagate only in live cells, so only a fertilised egg with a good supply of growing embryonic tissue is useful. Practitioners call such an egg embryonated, as opposed to <b>merely</b> fertilised, <b>because</b> they're referring to an advanced stage of development, not merely after fertilisation.|$|R

Garrett also helps to rescue Basso's betrothed Jeneviere from indentured servitude in the first mission of Thief II: The Metal Age.|$|R
25|$|A {{disease or}} {{condition}} {{is not a}} pandemic <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> it is widespread or kills many people; {{it must also be}} infectious. For instance, cancer is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious.|$|E
25|$|Henceforward, it will {{be found}} that the Royalist foot, now a {{thoroughly}} professional force, is superior in quality to the once superb cavalry, and not <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> its opportunities for plunder, etc. are more limited. Materially, however, the immediate victory was undeniably with the Royalists. After {{a brief period of}} manoeuvre, the Parliamentary army, now far from Plymouth, found itself surrounded and starving at Lostwithiel, on the Fowey river, without hope of assistance.|$|E
25|$|Donnelly {{was chosen}} to fight Pembrokeshire for the Labour Party in the 1950 general election, which a good Labour {{candidate}} had narrowly failed to win in 1945 and where the sitting Member, Gwilym Lloyd George, was very popular, not <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> {{he was the son}} of David Lloyd George. Despite the general trend away from the Labour Party, Donnelly beat Lloyd George by playing on the fact that he was supporting the Conservatives, and won the seat by 129 votes.|$|E

25|$|Reviewer Dale Arnold of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society {{suggests}} that magic has real political and societal {{impact in the}} Emberverse, {{whether or not it}} is actually the result of supernatural force or <b>merely</b> religious delusions, <b>because</b> the characters act as if it were real.|$|R
25|$|In the Judgement, Supreme {{court of}} India in 2004, said that {{teaching}} of 'Jyotir Vigyan' can {{under no circumstances}} be equated with teaching of any particular religion. Court further {{said that it was}} for the pupil concerned to select any particular field or subject in furtherance of his future career, and <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> the subject has got its basis or origin traceable to some cult, it cannot be held that the same would only result in propagation of a particular religion.|$|E
25|$|The mere-exposure {{effect is}} a {{psychological}} phenomenon by which people tend to develop a preference for things <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> they are familiar with them. In social psychology, this effect is sometimes called the familiarity principle. The effect has been demonstrated with many kinds of things, including words, Chinese characters, paintings, pictures of faces, geometric figures, and sounds. In studies of interpersonal attraction, the more often a person is seen by someone, the more pleasing and likeable that person appears to be.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, Alfred Austin, {{a future}} Poet Laureate, {{referred}} to 'Skittles' by name in The Season: a Satire, his poem satirising mid-Victorian social mores. He described her dramatic appearance in Rotten Row, and the covert and jealous interest society ladies felt for her. He {{also suggested that}} Skittles and other celebrity prostitutes were attractive not <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> they offered sex, but because they were more natural, less repressed and less boring than the well-bred girls who came to London for the marriage 'season'.|$|E
60|$|It {{might seem}} that those modulations of sound carry some {{connection}} {{with the nature of}} the things they represent, and are not <b>merely</b> arbitrary; <b>because</b> the natural cries of all animals, even of those animals with whom we have not been acquainted, never fail to make themselves sufficiently understood; this cannot be said of language. The modifications of sound, which may be productive of the sublime, are almost infinite. Those I have mentioned are only a few instances to show on what principles they are all built.|$|R

His performance as a Minister of Defense during the Second Lebanon War was deemed to be poor by the public, which led to an early elections for the Labor Party leadership. He was defeated by former Labor Party chairman and former Prime Minister Ehud Barak and chose to resign from his post.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} argument, Drake argued that, like American courts {{had done in}} similar cases, the High Court should look to the {{substantive}} effect of the Tasmanian legislation in considering whether it interfered with an exclusive power of the federal parliament. Justice O'Connor asked Drake whether his argument applied to D'Emden because he was {{an officer of the}} Department, or <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> he had performed services for the Department, and Drake responded that his reasoning was not based on the person but {{on the fact that the}} salary receipt was a departmental record.|$|E
25|$|Aerotel's patent {{was found}} to relate to a {{patentable}} invention in principle because {{the system as a}} whole was new in itself, not <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> it is to be used for the business of selling phone calls. While this system could be implemented using conventional computers, the key to it was a new physical combination of hardware. The judge felt that this was clearly more than just a method of doing business as such. The method claims were construed as relating to a use of the new system and were also deemed to relate to a patentable invention in principle. The additional questions of whether the claimed invention was novel and involved an inventive step were not considered directly by the judge, although the implication is that the invention was at least novel.|$|E

50|$|A {{time series}} {{database}} is a software {{system that is}} optimized for the handling of data organized by time. Time series are finite or infinite sequences of data items, where each item has an associated timestamp and the sequence of timestamps is non-decreasing. Elements of a time series are often called ticks. The timestamps {{are not required to}} be ascending (<b>merely</b> non-decreasing) <b>because</b> in practice the time resolution of some systems such as financial data sources can be quite low (milliseconds, microseconds or even nanoseconds), so consecutive events may carry equal timestamps.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the works}} of Aristotle the terms energeia and entelecheia, often {{translated}} as actuality, differ from what is <b>merely</b> actual <b>because</b> they specifically presuppose that all things have a proper kind of activity or work which, if achieved, would be their proper end. Greek for end in this sense is telos, a component word in entelecheia (a work that is the proper end of a thing) and also teleology. This is an aspect of Aristotle's theory of four causes and specifically of formal cause (eidos, which Aristotle says is energeia) and final cause (telos).|$|R
25|$|The mere-exposure effect {{exists in}} most areas of human {{decision}} making. For example, many stock traders tend to invest in securities of domestic companies <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> they are more familiar with them {{despite the fact that}} international markets offer similar or even better alternatives. The mere-exposure effect also distorts the results of journal ranking surveys; those academics who previously published or completed reviews for a particular academic journal rate it dramatically higher than those who did not. There are mixed results {{on the question of whether}} mere exposure can promote good relations between different social groups. When groups already have negative attitudes to each other, further exposure can increase hostility. A statistical analysis of voting patterns found that a candidate's exposure has a strong effect on the number of votes they receive, distinct from the popularity of the policies.|$|E
25|$|Here Strabo {{launches}} another quibble. Hipparchus, {{relying on}} Pytheas, according to Strabo, places this area south of Britain, but he, Strabo, calculates {{that it is}} north of Ierne. Pytheas, however, rightly knows what is now Scotland as part of Britain, land of the Picts, even though north of Ierne. North of southern Scotland the longest day is 19 hours. Strabo, based on theory alone, states that Ierne is so cold that any lands north of it must be uninhabited. In the hindsight given to moderns Pytheas, in relying on observation in the field, appears more scientific than Strabo, who discounted the findings of others <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> of their strangeness to him. The ultimate cause of his skepticism is simply {{that he did not}} believe Scandinavia could exist. This disbelief may also be the cause of alteration of Pytheas' data.|$|E
25|$|The writ of coram nobis {{does not}} lie to correct any error in the {{judgment}} of the court nor to contradict or put in issue any fact directly passed upon and affirmed by the judgment itself. If this could be, there would be no end of litigation. The writ of coram nobis is not intended to authorize any court to review and revise its opinions; but only to enable it to recall some adjudication made while some fact existed which, if before the court, would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; and which without fault or negligence of the party, was not presented to the court. It is not a writ whereby convicts may attack or relitigate just any judgment on a criminal charge <b>merely</b> <b>because</b> the unfortunate person may become displeased with his confinement or with any other result of the judgment under attack.|$|E
5000|$|In fact, the rabbis were so insistent on {{the bride}} having the [...] "benefit of the ketubah" [...] that some even {{described}} a marriage without one as being <b>merely</b> concubinage, <b>because</b> the bride would lack {{the benefit of}} the financial settlement in case of divorce or death of the husband, and without the dower or ketubah amount the woman and her children could become a burden on the community. However, the husband could refuse to pay the ketubah amount if a divorce was on account of adultery of the wife.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{these various}} cues, only convergence, {{accommodation}} and familiar size provide absolute distance information. All other cues are relative (i.e., {{they can only}} be used to tell which objects are closer relative to others). Stereopsis is <b>merely</b> relative <b>because</b> {{a greater or lesser}} disparity for nearby objects could either mean that those objects differ more or less substantially in relative depth or that the foveated object is nearer or further away (the further away a scene is, the smaller is the retinal disparity indicating the same depth difference.) ...|$|R
