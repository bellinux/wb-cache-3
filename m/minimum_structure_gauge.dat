50|$|Narrow-gauge {{railways}} {{often have}} a significantly smaller <b>structure</b> <b>gauge,</b> and therefore the rolling stock used has a smaller loading gauge in both height and width. Conversion to a wider track gauge will often require enlargement of the <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> on bridges, under road overpasses and in tunnels. Embankments and cuts could need widening as well.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} between the <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> and the loading gauge is called the [...] "clearance". The amount of clearance between the loading <b>gauge</b> and the <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> depends on {{the speed of the}} train, due to the train wobbling, so a train {{may be able to get}} past a restricted clearance by travelling at slow speed.|$|R

50|$|The <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> S {{requires}} {{buildings to}} be placed at minimum of 3100 mm from the track centreline. Bridges and tunnels must have a clearance of at least 4900 mm wide and 6400 mm high. The <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> Sp for passenger platforms allows 4900 mm only above 1100 mm (the common platform height) requiring a width of 3840 mm below that line.|$|R

50|$|The <b>structure</b> <b>gauge,</b> {{which refers}} to the {{dimensions}} of the lowest and narrowest bridges or tunnels of the track, complements the loading gauge, which specifies the tallest and widest allowable vehicle dimensions. There is a gap between the <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> and loading gauge, and some allowance needs to be made for the dynamic movement of vehicles (sway) to avoid mechanical interference causing equipment and structural damage.|$|R

50|$|The Department for Transport {{report on}} High Speed Rail {{published}} in March 2010 sets out the specifications for a high-speed line. It {{will be built}} to a European <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> (as was HS1) and will conform to European Union technical standards for interoperability for high-speed rail (EU Directive 96/48/EC). HS2 Ltd's report assumed a GC <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> for passenger capacity estimations, with a maximum design speed of 250 mph. Initially, trains would run at a maximum speed of 225 mph.|$|R
50|$|The terms <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> and {{loading gauge}} have little {{connection}} with track gauge. They are both widely used, but imprecise, terms. <b>Structure</b> <b>gauge</b> describes the cross-section envelope into which new or altered structures (bridges, lineside equipment etc.) must not encroach. Loading gauge is the corresponding cross-sectional profile within which rail vehicles and their loads must be contained. If an exceptional load {{or a new}} type of vehicle is being assessed to run, it must conform to the route's loading gauge.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{provides}} methodologies {{for determining}} railway <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> and distance between track centres. The first part provides information about reference profile, which is base for determining <b>structure</b> <b>gauge.</b> This {{is followed by}} description {{of different types of}} gauges, related to railway transport. The thesis also presents separation of railways according to number of tracks. The second part is based on Slovenian standard SIST EN 15273 - 3 : 2013. It describes methods for determining <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> including all presented widenings (additional overthrows, quasi static effect and random transverse phenomena). In accordance with same standard there are presented methods for determining distance between track centres. The last part of the thesis discusses differences between standard and UIC code 505 - 4 OR. Calculation examples of different railway gauges and distances between track centres are also included...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a numerical investigation into the strength of <b>minimum</b> <b>structure</b> platforms subject to a ship impact. The study has identified important design issues that should be addressed in order to improve the survivability and continued serviceability of <b>minimum</b> <b>structures</b> after a ship impact. It was found that, {{due to a lack of}} research effort, design guidelines governing ship impact on <b>minimum</b> <b>structures</b> are lacking in comparison with conventional jacket platforms. In particular, requirements governing the minimum amount of plastic energy absorption in <b>minimum</b> <b>structures</b> are not clearly defined. Ship impact analyses were therefore carried out in order to compare their structural integrity with that for a jacket under ship collision conditions and to evaluate the effects on their ultimate strength. The study not only established any degradation of,system strength, but has also determined the amount of plastic energy absorption under various impact scenarios...|$|R
50|$|The {{loading gauge}} limits {{the size of}} {{passenger}} carriages, goods wagons (freight cars) and shipping containers that can be conveyed on a section of railway line and varies across the world and often within a single railway system. Over time {{there has been a}} trend towards larger loading gauges and more standardization of gauges with older lines having their <b>structure</b> <b>gauges</b> enhanced by raising bridges, increasing the height of tunnels and making other necessary alterations. Containerisation and a trend towards larger shipping containers has led rail companies to increase <b>structure</b> <b>gauges</b> to compete effectively with road haulage.|$|R

It is shown that this action does not depend on the hamiltonian <b>gauge</b> <b>structure</b> functions of higher orders. A method for finding the lagrangian <b>gauge</b> <b>structure</b> tensors of all orders is presented. It is proven that the lagrangian <b>gauge</b> <b>structure</b> tensors do not depend on the hamiltonian <b>gauge</b> <b>structure</b> functions of second- or higher-orders...|$|R

50|$|While {{track gauge}} {{is the most}} {{important}} factor preventing through running between adjacent systems, other issues can also be a hindrance, including <b>structure</b> <b>gauge,</b> loading gauge, axleloads, couplings, brakes, electrification systems, signalling systems, multiple unit controls, rules and regulations, driver certification, righthand or lefthand running, repairs (how to make and pay for repairs while rolling stock is on other railway's territory) and language. The <b>structure</b> <b>gauge,</b> loading gauge and axleload problems are solved by simply using the smaller options for through running. The general solution is often to custom-build vehicles to fit all the standards to be encountered. Trains can be built to accept four voltages, to have dual signaling systems equipment, etc. All of these solutions however usually result in either more expensive trains or less comfort for passengers (e.g. through less room inside the train if it has a smaller loading gauge) or - in the case of freight railways - less room for cargo, making double stacking impossible or other negative effects.|$|R

2500|$|Most {{passenger}} rail {{lines in the}} Northeast have a loading gauge that can only accommodate cars [...] or less in height; {{this is due to}} <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> restrictions such as bridges and tunnels that are too low, and may also have electrified lines overhead.|$|R

The small <b>structure</b> <b>gauges</b> and {{consequently}} small loading gauges on British railways mean that double stacking {{is not possible}} and that well cars are required {{to be able to}} transport 9 ft high intermodal containers on routes where the loading gauge is W9 or smaller.|$|R
50|$|Railways {{have greater}} or lesser {{interoperability}} depending on conforming to standards of gauge, couplings, brakes, signalling, communications, loading <b>gauge,</b> <b>structure</b> <b>gauge,</b> and operating rules, to mention a few parameters. For passenger rail service, different railway platform height and width clearance standards may also cause interoperability problems.|$|R

5000|$|The {{main problem}} with a train on tram rails is the {{relatively}} narrow width of frog and switch gaps and channels of the groove rails designed to accommodate the narrow flanges of tram wheels [...] The wider flanges of train wheels {{increase the risk of}} derailment at these points. On routes where train carriages are driven on tram tracks (as in the past in parts of The Hague), wider grooves are required as a compromise that is practical as wide grooved girder rail is available. A larger <b>structure</b> <b>gauge</b> would also be required This was also done in Los Angeles and in Vancouver as well as elsewhere in North America. The usually or normally limited <b>structure</b> <b>gauge,</b> and tight curves, on tram tracks will also prevent trains from using tram tracks.|$|R
