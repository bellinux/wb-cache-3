2500|$|Nevertheless, {{many analysts}} said the {{judgment}} might prove a fatal blow to Zuma, although factional battles within the ANC {{would be the}} ultimate decider. One suggested that powerful ANC members had lost faith in Zuma and might move to oust him at a more opportune moment. The South African Communist Party, part of Zuma's own Tripartite Alliance, had been skeptical about the adequacy of his response to the judgment. Some ANC members booed Zuma at his next subsequent appearance. And several prominent members of civil society and former ANC insiders, including Ahmed Kathrada, Ronnie Kasrils, Trevor Manuel, Cheryl Carolus, and retired Constitutional Court judge Zak Yacoob, called for Zuma's resignation, prompting a backlash from certain Zuma allies. The South African Council of Churches did the same, saying Zuma had [...] "lost all moral authority". The Gauteng ANC, led by noted Zuma critic Paul Mashatile, formally resolved that Zuma must resign; doubts were raised about Zuma's leadership even within his traditional strongholds like the ANC's Limpopo branches; and an internal ANC memorandum sent by party veterans to the Top Six allegedly demanded Zuma's recall and compared him to detested apartheid-era President P. W. Botha. Finally, members of the Gupta family, thought to be Zuma's long-standing allies and crucial financial backers, resigned from their <b>major</b> <b>holding</b> company and fled South Africa for Dubai in the week after the judgment – leaving Zuma, {{in the opinion of}} some analysts, extremely vulnerable. In the wake of these developments, Malema said it was now time to [...] "crush the head of the snake". On 12 April 2016, Max du Preez said the key question, [...] "now that the balance of power has turned irrevocably against Zuma", was how to ensure he makes a managed – and non-violent – exit.|$|E

50|$|Under the {{jurisdiction}} of the <b>Major</b> <b>Holds</b> are Minor Holds. These can range widely in size, but operate not unlike a <b>Major</b> <b>Hold</b> on a smaller scale. Despite the name, some of the larger Minor Holds may approach the population of a <b>Major</b> <b>Hold's</b> urban center. Nonetheless, they are subject to the <b>Major</b> <b>Hold</b> of which they are a part and to which they tithe. Minor Holds are managed by a Holder, not a Lord. In many cases, however, a Lord Holder will install his son as Holder at a Minor Hold; the son retains the hereditary title of Lord.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} types of <b>Hold.</b> <b>Major</b> <b>Holds</b> are {{the largest and most}} {{politically}} powerful.

When referring to a <b>Major</b> <b>Hold,</b> a speaker might mean either this entire region or only the urban center.|$|R
50|$|Minor Holds {{are always}} beholden to a <b>Major</b> <b>Hold,</b> and tithe {{to them in}} return for {{protection}} from Thread and other dangers. They are run by a person who bears the title of Holder, and are home to smaller numbers of people than <b>Major</b> <b>Holds.</b>|$|R

Now, this little business of yours is-- well, we'll say unusual, and if what I do seems a little unusual too, it's to be excused. Ye can't throw stones at every one, me boy, and then be surprised when some one throws one at you. You bite the diamond holders, d'ye see, and I take a little nibble at you.
