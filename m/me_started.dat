500|$|The {{mass media}} has often speculated about a romantic {{relationship}} between Vidya and her co-actors, but she has strongly denied these reports. In 2009, Vidya {{was involved in a}} controversy when she mentioned a previous relationship in which [...] "caustic remarks" [...] were made at her due to her weight. She said, [...] "If someone who matters to you takes you down, it can break you. That someone whose approval mattered to <b>me</b> <b>started</b> to constantly find faults with me. At that point of time, it was important to walk away from that relationship." [...] Though she refused to name the person, tabloid reports suggested that she was referring to Shahid Kapoor (her co-star in Kismat Konnection). Kapoor, however, denied the allegations. During an interview in May 2012, Vidya announced that she was dating Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures. On 14 December 2012, the couple were married in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai.|$|E
500|$|Metallica's Lars Ulrich, who, {{along with}} bandmate James Hetfield {{inducted}} Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, said [...] "Black Sabbath is {{and always will}} be synonymous with heavy metal", while Hetfield said [...] "Sabbath got <b>me</b> <b>started</b> on all that evil-sounding shit, and it's stuck with me. Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." [...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said [...] "I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{recording}} {{her debut}} studio album in 2005, Rihanna met Ne-Yo {{for the first}} time, {{but they could not}} collaborate on the album. She wanted to work with him since she heard [...] "Let Me Love You" [...] (2004) by Mario, which Ne-Yo wrote. When the production for A Girl like <b>Me</b> <b>started,</b> she considered working with him. She said, [...] "So for the second album, I was like, 'You know what? I have to work with that guy Ne-Yo.' So we went into the studio and we started working on this song." [...] Ne-Yo and Norwegian production duo Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen collectively known as StarGate wrote [...] "Unfaithful", which Rihanna said was [...] "new ground for [...] " [...] because it was a ballad. It was produced by StarGate while Debbie Mounsey served as a production assistant. [...] "Unfaithful" [...] was recorded by Eriksen, Al Hemberger, Malcolm Pollack and Tiger Stylz at Battery and Avatar Studios in New York City, Loft Recording Studios in Bronxville and Digital Insight Recording Studios in Las Vegas. It was mixed by Phil Tan and Makeba Riddick provided the vocal production.|$|E

2500|$|A {{child of}} Russian-Jewish immigrants, Magdoff {{grew up in}} the Bronx. [...] In 1929, at age 15, Magdoff first started reading Karl Marx when he picked up a copy of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy in a used-book store.

60|$|As {{the natives}} {{had at last}} consented to his going, it might have been, that some of them, at least, really counted upon his speedy return; {{probably}} supposing, as indeed he had told {{them when they were}} coming down the valley, that his only object in leaving them was to procure the medicines I needed. This, Jimmy also must have told them. And as they had done before, when my comrade, to oblige <b>me,</b> <b>started</b> on his perilous journey to Nukuheva, they looked upon me, in his absence, as one of two inseparable friends who was a sure guarantee for the other’s return. This is only my own supposition, however, for as to all their strange conduct, it is still a mystery.|$|E
6000|$|The sounds {{grew louder}} and nearer, and {{gradually}} the whole valley rang with wild outcries. The sleepers around <b>me</b> <b>started</b> {{to their feet}} in alarm, and hurried outside to discover {{the cause of the}} commotion. Kory-Kory, who had been the first to spring up, soon returned almost breathless, and nearly frantic with the excitement under which he seemed to be labouring. All that I could understand from him was, that some accident had happened to Toby. Apprehensive of some dreadful calamity, I rushed out of the house, and caught sight of a tumultuous crowd, who, with shrieks and lamentations, were just emerging from the grove, bearing in their arms some object, the sight of which produced all this transport of sorrow. As they drew near, the men redoubled their cries, while the girls, tossing their bare arms in the air, exclaimed plaintively, “Awha! awha! Toby muckee moee!”—Alas! alas! Toby is killed! ...|$|E

60|$|He then lassoed the cow, and I {{captured}} the calf, and lifting {{it into the}} saddle before <b>me,</b> <b>started</b> homewards. The cow followed me at a furious pace, and behind came Claro at a swinging gallop. Possibly {{he was a little}} too confident, and carelessly let his captive pull the line that held her; anyhow, she turned suddenly on him, charged with amazing fury, and sent one of her horrid horns deep into the belly of his horse. He was, however, equal to the occasion, first dealing her a smart blow on the nose, which made her recoil for a moment; he then severed the lasso with his knife, and, shouting to me to drop the calf, made his escape. We pulled up as soon as we had reached a safe distance, Claro drily remarking that the lasso had been borrowed, and that the horse belonged to the estancia, so that we had lost nothing. He alighted, and stitched up the great gash in the poor brute's belly, using for a thread a few hairs plucked from its tail. It was a difficult task, or would have been so to me, as he had to bore holes in the animal's hide with his knife-point, but it seemed quite easy to him. Taking the remaining portion of the severed lasso, he drew it round the hind and one of the fore feet of his horse, and threw him to the ground with a dexterous jerk; then, binding him there, performed the operations of sewing up the wound in about two minutes.|$|E
60|$|I was reposing {{upon the}} mats, within the sacred building, in company with Mehevi {{and several other}} chiefs, when the {{announcement}} was first made. It sent a thrill of joy through my whole frame;—perhaps Toby was about to return. I rose at once to my feet, and my instinctive impulse was to hurry down to the beach, equally regardless of the distance that separated me from it, and of my disabled condition. As soon as Mehevi noticed the effect the intelligence had produced upon me, and the impatience I betrayed to reach the sea, his countenance assumed that inflexible rigidity of expression which had so awed me {{on the afternoon of}} our arrival at the house of Marheyo, As I was proceeding to leave the Ti, he laid his hand upon my shoulder, and said gravely, “abo, abo” (wait, wait). Solely intent upon the one thought that occupied my mind, and heedless of his request, I was brushing past him, when suddenly he reassumed a tone of authority, and told me to “moee” (sit down). Though struck by the alteration in his demeanour, the excitement under which I laboured was too strong to permit me to obey the unexpected command, and I was still limping towards the edge of the pi-pi with Kory-Kory clinging to one arm in his efforts to restrain me when the natives around <b>me</b> <b>started</b> to their feet, ranged themselves along the open front of the building, while Mehevi looked at me scowlingly, and reiterated his commands still more sternly.|$|E
