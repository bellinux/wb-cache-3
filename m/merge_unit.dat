40|$|Multi-sample {{anti-aliasing}} is {{a popular}} technique for reducing geometric aliasing (jagged edges) and is supported in all modern graphics processors. With multi-sampling anti-aliasing, visibility and depth are sampled more than once per pixel, while shading is done only once per pixel per primitive. Although this significantly reduces the appearance of jagged edges around object boundaries, the image quality improvement in non-silhouette regions is hardly noticeable. We propose a hardware unit, called the pixel <b>merge</b> <b>unit,</b> which is located just after the early depth test unit but before the pixel shader. Our unit attempts to reduce the shading rate to once per pixel per group of connected primitives covering a pixel using a novel merging strategy. We demonstrate up to 15 % reduction in pixel shader executions. Given the simple implementation that we propose, this is a substantial reduction...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{completeness}} of {{several types of}} pruning methods for the logical consequence finding procedure SOL-resolution. The consequence finding problem is a generalization of the refutation finding problem. The SOL-resolution is a Model-Elimination-like calculus with Skip operation, {{and is one of}} the most significant calculi for consequence finding. The concept "completeness" of consequence-finding calculi differs from the one of refutation finding calculi, hence the pruning methods that are complete for refutation finding tasks may not be complete for consequence finding problems. In this paper, we first reformulate SOL-resolution within connection tableaux and properly strengthen one of structural conditions, the regularity for skipped literals, which reduces a great amount of the redundancies in the search space. Next we investigate various types of pruning methods, such as order-preserving reduction, lemma matching, <b>merge,</b> <b>unit</b> subsumption, etc, and show the completeness theorems of each pruning method for consequence finding. Finally we show Skip operation itself has a significantly important future as a new local failure pruning method in consequence finding...|$|E

For the {{increasing}} development of smart grid {{and the basic}} requirements of smart substations for digital information, networked communication platform and standardized information sharing, it’s very necessary to do research on the <b>merging</b> <b>unit,</b> which is the important equipment in process layer of substations.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Electrical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 The IEC 61850 standard, “Communication networks and systems in substations” was promulgated to accommodate {{the need for a}} common communication platform within substations for devices from different vendors. The IEC 61850 standard proposes a substation automation architecture that is Ethernet-based, with a “station-bus” for protection devices within the substation and a “process bus” where raw data from the voltage and current transformers are published onto the data network using a device known as a <b>Merging</b> <b>Unit.</b> To date, most of the standardization efforts were focused at the station bus level where event-triggered messages are exchanged between the substation automation devices, commonly referred to as Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). These messages are known as Generic Object Oriented Substation Event messages. Equipment from vendors to accommodate the “process bus” paradigm, however is still limited at present. The Centre for Substation Automation and Energy Management Systems was established within the Electrical Engineering Department at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology with one of its objectives being the development of equipment either for simulation or real-time purposes in compliance with the IEC 61850 standard. In order to fulfil this long-term objective of the Centre, an in-depth understanding of the IEC 61850 standard is required. This document details the efforts at acquiring the requisite knowledge base in support of the educational objectives of the Centre and the research project implements a simulation of a <b>merging</b> <b>unit</b> which is compliant with the functional behavior as stipulated by the standard. This limited functional implementation (i. e. non-real-time) of the <b>merging</b> <b>unit,</b> is achieved through the development of a virtualized data acquisition node capable of synthetic generation of waveforms, encoding of the data and publishing the data in a format compliant with the IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 sampled value message structure. This functional behavior of the virtual sensor node which was implemented has been validated against the behavior of a commercial device and the sampled value message structure is validated against the standard. The temporal behavior of the proposed device is commented upon. This research project forms the basis for future real-time implementation of a <b>merging</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{technological}} advancements in the substation automation {{give rise to}} many new challenges for the engineers. The IEC 61850 standard de nes the most advanced techniques towards the digital substation development. It describes the communication mappings for the substation automation of both conventional and digital substations. The most important challenge is to replace old successful and reliable protection relays with the newly born microprocessor based relays called intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). The IEC 61850 standard gives the novel ideas in its sub-clauses IEC 60044 - 8 and IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 about digital communication and sampled values transmission over an Ethernet link called process bus. As this thesis is the Part-A and {{it is mainly based}} {{on the development of the}} conventional instrument transformers, analog to digital data converter and a multi-bus power system. The scope of this study contains the development of current and voltage transformer models in SIMULINK which gives the ideal behaviour of the conventional instrument transformers for voltage and current measurements. The methodology of this study is to model the Sigma-Delta analog to digital converter in the SIMULINK and then simulated results are veri ed according to the standard. The 4 KHz output (Voltage/Current) signal is obtained in the digital form with 16 -bit resolution. The SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) and ENOB (Eective Number of Bits) of the data converter is veri ed both theoretically and practically. In the next phase the multi-bus power system is modelled in the SIMULINK using SimPowerSystems Library to make the nal tests on the developed product. Finally the developed models of Project Part-A have been integrated with the transmission model developed in the Project Part-B, collectively known as <b>Merging</b> <b>Unit.</b> The functionality of this complete developed product is to get 3 -phase analog signals of currents and voltages from the instrument transformers, perform signal processing on these signals and then transmit them on the Ethernet port in the form of SV (Sampled Value) stream according to the IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 standard. The developed <b>Merging</b> <b>Unit</b> is then connected to the dierent nodes of the power system to test the performance and reliability of the <b>Merging</b> <b>Unit.</b> The over current and dierential protection functions are tested on the ABB's RET 670 IED (Protection Relay for Transformer). In both test cases three phase short circuit fault is applied to the power system to check the behaviour of the <b>Merging</b> <b>Unit</b> during normal and abnormal conditions.
