5|$|By July Dyer {{was back}} in Britain and was fit enough to {{re-enter}} the ring, stopping Nicol Brady via technical knockout in a contest in Wallsend. He followed this with a points decision over Jack Zimmer and then won through Will Brooks' disqualification in a contest held in Cardiff. In November 1920 Dyer was invited to the National Sporting Club in London to face 'Bermondsey' Billy Wells. During the bout the referee twice instructed both men to make a proper contest of the fight. The referee let the match go the full fifteen rounds and then, instead of declaring a winner, he called the fight a 'no contest', with the fighters' purse being given to charity. After the National Sporting Club debacle, Dyer turned more and <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> singing and very few fights are recorded after 1920. A fight against Jim Slater in January 1922 {{is believed to be}} his last bout.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.|$|E
5|$|Oesau added four <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> tally by mid-1943. Shortly {{before his}} 30th birthday, Oesau was {{elevated}} {{to a series}} of Luftwaffe staff and administration positions. On 1 July 1943 he was posted as Fighter Leader Brittany (Jagdfliegerführer Bretagne), before being appointed as Geschwaderkommodore of JG 1 on 12 November 1943, following the death of JG 1's Hans Philipp in October 1943. The ban on Oesau's combat flying was lifted. While commanding JG 1, Oesau became an expert (Experten) at shooting down 4 engine bombers, with 14 bomber kills claimed. He was awarded the Combined Pilots-Observation Badge in gold and diamonds on 17 October 1943. He was awarded the German Cross in Gold on 10 January 1944.|$|E

5|$|Pick {{wanted a}} new type of {{building}} for the more open sites of the stations on the Piccadilly line's extensions. To decide what this new type should look like, he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see the latest developments in modern architecture. Pick was disappointed with much of the new architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it either too extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. The architecture in the Netherlands was much <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> liking, particularly buildings by Willem Marinus Dudok in Hilversum. Although the architecture in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior fixtures and fittings.|$|E
5|$|The England {{selectors}} {{surprised the}} cricket public {{with their new}} appointment as captain, selecting a player who many believed owed his appointment <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father than his own ability. Chris Cowdrey {{was the son of}} Colin Cowdrey, an England captain in the 1960s and later given a knighthood and then life peerage for his services to the sport; Chris Cowdrey was also godson of the chairman of selectors, Peter May. Cowdrey was a successful captain of Kent in county cricket, but had played just five Tests previously, during the 1984–85 tour to India, captained by David Gower. He became only the second son to follow his father as captain of the England cricket team, after George Mann in the 1940s followed Frank Mann in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|When Signor Lago, {{formerly}} impresario of the Imperial Opera Company of St. Petersburg, {{was looking}} for a second conductor to work with Luigi Arditi for a proposed London season, Garcia recommended Wood. The season opened at the newly rebuilt Olympic Theatre in London, in October 1892, with Wood conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. At that time the operatic conductor was not seen as an important figure, but the critics who chose to mention the conducting gave Wood good reviews. The work was not popular with the public, and the season was cut short when Lago absconded, leaving the company unpaid. Before that debacle, Wood had also conducted performances of Maritana and rehearsed Oberon and Der Freischütz. After the collapse of the Olympic opera season, Wood returned once <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> singing tuition. With the exception of a season at the Opera Comique in 1896, Wood's subsequent conducting career was in the concert hall.|$|E

5|$|In 1754, Pelham died, to be {{succeeded by}} his elder brother, the Duke of Newcastle. Hostility between France and Britain, {{particularly}} over the colonization of North America, continued. Fearing a French invasion of Hanover, George aligned himself with Prussia (ruled by his nephew, Frederick the Great), {{the enemy of}} Austria. Russia and France allied with their former enemy Austria. A French invasion of the British-held island of Minorca led to {{the outbreak of the}} Seven Years' War in 1756. Public disquiet over British failures {{at the start of the}} conflict led to the resignation of Newcastle and the appointment of the Duke of Devonshire as prime minister and William Pitt the Elder as Secretary of State for the Southern Department. In April the following year, George dismissed Pitt, in an attempt to construct an administration <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> liking. Over the succeeding three months attempts to form another stable ministerial combination failed. In June, James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave, held the seals of office for only four days. By the start of July, Pitt was recalled, and the Duke of Newcastle returned as prime minister. As Secretary of State, Pitt guided policy relating to the war. Great Britain, Hanover and Prussia and their allies Hesse-Kassel and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel were pitted against other European powers, including France, Austria, Russia, Sweden and Saxony. The war involved multiple theatres from Europe to North America and India, where British dominance increased with the victories of Robert Clive over French forces and their allies at the Battle of Arcot and the Battle of Plassey.|$|E
5|$|Ngwat-Mahop contributed {{greatly in}} his club's season opener, as he scored the fourth goal and {{assisted}} the sixth, in Red Bull Salzburg's 6–0 home devastation against SV Mattersburg. A {{few days later}} he added two <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> tally, as his club won Armenian club Banants by a 7–0 scoreline at home, for the first Qualifying round of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup. He once again scored in his club's first leg match for the second Qualifying round of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, against Lithuanian club FK Sūduva. He continued his scoring trends three days later for {{the first round of}} the ÖFB-Cup, in a 1–4 away win against Pasching. It took him almost a month to find the net again, as he scored the last goal in his club's 4–2 home win against Vöcklabrucker for the 2nd round of the ÖFB-Cup. A week later he managed to score the opening goal, in Red Bull Salzburg's 2–2 away draw against Sturm Graz. Until the end of the season he featured regularly in his team's matches, although mostly as a substitute, and only managed to score one more goal in a 4–1 home win against Austria Kärnten. At the end he counted 36 appearances with Red Bull Salzburg, of which 27 in the Bundesliga, six in the UEFA Cup and three in the ÖFB-Cup. Out of these matches he scored a total of eight goals, of which three in the Bundesliga, three in the UEFA Cup and two in the ÖFB-Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{designer for}} nearly all entries in the series is Kimihiko Fujisaka. Initially a minor staff member at Cavia, the team were impressed by his skill as an amateur artist and he was recommended for the post of character designer for the game. The designs for both the characters and the world were influenced by armor and clothing of Medieval Europe. He returned in the same capacity for Drakengard 2, and later for Nier. Disliking some of his initial designs for Drakengard, he {{took the opportunity to}} remodel them <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> liking for the arcade game Lord of Vermilion. For Niers international release, the protagonist was redesigned from a teenager to an adult character. This was because the publishers felt an older character would appeal more to western players. In Drakengard 3, Fujisaka designed the protagonist Zero around the dark themes of the game, although some unusual elements were nearly cut. The other female characters were inspired by Puella Magi Madoka Magica, while the male characters, considered a low priority, were designed around male archetypes and approved quickly. For Nier: Automata, the designs were handled by Akihiko Yoshida, an artist noted for his work on the Final Fantasy series. While he was initially expected to refuse, he agreed as several staff at his company CyDesignation were fans of Nier. For his designs, Yoko requested he focus on smooth outlines and black coloring.|$|E

60|$|But {{there is}} an unholy fascination in {{systematic}} noise. He did not flee from it incontinently, as {{one might have expected}} him to do. He remained, astonished at himself for remaining, since nothing could have been <b>more</b> repulsive <b>to</b> <b>his</b> tastes, <b>more</b> painful <b>to</b> <b>his</b> senses, and, so <b>to</b> speak, <b>more</b> contrary <b>to</b> <b>his</b> genius, than this rude exhibition of vigour. The Zangiacomo band was not making music; it was simply murdering silence with a vulgar, ferocious energy. One felt as if witnessing a deed of violence; and that impression was so strong that it seemed marvellous to see the people sitting so quietly on their chairs, drinking so calmly out of their glasses, and giving no signs of distress, anger, or fear. Heyst averted his gaze from the unnatural spectacle of their indifference.|$|R
25|$|According to {{historian}} Richard J. Evans, Heidegger was {{not only}} a member of the Nazi Party, but was enthusiastic about participating. He wanted to position himself as the philosopher of the Party, but the highly abstract nature of his work and the opposition of Alfred Rosenberg, who himself aspired to act in that position, limited Heidegger's role. His resignation from the rectorate owed <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> frustration as an administrator than to any principled opposition to the Nazis.|$|E
25|$|Kovari's {{previous}} roommate, John Pape, {{reported being}} very suspicious {{that there was}} <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend's death than the Police were letting on.

He was astonished at the similarities of the cases, especially the locations in which the bodies were found, however Dagenham Police did not link the two cases nor did they issue any warnings to the LGBT community.|$|E
25|$|Möngke's brother Kublai, {{after a brief}} flirtation with Chan Buddhism, found Tibetan Buddhism <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> liking. In 1253 {{he asked}} Godan to give him Chögyal Phagpa, who was then 18. Kublai was {{subsequently}} converted to Buddhism by his efforts and Phagpa became his tantric guru in 1258. Under the influence of Kublai's wife Chabi, their mutual relation was defined so that Phagpa had a precedence in religious matters and Kublai in temporal affairs. When the prince received religious instruction from his lama, the latter sat on a higher seat, while Kublai sat higher than Phagpa when he conducted court business. Phagpa further strengthened his case by defeating his Daoist opponents in a great debate in Kublai's newly built city Kaiping in 1258.|$|E
