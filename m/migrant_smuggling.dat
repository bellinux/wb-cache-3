50|$|Given {{the current}} {{political}} priority around people smuggling, it is perhaps surprising that a concerted international focus on defining and responding to <b>migrant</b> <b>smuggling</b> only occurred in the 1990s.

The resulting legal framework was the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (<b>Migrant</b> <b>Smuggling</b> Protocol), that supplements the parent instrument, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.|$|E

Senior officials have identified combating human trafficking as an important priority, sought increased partnerships with other governments and international organizations over the past year, and demonstrated a growing awareness of the distinction between human trafficking and smuggling. The government, however, remains unable to effectively implement all of the protection, prevention, and prosecution components of its anti-trafficking law given its lack of resources. Addressing <b>migrant</b> <b>smuggling</b> and daunting refugee flows remained a main concern, diverting government attention and limited law enforcement resources that might otherwise have been devoted to detecting and responding to forms of trafficking occurring within the country’s borders.

5000|$|Hungary, {{rather than}} Czechoslovakia, was the initial {{hub of the}} post-1989 Chinese {{community}} in Eastern Europe, due to their policy of offering visa-free entry to PRC nationals; as many as 45,000 Chinese may have arrived in Hungary by 1992, largely shuttle traders and migrant workers. However, when that visa-free policy was terminated, the Chinese began to spread out to other neighbouring countries, primarily Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.
