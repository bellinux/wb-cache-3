5|$|Kingsmill {{massacre}} - A 1976 {{massacre of}} civilians {{who had also}} been traveling in a <b>minibus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{night after}} the Miami Showband massacre, gunmen opened fire on a <b>minibus</b> near Gilford. It had been {{travelling}} from Banbridge to Bleary with nine people on board; all were Catholics and most had been returning from a regular bingo session. One report says it was stopped at a fake British Army checkpoint. Five Catholic civilians were shot; passenger Joseph Toland was killed outright and driver James Marks died of his wounds in January 1976. The attack was blamed on loyalists and Lost Lives—an account of every death in the conflict—states that reliable loyalist sources have confirmed the UVF was responsible. However, police have blamed the IRA. The RUC suggested the IRA had meant to attack a police <b>minibus</b> in revenge for the Miami killings, but had mistakenly attacked a civilian <b>minibus</b> instead. A report by the police's Historical Enquiries Team (HET) also suggests this. The IRA has denied responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Dial-a-Ride {{services}} {{for the elderly and}} handicapped are well used, along with the local Community <b>minibus</b> set up by the local Rotary Club in 1967 under Midsomer Norton & Radstock Community Service Vehicle Trust. This vehicle is for use primarily by organisations in the area serving the disabled and infirm.|$|E
5|$|Following {{deregulation}} in October 1986, a {{small number}} of service changes were made, with a new route from Guildford to Chiddingfold being introduced and a service to Gomshall withdrawn. At the same time, a new brand name, Hobbit, was introduced for Tillingbourne's <b>minibus</b> operations. Barry King left the company in December 1986 and was replaced as Managing Director by Chris Bowler.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Travers {{heard the}} gunmen rummaging {{in the back}} of the <b>minibus,</b> where he kept his guitar. Concerned it might be damaged, he {{approached}} the two gunmen and told them to be careful. Asked whether he had anything valuable inside the case, Travers replied no. The gunman turned him round, punched him in the back and pushed him on the shoulder back into the line-up.|$|E
5|$|The {{band was}} {{travelling}} home to Dublin {{late at night}} after a performance in Banbridge. Halfway to Newry, their <b>minibus</b> was stopped at {{what appeared to be}} a military checkpoint, where gunmen in British Army uniforms ordered them to line up by the roadside. At least four of the gunmen were serving soldiers from the British Army's Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) but, unbeknownst to the band, all were members of the UVF. While two of the gunmen (both soldiers) were hiding a time bomb on the <b>minibus,</b> it exploded prematurely and killed them. The other gunmen then opened fire on the dazed band members, killing three and wounding two. It is believed the bomb was meant to explode en route, killing the band and framing them as IRA bomb-smugglers, and possibly leading to stricter security measures at the border.|$|E
5|$|The {{village is}} served by a <b>minibus</b> service to Ilkley via Grassington twice a week in summer, and once a week in winter. The nearest railway station is in Skipton, with {{services}} to Leeds, Bradford, Carlisle, and Carnforth, and the nearest international airport is Leeds Bradford Airport.|$|E
5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} the attack the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) issued a statement. It was {{released}} under the heading Ulster Central Intelligence Agency – Miami Showband Incident Report:A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a <b>minibus</b> and a car parked near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the <b>minibus.</b> As they began to enter the vehicle, a bomb was detonated and both men were killed outright. At the precise moment of the explosion, the patrol came under intense automatic fire from the occupants of the other vehicle. The patrol sergeant immediately ordered fire to be returned. Using self-loading rifles and sub-machine guns, the patrol returned fire, killing three of their attackers and wounding another. The patrol later recovered two Armalite rifles and a pistol. The UVF maintains regular border patrols due to the continued activity of the Provisional IRA. The Mid-Ulster Battalion has been assisting the South Down-South Armagh units since the IRA Forkhill boobytrap which killed four British soldiers. Three UVF members are being treated for gunshot wounds after last night but not in hospital.It {{would appear that the}} UVF patrol surprised members of a terrorist organisation transferring weapons to the Miami Showband <b>minibus</b> and that an explosive device of some description was being carried by the Showband for an unlawful purpose. It is obvious, therefore, that the UVF patrol was justified in taking the action it did and that the killing of the three Showband members should be regarded as justifiable homicide. The Officers and Agents of the Ulster Central Intelligence Agency commend the UVF on their actions and tender their deepest sympathy to the relatives of the two Officers who died while attempting to remove the bomb from the <b>minibus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} why France2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene {{directly}} after the shooting, including the {{shooting death of}} the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad. Abu Rahma's footage stops suddenly after the shooting of the father and son, then begins again—from the same position, with the white <b>minibus</b> behind which Abu Rhama was standing visible in the shot—with other people being loaded into an ambulance.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, {{the museum}} is headed by Bret Pidgeon, who is {{currently}} {{the general manager of}} Madame Tussauds Hong Kong and Shanghai. He has worked for eight years for Madame Tussauds in New York previously. The museum is accessible from Central via <b>minibus,</b> taxi or Peak Tram and opens all year round from 10 am to 10 pm daily. Admission fee is HK$140 (US$18) for adults and HK$70 for children aged between 3 and 11 years old.|$|E
5|$|From 1978 to 1981, Sai Tso Wan Landfill (晒草灣堆填區) served East Kowloon. Approximately 1.6million tonnes of {{domestic}} waste and commercial waste were {{dumped in the}} site during its four-year operation. The disposed waste stacked up to 65 metres high. After its closure in 1981, it was sealed with soil and planted over with Grasslands and trees. Sin Fat Road, which runs {{up the hill and}} hosts Sceneway Garden <b>Minibus</b> Terminus, was constructed. Sai Tso Wan Landfill was later rebuilt into Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground.|$|E
5|$|On Tottenham's {{pre-season}} tour of Australia, Kane attracted numerous fans {{while visiting}} the Westfield Sydney shopping centre, {{resulting in the}} club sending a <b>minibus</b> to escort him away. On 29 July 2015, Tottenham were the guests in the 2015 MLS All-Star Game at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Colorado. They lost 2–1 to the MLS All-Stars, with Kane scoring their consolation goal in the 37th minute after beating a challenge from Omar Gonzalez, and he was later substituted to a standing ovation.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of sight}} of the band members, two of the gunmen placed a ten-pound (4.5kg) time bomb {{in the rear of the}} <b>minibus.</b> The UVF's plan was that the bomb would explode once the <b>minibus</b> had reached Newry, killing all on board. However, Martin Dillon alleged that the bomb was meant to go off in the Irish Republic. He {{suggested}} that had all gone according to plan, the loyalist extremists would have been able to clandestinely bomb the Republic of Ireland, yet claim that the band were republican bomb-smugglers carrying explosives on behalf of the IRA. They had hoped to embarrass the Government of Ireland, as well as to draw attention to its level of control of the border. This may have resulted in the Irish authorities enforcing tighter controls over the border, thus restricting IRA operations. Dillon opined that another reason the UVF decided to target the Miami Showband was because Irish nationalists held them in high regard; to attack the band was to strike the nationalists indirectly.|$|E
5|$|Public {{transport}} {{is based}} on a fairly dense network of tram and bus routes operated by a municipal company, supplemented by a number of private <b>minibus</b> operators. Local trains connect some of the suburbs. The bulk of the city's historic area {{has been turned into a}} pedestrian zone with rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages; however, the tramlines run within a three-block radius (pictured). The historic means of transportation in the city can be examined at the Museum of Municipal Engineering in the Kazimierz district, with many old trams, cars and buses.|$|E
5|$|The fleet was {{substantially}} updated shortly {{prior to}} the company's closure. Two Volvo B6 single-deckers were bought in 1994. These were followed {{by a number of}} Optare products including the Metrorider <b>minibus</b> and four of the last Optare Vecta single-deckers built. The most common type in the fleet in the late 1990s was the Mercedes-Benz 811D minibus; by 1998 21 were in use out of a total fleet of 65. Tillingbourne bought its first low-floor buses, two new Optare Excels, in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 AFL–CIO President Lane Kirkland {{appointed}} Kahn {{to organize}} the AFL–CIO's support of Solidarity. The AFL–CIO sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help. Politically, the AFL–CIO supported the twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers, by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, the AFL–CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund. By 1981 it had raised almost $300,000, which was used to purchase printing presses and office supplies. The AFL–CIO donated typewriters, duplicating machines, a <b>minibus,</b> an offset press, and other supplies requested by Solidarity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} shortly {{before and after}} deregulation, a range of types were used. As well as {{a large number of}} Bedford vehicles, which {{continued}} to be bought new until the late 1980s, the fleet also included the AEC Reliance, Leyland Leopard, Leyland Tiger and Volvo B10M models, and the first two Dennis Lancet single-deckers to be built. The company bought its first <b>minibus,</b> a 16-seat Ford Transit, in 1985. The Tillingbourne fleet in the late 1980s and early 1990s also included two rare Dennis Dorchesters bought new, and a Volvo B10M coach with the last Plaxton Derwent body built.|$|E
5|$|The band's road manager, Brian Maguire {{stated that}} when he drove away from Banbridge in the lead, a few minutes ahead of the band's <b>minibus,</b> he passed through {{security}} barriers manned by the RUC. As Maguire continued ahead, up the by-pass towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from {{where it had been}} parked in a lay-by. Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing its lights. Two men had been observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's movements were being carefully monitored.|$|E
5|$|When the RUC {{arrived at}} the site they found five dead bodies, a seriously injured Stephen Travers, body parts, the {{smouldering}} remains of the destroyed <b>minibus,</b> debris from the bomb blast, bullets, spent cartridges, and the band members' personal possessions, including clothing, shoes, and {{a photograph of the}} group, strewn across the area. They also discovered a stolen white Ford Escort registration number 4933 LZ, which had been left behind by the gunmen, along with two guns, ammunition, green UDR berets and a pair of glasses later traced to James McDowell, the gunman who had ordered the shootings.|$|E
5|$|In November 1994, Walford {{resident}} Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) {{takes in}} a dog he assumes to be a stray, naming him Wellard. The dog's owner, Mr Hammond, locates him and demands him back, but Wellard later returns to Albert Square {{of his own}} accord. Robbie realises he has been mistreated and has run away. Mr Hammond admits to neglecting Wellard, and allows Robbie to keep him. Wellard fathers puppies with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); however, the puppies are stillborn. When Robbie begins {{a relationship with a}} woman allergic to dogs, she gives him the ultimatum of choosing between her and Wellard: Robbie chooses Wellard. Several years later, when Robbie is due to leave Walford to live in India, Wellard is run over, delaying Robbie's departure. He is cared for by Robbie's sister Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), who gives him to her friend Gus (Mohammed George) after Robbie's departure. When Gus is involved in a <b>minibus</b> crash, Wellard is able to save his owner by leading him to a spot from where he can call the emergency services.|$|E
5|$|Jamal, Muhammad, the Associated Press cameraman, and Shams Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, took cover {{against the}} {{concrete}} {{wall in the}} south-east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost. Jamal, Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum, apparently part of a culvert, that was sitting against the wall. A thick paving stone sat {{on top of the}} drum, which offered further protection. Abu Rahma hid behind a white <b>minibus</b> parked across the road about 15metres away from the wall. The Reuters and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad's shoulders—the cameras pointing toward the Israeli outpost—before the men moved away. Jamal and Muhammad did not move away, but stayed behind the drum for 45 minutes. In Enderlin's view, they were frozen in fear.|$|E
5|$|Rejecting {{this turn}} of events, Rin travels {{back into the}} {{artificial}} world again (this time created by Riki and Rin) and helps Riki overcome his weakness. Afterwards, {{the two of them}} go back to waking up at the crash site. This time, Riki and Rin work together to save everyone at the crash scene. Kyousuke, who sneaked onto the bus (as a third year he was not allowed to go), managed to block the leak hole on the gas tank to delay the explosion, despite his injuries being far greater than anyone else. Everyone in the bus recovers from their injuries, although Kyousuke's recovery takes longer due to extensive injuries. Finally, after Kyousuke returns, he rents a <b>minibus,</b> {{and the members of the}} Little Busters set out for a trip to the ocean.|$|E
5|$|The company {{changed its}} name to Tillingbourne Bus Company in 1972, {{changing}} its livery to blue and yellow, and moved to a garage in Gomshall in the same year. A second garage in Ewhurst was opened in 1974. An expansion of operations in the late 1970s and early 1980s, much of it through the award of county council contracted routes, took the company's vehicles into West Sussex and Hampshire as well as Surrey. Tillingbourne took over the services of London operator Orpington & District following that company's collapse in 1981. These were run separately from the main company as Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) which, in 1983, was sold to its management to form Metrobus, now part of the Go-Ahead Group. The company moved garages again in 1980, settling in Cranleigh. A new, larger garage in the same town was opened in February 2001. Deregulation of local bus services in 1986 led to further expansion, including the establishment in 1989 of a new brand, Hobbit, for Tillingbourne's <b>minibus</b> operations. A high-quality coaching subsidiary, Dorking Coaches, was also operated towards the end of Tillingbourne's life.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} used forms of medium distance transport in Hyderabad include government owned services such as light railways and buses, as well as privately operated taxis and auto rickshaws. Bus services operate from the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station in the city centre and carry over 130 million passengers daily across the entire network. Hyderabad's light rail transportation system, the Multi-Modal Transport System (MMTS), is a three line suburban rail service used by over 160,000 passengers daily. Complementing these government services are <b>minibus</b> routes operated by Setwin (Society for Employment Promotion & Training in Twin Cities). Intercity rail services also operate from Hyderabad; the main, and largest, station is Secunderabad Railway Station, which serves as Indian Railways' South Central Railway zone headquarters and a hub for both buses and MMTS light rail services connecting Secunderabad and Hyderabad. Other major railway stations in Hyderabad are Hyderabad Deccan Station, Kacheguda Railway Station, Begumpet Railway Station, Malkajgiri Railway Station and Lingampally Railway Station. The Hyderabad Metro, a new rapid transit system, is {{to be added to}} the existing public transport infrastructure and is scheduled to operate by 2018.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of minibuses in Wan Chai, the green <b>minibus</b> and the red <b>minibus.</b> In general, green minibuses operate on {{scheduled}} service with fixed routes and published fares. Red minibuses run with government license but on non-scheduled services, casually connecting regular travellers and commuters to specific urban areas across Hong Kong Island. Drivers of red minibuses will display fares in the front of their <b>minibus</b> windshields.|$|E
25|$|On leaving Zhinan Temple or Maokong Stations, {{regular and}} {{frequent}} <b>minibus</b> services can ferry visitors to destinations around the Maokong area. <b>Minibus</b> services can also deliver passengers directly {{back to the}} Taipei Zoo MRT station.|$|E
25|$|Not {{far from}} the scene of the ambush, a <b>minibus</b> with a wedding party hit a {{landmine}} believed planted by the PKK. Seventeen civilians (six of them children) were injured and the <b>minibus</b> was completely wrecked. The wounded were airlifted to the Yüksekova hospital.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the murder, Özgecan went to a {{shopping}} center with her friend. After eating, the women took the <b>minibus</b> to return home. Özgecan was last seen by her friend, who exited the <b>minibus,</b> leaving Özgecan alone in the <b>minibus.</b> As Özgecan did not return home after nightfall, she was reported missing. Meanwhile, the <b>minibus</b> driver stopped at a Gendarmerie checkpoint to ask for directions, but instead of following the directions, diverted into a forest. The gendarme became suspicious and stopped the vehicle to find smears of blood, which the driver claimed had been caused by a fight between passengers. After a brief investigation, the suspects were released. After Özgecan was reported missing, the gendarme started to look for the <b>minibus</b> again. It was captured with two of the suspects; Özgecan's hat (confirmed as hers by her father) was found inside. The two suspects subsequently admitted the murder, and the search for the third suspect began.|$|E

25|$|The <b>minibus</b> was {{transporting}} 14 children home to Worcestershire from {{a school}} trip to London when it veered into {{the rear of the}} motorway maintenance lorry which was stationary on the hard shoulder. Twelve of the 14 children and the driver of the <b>minibus,</b> their teacher, were killed in the crash, one of the worst on the British road network. The two survivors sustained minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|An {{experimental}} high-frequency service using 22 minibuses {{had been}} introduced in Exeter on 27 February 1984. By the time the company was privatised in August 1986, the <b>minibus</b> fleet had expanded to more than 200 vehicles, {{more than half the}} buses in service. By the end of 1990 all regular services had been converted to <b>minibus</b> operation using a mixture of 16 and 24-seat vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The co-ordinated sectarian shootings of the Reavey and O'Dowd families, {{allegedly}} {{perpetrated by}} the Glenanne gang and organised by Robin Jackson, {{was followed by}} the South Armagh Republican Action Force retaliation with a sectarian attack the following day. It stopped a <b>minibus</b> at Kingsmill and shot dead the ten Protestant passengers, after being taken out of their <b>minibus</b> which was transporting them home from their workplace in Glenanne.|$|E
25|$|Özgecan Aslan (22 October 1995 – 11 February 2015) was a Turkish {{university}} {{student who was}} murdered as she resisted a rape attempt on 11 February 2015 on a <b>minibus</b> in Mersin, Turkey. Her burnt body was discovered on 13 February. The murder was committed by the <b>minibus</b> driver Ahmet Suphi Altındöken, his father Necmettin Altındöken and his friend Fatih Gökçe. All perpetrators were handed aggravated life sentences {{without the possibility of}} parole.|$|E
