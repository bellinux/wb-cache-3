40|$|Introduction Lumbar interbody fusion using cages {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{reliable}} treatment options for degenerative spinal diseases. Currently, many cage designs are available in the market; however none of them is completely successful, as reflected by non-union rates ranging from 7 to 30 %. Cages are made of very different materials (e. g. metals, polymers) and they present a large range of morphological configurations (e. g. solid, ring), leading to distinct <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> within the fusion region. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> are known to largely influence bone regeneration [Klein, 2003] in long bones, however their role on spinal fusion remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate how the local <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> (strains, stress, fluid flow) created by different cage designs might influence bone tissue formation during the spinal fusion process. Methods We developed an iterative computer model to simulate the time course of tissue formation during spinal fusion. The model included the vertebral bodies, the intervertebral space and a spinal cage (Fig. 1). In each time step, tissue formation was regulated by the local <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> [Prendergast, 1997] within the regenerating region, determined using finite element techniques. The temporal and spatial evolution of tissue formation was investigated for two different cage designs (a solid and a ring cage) and two different levels of stiffness: 1 (soft) and 100 (stiff) GPa. Results Bone formation and maturation started in the most inner region of the intervertebral space and extended over time to the outer region, forming a defined callus shape (Fig. 1 a). Model predictions showed a strong influence of cage stiffness and configuration on the fusion outcome (Fig 1 b-e). A softer cage showed a more favourable mechanical stimulation for the regeneration of bone, leading to higher amounts of bone tissue formation. For the stiffer cage, better fusion outcome was predicted with a centered solid cage compared to a ring cage (Fig. 1 c & e). Stress shielding was observed in the central hollow region of the ring cage, which was more pronounced for the stiffer cage (Fig. 1 c). Discussion <b>Mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> have an influence on bone regeneration. We investigated the effect of the mechanical environment created by different cage designs on the fusion outcome. We observed that cage design, both morphology and material properties, play a key role in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> within the fusion region and therefore the time course of the fusion process. In the future such understanding may be used to optimize the design of spinal fusion implants to guide and foster bone formation and inter-body fusion.

40|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> in {{the repair}} tissues {{are known to}} {{influence}} the outcome of fracture healing. These <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> {{are determined by the}} stiffness of fixation and limb loading. Experimental studies have shown that there is a range of beneficial fixation stiffness for timely healing and that fixation stiffness that is either too flexible or too stiff impairs callus healing. However, much less is known about how <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> influence the biological processes that make up the sequence of bone repair and if indeed mechanical stimulation is required at all stages of repair. Secondary bone healing occurs through a sequence of events broadly characterised by inflammation, proliferation, consolidation and remodelling. It is our hypothesis that a change in fixation stiffness from very flexible to stiff can shorten the time to healing relative to constant fixation stiffness. Flexible fixation has the benefit of promoting greater callus formation and needs to be applied during the proliferative stage of repair. The greater callus size helps to stabilize the fragments earlier allowing mineralization to occur faster. Together with stable/rigid fixation applied during the latter stage of repair to ensure mineralization of the callus. The predicted benefits of inverse dynamization are shortened healing in comparison to very flexible fixation and healing time comparable or faster than stable fixation with greater callus stiffness...|$|R

The mean interfragmentary strain can also be accurately controlled, but with some variation over the gap (due to coupled transverse displacement error). Interfragmentary stiffness measurements are accurate up to gap stiffnesses corresponding to bony bridging.

To this end, Operation Collingwood purchased and stored 50001, 50023, 50029, 50030, 50040 and 50045. All except 50029 and 50030 were heavily stripped examples sold to scrapyards for final cutting up. The intention was to restore them by using industrial sponsorship money to build an engineering centre and overhaul the components, making brand new ones where necessary to overcome lack of availability of some parts unique to the original design. These ambitions failed when sponsorship did not reach the required level and the project lost various key people. The charity was wound up in 2002; 50001/023/040 and 045 were sold back to scrapyards and their state as little more than bodyshells deterred most further preservation attempts. 50045 was scrapped to provide spares for preserved 50026, and 50001 met a similar fate.

40|$|Although {{there are}} many pogresses in the trauma {{surgical}} research, there are healing complications in about ten to twenty percent of fracture therapies (Haas, 2000). The purpose of the trauma surgical treatment is a fast and total restoration of {{the function of the}} musculosceletal system. This is only possible with {{a better understanding of the}} complex interaction between the mechanical and biological factors during the fine adjusted process of fracture healing. In a previous animal study the magnitude for shear movements, inducing on the one hand a perfect and on the other a less effective healing, was defined. Based on a validatet musculosceletale model of the sheep’s hind leg, a special shear-flexible external fixator was designed for this project, which creates <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> known to hinder the healing process in the clinic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of determined critical <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> on the callus modulation and differentiation in comparison to the healing results induced by perfect <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> from a previous study. For this study 32 sheep were stabilized by a monolateral critical external fixator. All sheep underwent a standardized osteotomy of the right tibia with an identical three millimetre wide osteotomy-gap. After the observation period of two, three, six or nine weeks the animals were sacrificed, and then radiological, biological and biomechanical analyses were performed. During the observation time of nine weeks all sheep showed an incomplete fracture healing of the osteotomy gap. After nine weeks all sheep showed a small continous fracture line in the fracture callus, which histologically consists of cartilage and connective-tissue. By comparing with the results of the previous study, the hypothesis is confirmed, that the critical <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions</b> in this study induced a delayed fracture healing: under perfect <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions,</b> bony bridging occured in most of the tibiae after six and in all tibiae after nine weeks. The poor torsional stiffness after six and nine weeks also suggests a hardly advanced healing progress. In 50 percent of the cases the biomechanical testing was not possible due to immature callus tissue. Between six and nine weeks no increase in torsional stiffness was found in biomechanical testing. The reasons of the delayed bone healing are the very critical <b>mechanical</b> <b>conditions.</b> The results demonstrate that the process and the score of the bone healing are influenced by the biomechanical circumstances. To make a more precise statement of the healing process and its healing results, the chosen observation time period of nine weeks is too short. After nine weeks a delayed bone healing with activ courses of the healing was observed, which could presumably lead to a healing of the fragments in the future but may also end in a hypertrophic pseudarthrosis. To evaluate this precisely, the testing period must be longer, which is already planned in a further project. The new perceptions about the histological steps of the delayed fracture healing under defined mechanical circumstances could help to figure out the possibilities and boundaries of an osteosynthesis. In this way a non-problematic healing could be realized even for complex fractures...|$|R
