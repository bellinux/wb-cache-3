Sweden is the first country within the European Union to do so after gaining membership (with other members, such as Poland, withholding recognition previously issued under Communist rule). Israel called the move unconsidered and Israel recalled its ambassador, Isaac Bachman, following the recognition. Bachman returned to Sweden on 29 November 2014.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the degree to which the threat of <b>managed</b> <b>trade</b> leads to foreign direct investment (FDI) in a time-consistent manner. We study the role of capital mobility in a two-countries world economy characterized by monopolistic competition. Investment decisions are implemented ex-ante, prior to the realization of productivity shocks. International trade among the countries is the outcome of either free or <b>managed</b> <b>trade.</b> An endogenous switch from free to <b>managed</b> <b>trade</b> may occur ex-post as the outcome of a cost-benefit assessment of the two countries. Under <b>managed</b> <b>trade,</b> the patterns of international commerce are determined as the outcome of costly bargaining. We identify time-inconsistent patterns of <b>managed</b> <b>trade</b> in the absence of capital mobility. Ex-post, one country will have the incentive to induce a switch to <b>managed</b> <b>trade,</b> the outcome of which is to reduce the expected welfare ex-ante. We demonstrate that capital mobility and the diversification of production achieved by the FDI alleviates this time inconsistency by reducing (potentially eliminating) the ex-post incentive of one country to switch to <b>managed</b> <b>trade.</b> Our analysis suggests that FDI induced by the threat of <b>managed</b> <b>trade</b> benefits ex-ante both the host country and the multinationals, explaining the relative tolerance toward FDI. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{assessment}} of three tilts in U. S. trade policy during the 1980 s: minilateralism, <b>managed</b> <b>trade,</b> and Congressional activism.

Sectoral minilateralism might have been a feasible replacement for the more aggressive <b>managed</b> <b>trade</b> experiments, e. g., in semiconductors, and earlier Executive Branch initiative in drafting trade legislation of the late 1980 s might have blunted some of the sharper edges of the Congressional arsenal in the 1988 act.
