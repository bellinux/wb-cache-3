40|$|We used a {{model system}} of {{purified}} components {{to explore the}} effects of a downstream target on the signaling properties of a covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycle,</b> an example of retroactivity. In the experimental system used, a bifunctional enzyme catalyzed the modification and demodification of its substrate protein, with both activities regulated by a small molecule stimulus. Here we examined how a downstream target for one or both forms of the substrate of the covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycle</b> affected the steady-state output of the system, the sensitivity of the response to the stimulus, and the concentration of the stimulus required to provide the half-maximal response (S 50). When both the modified and unmodified forms of the substrate protein were sequestered by the downstream target, the sensitivity of the response was dramatically decreased, but the S 50 was only modestly affected. Conversely, when the downstream target only sequestered the unmodified form of the substrate protein, significant effects were observed on both system sensitivity and S 50. Behaviors of the experimental systems were well approximated both by simple models allowing analytical solutions and by a detailed model based on the known interactions and enzymatic activities. Modeling and experimentation indicated that retroactivity may result in subsensitive responses, even if the covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycle</b> displays significant ultrasensitivity in the absence of retroactivity. Thus, we provide examples of how a downstream target can alter the signaling properties of an upstream signal transduction covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractCovalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles</b> {{are basic}} units and {{building}} blocks of posttranslational modification and cellular signal transduction. We systematically explore different spatial aspects of signal transduction in covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles</b> by starting with a basic temporal cycle as a reference and focusing on steady-state signal transduction. We consider, in turn, the effect of diffusion on spatial signal transduction, spatial analogs of ultrasensitive behavior, and the interplay between enzyme localization and substrate diffusion. Our analysis reveals the need to explicitly account for kinetics and diffusional transport (and localization) of enzymes, substrates, and complexes. It demonstrates a complex and subtle interplay between spatial heterogeneity, diffusion, and localization. Overall, examining the spatial dimension of covalent modification reveals that 1), there are important differences between spatial and temporal signal transduction even in this cycle; and 2), spatial aspects may play a substantial role in affecting and distorting information transfer in modules/networks that are usually studied in purely temporal terms. This {{has important implications for}} the systematic understanding of signaling in covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles,</b> pathways, and networks in multiple cellular contexts...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Cycles</b> of {{covalent}} <b>modification</b> are ubiquitous motifs in cellular signalling. Although such signalling cycles {{are implemented}} via a highly concise set of chemical reactions, {{they have been}} shown to be capable of producing multiple distinct input-output mapping behaviours – ultrasensitive, hyperbolic, signal-transducing and threshold-hyperbolic. Results: In this paper, we show how the set of chemical reactions underlying covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles</b> can be exploited for the design of synthetic analog biomolecular circuitry. We show that biomolecular circuits based on the dynamics of covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles</b> allow (a) the computation of nonlinear operators using far fewer chemical reactions than purely abstract designs based on chemical reaction network theory, and (b) the design of nonlinear feedback controllers with strong performance and robustness properties.

However, the behavior of such systems far from steady state remains unclear. Here, we analyze the properties of covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles</b> and ligand/receptor interactions driven by the accumulation of the activating enzyme and the ligand, respectively. We show that for a large range of parameters both systems produce sharp switchlike response and yet allow for temporal integration of the signal, two desirable signaling properties. Ultrasensitivity is observed also in a region of parameters where the steady-state response is hyperbolic. The temporal integration properties are tunable by regulating the levels of the deactivating enzyme and receptor, as well as by adjusting the rate of accumulation of the activating enzyme and ligand. We propose that this tunability is used to generate precise responses in signaling systems...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMultisite {{phosphorylation}} {{plays an}} important role in biological oscillators such as the circadian clock. Its general role, however, has been elusive. In this theoretical study, we show that a simple substrate with two modification sites acted upon by two opposing enzymes (e. g., a kinase and a phosphatase) can show oscillations in its modification state. An unbiased computational analysis of this oscillator reveals two common characteristics: a unidirectional <b>modification</b> <b>cycle</b> and sequestering of an enzyme by a specific modification state. These two motifs cause a substrate to act as a coupled system in which a unidirectional cycle generates single-molecule oscillators, whereas sequestration synchronizes the population by limiting the available enzyme under conditions in which substrate is in excess. We also demonstrate the conditions under which the oscillation period is temperature compensated, an important feature of the circadian clock. This theoretical model will provide a framework for analyzing and synthesizing posttranslational oscillators...|$|E
40|$|SummaryProtein {{concentration}} gradients encode {{spatial information}} across cells and tissues and often depend on spatially localized protein synthesis. Here, {{we report that}} a different mechanism underlies the MEX- 5 gradient. MEX- 5 is an RNA-binding protein that becomes distributed in a cytoplasmic gradient along the anterior-to-posterior axis of the one-cell C.  elegans embryo. We demonstrate that the MEX- 5 gradient is {{a direct consequence of}} an underlying gradient in MEX- 5 diffusivity. The MEX- 5 diffusion gradient arises when the PAR- 1 kinase stimulates the release of MEX- 5 from slow-diffusive, RNA-containing complexes in the posterior cytoplasm. PAR- 1 directly phosphorylates MEX- 5 and is antagonized by the spatially uniform phosphatase PP 2 A. Mathematical modeling and in vivo observations demonstrate that spatially segregated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions are sufficient to generate stable protein concentration gradients in the cytoplasm. The principles demonstrated here apply to any spatially segregated <b>modification</b> <b>cycle</b> that affects protein diffusion and do not require protein synthesis or degradation...|$|E
40|$|In {{biochemical}} signaling pathways without explicit feedback connections, {{the core}} signal transduction is usually {{described as a}} one-way communication, going from upstream to downstream in a feedforward chain or network of covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles.</b> In this paper we explore {{the possibility of a}} new type of signaling called retroactive signaling, offered by the recently demonstrated property of retroactivity in signaling cascades. The possibility of retroactive signaling is analysed in the simplest case of the stationary states of a bicyclic cascade of signaling cycles. In this case, we work out the conditions for which variables of the upstream cycle are affected by a change of the total amount of protein in the downstream cycle, or by a variation of the phosphatase deactivating the same protein. Particularly, we predict the characteristic ranges of the downstream protein, or of the downstream phosphatase, for which a retroactive effect can be observed on the upstream cycle variables. Next, we extend the possibility of retroactive signaling in short but nonlinear signaling pathways involving a few covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Posttranslational {{modification}} of proteins is key in {{transmission of signals}} in cells. Many signaling pathways contain several layers of <b>modification</b> <b>cycles</b> that mediate and change the signal through the pathway. Here, we study a simple signaling cascade consisting of n layers of <b>modification</b> <b>cycles,</b> such that the modified protein of one layer acts as modifier in the next layer. Assuming mass-action kinetics and taking the formation of intermediate complexes into account, we show that the steady states are solutions to a polynomial in one variable, and in {{fact that there is}} exactly one steady state for any given total amounts of substrates and enzymes. We demonstrate that many steady state concentrations are related through rational functions, which can be found recursively. For example, stimulus-response curves arise as inverse functions to explicit rational functions. We show that the stimulus-response curves of the modified substrates are shifted to the left as we move down the cascade. Further, our approach allows us to study enzyme competition, sequestration and how the steady state changes in response to changes in the total amount of substrates.

Methionine sulfoxide reductase, which reduces methionine sulfoxide to methionine in a thioredoxin-dependent manner, is therefore not only an enzyme important for the repair of age- or degenerative disease-related protein modifications.

During Drosophila gastrulation, mitosis {{is associated with}} the transcriptional activation of cdc 25 string, a phosphatase that activates Cdk 1. Here, we demonstrate that the switch-like entry into mitosis observed in the Drosophila embryo during the 14 th mitotic cycle is timed by the dynamics of Cdc 25 string accumulation. The switch operates as a short-term integrator, a property that can improve the reliable control of timing of mitosis. The switch is independent of the positive feedback between Cdk 1 and Cdc 25 string and of the double negative feedback between Cdk 1 and Wee 1. We propose that the properties of the mitotic switch are established by the out-of-equilibrium properties of the covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycle</b> controlling Cdk 1 activity.

Regulation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase by reversible covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles</b> exemplifies signal transduction by enzyme cascades. Although this system for regulating glycogen synthesis and breakdown appears similar in all tissues, subtle differences have been identified. For example, phosphatase- 1, a dephosphorylating enzyme of the system, is regulated quite differently in muscle and liver. Do these small differences in regulatory architecture affect the overall {{performance of the}} glycogen cascade in a specific tissue? We address this question by analyzing the regulatory structure of the glycogen cascade system in liver and muscle cells at steady state. Results The glycogen cascade system in liver and muscle cells was analyzed at steady state {{and the results were}} compared with literature data. We found that the cascade system exhibits highly sensitive switch-like responses to changes in cyclic AMP concentration and the outputs are surprisingly different in the two tissues. In muscle, glycogen phosphorylase is more sensitive than glycogen synthase to cyclic AMP, while the opposite is observed in liver. Furthermore, when the liver undergoes a transition from starved to fed-state, the futile cycle of simultaneous glycogen synthesis and degradation switches to reciprocal regulation. Under such a transition, different proportions of active glycogen synthase and phosphorylase can coexist due to the varying inhibition of glycogen-synthase phosphatase by active phosphorylase. Conclusion The highly sensitive responses of glycogen synthase in liver and phosphorylase in muscle to primary stimuli can be attributed to distinctive regulatory designs in the glycogen cascade system. The different sensitivities of these two enzymes may exemplify the adaptive strategies employed by liver and muscle cells to meet specific cellular demands. </p...|$|R

40|$|To {{characterize}} the alpha-tubulin gene family in chicken, we have isolated five chicken alpha-tubulin genes and determined {{the majority of}} the sequences of the encoded polypeptides. Three of these (c alpha 3, c alpha 5 / 6 and c alpha 8) encode novel, expressed alpha-tubulins that have not previously been analyzed, whereas one gene segment is a pseudogene and another appears capable of encoding a functional subunit (although we were unable to document its expression in a survey of chicken tissues). Together with two additional expressed, functional alpha-tubulins reported earlier, we conclude that the chicken alpha-tubulin family is comprised of at least five functional genes whose polypeptide products are substantially more heterogeneous than found in preceding analyses of vertebrate alpha-tubulins. Comparison of the amino acid sequences reveals that the five polypeptides are between 96 and 83 % identical, with the extreme carboxy-terminal residues representing a highly heterogeneous variable domain. Since some alpha-tubulins undergo cyclic post-translational removal and readdition of a carboxy-terminal tyrosine, the notable sequence divergence in this domain suggests that individual tubulins probably participate to different extents in this <b>modification</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|E

This thesis {{reports on}} the {{investigation}} of a cyclic chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method eliminating unwanted surface reactions and enhancing shape selective properties by depositing inert silica onto the external surface of zeolite ZSM- 5.

Modifications are carried out in up to 33 cycles on {{one and the same}} sample employing tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as silica precursor at deposition temperatures ranging from 50 to 400 °C. After each CVD treatment the catalyst is tested with appropriate test reactions in order to quantify the extent of modification.

40|$|Biological signal {{transduction}} networks are commonly viewed as circuits that pass along information—in the process amplifying signals, enhancing sensitivity, or performing other signal-processing tasks—to transcriptional and other components. Here, {{we report on}} a "reverse-causality" phenomenon, which we call load-induced modulation. Through a combination of analytical and experimental tools, we discovered that signaling was modulated, in a surprising way, by downstream targets that receive the signal and, in doing so, apply what in physics is called a load. Specifically, we found that non-intuitive changes in response dynamics occurred for a covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycle</b> when load was present. Loading altered the response time of a system, {{depending on whether the}} activity of one of the enzymes was maximal and the other was operating at its minimal rate or whether both enzymes were operating at submaximal rates. These two conditions, which we call "limit regime" and "intermediate regime," were associated with increased or decreased response times, respectively. The bandwidth, the range of frequency in which the system can process information, decreased in the presence of load, suggesting that downstream targets participate in establishing a balance between noise-filtering capabilities and a circuit’s ability to process high-frequency stimulation. Nodes in a signaling network are not independent relay devices, but rather are modulated by their downstream targets. United States.

It is crucial for understanding {{the behavior of a}} complex system from the behavior of the composing subsystems. Whether modularity holds in biology is an intriguing and largely debated question. In this paper, we discuss this question taking a control system theory view and focusing on signaling systems. In particular, we argue that, despite signaling systems being constituted of structural modules, such as covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles,</b> modularity does not hold in general. As in any engineering system, impedance-like effects, called retroactivity, appear at interconnections and alter the behavior of connected modules. We further argue that while signaling systems have evolved sophisticated ways to counter-act retroactivity and enforce modularity, retroactivity may also be exploited to finely control the information processing of signaling pathways.

40|$|The {{building}} blocks of most signal transduction pathways are pairs of enzymes, such as kinases and phosphatases, that control the activity of protein targets by covalent modification. It has previously been shown [Goldbeter A & Koshland DE (1981) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 78, 6840 - 6844] that these systems can be highly sensitive to changes in stimuli if their catalysing enzymes are saturated with their target protein substrates. This mechanism, termed zero-order ultrasensitivity, may set thresholds that filter out subthreshold stimuli. Experimental data on protein abundance suggest that the enzymes and their target proteins are present in comparable concentrations. Under these conditions a large fraction of the target protein may be sequestrated by the enzymes. This causes a reduction in ultrasensitivity so that the proposed mechanism is unlikely to account for ultrasensitivity under the conditions present in most in vivo signalling cascades. Furthermore, we show that sequestration changes the dynamics of a covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycle</b> and may account for signal termination and a sign-sensitive delay. Finally, we analyse the effect of sequestration on the dynamics of a complex signal transduction cascade: the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade with negative feedback.

40|$|Covalent {{modification}} cycles are ubiquitous. Theoretical {{studies have}} suggested that they serve to increase sensitivity. However, this suggestion has not been corroborated experimentally in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that the assumptions of the theoretical studies, i. e., irreversibility and absence of product inhibition, were not trivial: when the conversion reactions are close to equilibrium or saturated by their product, "zero-order" ultrasensitivity disappears. For high sensitivities to arise, not only substrate saturation (zero-order) but also high equilibrium constants and low product saturation are required. Many covalent modification cycles are catalyzed by one bifunctional 'ambiguous' enzyme rather than by two independent proteins. This makes high substrate concentration and low product concentration for both reactions of the cycle inconsistent; such modification cycles cannot have high responses. Defining signal strength as ratios of modified (e. g., phosphorylated) over unmodified protein, signal-to-signal response sensitivity equals 1 : signal strength should remain constant along a cascade of ambiguous modification cycles. We also show that the total concentration of a signalling effector protein cannot affect the signal emanating from a <b>modification</b> <b>cycle</b> catalyzed by an ambiguous enzyme if the ratio of the two forms of the effector protein is not altered. This finding may explain the experimental result that the pivotal signal transduction protein PII plus its paralogue GInK do not control steady-state N-signal transduction in Escherichia coli. It also rationalizes the absence of strong phenotypes for many signal-transduction proteins. Emphasis on extent of modification of these proteins is perhaps more urgent than transcriptome analysis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Branched-chain a-keto acid {{dehydrogenase}} (BCKDH) complex, {{the enzyme}} {{catalyst for the}} second step of the BCAA catabolic pathway, plays {{a central role in}} the regulation of BCAA catabolism. The activity of the complex is regulated by a covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycle</b> in which phosphorylation by BCKDH kinase inactivates and dephosphorylation by BCKDH phosphatase activates the complex. Many studies suggest that control of the activity of the kinase is a primary determinant of the activity of the complex. The kinase exists at all times in the mitochondrial matrix space in two forms, with a large amount being free and a smaller amount bound rather tightly to the BCKDH complex. Only the bound form of the kinase appears to be catalytically active and, therefore, responsible for phosphorylation and inactivation of the complex. a-Ketoisocaproate, the transamination product of leucine and the most important known physiological inhibitor of BCKDH kinase, promotes release of the kinase from the complex. a-Chloroisocaproate, the analogue of leucine and the most potent known inhibitor of the kinase, is more effective than a-ketoisocaproate in promoting release of BCKDH kinase from the complex. Exercise and chronic liver disease (liver cirrhosis) likewise decrease the amount of the kinase bound to the complex in rat liver. The resulting activation of the BCKDH complex appears responsible for the increase in BCAA catabolism caused by exercise and liver cirrhosis. Our findings support the use of BCAA supplements for patients with liver cirrhosis. J. Nutr. 136 : 250 S– 253 S, 2006. KEY WORDS: branched-chain amino acids BCKDH complex BCKDH kinas...|$|E

Such enzyme cascades are known to exhibit ultrasensitive response to primary stimuli and act as signal integration systems.

This robust response of GS adenylylation is also observed for change in system parameters. From numerical analyses, we show that the robust ultrasensitive response of bicyclic cascade is because of allosteric interactions of glutamine and 2 -ketoglutarate, bifunctionality of converter enzymes, and closed loop bicyclic cascade structure. By system level quantification of the GS bicyclic cascade, we conclude that such a robust response may help the cell in adapting to different carbon and nitrogen status...|$|R

We have previously shown that invadolysin {{is essential in}} Drosophila, with roles in cell division and cell migration. Mitotic chromosomes are hypercondensed in length, but display an aberrant fuzzy appearance. We additionally demonstrated that in human cells, invadolysin is localized {{on the surface of}} lipid droplets, organelles that store not only triglycerides and sterols but also free histones H 2 A, H 2 Av and H 2 B. Is there a link between the storage of histones in lipid droplets and the aberrantly structured chromosomes of invadolysin mutants? We have identified a genetic interaction between invadolysin and nonstop, the de-ubiquitinating protease component of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn 5 -acetyltransferase) chromatin-remodelling complex. invadolysin and nonstop mutants exhibit phenotypic similarities in terms of chromosome structure in both diploid and polyploid cells. Furthermore, IX- 141 /not 1 transheterozygous animals accumulate mono-ubiquitinated histone H 2 B (ubH 2 B) and histone H 3 tri-methylated at lysine 4 (H 3 K 4 me 3). Whole mount immunostaining of IX- 141 /not 1 transheterozygous salivary glands revealed that ubH 2 B accumulates surprisingly in the cytoplasm, rather than the nucleus. Over-expression of the Bre 1 ubiquitin ligase phenocopies the effects of mutating either the invadolysin or nonstop genes. Intriguingly, nonstop and mutants of other SAGA subunits (gcn 5, ada 2 b and sgf 11) all suppress an invadolysin-induced rough eye phenotype. We conclude that the abnormal chromosome phenotype of invadolysin mutants is likely the result of disrupting the histone <b>modification</b> <b>cycle,</b> as accumulation of ubH 2 B and H 3 K 4 me 3 is observed. We further suggest that the mislocalization of ubH 2 B to the cytoplasm has additional consequences on downstream components essential for chromosome behaviour.

40|$|Bacterial {{chemotaxis}} in Escherichia coli is a canonical {{system for}} the study of signal transduction. A remarkable feature of this system is the coexistence of precise adaptation in population with large fluctuating cellular behavior in single cells (Korobkova et al. 2004, Nature, 428, 574). Using a stochastic model, we found that the large behavioral variability experimentally observed in non-stimulated cells is a direct consequence of the architecture of this adaptive system. Reversible covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles,</b> in which methylation and demethylation reactions antagonistically regulate the activity of receptor-kinase complexes, operate outside the region of first-order kinetics. As a result, the receptor-kinase that governs cellular behavior exhibits a sigmoidal activation curve. This curve simultaneously amplifies the inherent stochastic fluctuations in the system and lengthens the relaxation time in response to stimulus. Because stochastic fluctuations cause large behavioral variability and the relaxation time governs the average duration of runs in response to small stimuli, cells with the greatest fluctuating behavior also display the largest chemotactic response. Finally, Large-scale simulations of digital bacteria suggest that the chemotaxis network is tuned to simultaneously optimize the random spread of cells in absence of nutrients and the cellular response to gradients of attractant.

40|$|The Briggs-Haldane {{standard}} quasi-steady state approximation and {{the resulting}} rate expressions for enzyme driven biochemical reactions provide crucial theoretical insight compared to the full set of equations describing the reactions, mainly because it reduces the number of variables and equations. When the enzyme is {{in excess of the}} substrate, a significant amount of substrate can be bound in intermediate complexes, so-called substrate sequestration. The standard quasi-steady state approximation is known to fail under such conditions, a main reason being that it neglects these intermediate complexes. Introducing total substrates, i. e., the sums of substrates and intermediate complexes, provides a similar reduction of the number of variables to consider but without neglecting the contribution from intermediate complexes. The present theoretical study illustrates the usefulness of such simplifications for the understanding of biochemical reaction schemes. We show how introducing the total substrates allows a simple analytical treatment of the relevance of significant enzyme concentrations for pseudo first-order kinetics and reconciles two proposed criteria for the validity of the pseudo first-order approximation. In addition, we show how the loss of zero-order ultrasensitivity in covalent <b>modification</b> <b>cycles</b> can be analyzed, in particular that approaches such as metabolic control analysis are immediately applicable to scenarios described by the total substrates with enzyme concentrations higher than or comparable to the substrate concentrations. A simple criterion which excludes the possibility of zero-order ultrasensitivity is presented...|$|R

After numerous review and <b>modification</b> <b>cycles,</b> the document is printed and distributed, often through intermediaries. Finally, it reaches the hands and eyes of perhaps thousands. This contrasts dramatically with the Internet where, within minutes of completion, text {{can be seen by}} millions. The Internet offers enormous research power. With a PC and a phone line, one can locate a recipe for delicious meringue or deadly ricin; can research a thesis or the step-by-step fabrication of a thermonuclear device. Recognizing the potential for misuse as well as for informing the public, the Department of Defense charged each of its agencies with the responsibility of policing content and form of that agency's publicly accessible websites. As the United States Navy command responsible for this daunting assignment, FIWC faces a job that grows in complexity and size by the day. Taking on this problem manually would result, at best, in unitary growth of dedicated resources and a similar increase in potential for error, both of oversight and of inappropriate action. This thesis provides one approach to automating FIWC's website monitoring and enforcement activities. The approach it advocates is focused on reducing manpower and increasing accuracy. This architecture - a generic model with a GUI database frontend - is presented, not as an ultimate solution, but rather as a solid first step. Civilian, Department of Defens...|$|R
